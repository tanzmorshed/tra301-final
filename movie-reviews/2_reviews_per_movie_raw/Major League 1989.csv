"Brian-272","8","46","52","26 May 2001"," One of the best sports/comedy movies of all-time.
","Over the years many times I have watched Major League and each time I enjoy it. This film just seems better if you watch it during baseball season. The cast and plot of this movie is just great. You have a bunch of misfits and old-timers who come together and bring the Cleveland Indians out of many years of a slump, and finally contend for an American League Pennant. The movie has plenty of funny moments and mishaps that the characters do just to make you laugh while at the same moment you cheer for the team in each game of the season. Charlie Sheen is great he was perfectly cast as the pitcher. Plus the cast of Wesley Snipes, James Gammon, Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, and Tom Berenger all worked very good together even Bob Uecker is a joy as the Indians very funny play-by-play announcer. Major League is just one of those movies when you watch it each time you enjoy it and you just love to cheer for the underdog. If you are a baseball fan and love a little comedy mixed with winning then Major League is a movie to watch many times."

","I saw this movie when it was released back in 1989 and I couldn't stop laughing;  This movie was hilarious.  <br/><br/>It was very fitting, since the Cleveland Indians at the time were the laughingsock of the Major Leagues and for years, they were stuck in the realms of mediocrity or in last place year after year.<br/><br/>The cast was great; Led by Tom Berringer, and Margaret Whitton.  She played the perfect villain in this movie.  You just wanted to hate her.  Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bersen, along with 3 unknown actors at the time, Wesley Snipes, Dennis Haysbert and Rene Russo.  Snipes was hilarious as Willie ""Mays"" Hayes as well as Haysbert as Pedro Cerrano, the power hitter who practices voodoo.  The cast was well rounded off with Checie Ross as Eddie Harris, the aging religious pitcher, James Gammon, Charles Cypers and Bob Uecker as ""Harry Doyle"".<br/><br/>There were many great one liners and hilarious scenes.  The American Express commercial was classic and here's a couple of my favorite scenes:<br/><br/>-Jake Taylor, Willie ""Mays"" Hayes and Ricky Vaughn are in a bar after a game and discussing the long ball Vaughn gave up:<br/><br/>Taylor:  ""It wasn't that bad"" Vaughn: ""Oh yeah?  Name one park that ball couldn't have left"" Taylor: ""Yellowstone"" (All 3 laughing)<br/><br/>That scene was in the theater version and I've seen it in the trailers for the movie, but it was deleted in the video version.  I'd like to know why, because that was one of my favorite scenes.<br/><br/>-""Oh now you come around; But he isn't fooled""- Eddie Harris on seeing Pedro Cerrano crossing himself.<br/><br/>Here's a few bits of trivia on the movie:<br/><br/>-Funny thing was seeing Pete Vukovich as Klu Haywood, a first baseman. Mainly because he was a pitcher in the Major Leagues.<br/><br/>-Catcher Jake Taylor wore #7.  This was the uniform number of longtime Los Angeles Dodger catcher Steve Yeager, who was the technical advisor to this movie and played 3rd Base Coach, ""Duke Temple"" (Fitting that Taylor wore his number?).<br/><br/>-The movie was filmed in Milwaukee and 3 people affiliated with the Brewers were featured:  Pete Vukovich, Bob Uecker (Brewers play-by -play man) and pitcher Jerry Augustine (Duke Simms).<br/><br/>-Was it a coincedence that Miller and Lite Beer was used, since Bob Uecker at the time was spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company?<br/><br/>
This movie is one of the best sports movies around.  Getting the dvd is worth it."
"Starbuck-13","9","58","73","23 November 2000"," My first contact with Baseball...
","As you might know, Baseball is not big in Germany. Hardly anybody knows or understands the rules. People watch soccer here. Basketball gets bigger. But Baseball? No.<br/><br/>So this movie, which many of my friends watched as well, was my first contact with this interesting sport. Of course, it is a fairy tale. Of course, the underdog won't get that big that it will beat everybody and win the championship. Or will it? <br/><br/>Sports history tells us different. The story is the same in every sport. Just two years ago, a team just promoted from second division won the German soccer championship! <br/><br/>This movie depicts the glorious story of a bunch of outsiders and underachievers who finally win some games. And it is told in such a wonderful manner that you can't but root for them on their way out of the slumps. Yes! It is a simple story! But the characters are wonderful, the wisecracking Harry Doyle incredibly funny and the finals... well... no spoilers here.<br/><br/>My most favorite moment is when oldtimer pitcher Harris is replaced by Charlie Sheens character in the finals. In the first games of the season, some die-hard fans had given Sheen the nickname ""Wild thing"" and sang the famous song. Now, the whole crowd is chanting this song as Sheen steps onto the field to pitch his largest enemy. This scene always gives me goosebumps. It is splendid.<br/><br/>Many great moments, excellent humor and a fate you would wish for your favorite sports team as well - unless you are one of those boring Yankees, Bulls or Bayern Muenchen fans..."
"Kittyfolk","10","30","37","29 December 2004"," There Once Was...
","This is one of the cleverest predictable movies of all time, and for my taste the best baseball movie. A great cast, an underdog plot, and one memorable choice after another by the writers and director make this a valentine to the foot soldiers of our national pastime. (Remember, this was 15 years ago.) <br/><br/>The fabulous scoreboard, the hysterical radio play-by-play of Bob Uecker, even the motley occupants of Cleveland sports bars are irresistible hooks to reel us in, after we've been hooked by the motley team of colorful has-beens and never-were's. If this is a formula, it's the right one. I deeply love this movie, and regret not having seen it in its theatrical run. (I've seen it a dozen times since.) I'm sure the audience went wild during that climactic Yankees game! How about that Dorn making a bunch of clutch plays! Didn't you love Cerrano carrying his bat around the bases with him? Jake not dusting off, and pointing, twice...man, I wish I'd been there.<br/><br/>Then there's the little insert, early in the story, about Jake's fantasy of hitting the winning run out of the park. What happened instead when the chips were really down? <br/><br/>Okay, it isn't ""poetry"" -- it's more of a limerick, know what I mean? Just start with three words: ""There once was...."" and finish it yourself! I bet you'll finish with a big smile on your face!"
"bkoganbing","7","15","17","13 August 2009"," Miracle On The Cuyahoga
","Major League was six years too early in its prophecy for success for the Cleveland Indians. I'm old enough to remember when they had a good team back in the Fifties. When I was just a small kid, large Municipal Stadium known without affection as mistake on the lake used to have 70,000 plus crowds because the Indians had such players as Bob Feller, Lou Boudreau, Joe Gordon, and Satchel Paige. But when that team went bad, the larger the stadium and they had the largest in baseball looked all the more empty.<br/><br/>Terry Pluto wrote a book on the history of the Indians failure called The Curse Of Colavito. In 1959 the Indians finished a respectable second to the White Sox in the pennant race that year with Casey Stengel's Yankees having an inexplicable bad season and a distant third. Rocky Colavito led the American League in home runs and he was the most popular fellow in Cleveland. He became one of a select group of Major Leaguers that year to hit four home-runs in one game. And he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for the batting champion, Harvey Kuenn. It was never the same for Cleveland. <br/><br/>Which takes us to the futile Indians of 1989 as futile in real life as they start on screen. The team comes into the possession of a new owner former showgirl Margaret Whitton. Her contract with the city specifies that if the team attendance dips below 700,000 for the season, she can move the team and she wants the warm sun of Miami instead of winters on the Cuyahoga River.<br/><br/>Building a winning team in baseball is a lot harder than what you see in Major League. But this collection of goofballs, misfits, and has beens actually get mad enough and start winning.<br/><br/>Major League has a nice collection of players playing ballplayers like veteran catcher Tom Berenger, narcissistic third baseman Corbin Bernsen, juvenile delinquent rookie pitcher Charlie Sheen known as Wild Thing for his lack of control, Wesley Snipes as center-fielder Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a Santeria observing power hitter. It is the American League so Haysbert probably is the designated hitter. My favorite in the film is veteran manager James Gammon who pulls this collection together for a winning team.<br/><br/>Major League is a film for baseball and film fans it so nicely blends the interests. As for the Cleveland Indians when Municipal Stadium closed down and they got a new ballpark in Jacobs Field, they actually won a couple of pennants in 1995 and 1997. Of course the process to build the Indians wasn't half as entertaining as Major League is."
"natefrog2","10","29","38","7 November 2003"," Classic Movie!
","This is easily my favorite movie of all-time.  Being a sports fan who loves comedies, you can't beat this flick.  This is one movie that I can watch over and over without getting sick of it.  Definitely hilarious, the one-liners are great.  The cast is solid as well.  Wesley Snipes, Tom Berenger, Dennis Haysbert, Corbin Bernsen, Charlie Sheen and Bob Uecker are excellent in their roles.  I love how the film holds nothing back as well, unlike the sequel where the language and what not was toned down.<br/><br/>Is Major League predictable? I guess...but it is still a great movie. Its a ***** movie in my opinion, plus it was filmed at the late MCS (Milwaukee County Stadium) so that makes it even better!"
"SuperBaes","9","19","24","20 July 2001"," Can baseball be any funnier?
","There have been some excellent baseball movies made from Field of Dreams to The Pride of the Yankees, but no movie based on the national pastime can ever claim to be as hysterically funny as Major League.  Granted, the value of the original was hurt by the second and third attempts at re-creating the atmosphere.  Those two films were an embarrassment to all involved.<br/><br/>Major League, however, personified the attitude of ""Nothing to lose"".  Aside from the easily identified woes of the Cleveland franchise of the late-eighties, there were several actors in this film that had yet to hit big or had started to fall from grace.  The incredibly strong language of the movie only made it seem that much more realistic."

","I grew up in Strongsville Ohio and suffered through many bad Indians teams in the 70's and 80's.  At the beginning of the movie it was great seeing the pan view of downtown Cleveland.  Oh yes, the movie.......THE INDIANS WIN IT! sums it up perfectly.  A million thanks to Tom Berenger, Wesley Snipes, Charlie Sheen and the rest of a great cast for making such a funny and heart-warming movie.  Thanks to you too, Euk, for giving that line its heart!  Give Cleveland a decent sports franchise and they will come for miles to support them.  Sold a few home games out at the Jake as you will recall..........a few tough times have hit the Tribe lately but they're coming back....With Mike Hargrove back that's a step in the right direction. Definitely watch this movie if you want to relax in the comfort and safety of a hilarious and nostalgic movie.   GO TRIBE!!!!"
"Maniac-9","10","11","15","3 February 2012"," Best baseball movie
","I don't care what anyone says this is by far the best baseball movie ever made. Bull Durham was a bit too much of a chick flick to be a real baseball fans movie of choice.<br/><br/>Major League isn't a movie that's going to solve world peace or anything but if you want a light hearted, entertaining film that is hysterically funny then you need to see this.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen being a former high school pitcher who was able to get 85 mph on his fastball, which isn't as fast as characters 100 mph. But close enough to with the way they film it to make it look believable as being a real flame thrower. If they had someone who didn't have a background in baseball they would've probably had to use a stunt double for his pitching scenes, which would've sucked."
"generationofswine","10","4","5","11 July 2019"," An Honest Review
","It came out when I was 9 and, honestly, all 9 year old boys love baseball movies. It's a law that transcends race, religion, and country of origin. Even in backwards countries like France, when they value soccer as a national popular sport, the 9 year old boys still love baseball movies. Even if they don't play it.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was a love story to the Cleveland Indians. It stinks of it. You know, you just know that someone wrote the movie, directed it, whatever, just so that they could sit back and watch the Indians win.<br/><br/>It's like baseball fan fiction, only unlike normal fan fiction, it's a pleasure to watch because baseball fan fiction is about the team winning and not about a Mary Sue taking all the glory.<br/><br/>And then, to cover up the fact that it's baseball fan fiction, they made it into a comedy as if to tell the audience not to worry, they aren't going to take it seriously anyway.<br/><br/>And I get where they are coming from, I had the exact same fantasies about the Cubs, most of my life, at least until I went to Europe and saw a soccer riot and got worried about what would happen if they did actually win... but it went off without a hitch didn't it? And now, honestly, it doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>A part of me, the masochist in me, would almost rather have a movie like this made about my team, instead of seeing the real thing.<br/><br/>Anyways, what it is, is baseball fan fiction, and base ball fan fiction is a lot better than most other things. Baseball period is a lot better than most other things.<br/><br/>Its almost like a romantic comedy in a very weird way. So sit back, grab a beer, and enjoy. It's like watching a funny version of the real thing."

","Let me preface this by saying I can't stand baseball; I find it to be one of the most boring sports out there.  With that said, I love this film. It has a great ""underdog"" story, some genuine comedy, great characters, and heart. It's a minor film, but it's thoroughly entertaining.  If more films could just be entertaining, I might go to the theater more often.<br/><br/>The heart of this film is the characters.  We have the broken down veterans, the rookies, the love interest, the wise old coach, and the villain.   These are rather cliched characters, but they are written and performed so well, you don't notice.  Much of the humor arises out of character moments, which keeps it from becoming tired or dated.<br/><br/>Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen were hot, coming off of the success of Platoon.  Corbin Bernsen was enjoying fame on LA Law.  Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes were relative unknowns who got a chance to shine.  And then there's Bob Uecker!  Uecker is the glue that brings everything together and he gets the best lines in the movie.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with a film like this.  Everything works well and a good time is had by all. Too bad the sequels forgot what made this a success."

"El Guapo-2","Null","10","24","16 September 2003"," Baseball comedy classic
","""Major League"" is nothing original... it borrows heavily from the ""Bad News Bears"" school of screen writing. What holds the movie together is the easy charm and camaraderie of the cast, which features some tried and true character actors: Bob Uecker, basically playing himself; Margaret Whitfield, playing her patented ""bitch"" role, and James Gammon, playing the wise old coot who has seen it all. Rounding out the cast are Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen and Rene Russo, who at the time was new to features. The plot is as follows: The owner of the Cleveland Indians marries a Vegas showgirl and dies on his honeymoon, leaving her the team. Cleveland (which the song being played over the main titles laughingly refers to as ""city of light, city of magic""- perhaps they are referring to when the Cuyahuga River caught on fire?) doesn't agree with her, so she wants to exploit a loophole in her contract with the city which stipulates if attendance falls below a certain level, she can take the franchise out of Cleveland. So she goes out and gets herself the sorriest looking group of ballplayers you've ever seen... A Cuban defector (because his religion is voodoo) who can only hit fastballs (Dennis Haysbert), the worlds laziest third baseman (Think Bernsen as a clean shaven Wade Boggs), a catcher with shot-out knees (Berenger channeling Johnny Bench or Cartlton Fisk), a near-sighted pitcher who throws 100 MPH at everything but the plate (Sheen), and the lead-off hitter who thinks he is Rickey Henderson (Wesley Snipes). The movie has a lot of laughs and it's a fun way to waste 90 minutes. Directed by David S. Ward of ""The Sting"" fame. Interestingly enough, this movie did give the nickname ""Wild Thing"" to one-time Philadelphia pitcher Mitch whatshisname who threw a bad pitch to Joe Carter in the 9th inning to lose the '93 World Series to Toronto."
"Quinoa1984","7","4","8","5 August 2000"," Yes Yes Yes
","This is one of the best baseball sports films ever made.  Notg because it exactly depicts the tradition of baseball.  Mainly because of a pitcher who can throw a ball at 96 mph at a guys head, a vodoo guy who doubts Jesus Christ's curve ball skills, and a guy named Willy Mayes Hayes who can run like haze but hit like s***.  These are the original comedy things added to this great baseball film about the new owner of the Cleavland Indians who wants the team to finish dead last so she can sell the team.  That is until the team (which includes Tom Berenger, Cornin Bernson, Charles Cyphers, Wesley Snipes and Charlie Sheen) changes all that.  Incredibly funny, and it gets better with each viewing.  My favorite moment, when Hays (played by a good newcomer named Wesley Snipes) finds out he made the Indians and just runs outside and goes (Owwwww, yes yes yes).  A+"

Major League has a cast of characters and is the Cleveland Indians are on a loosing streak and our unlikely heroes and underdogs set to turn their misfortunes around. Charlie Sheen was a good baseball player and gave his all for the role. He even juices up to get more in the shape and character of an actual professional baseball player.

By fielding the worst team possible she expects that no one will show up to the games and she'll get her wish. Spoiler alert: the team doesn't move. Not to worry, Miami got a team anyway in the Florida Marlins who have won two World Series and the Indians are still waiting.<br/><br/>""Major League"" is a worst to first movie. It's a ""Bad News Bears"" MLB style. It's a cool movie although the love triangle with Rene Russo was lame. I don't know why Hollywood does that. Her character had moved on from ex-husband, Jake Taylor (Tom Beringer), because of his philandering ways, yet he was able to charm his way back into her pants... I mean life... even though she was engaged to be married. It was some lame romance for the female viewer which seems really insulting to me.<br/><br/>Putting the romance aside, the baseball was fun.

"renegadeviking-271-528568","7","0","0","13 January 2020"," It's funny, energetic and earnest in an honest fashion.
","There are lots of glaring flaws in Major League. The main characters are barely developed. The humor is really, really crass. The film moves far too slowly through moments that don't matter, and speeds through the moments that do matter. They have a catcher with bad knees who can barely run hitting in the two hole and have a pitcher who starts, relieves, and does everything in between whenever the script feels he's needed. All of these are problems that should plague the film and make for a pretty bad experience in every regard.<br/><br/>That's not the case with Major League, it overcomes its flaws and then some. The reason for this is simple, it's honest in its intentions. It doesn't hide that it's predictable, that it's not logically placing its characters in situations, it embraces its crassness, and it takes into account how shallow its characters are. Major League takes all of its flaws and turns them into strengths. That's why this film has always been, and remains, a favorite of mine. I grew up watching Major League, and I was very scared that revisiting it all these years later would reveal a memory fueled only by nostalgia.<br/><br/>The end sequence of Major League is a great discussion point for how the film overcomes its flaws. When Willie Mays Hayes gets on base the film focuses on his attempt to steal a base. There's no real reason why we should care about his attempt to steal a base. We know it will help the team and that it's clearly an important moment in the film as far as the ultimate intentions of the film are concerned. But, the character of Willie hasn't been developed in any way. He's a guy who runs fast, that's all that we know about him. Yet, in that moment that is all that matters and that's why the film moves past Willie's flawed character development. There nothing but Willie stealing the base and what that means for the team we are watching.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum is Jake Taylor, who we have spent some time with. We know that he's near the end of his last hurrah in baseball. He's a has been, and a never will be again. This is his shining moment, when he can be the hero. But, he doesn't do the heroic thing to be a hero, he does the everyman thing. His actions represent his end, his final sacrifice for his team. It's through his action in the final sequence that we learn everything we need to about the character of Jake Taylor. Tom Berenger's character may have started off shallow, but in the final sequence Jake was given meaning and heft that cements his status in the film that came before.<br/><br/>There's something else going for Major League, it's a comedy that is very funny. The jokes and bits are all easy, but they are pulled off so as to create a hilarious picture. If I wasn't laughing out loud I was chuckling, and for my money that's the sign of a great comedy. This is, again, an indicator of how the film overcomes its weaknesses. Major League should not be so funny, it is far too crass and easy to be as funny as it is. Because of its honest intentions, its desire to be funny, the film ends up being funny. Honesty in intention can go a long way when it comes to delivering a quality product.<br/><br/>My memories were not ruined, and I can gladly still proclaim Major League to be a great film. It's funny, energetic and earnest in an honest fashion. My wife didn't enjoy Major League anywhere near as much as I did, so maybe nostalgia did play a role in my outlook on the film. As much as nostalgic remembrance is a possibility, I don't think it holds true when it comes to Major League. The film has many, many issues, but it consistently overcomes those issues with a belief in its story that is one of the signs of a well made film. Of course, the subject of the film really should have been my Chicago Cubs, but that's yet another flaw that I can easily overlook when it comes to Major League."

","This was a rather fun film featuring the old worst to first team. The catch here is that the owner of the team wants to relocate the Cleveland Indians to Florida or somewhere like that. To accomplish this she proceeds to put together a team that she hopes will be beyond bad. Enter a crew of misfits that feature aging players like Eddie the pitcher, an aging catcher whose knees are not what they used to be Jake Taylor, and Roger Dorn who cares more about life after baseball than playing the game with any passion in the present. Also present are some young guys like Pedro Cerrano who can hit a fastball a mile (a curve not so much), a speedy guy named Willie Mayes Hayes who invites himself to camp and Ricky Vaughn a hard throwing pitcher with no control. Well this team is not as terrible as expected and it is brought to the manager's attention and his plan is to win not only a few games here and there, but the entire division. The movie is funny and has a bit more bite to it than the sequel which is basically this movie again without much Reno Russo as Jake's girl and no Wesley Snipes at all as he is recast. For a baseball film featuring the whole underdogs trying to win it all it does fairly well. I enjoyed Charlie Sheen as the pitcher with a wild fastball that gets good by getting glasses. I also enjoyed Snipes and I was saddened when he was not in the sequel. Basically a good cast and a good funny baseball film."

It was nice to see the poor Cleveland Indians wind up winners, too.<br/><br/>But, in addition to being a fan of the game, I am a Christian, too, and the bias against my faith in this movie was disgusting. Had they done this to any other group, I suspect you would have heard an uproar over it.....but Christians are fair game in the film world. Here, the dumbest and most annoying player on the team, of course, is the ""religious"" guy, ""Eddie Harris,"" played cartoon-ishly by Chelcie Ross. He is pictured as a ""nutcase"" and a guy nobody likes. On the other hand we have the very likable voodoo-believing Latin American player.

","I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989.  As a not-so-strapping boy of 15, I wasn't particularly familiar with baseball, and didn't have any particular interest in it.  But hey, it was a movie, and I got to see it for free.  And it was funny. (I think that this movie was made for 15-year-old boys!)<br/><br/>But I also couldn't believe for a moment that the Indians were a real baseball team.  I mean, what baseball team would allow themselves to be made fun of this way?<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise the next morning when I discovered that the Indians were, in fact, a real ball club, and they really were as bad as they were portrayed as being in the film!  I immediately bought a Chief Wahoo hat and declared myself an Indians fan.<br/><br/>Watching this film today is like a nostalgia session.  Cleveland's Municipal Stadium (the ""mistake by the lake"", built as part of Cleveland's bid for the Olympic games) has long since been torn down, as was the Brewers' stadium in Milwaukee used for the scenes ""inside"" the ballpark.  The Indians, though faltering in the 2002 season, are still a far better team than they were in 1989.  (An odd side note - the San Francisco Giants' last trip to the World Series was in 1954 - when they played the Indians!  That was the last time the Tribe won the AL pennant until 1997, when they lost the World Series to the Marlins.) Cleveland has actually been cleaned up pretty substantially since the film was released, and a few buildings have been added to the skyline.  The Browns even have their own stadium nowadays!<br/><br/>There are certainly movies that have better baseball (""Bull Durham"" comes to mind), but not many that have as much fun with the sport."

There are no 3-dimensional characters here. But as time goes on, and despite their problems, this Cleveland team begins to come together and play well, you start to like them and hope they will do better, perhaps because we're raised to like the underdog.<br/><br/>Some of the success of this movie must go to the director, who knows how to pace things so that we get involved in them, even though most of the characters aren't particularly likable.<br/><br/>So, in the end, you could do worse, and you won't be bored."

The story is nothing special. They put together a team of losers who of course manage to win the entire thing. And of course there is a bad guy in these types of movies.

","I recently fired up ""Major League"" for the first time in a decade, and am pleased to report it still sits on its throne at the midpoint between all-time comedies and baseball films. This is a prototype 1980's comedy -- hilarious and ludicrous -- and one which adapts a fantastic absurdity from predecessors like ""<a href=""/title/tt0080339/"">Airplane!

Not the case with ""Major League.""

"hall895","6","1","2","10 May 2012"," Doesn't quite make my heart sing
","Having first seen it many years ago when I recently watched Major League again I found that it did not live up to my memories. Nor did it live up to its reputation. It's not nearly as funny as I seemed to remember it being. And while it it has acquired a reputation for being truly outrageous that's not really an accurate assessment either. Honestly, the movie's kind of tame, it doesn't push the envelope nearly as much as you would think. Now all of this doesn't mean it's a bad movie. And any movie with Charlie Sheen playing a character nicknamed Wild Thing will have an outlandish moment or two. It's just that there aren't enough of those great moments to allow the movie to really be that brilliant, outrageous baseball comedy so many people remember it as being.<br/><br/>The story is your typical sports underdog tale. A bunch of losers band together and prove that maybe they're not really losers after all. There's the requisite villain, in this case the team's evil female owner, who is trying to hold the team down. Obstacles are constantly thrown in the way of our plucky underdogs but they forge on towards the big game at the end which ends all movies of this sort. Along the way there are some laughs and hijinks. Not all the jokes and gags hit their mark but enough do to keep you entertained. There's an unfortunate romantic subplot which is a total dud. All the time spent exploring this relationship between the veteran catcher, played by Tom Berenger, and his old flame, played by Rene Russo, is really time wasted for the movie. We never really get to know Russo's character at all and Berenger's crusty old catcher is much more in his element around his teammates. You know the movie's going to try to pay this storyline off in the end but really who cares? This movie is about the Indians. And there were more than enough personalities in that group of misfits to carry the movie. Sheen, Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Wesley Snipes, Chelcie Ross and, as the voodoo-loving Pedro Cerrano, Dennis Haysbert. Each of the characters has their moments. Perhaps the best performance of all though comes from James Gammon as the manager, Lou Brown. He gets many of the best lines and the way he delivers them is just perfect. And of course there's also Bob Uecker providing laughs every time he opens his mouth in playing the team's radio announcer. There are a lot of fine performers here and the movie has a lot of good pieces. But there's the sense it doesn't quite all add up. It's not as consistently funny as you'd hope. The whole thing is very predictable which wouldn't be so bad if the movie at least kept you laughing all the way to the ending you know is coming. But the laughs come and go, and when they do come they're generally not as explosive as you'd hope. And there's that romantic storyline which is a complete waste of time and which rears its ugly head again in the end at a time when all the focus clearly should be on the team. Major League is not a bad movie. But is has enough flaws to hold it back from true greatness."

","You have to love films about baseball, especially when they are extremely well written. This is one of those films. Ward has a handle on baseball players and baseball fans that cuts straight to the heart and draws you in. Instead of focusing on a single player, he makes baseball what it ought to be...a team effort. His team is Tom Berenger, who plays the past his prime catcher ready to have one more decent season. Renee Russo is his ex-fiancé who has moved on with her life, but is still in love with Jake. Charlie Sheen and Wesley Snipes become the ""hotshots"" of the rookies, Sheen as the pitcher with the blazing fast ball and a lack of control, nicknamed the Wild Thing, Snipes as Willie Mays Hays, the runner out to score 100 stolen bases in the season. Dennis Haysbert gives an excellent performance as Pedro Cerrano, the Cuban who defected from his native land to practice his religion...voodoo. Harsh language and a couple of scenes of brief nudity drew an R rating from the MPAA, but the teens ought to love it, especially the ones who have played baseball in school. Definitely a collectible."
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","16 March 2011"," Doesn't strike out...yet
","Major League is not only a comedy film with numerous laughs, it proves itself to be one of the grand-daddies of baseball comedies. A League of Their Own and Bull Durham are also among the list although those are more towards the drama genre. I attend various minor league baseball games a year. Approximately twelve. I love them. Being a Chicagoan, I think I'd rather watch minor league teams than major league teams.<br/><br/>Some may call that strange, but I love the entertainment and the ""close to home"" feel provided by a minor league game. There are tons of events on the field to keep me interested, and I know pretty much every cop and concession stand employee there thanks to my father. It's an enjoyable time. I walk around most of the game, chat with various officers, it's a damn good time.<br/><br/>On with the film. I can discuss Minors vs. Majors in a separate blog. After the Cleveland Indians' owner dies, her husband Rachel (Whitton) inherits the team. She plans to make the team as poor as possible so they can move the team to Miami. To put it simply, she sabotages the team, the stadium, and everything else in various ways to assure a poor season.<br/><br/>The team is mainly made up of rookies like Willie ""Mays"" Hayes (Snipes), Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn (Sheen), and Jake Taylor (Berenger). They're acceptable players, but no where near as good as they should be.<br/><br/>One thing I really enjoyed and found worthwhile about Major League is the fact that we get closer into Jake Taylor's relationship life. It's good that all the fun doesn't take place on the field, and we get a wider variety and an in-depth look on one player's life. I would've liked to hear more about Lou Brown's (Gammon) career and more about some other players. But at least it's not all about on the field interactions.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen, James Gammon, and Wesley Snipes were all great in the film. It's a little sad that Gammon died this past July, and news about it really didn't surface too much. Not looking at Gammon's filmography, I assume his career wasn't made up of too many more famous roles like his portrayal of Lou Brown.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen was extremely hilarious in this film, but watching it only makes me more sad about he just continues to make an ass of himself to the media. His career is going straight into the ground as of now. In this film he was extremely handsome, but now his image makes him look older than he is, and his reputation is plummeting into the ground. Oh well, his role as Wild Thing was, say, WINNING.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is fantastic in this as well playing Willy ""Mays"" Hayes. He is absolutely funny, and a great addition to the cast. Too bad for him as well because since Snipes refuses to pay his taxes, he is in prison until 2013. I really enjoyed him in movies like Blade and Passenger 57.<br/><br/>What truly scares me is that this film has spawned two sequels. This kind of film can only be done well once, passably a second time, and pretty much end horrifically with a third film. Back to the Minors could easily make or break the franchise. Why make a sequel when Berenger and Sheen don't even return? It's all about the benjamins.<br/><br/>Major League can be summed up with a few statements. An enjoyable baseball comedy, a cast of greats, but a cast of people whose lives either ended tragically or just were forgotten.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo, James Gammon, Margaret Whitton, and Wesley Snipes. Diretded by: David S. Ward."

","It's amazing to see how this movie also serves as a time tunnel to how baseball was, twenty years ago, before there was major league baseball in Florida. It's nostalgic to see the old White Sox and MAriners uniforms.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is centered around a stripper who marries a billionaire baseball team owner. The owner dies, and the stripper inherits the team.<br/><br/>But she doesn't care much for the city of Cleveland. She wants to move the team to Miami. She, she promotes manager Charlie Donovan to GM, and names Lou Brown, played to great effect by James Gammon, to manage the team. Problem is, Brown has never managed in the big leagues.<br/><br/>So she signs several players, none of whom she hopes to be of major league quality. Jake Taylor, a catcher with fading skills. Ricky Vaughn, a pitcher who's better at stealing cars then striking out batters. Pedro Cerrano, a power hitter who can't hit a fast ball. And by the way, Cerrano has an unusual religious affiliation.<br/><br/>Add Willie Mays Hayes, a hopeful who crashes the gates to order to make the team, Roger Dorn, who's more interested in his post baseball career then anything else, and Eddie Harris, an aging pitcher, and you have the perfect ingredients for a 100 loss team.<br/><br/>Instead, the team bonds together, in spite of their owner's plans for the team. The team comes out of nowhere to race for the AL pennant. All that stands in their way is a powerful New York Yankees team. A team that has gotten the best of Vaughn all season.<br/><br/>What happens in the most used formula films actually becomes a funny one because of the development of the characters involved. The film is witty, comical, and with the awesome performance by Bob Ueker, this has to be one of the best baseball comedies of all time. His performance as Harry Doyle has to be one of the best in film history. I really loved the following line ""One hit, that's all we got one goddamn hit!"" Former Dodgers catcher Steve Yeager and Brewers Pitcher Pete Vukovich each make small appearances in the movie, and this was one of the first major films for Rene Russo.<br/><br/>This is a really great movie, and it's more then a guilty pleasure. It's actually a good movie. Too bad the sequels tried to be a little too slapstick. But the first, remains the best! A must have for any film collection!"

The only thing a little out there is the premise of the team owner wanting it to lose. But for the rest, despite being very genuine and down to earth, it doesn't fail to convey strong and precise artistic goals. It works perfectly. All its parts are arranged in right amounts.<br/><br/>Wild Thing's entrance in the final game is just one of the best moments in movie history, in my view. It's constructed perfectly throughout the movie, it comes at the perfect moment and it releases tons of excitement.<br/><br/>The love story between Jake and Lynn is no solemn thing, but still works perfectly.<br/><br/>And I think one thing that makes it so perfect is that it's surprisingly well acted. In order to do that, it must be well written in the first place. But surely none of these actors fails in any of their scenes. They are all remarkable, especially Sheen, Berenger and Gammon.<br/><br/>The locker-room feeling and the talk between the players is very real. The baseball talk by the speaker during the matches is also right on the line. The overall baseball world and the insight on what the life of a player would be come through neatly.<br/><br/>This way of making movies should be the rule."
"zkonedog","6","1","3","11 March 2017"," Tries To Be A Bit Too Much, But Still A Solid Effort
","As a passionate fan of the game of baseball and thus, by extension, films about the national pastime, I have come to the conclusion that there really are just two camps that baseball movies fall into:<br/><br/>First, there is the Kevin Costner style of doing baseball (Field of Dreams, For The Love Of The Game, etc.) that romanticize (almost to a religious level) the game and relate it to real life on a very personal level.<br/><br/>Then, there are films like Little Big League, which don't take themselves seriously at all, yet that is the whole point...as neither do many big league ballplayers! These types of films, while short on plot and substance, are incredibly funny and speak to the type of humor that is needed to emotionally survive such a long ""work week"" (162-game season).<br/><br/>The film ""Major League"" is obviously a comedy, as its cast of characters is as goofy as goofy can get. There's the crazy psychopath (played by Charlie Sheen), the high-ego strutter (Wesley Snipes), the crazy voodoo guy (Dennis Haysbert), the serious, play-to-win guy (Tom Berenger), and even the gruff manager who's seen it all and his face never cracks (James Gammon). Plus, even the eccentric announcer (""Juuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside""-Bob Uecker) is thrown into the mix. When that nutty lot is thrown together on the field because the owner of the Cleveland Indians wants attendance to drop so bad that she can move the team out of town, hilarity ensues!<br/><br/>Yet, I actually think that what held this movie back a bit (dropping it from a four to three star rating) was the fact that, at times, it tried to take itself a bit too seriously. This is best personified in the film's focus on Tom Berenger's character, who is the only character that really has any kind of backstory whatsoever. True, his inspiration is needed to rally the troops towards the end of the season, but all the scenes involving his personal life/romance really just make you wish you could get back to the baseball diamond.<br/><br/>Thus, although Major League is considered to be one of the classic baseball films of all-time (and I will admit it has its share of iconic moments and characters), it suffers a bit from wandering too far from the formula that made it that way...comedy. If you don't mind a little clichéd sappiness with your humor, though, you won't have a problem. I recommend watching this film just for the sheer experience of it, but don't be expecting the come away with it ranking in your Top Ten."

","Major League holds up today not only as the rare sports-themed comedy to balance goofiness and dynamic game atmospherics seamlessly, but also as a fleeting reminder of baseball's last remnants of participatory charm and gee-whiz curveball worship.<br/><br/>In the History of sports there's always been at least two baseball films that has stood out above all the rest. For me it's Major League and The Sandlot. Major League is truly a sports comedy classic. What makes Major League such a winner is the many memorable scenes in the film and characters. Charlie Sheen as ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn, I mean you gotta love his bad boy character.<br/><br/>As funny as this movie is, it's the vulnerability of the three main stars is really what makes the movie work."

The cast is filled with Eighties TV icons like Corbin Bernsen and future stars, like a young Wesley Snipes. It is a blast to see Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, who were at each others' throats in Platoon, as teammates and friends.

You'd never see this movie made today, firstly I'm amazed that the overly PC major sports in the US allowed this one to happen in the first place. Baseball players are seen to be selfish, cocky, brash, prima-donnas who will think nothing of cheating or putting down others to better their own position.<br/><br/>All true to from what I've seen in 20 something years of following sport.<br/><br/>The strange thing is that in making a movie that seeks to send up the sport and the athletes the filmmakers showed exactly why sport is so awesome in the first place. The comraderie, the trash-talk and petty infighting, the pranks, the constant losing and then the exhilaration as the team actually starts winning.<br/><br/>The team is made up of no-hopers and past their primes: The no-hopers: Charlie Sheen as an out of control pitcher named Ricky Vaughn, a cocky Willie Mays Hays who showed up with being asked to try out for the team, (Wesley Snipes in a very early role), a voodoo follower who can't hit a curveball and others The past their primes: Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor, a catcher who is wracked with injury, Corbin Bernsen as Roger Dorn, a pretty boy more concerned with his future endorsements than winning games, and Chelcie Ross as Ed Harris, a crafty veteran who now relies more on cheating than brute strength and skill.<br/><br/>The team manager is the gruff, blunt and hilarious Lou Brown, elevated unexpectedly from his previous role selling tyres to the big league. Lou takes no sh*t, cares not for ceremony and tells it like it is, and his responses to some of the queries made by prima donnas are classic.<br/><br/>As the team builds momentum the owner, aware that success means fans, which means no moving to a better city, removes the player perks including.<br/><br/>The final game to decide the fate of the season, versus of course the team's nemesis is brilliant, you know you are being manipulated but still can't help but feel pulled into the contest. I still get pins and needles even though I've seen this soooo many times, and Bob Eucker as Harry Doyle is simply the best commentator for the game.<br/><br/>The game lasts almost 20 minutes of screen time, and not a minute is wasted, even though there is hardly a joke or laugh to be had in the whole scene. By this stage if you are still on board this far into the movie you are likely less of a film watcher than a sport's fan, this last segment is so well made that it is almost as rewarding as rewatching some of the greatest games that actually occurred in sport's history.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9 / 10.

My cousin and I spent countless hours of our life watching this movie.<br/><br/> The movie takes a look at the laughing stock of baseball, at the time, the Cleveland Indians. With the hilarious ex show girl wife of the now dead owner taking over the team and wanting to re-locate them to sunny Florida (this is prior to the Marlins being introduced in 94). So she wants to put together the worst team possible as she has found a loup hole in the contract if their attendance falls below a certain number for the year then they can move, with no protest from the city. The attendance number that it has to fall below is some ridiculously low number but she thinks they can do it. There are many great scenes prior to any baseball being played at all, including one of the best lines in the movie when they are looking over the people they want to invite to camp.""This guy here is dead!"" ""Cross him off then"". If you love this movie like I do your laughing right now. I know I need to shorten up the end of this review for word sake so i'll go quickly through the rest. So they assemble this team of a few has beens and a couple of never will be's.First there is one of the best guys in the movie Harry Doyle(Bob Uecker)as the announcer who's quick wit really carry a lot of the moive(not really part of the team but deserved to be mentioned). Lou-The minor league manager who works at Tire World and doesn't seem to be too excited about managing the Indians as he puts the GM on hold because he has someone on the other line asking about some whitewalls. Jake-The aging catcher w/bad knees. Dorn-The over confident 3rd baseman who can't field a ground ball. Hays-Who can run circles around anyone but likes to pop the ball up. Harris-The aging pitcher who throws nothing but spit balls. Cerano-The voodoo man who can't hit a curve ball. Then there is Vaughn, the pitcher who can throw the ball as hard as anyone but just can't control it. Playing the enemies in the movie, it's baseball so it still stands today and would have to be, are the Yankees. The Indians go thru the season struggling of course until the GM tells the manager that the owner has hired all of them just to loose. So this, like in most 80's movies, is the what I like to call ""we're gonna do it!"" factor of the movie. Where they Indians need to win something like 32 out of 40 games to get into and final day tie with the Yankees. This makes it so that there is a one game playoff between the two. This by far is the best part of the movie, this whole game. If you haven't seen this movie I won't give it all away, but i'm sure you know the end because it's an 80's movie. Still to this day whenever I see this movie I still get chills with the Harry Doyle call at the end. As I said before one of my favortie movies from my childhood.<br/><br/>3 1/2 out of 4 stars."

There are several good actors in this movie - James Gammon and Margaret Whitton among them - which adds to some mediocre acting by Bernsen and Berenger.

","After her rich husband dies and leaves her as the owner of the Cleveland Indians, ""Rachel Phelps"" (Margaret Whitton) devises a scheme to relocate the team to Miami. However, in order to do that legally she needs to ensure that attendance at home games falls below 800,000. To that end, she recruits the worst players she can possibly find and anxiously awaits the team's inevitable demise. What she doesn't count on, however, is the player's reaction when they learn of her plan and her total disregard for them as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a delightful baseball comedy which had featured good performances by a number of actors. Most notable in that regard was Charlie Sheen (as ""Ricky 'Wild Thing' Vaughn""), Tom Berenger (""Jake Taylor""), Corbin Bernsen (""Roger Dorn"") and Wesley Snipes (""Willie Mays Hayes""). Likewise, I also enjoyed the performance by Margaret Whitton who played the part in an expert manner. In short, I found this to be an entertaining comedy and I have rated it accordingly.

","If there's any sport that makes for a great movie it's baseball. Perhaps I'm a little bias because I play the sport, but there's something about America's pastime that really hits home in the movies.<br/><br/>Major League tells the made-up (but totally based on the real-life struggles of the Cleveland Indians) story of a group of misfits hired by a new owner to lose as many games as possible, to ensure her plan of moving the team down to Miami. On the outskirts, it seems like a ridiculous premise that would be something out of a spoof movie. But in reality, there's actually a good deal of dramatic heft to the story as well. Luckily, the comedy and drama both balance each other out quite well.<br/><br/>With a memorable cast of misfits, including Charlie Sheen as the fireball pitcher Ricky Vaughn, Tom Berenger as the old but still effective Jake Taylor, Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes, Dennis Haysbert as the religious Pedro Cerrano, and of course the colorful Bob Uecker as the Indians play by play announcer. With all movies, but specifically with sports movies, you need a group of actors that have chemistry and feel like a team when they're together. Albeit extremely unconventional, the players that make up this Indians team are something else. And even though it seems like the characters are built around stereotypes, the way the actors portray them makes it never feel like stereotypical characters at all. Instead, they make for some of the most quotable lines in the history of sports films.<br/><br/>With that said, the film definitely delves into some paint by numbers plot points for sports films. You have your ups, downs, and montages, just like all of the other great sports pictures. I also find it sometimes difficult to watch a sports film, baseball in particular, because the movies have a hard time capturing how a game flows and looks. There are moments that feel completely acted out and unnatural, and while I can give it a pass in some areas, others I can't. However, overall Major League is a fun and re-watchable sports film that gives us plenty of comedy and a surprising amount of dramatic payoff as well. <br/><br/>P.S.

She wants to move the team to Miami for the warmer climate and a new stadium. To justify the move, the team has to lose, and lose badly. So she assembles the worst possible team she can. Among these are a past-his-prime catcher with bad knees, a shrewd but past-his-prime pitcher, a young tearaway pitcher (and felon) with a 100 mph fastball but absolutely no control, a third baseman who is too wealthy and precious to dive, a voodoo-loving slugger who can't hit a curveball and an energetic-but-naive lead off hitter and base- stealer who can't keep the ball on the ground. Against the odds, and after the inevitable initial failures, they iron out some of their faults and start to win, much to Ms Phelps' consternation. <br/><br/>Great baseball movie.

Throw the great sport of baseball into the mix and it is a win/win for those who love the game and those who just want to have a good laugh. Major League is impressive on three levels. First, the actors are brilliant (even those relegated to smaller roles). Second, the plot is mainly baseball action, baseball action and more baseball action. Third, it's hilarious and makes you feel good. I watch it almost every summer, and for a comedy to lend itself to repeated viewings is a rare thing indeed. On another note, the screen presence of every actor and actress in this movie is phenomenal. Sheen, Beringer, Corbin, Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes all in the same movie acting at the top of their game. Even those minor characters like Cerrano, Bob Ucker and the old veteran pitcher are acting their hearts out here. It's literally an All-Star team of great actors! I felt this was a beautiful film.

","This is one of the funniest, but vulgar, adult sports films ever made. And, it's strictly adult, so parents will want to be wary and read the parents guide. But for many adults it's very funny throughout. From several of the reviews I've read, I'm surprised that none of them recognized this as a clever satire as well. It spoofs – mostly in a friendly but brash way – many aspects of professional baseball, from greedy management (not most, thank goodness) to prima donna players. It really has fun with baseball signals, and even the fans. <br/><br/>""Major League"" is a funny sports movie, but I can't agree with some who think it ranks among the best of the baseball films. To be in that category, it would have to be watchable by a larger, diverse audience. When it comes to the game, I think the more serious films tell a better story about America's favorite pastime. One of the best is ""Pride of the Yankees,"" the 1942 biopic with Gary Cooper playing Lou Gehrig. Another is the story of Monty Stratton in the 1949 movie, ""The Stratton Story,"" that stars James Stewart. Dan Dailey stars as Dizzy Dean in the 1952 biopic, ""The Pride of St. Louis."" A recent move, ""42"" in 2013 tells the story of Jackie Robinson, another great ball player and the first black player to break the color barrier in professional baseball. Other top baseball films include, ""The Winning Team"" of 1952, ""Fear Strikes Out"" of 1957, ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" of 1973, ""The Natural"" of 1984, ""Eight Men Out"" of 1988, and ""A League of Their Own"" of 1992.<br/><br/>These and many other films give a good picture of baseball and what it has meant to Americans since the late 1800s. ""Major League,"" on the other hand, is a spoof of baseball that's meant to entertain with brash comedy. Unfortunately, its appeal mainly is to men who enjoy vulgar humor. Had they toned that down a couple notches, this film could have been a real keeper and enjoyed by many more people. Yes, there is humor without vulgarity, and much more of it."

There's some real heart here and it's a great down-n-dirty triumph over opposition story. <br/><br/>But at the end of the day, it's a great comedy with more than a few memorable one-liners and a winning sense of humor.

They get an old minor league washed up James Gammon to run the team expecting him to run it in to the ground. He doesn't do that but uses the fact that he owner wants them to fail as the motivation for the teams success. Charlie Sheen is good as the penal league pitcher Wild Thing.

","If this film were made today it would probably be hit with charges of insensitivity and racism against Native American Indians, and I'm trying to think back to when things got so hyper regarding political correctness that you were made to feel guilty about things like the national pastime. This one, led by Bob Uecker, manages to hit all the clichés about redskins, featherheads, tomahawks and going 'off the reservation', but you know what - it's a funny flick and a blast for fans of the game. Granted, it makes use of all the clichés and has the most predictable of plots but the fun is in seeing how the hapless Cleveland Indians overcome their circumstances and become American League Champs. I'm probably not alone in picking the 'Wild Thing' sequence as my favorite part of the picture, coming at just the right time to vault the team to glory in their single playoff game. Every actor here is cast perfectly for their role, and if I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be James Gammon as crusty manager Lou Brown who pulls the team together for that final victory to the dismay of team owner Rachel Phelps (Margarter Whitton).

","MAJOR LEAGUE (1989) might not be especially deep or provocative or ethereal like such more regarded classics as THE NATURAL, BULL DURHAM, EIGHT MEN OUT, or FIELD OF DREAMS (how did the 80s produce so many good baseball movies?!), but in retrospect, MAJOR LEAGUE is most probably my favorite among the bunch just b/c it is so plain entertaining! While those other films try to go for the long ball and swing for the fences, MAJOR LEAGUE basically just tries to make contact and get on base! And it does it with great humor, grit, and palpable appeal! <br/><br/>The main reason MAJOR LEAGUE works is due to the casting, first and foremost the underrated Tom Berenger in one of his most accomplished film performances. Berenger totally carries ML as veteran, crafty, world-weary, womanizing catcher Jake Taylor, whose last chance at glory is upon him with a tryout with the Cleveland Indians, a franchise that hadn't been in a World Series since 1954. Berenger's laid-back, man's man appeal sets the tone of the film and everyone basically plays off of him. He's as effortless as the lead in ML as Kevin Costner was in his 80s baseball movies.<br/><br/>The diverse supporting cast is sublime: Charlie Sheen as closer Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn, Corbin Bernsen as egotistical, media-schmoozing 3rd baseman Roger Dorn, scene-stealing James Gammon as scruffy, take-no-prisoners manager Lou Brown, Wesley Snipes as slick ""Willie Mays"" Hayes, Dennis Haysbert as voodoo-worshipping Pedro Cerrano, sexy Margaret Whitton as devious team owner Rachel Phelps (undercutting the team hoping it will lose so she can sell it for profit), enchanting Rene Russo as Jake's true love Lynn Wells, and last but not least Mr. Baseball Bob Uecker, used brilliantly in an all-too-welcome role as Indians announcer Harry Doyle.<br/><br/>The strength of ML is that it has a real ""everyday"" appeal that one doesn't find to often in movie comedies. It has a lot of (seemingly improvised) montage scenes of the team throughout the season and just random extras playing Indian fans in bars, at games, at work thrown in to give it a universal appeal; in this way, it allows the viewer to root for this underdog team along with them. But these scenes all feel REAL and the movie doesn't work without them.<br/><br/>Everything in ML is relatable to the viewer. The laughter comes from the reality of the situation and is not manipulative at all. Of all the baseball movies I've ever seen, ML feels like the one that gets the sport of BASEBALL right!"

There is not a single weak link in the entire ensemble, which makes picking a favorite character almost impossible.<br/><br/>Without a doubt my favorite baseball movie, the portrayal of America's favorite past time is done with a humorous touch to the slightest detail, with the score board, the local regular fans, and of course Bob Uecker as the broadcaster, who utterly steals the show.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, give it a try.

In spite of her actions, the team starts to win, they begin to gel a little, but are not yet playing together as a team. She decides to take some of their things away, like their plane and their equipment. They have to travel by bus, and have no equipment (like whirlpools or hot water, to help their aches and pains). Bob Ucher plays a baseball announcer who adds tremendous comedy to the movie at almost every turn. <br/><br/>Tom Berringer plays Jake Taylor an aging catcher, who knows the game well, but his age is causing problems. Jake's wife (Played by Renee Russo) has divorced him, because he played around when he was younger, but now his aging has changed his view and he is far more serious about baseball and his relationship. He wants a shot at some sort of Baseball Championship as it may be his last shot. He also wants his wife back. However, she is now engaged to a rich successful guy and in addition she continues to see Jake Taylor for the playboy he used to be. It may be too late for either of Jake's goals. <br/><br/>With 41 games left, the Indians have been a shocker in that they are 60 and 61. This is when the coach discovers the new owners true plans to move the team to Miame and get rid of these players. The Coach relays these plans to the players. This is it, the thing that brings them together! Jake verbalizes their goal to win the whole thing. They determine they need 32 more wins to do it. That goal of going 32 and 9 seems impossible, even as motivated as they are to do it. <br/><br/>The Indians begin to play as a team. They work on their weaknesses and the city energizes behind them during a good music/movie montage. They win their way to a one game playoff with the New York Yankees for the Eastern Division Championship. <br/><br/>Well you can guess what happens, and you can also guess what happens with the Jake Taylor and his wife. But, despite this predictability, this movie climax has enough surprises (Centering around Jake Taylor) to rank up there among the very best movie climaxes ever.<br/><br/>This movie exhibits a sound/music climax coinciding with the story climax. Therefore, if you can, try blasting the volume just at the point the Manager calls Ricky Vaughn (the Wild Thing) out of the Bullpen. Leave the volume up from that point upto the final shot.

The assorted team members comprise such characters like a religious voodoo nutter and a wild child parolee - and those are the sane ones! The cast is made up of big names, Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes are in tune and in it for laughs, and hopefully you will be as well. Upon its theatrical release it proved to be a popular crowd winner, so much so that (unfortunately) two desperately bad sequels were spawned, so do avoid those at all costs. Instead just settle for this one especially if you are in need of a pick me up.<br/><br/>Wild Thing you make my heart sing, indeed. 7/10"

","Major League (1989) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Wonderful crowd-pleaser about a group of misfit baseball players who are thrown together by an owner who hopes they're bad enough so that she can relocate the team to a new city in the off season. The players of the Cleveland Indians find out about this and decide to give it their all to become winners. MAJOR LEAGUE really isn't anything that we haven't seen before in countless sports movies. We have the typical stereotypes and the clichéd story and we all know how it's going to end. With that said, who says you can't take something old and make it fresh and exciting? This here is without question one of the best comedies of the 80s and I really think it keeps getting better with age. The movie really has one terrific scene after another as one can't help but fall in love with these losers, their situation and of course you want to see them win. What works so well is that we're given a terrific cast with Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen leading the way as the wise vet and the wild rookie. The two of them work perfectly well together and certainly help keep the film going at a fast pace. The supporting cast gives us wonderful work by Corbin Bernsen, Margaret Whitton, James Gammon, Wesley Snipes, Charles Cyphers, Dennis Haysbert, Chelcie Ross and Rene Russo. We also have the priceless Bob Uecker who turns in one of the memorable roles in sports film history. The film is perfectly directed by David Ward who perfectly plays up the various comedy routines but he also manages to packs some wonderful tension during the final ballgame as the Indians go up against the Yankees. MAJOR LEAGUE has non-stop laughs from start to finish but we even get a little side romance and of course plenty of dirty jokes. The R-rating really helps this film because it just seems like one of those macho movies where guys talk dirty and it's all wonderfully funny."

","Jake (Tom Berenger) has just been signed by the Cleveland Indians again. Having spent his most recent years in the Mexican league, he is happy to be in the SHOW once more. However, he learns quickly enough about the new owner's strategy. It seems this lady has deliberately assembled a team to LOSE, knocking attendance down so low that she can move the team to Miami Beach. How charming. Rookies Willie Mays Hays (Wesley Snipes) and Wild Thing (Charlie Sheen) are unhappy about their situations as well. But, what if they can rise to the occasion and become a winning team? After all, the team also sports a powerhitting, voodoo-believing clean up man, a born again pitcher, and a go-for-broke manager. And, if Jake can convince his ex-wife (Rene Russo) to take a chance again on him and the team, miracles can happen, can't they? This is an all star baseball movie, in every way, but is so humor-laden that any non-sports enthusiast will enjoy it very much, too. As the supposed rejects, Berenger, Snipes, Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Bob Uecker, and the rest of the acting crew delight the audience at all times. The awesome script is brimming with humor, wackiness, and inspiration. As for the costumes, sets, and production values, they are top of the line. The final moments of the film, told in slow motion, are guaranteed to bring some lumps to anyone's throat. If you love baseball, you MUST, MUST see this film. But if you just want to laugh, cry, cheer, and feel good about life, this winning movie is for you, too. Catch it today, without delay."

","If Troma, the Farrelly brothers, and Mel Brooks ever conspired to produce a movie with baseball as a centerpiece, it probably would end up looking a lot like Major League. The film benefits from excellent casting, clever writing that leverages these characters, and being able to take itself lightly. Take a look at the 'goofs' section and you'll see that it is riddled with issues! If anything, it means the audience is attentive enough to pay that close attention and probably by viewing the movie on multiple occasions. I think it adds to the movie's comedic angle, albeit accidental, to see the stadium clock set at 10:40 am during a game! Great elements exist throughout. The lowly Indians of the 80s taking on the Yankees, their bitter rival that also serve as the unlikable bully. There is the wild rookie, the veteran player's last chance, the love triangles, the loathed owner, and Bob Euker! This is one of those films that has moments that burn into memory. Fortunately, when it ends up on a cable channel, I'll stick with it because there is always a good moment ahead. Note: This review does not apply to the sequel! It confirmed the law of diminishing returns. 'II' is the dreadful counterbalance to the original."

","Easy going charm and an assortment of nutty characters make this one of the most entertaining sport's comedies ever. Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes all star as the ""Bad News"" Cleveland Indians who are searching for their first pennant in thirty years. The Plot: Rachel Phelps as Margaret Whitton inherits the management of the baseball team after her husband dies and puts together a roster of players with a sure fire recipe to lose. However the team overcomes it's difficulties and fights Mrs. Whitton's various hurdles to: you guessed it.<br/><br/>Some great characters and great scenes make this one a winner. Charlie Sheen as the juvenile delinquent ""Wild Thing"" has a scene stealing moment as he exits the bullpen and enters the last game against the Yanks. Dennis Haybert as the voodoo worshiping Pedro Cerano adds more flavor. Wesley Snipes (before he started taking himself too serious) was charismatic as the speedy Willie Mays Hays. James Gammon is great as the barking, gruff manager who does a classic with Corben Bernson's character's contract. Even Bernsen, who plays a spoiled playboy type is marvelous. Berenger and Russo, who play the romantic side, do it well, keeping it low key as to not take anything away from the main plot. Very upbeat, funny film.<br/><br/>Two of my favorite moments: Wild Thing in the restaurant with cut off shirt, crazy hairdo, earring and a tie wrapped around his bare neck says deadpan ""I look like a banker."" Classic Charlie Sheen. Also Tom Berenger in slow motion in the final game headed for first. The look of heart, as the movie certainly has."
"pax03","9","0","1","12 March 2006"," the best baseball movie??
","In my opinion this is the best baseball movie out there. Sure there are others (the natural, the babe, field of dreams, etc.) but this one had it all. Put it this way, it had everything all the good baseball movies had in it plus alittle extra. It had great acting (Berenger, Sheen, Snipes, Bernson, Haysbert, Russo, Gammon, etc.) they were all spot on with their characters and some will never live down their characters here. The story was intriguing one as well, the basic story is this ""evil"" GM of a terrible baseball team, and of course its a woman, is trying to get the team to loose all their games so she can move the team to Miami and out of Ohio where she hates being and replace the current players with better ""personel"" Along with that story, there is kind of a love triangle with Berenger/Russo/and her new man. This doesn't take over the main story though and its good it doesn't stray far from what it is, a baseball movie. It is good to have other side stories as well to keep the pace of the movie going: Cerano having trouble with the curve ball and the old pitcher that gives him crap about being into Voodoo. Rick Vaughn having trouble with seeing, his temper, and his control. Willie Mayes Hayes trying to show off his ""hit like Hayes, Run like Mayes"" style, and Roger Dorn with his trouble trying to keep his self clean of any injuries and trying to cleanly field a ground ball. All these side stories get played out very well and they help the 2 main story lines keep the pacing of the movie very sharp. The script was sharp as well, a lot of baseball jargon and quick witty dialog, I think some was ad libbed by some of them and the comedic timing was right on. If you are a baseball fan you cant NOT like this movie and you should get chills like I do every time I see the final game and the finale of the film, very emotional and a great ending. The finale might of just made this one of, if not the best baseball movie ever made. Like I said before you aren't a baseball fan if you didn't like this movie! plan and simple."

Before the series with the Yanks, when the team is flying to the game, Lou calls Ricky to the back of the plane to advise him that he is not starting. Rick is wearing a shirt with ""Capt.

","When her husband dies of a heart attack, former exotic dancer Rachel Phelps inherits the Cleveland Indians  a baseball team that has ""enjoyed"" a 34 year slump. She immediately makes her plan clear  to make the team lose so badly that she will be able to move the team to Miami. Her first move is to bring in a whole raft of new players  deadbeats, former stars, no-hopers and such and then bring them under the management of Lou Brown, now working in an auto-repair garage. With all the players in place the team is naturally a mess and start the year as such. But can the misfits pull together as a team to make a hit in the league?<br/><br/>With a plot that is pretty much just one long cliché this film was never going to be anything special but it isn't terrible and it does actually manage to be amiable enough to entertain. A couple of times the narrative tries to do something interesting with the characters but it never gets to the point where you could compare it to the much better Bull Durham and really it shouldn't have bothered. Outside from this there isn't really anything that provides consistent laughs but it does manage to have a vaguely humorous air to it for most of the running time. I suppose it depends how demanding you feel when you watch it but if you accept the clichés then you'll probably buy into the relaxed air it has. This isn't to suggest it is any good (because it isn't) but sometimes it is comforting to be somewhere familiar and you can't get much more familiar than the clichés on display here.<br/><br/>The cast are quite impressive on paper and their collective charisma is part of the reason that the clichéd material actually is amusing. Berenger plays grizzled better than many an actor and is solid in the clichés despite not being able to do anything of value with his subplot with Rene Russo. Sheen and Snipes are both very young looking and play their roles well enough. Bernsen isn't the most convincing but he does alright (again not able to do anything with his more serious subplot though). Russo is totally wasted but Ross, Haysbert and others in the team are reasonably enjoyable while Whitton delivers her character well.<br/><br/>Overall then, hardly the greatest film ever made, or even that good a film but one that just about does enough to be enjoyable if you are in the mood for it. Trading almost totally on clichés the film was never going to be anything special (and it isn't) but the sequels indicate that there must be a market for even stuff this derivative and I suppose that it pretty much delivered all I wanted on a very lazy Sunday evening where I didn't want to think."

","In the last three games of the 1980 seasons, the Mets played the Pirates, and set a record for lowest home attendance for a three-game series, at slightly over 5,000 tickets. Three of those were mine. The Indians from this movie were about as bad, and the stadium about as empty.<br/><br/>The plot: a stripper's husband dies on their honeymoon, and she wants to move the Cleveland Indians, whom she inherited, to Miami. To do this, she compiles the worst collection of players she can find while still appearing to try to win.<br/><br/>Like the Bears, who were court-ordered because everyone had to get a chance to play, these Indians are ""owner ordered"" because their mission was to lose games. Neither team would have existed otherwise.<br/><br/>The ""Buttermaker"" role in this film, Manger Lou Brown (a tire salesman), is played stereotypically well by James Gammon. ""Englebert"" (catcher Jake Taylor) is played by Tom Berenger, with Rene Russo as his annoying ex-girlfriend that he inexplicably still wants. ""Amanda"" in this movie is ""Wild Thing"" (played by Charlie Sheen), the no-nonsense ex-con with the killer fastball. ""Kelly Leak"" was divided in half, with the delinquent half incorporated into Sheen's character, and the slugging half to political exile Pedro Cerrano, a Cuban national who fled Castro's persecution over his practice of voodoo. Corbin Bernsen (now a very bald John Durant on General Hospital) is Roger Dorn, the prima donna third baseman who refuses to give even 50 percent for this farce of a team. Wesley Snipes is Willy Mays Hayes, a gate-crasher at Spring Training who literally runs his way onto the team.<br/><br/>The season starts off predictably, but the owner (Margaret Whitton) is not pleased because the team isn't as bad (16-25) as she had hoped. When they reach .500 at 60-60, only nine games out of first, she goes ballistic and cuts the team's legs out from under them, forcing them to train with poor equipment and travel in an old chartered plane that put the fear of God into the team. When the Bear-I mean the Indians, find out why they were hired, they have that coming-of-age moment when they decide to rise up and ""win the whole thing."" Like the 1973 Mets, who came from 11.5 games back at the end of August to pass five teams and win the division, these Indians play hard, even Dorn gets into the act and plays like it's a contract year, and the movie climaxes on the final day of the season with the Indians and Yankees in a playoff for the title.<br/><br/>The subplots are well-acted and the casting was superb, as the future careers of many actors in this film testifies to."

The fact that Willie Mays Hayes car is a VW bug made to look like a Rolls is hilarious. This move is better then Bull Durham, not because the baseball scenes are better, they aren't. It is better because Renne Russo is sooo much better looking the Susan Surandon. Also worth watching are the edited for television scenes. ""Want me to take him outside, kick the *snot* out of him?

How did he get there? ""I stole a car,"" Wild Thing Ricky Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) responds. That is the makeup of an ""every-team"" that is the Indians, and is enough to carry the movie from start to finish. Corbin Bernsin plays a cocky (what are the odds?) third baseman, Wesley Snipes is a speedy centerfielder, Dennis Haysbert is a Voodoo loving rightfielder, and Rene Russo makes her movie debut as the love interest of one of the ball players. The man who steals the movie, however, is Bob Uecker as the bumbling Indian's announcer, who is famous for the phrase ""Juuuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside"" for a pitch 4 feet off the plate.

","Major League invented the modern day sports film formula.  That formula goes as follows: take a team of any sport that is doing really horrible, add a bunch of misfit players with screwball personalities, spend most of the film showing how they have hidden talent, spend what's left of the film showing them kicking everybody's asses, then go into a big ""ending game"" where they win.  Now, we have seen this formula a thousand times.  This is quite possibly the most copied and repeated formula ever created because all the movies that use it are exactly the same, only with a different sport and characters with different quirks.  What are some movies like this?  Well, there's Necessary Roughness, Major League 2 & 3, The Replacements, all those Mighty Ducks movies, and, ummm, about 500 others that I can't think of right now.  Just trust me, there are enough clones of this movie to make those anti- stem cell people wet their pants.<br/><br/>What makes Major League different is that is was first (but, if I'm wrong about this, please correct me).  To my knowledge, it was the first movie to use this exact formula.  Now comedic sports movies have existed since Edison's day, but Major League was the first to do this.  And I think it's the best.  What makes it better than the clones with the same formula is talent.  This film is filled with it.  Charlie Sheen playing a pot smoking, car stealing, punk, which is, well, himself.  Tom Berrigner before he started making straight to video films (what happened to him?  The guy's nominated for an Oscar, then he's flipping burgers at McDonalds.  Since when does it work like that?)  Renne Russo in her first film, I think.  Dennis Haysbert is hilarious as the voodoo man Pedro, my favorite character in the film.  Wesley Snipes is great and pretty much unnoticed in this film.  Had this movie been made today, he would have gotten top billing, but this was before he was famous.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one thing about this movie that I don't like, it would have to be the routine ""big game at the end"".  The movie is hilarious up to this point, when it gets serious.  It's like someone hits the brakes when you're going 80 down the interstate, in what I call comedic whiplash.  This happens in a lot of movies (remember Space Cowboys?).  But Major League just gets too serious too quickly.  But that's my only gripe and it hurts me to say it because I love this little movie.<br/><br/>Yep, I love this movie.  It's very close to my heart.  It hasn't got the big laughs of some movies, it isn't filled with comedians, it isn't crude, racist, or blasphemous (not that I really care); but it is funny and it has heart.  It's just a fun, good ol movie.  In fact, I have yet to meet a person who didn't like it.  Now I can't say that about the clones.<br/><br/>Rating: Probably a 7 or an 8.  Somewhere in that area."
"Peach-2","8","0","4","6 January 1999"," One of the funniest baseball movies I've ever seen.
","Major League is definitely one of the funniest baseball movies I have ever seen. The only thing I didn't like about it is that I'm a life-long Yankee fan. They make the Yankee's out to be such jerks in this film, how could you not root for the Indians. The casting is excellent and there are some truly great moments in this film. It suffers from a Cinderella type storyline, but that is the only true weakness."

","Having just managed to get a copy on video, it is still a great comedy after all these years , remembering that i went to watch it twice when it first come out.Baseball is not a big sport in the UK but it did'nt matter if you did not understand the sport , the comedy was great, and a mixture of great characters, an ex con , a washed up player  with dodgy knees, a poser and a player that has voodoo as his religion , put it with a announcer who says what he thinks and you have the mixture for a great film . It is a film about the under dog who gets on top, a bunch of misfit players who come together to get one over on their bitch of an owner played by Margret Whitton , Charlie Sheen is great as Wild Thing Rick Vaughn with a brillant haircut , Berenger has a great line when he is talking to Corbin Bernsen, after Bersen had not dived for a ball during a game "" If you ever tank a play like that again I will cut your nuts off and shove them down your F****** throat "". The first was the best and the sequals were a let down , but after 12 years the original is still a great comedy film"
"eibon09","Null","0","1","18 July 2001"," Inspired by The Producers
","Takes a satiraic look at baseball and the awefullness of the Cleveland Indians during that point in time.  Film was done when the Cleveland Indiand were one of the laughing stocks of baseball.  This was before the next decade when they would become one of the best teams in the American League of major league baseball.  Some good performances are given by Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo, and Wesley Snipes.  Major League(1989) gave stardom to an unknown actor at that time by the name of Wesley Snipes.  Possiby the best performance ever given by Charlie Sheen. Many of the film's plot elements come from Mel Brooks's The Producers(1968). An entertaining and funny motion picture with some flaws in some areas. Major League(1989) was part of a big wave of baseball movies made from the late 1980s to the early 1990s."
"Niteout23","Null","0","1","15 July 2001"," Great fun
","I love this movie and enjoy it each time I see it although I know it all by heart. I love baseball and this movie captures both the fun and enjoyment of it as well as the futility of it.  Great Bob Ueker lines - and there is just something about the underdog winning.  When this movie first came out, my son's teenage baseball team adopted the bench clap/stomp for their use and they had every line of the movie memorized (""forget about the curveball, Ricky - throw him the heater"".)  Other baseball films may be better acted and filmed, but this one is just plain fun.  I could have done without the boy lost girl/boy gets girl part which was boring and took away time from the real fun.  The sequels were horrible and not worth watching, but this first one was wonderfully entertaining."
"Chinook-3","9","0","4","28 March 2001"," Why do I love this film?
","Beats me! All I know is that virtually EVERY time this flick hits cable...I watch it. There is something about the way this simple, very funny movie fits together that just compels me.  Sheen is great as ""Wild Thing"" Ricky Vaughn.  And the same can be said for every other actor (and character) in the film.  They all just seem to click.  Bob Uecker is priceless.  I don't know, maybe I'm losing my taste, but this is a film that will ALWAYS pick me up and makes life just a bit better!"
"Karl Self","Null","0","4","23 March 2001"," Solid And Funny
","This is what any sports league should be like -- a bunch of underdogs with genuine personality who get their act together and win the league championship along their girls' hearts.  Reality is probably a bit more mundane.<br/><br/>Overall, not a great work of art or anything, but undeniably an enjoyable, solid film with plenty of good lines and laughs.  Catch it on TV or get it from your video store if you haven't seen it yet."
"tfrizzell","Null","0","4","21 October 2000"," Major Comedy
","""Major League"" is a funny and yet somewhat serious and dramatic film about the woeful Cleveland Indians.  Their new owner (Margaret Whitton) has brought together the worst players so the team will lose more games than anyone else in baseball.  Why?  Well, she wants the attendance to be so low that she will be able to move the team to Miami and then buy the players to make the franchise successful.  The has-beens and never-will-bes include catcher Tom Berenger, third baseman Corbin Bernsen, center-fielder Wesley Snipes, and wild pitcher Charlie Sheen.  However after a rocky start, the team comes together and begins winning.  They unite the city and unite the team in grand fashion.  ""Major League"" is a film that tries to be more than it is and almost succeeds.  On first glance it is a pure comedy, but does have some dramatic aspects as well.  This makes the film somewhat uneven and disjointed, but somehow it still over-achieves for the most part.  Far from a masterpiece, but it is still a good film overall.  3.5 out of 5 stars."
"JoJo-31","Null","0","4","10 December 1998"," I don't understand
","I don't understand why people think this movie sucks.This movie rocks, if you know what I mean.  I'm talking about ""Wild Thing""  yeah it sure is a wild movie, and in a good movie are conflicts. There's Roger Dorn against Ricky Vaughn because he is a rookie, Eddie Harris against Pedro Curenno because Curenno believes in a different religion, and Lou Brown against Rachel Phelps because, well, she's just a bitch.  So, all of you people who think ""Major League"" sucks, why don't you watch it again and again."
"Monika-5","Null","0","4","25 March 2000"," A must see for baseball fans!
","This movie hits close to home because I live in the Cleveland area and am a HUGE Indians fan! I remember back in the days when Cleveland and especially the Tribe were laughingstocks...oh, back to the movie, hehe...<br/><br/>Bob Uecker is hysterically funny as the Indians' radio announcer, and Tom Berenger looks very comfortable and relaxed as the veteran catcher. Charlie Sheen is funny, and Rene Russo makes the most of her small role as Berenger's girlfriend. Wesley Snipes was great as the Kenny Lofton-esque Willie Mays Hayes, and the rest of the cast was great.<br/><br/>The script offers no suprises whatsoever, but it's still fun to watch. Recommended especially to Indians fans."

","This is my favorite movie of all time.  It is awesome! Not only is this movie one of the funniest sports movies ever made, but it also has one of the best endings to any sports movie ever.  I still get chills when I hear Bob Uecker yelling at the end!"

","This movie is pure Velveeta and packs every sports-flick cliche ever seen into 90 minutes...but I still laugh out loud during many of the lines I can quote verbatim and still get chills every time Ricky Vaughn strides out of the bullpen at the end.<br/><br/>Not a great movie by any means, but ten years later it's still one of my favorites."
"hsgodfre","10","0","4","4 October 1999"," Why the score?
","Major League is by far my favor sports movie, beating out Caddyshack although most would disagree. Why it has a score of 6.4 I can't understand. Everyone I know loves this movie. While the sequels are almost as bad as sequels to such other classics as Home Alone and Caddyshack, it shouldn't affect this movie. The wonderful one-liners and story alone make this great movie what it should be ranked at. Having it at a 6.4 is almost as bad as Mr. Showbiz saying Haley Joel Osment should be voted for worst actor of the year award, while he is the most oscar worthy supporting actor to be in a movie yet."

","Any true baseball fan has to see this movie if they haven't seen it yet. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Many of the lines are unforgettable.  You have to love the characters in this movie.  Ricky Vaughn, Willie Mays Hays, Pedro Cerrano, and Harris are terrific."
"The Boz","Null","0","1","30 July 1998"," A bunch of misfits make a run for the American League Pennant.
","A hilarious baseball movie about a bunch of misfits, cons, and old-timers that make the best of the situation and try to win the American League pennant.  The movie offers a lot of laughs as this group of so-called baseball players tries to overcome all the obstacles their owner puts in front of them.  Their new owner wants to move the team and can only do so by keeping attendance low.  She (Margaret Whitton) pulls out all the stops and tries to deter the Cleveland Indians from winning.  Charlie Sheen, Tom Beringer, and Corbin Bernsen lead an all-star cast is this all-out comedy that takes the Indians all the way to the pennant.  Bob Uecker plays the Indians play-by-play announcer as the lovable and funny Harry Doyle.  He throws in one-liners the whole movie and adds to the overall humor in this film.  If your a sports fan and love sports movies, this baseball ""blooper"" is a great choice."
