","People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. <br/><br/>What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.<br/><br/>Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. <br/><br/>Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.<br/><br/>Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.<br/><br/>You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves."

","The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does. <br/><br/>Paul Dano is absolutely brilliant as Eli Sunday and has complimented Daniel Day-Lewis in every sense of the word in spite of the fact that he barely had a week to prepare contrary to Daniel Day-Lewis, who had a whole year to prepare. Eli Sunday is ambitious, enigmatic, placid, pesky and pusillanimous and despite being highly contrasting to Daniel Plainview, ironically has many similarities to him, especially the uncanny demeanor that helped them both to inveigle others. It is the chemistry and the ever growing tension between them that makes the movie haunting and spectacular. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a morbid tale of greed, betrayal and obsession adorned by some great performances, visually stunning cinematography and masterful direction. Plainview owns a mine with potential silver deposits and his assiduity finally pays off when he discovers a silver ore. He sells it to acquire a crew to help him with the subsequent diggings in the mine. After the mine runs out of silver, oil is discovered in it and hence begins Plainview's journey of insatiable greed and morbid obsession. In order to acquire more oilfields and to strike out further deals easily, he adopts a young boy and names him as H.W. to help build a facade of a benevolent family man for himself. It almost takes him a decade to establish himself as a minor oilman, but this moderate success further intensifies his avarice. Subsequently, a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits Plainview's camp and offers to sell information about his family's ranch, which he claims to have an ocean of oil underneath it. Plainview and H.W. travel to the Sunday Ranch pretending to be on quail hunting while hiding their ulterior motive of verifying Paul's claim. Being as perspicacious as he was, it didn't take him long to find the vestiges of oil in the cracks formed due to the recent earthquake. He tries to inveigle the Sunday patriarch (who almost cried with rapture on hearing the offer) to sell him the land at a moderate price (which he calls quail price and not oil price), but is stymied by owner's ambitious son, Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano), who asks him to pay an additional ten thousand dollars towards the building of the Church of Third Revelation. Plainview reluctantly pays him five thousand dollars as advance and promises to pay the remaining amount once the drilling starts. Plainview assembles his crew at the Sunday Ranch and builds the first derrick. He also buys almost all of the land surrounding the Sunday Ranch so he will have not only those drilling rights but also the right to build a pipeline to the ocean to circumvent the railroads and their shipping costs. Eli wants to bless the derrick before drilling begins but Plainview rebuffs him. Using the money given by Plainview, Eli builds his church projecting himself as a preacher, faith healer and prophet. Soon the church has many followers, most of whom are Plainview's workers. Eli's increasing influence on the people and his display of false divinity starts pestering Plainview, who is further flummoxed by congregation's frequent gatherings (the daily prayers prevented the workers from taking desired rest, thereby decreasing their efficiency). Plainview beseeches Eli to make them less frequent, but Eli dismisses him with disdain. Plainview's ruthless ego is badly jolted by Eli's stubbornness and he brutally assaults him and even threatens to kill him when Eli asks him for the remaining money. Eli returns home all covered with mud after Plainview's assault and takes out his frustration on his myopic father, blaming him for acquiescing to Plainview's naked ambition. H.W. is deafened during an oil rig incident and starts behaving as a brat. Disconcerted by the change in the mannerisms of his son, he sends him away. Eli soon gets his revenge when a fellow named Bandy forces Plainview to get baptized at the Church of the Third Revelation (as a penance for a murder that Plainview committed and of which only Bandy knew). While baptizing him, Eli humiliates him by repeatedly slapping him and calling him a sinner for abandoning his hapless child. This incident further intensifies the hatred in Plainview and sets the tone for a deeply haunting finale when they meet many years later. <br/><br/>P.T Anderson once again proves his mettle as a director and manages to pack a punch with this poignant and a deeply disturbing masterpiece. The movie incredibly succeeds on every level and entertains immensely, while still delivering a strong message. It was undoubtedly the best picture of 2007 and one of the best of the decade. In fact, it was very remiss of the academy to keep up with its long earned notoriety and prefer a relatively mediocre 'No Country for Old Man' over this truly haunting masterpiece. <br/><br/>P.S. 10/10"
"DSampson612","9","868","1294","14 January 2008"," Remember Those Hollywood Studio Epics? Me Either. But We're Covered.
","The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past..."
"lamoreauxba","10","60","81","11 January 2011"," One of my top five of all time, For Film viewers not movie goers
","There Will Be Blood. Chilling, Sublime, perfect.<br/><br/>First I must say the Soundtrack is amazingly disturbing and sets the tone of the film from the first scene. Many forget the amount of mood that sound sets. <br/><br/>The film held me enraptured from first to last second.<br/><br/>The story is perfectly displayed. Ever thing is laid out before the viewer in an intentional pace. <br/><br/>The film is for viewers with imagination and foresight who can see through the shams of modern movie plot and into the realm of literature.<br/><br/>The acting is simply stunning. Daniel Day Lewis can portray lines with a single expression and does in this film.<br/><br/>I'm sure many will not enjoy this movie and all I have to say to them is go watch Transformers 2 again."
"helenkirkwood07","Null","229","356","18 February 2008"," Unapologetic Tour de Force
","PT Anderson's name already means something, or I should say something else. His self assuredness alone gives me shivers. A modern artist with such clear and severe vision of the world. Boogie Nights, Magnolia, even Punch Drunk Love have an Wellesian disregard for what's in or out. His films are landmarks that may infuriate some, confuse others and mesmerize the rest of us. Here, with the rigorous tale of an impervious oil man, PT Anderson outdoes himself. He has Daniel Day Lewis as his accomplice in a performance that would be as difficult to match as it is difficult to describe. There is a monstrous beauty here that not even a broken nose can disguise. The saga is filled with long silent moments of tension that take place in a cinematic canvas and an actor's head. PT Anderson must have known that this was going to be, not only not a mainstream opus but a hard pill to swallow. I for one stand up to applaud his daringness."
"toolfan-hess","10","561","942","6 November 2007"," A film that will leave film-goers pondering for a long time
","PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"". Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very daunting whilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for ""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film."
"tranquilbuddha","Null","382","636","27 December 2007"," Stunning
","This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old."
"pacific-oconnor","9","220","362","16 February 2008"," A Powerful Blow
","Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does't belong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up to us. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the day it's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universes and throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling, so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious. but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well be the saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality. Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds his unmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs Of New York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recently anywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel Day Lewis an unmissable work of art."
"blake-91","10","383","670","27 December 2007"," Revitalizing, masterful, and utterly terrifying.
","What is evil? What is hate? How low can an individual go with one's actions and still be considered human....? These, quite possibly, are the biggest questions raised in There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis, the tycoons at the helm of this dig for moral oil, tell a story that takes the archetypal anti-heroes of 'Citizen Kane' and Travis Bickle of 'Taxi Driver' to a whole new, 21st-century level. The film, using Lewis's character Daniel Plainview, walks through incredibly dangerous cinematic territory that questions religion, plays with the nature of greed and hate and evil, and with it all, draws terrifying parallels to the world we live in today. The film and its main character claw so deep through the limits of humanity and the landscape of hell, that you'll be thanking the Good Lord for the silver screen that divides you from this horrible world Paul Thomas Anderson has portrayed. But despite how safe you may seem in your cushy seat, you will undoubtedly walk out of the theater with all kinds of new demons and ghosts buzzing in your head and ripping away at your subconscious. In this way, Anderson has abandoned his primary previous influence of Robert Altman to take more of a Stanley Kubrick direction, creating moral allegories that creep into your psyche and don't ever leave. You should be scared. Very Scared."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","51","81","27 January 2008"," Truly a piece of work
","A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood, at first I was a little put off, it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama. But then a little later, I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting. So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it. Now, I'm just going to get a complaint out, I think this movie was still a little drawn out, it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog. But that was the only thing that threw me off. While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is, There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line. The direction, the acting, the script, the sets, everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an oil man, he's in the business with his son, H.W., and he goes around buying land very cheaply, and makes thousands and thousands of dollars when he strikes oil. But when he comes a town called Little Boston led by the tip of a boy named Paul, he buys the land promising the church that he will donate five thousand dollars to it. Eli, the leader of the church, claims he is a prophet and goes to the extreme to prove so with his followers. When Daniel's team is draining oil, his son is blasted away from an explosion of oil and looses his hearing, Daniel at this point just goes mad and meets a man who claims to be his brother, but he later finds out that this man lied to him. He abandons his son and is loosing all sanity, but when the church comes back to him, he claims he is saved. Years later though, he goes from business man to monster and is going to ""drink Eli's milk shake"", you'll see what I mean when you see the film.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a film of utter perfection, the reason why I'm rating it so high is because it is a perfectly made film. There's nothing wrong with it, when I said it's a little drawn out, it's just my opinion. But Daniel Day Lewis pulls in a flawless performance and became Daniel Plainview, especially the end, he pulled in such a chilling side and didn't over do the dialog, which I'm sure any other actor would have done. But one performance I am particularly impressed with is Paul Dano's as Eli/Paul, Eli really got to me and was incredible during his sermons, he held his own up to Lewis. He's come a long way since the silent rebel in Litte Miss Sunshine. There Will Be Blood is a GOOD movie, I mean good in the highest regards, because how many of us can say when a film is just utterly good? Not too often. There Will Be Blood is going to be a good contender this year for the Oscars, but we'll just have to see who'll take the best picture award, because we have some good films that are competing.<br/><br/>10/10"

Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me.

","With all of the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' performance (he was, in fact, given a Best Actor nod from the San Diego Film Critics Society, for whatever that is worth) in the P.T. Anderson-directed tale of early American oil speculation, ""There Will Be Blood,"" I can only relate my extreme disappointment.<br/><br/>This would have made an interesting 90-minute movie, but, unfortunately, it runs over 140-minutes, most of which is smeared with plasma and petroleum to the extent every character is sullied and unrecognizable as a human being.<br/><br/>Perhaps Anderson wanted it that way, after all, it's really only Day-Lewis¹ character (the lubricious Daniel Plainview) that even comes close to developing; the others are simply there to keep him company and accept his violent tirades.<br/><br/>Yes, times were tough in the early hardscrabble years of the American West, but this guy makes Jonas Cord (""The Carpetbaggers"") look like Mother Theresa.<br/><br/>We first meet Plainview in 1898 mining for silver in Arizona. After a nasty fall in which he breaks his ankle, he discovers oil in the shaft. After a few years, he has a crew and a few successful wells.<br/><br/>One day, a fellow worker ­ there with his infant son (for some reason) ­is killed and Plainview adopts the boy, H. W. (Dillion Freasier) for no other reason than to have a cute face to show while he cons the public (see ""Paper Moon"").<br/><br/>These are some of the movie's best scenes, with Plainview - and H.W. in tow - visiting backwoods bergs and convincing a gullible populace into signing away land rights for a fraction of what they were worth. Plainview, with a sinister soft-spoken demeanor plays psychological games until the rubes are all but ready to GIVE him the oil rights in perpetuity. <br/><br/>Several years later, a visitor tells Plainview about a ranch in California that is soaking in oil, so Pop and son head out there, under the pretense of hunting quail. There they meet the Sunday family, addled dad, Abel (David Willis), a few non-descript females and an Evangelist son, Eli (Paul Dano, ""Little Miss Sunshine"").<br/><br/>Plainview and Eli do not hit it off at all, and this is the conflict that sets up the second act. It doesn't take much to finagle Abel out of the Sunday Ranch, as well as the surrounding property, but several tragedies cause many in the town ­ especially the young preacher ­ to wonder if they made the right move in letting Plainview into their midst.<br/><br/>When H.W. is rendered deaf in an explosion and disastrous fire, we wonder if the whole enterprise is worth it.<br/><br/>Up until this point, I was willing to go along with this film as not only a historical drama relating the days of the early oil industry, as well as a chronicle of rural religious fervor, sort of ""Oklahoma Crude"" meets ""The Apostle.""<br/><br/>The problem is, the picture does not continue to walk that thin line. We are now subjected to scene after scene of Plainview¹s descent into madness and murder ­ but with little or no motivation for either.<br/><br/>For example, he beats Eli severely and mocks his church; meets a man who claims he¹s his brother; abandons H.W. and generally spirals out of control.<br/><br/>He's business savvy, however, and plans to build a pipeline to transport his vast oil reserves to the coast (thus eliminating the cost of railroad shipping). To do this, though, he has to build through a local hermit's (Hans Howes, ""Seabiscuit"") land.<br/><br/>The only way to accomplish this is to humble himself before Eli and the congregation and be baptized, obviously a fate worse than death to Plainview who seems to have no morals, whatsoever.<br/><br/>Now that he¹s joined the church and gotten his pipeline built, does he enjoy even one iota of his success? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>In one of Day-Lewis' many monologues, he gives us his motivation for being such a bastard, ""I do not just want to succeed, I do not want anyone else to succeed.""<br/><br/>Still, that does not explain his psychotic, murderous frenzy, and the longer the film goes on, the less cohesive it became.<br/><br/>I can accept his tirades early on, and even a bit of his unmotivated violence near the middle of the film, but Anderson pushes things to the extreme limit. He's even admitted that he watched ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" before beginning to film ""Blood"" - yet he still did not learn anything about coherent film-making.<br/><br/>Friends, this is by far one of the most depressing and oppressive films of the year. In fact, it makes ""No Country For Old Men"" look like ""Mary Poppins."" <br/><br/>Then, at the conclusion, after watching more than two-plus hours of this evil, hateful man succeed over and over again, we're treated to another brutal, pointless murder -­ this one coming out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Like ""The Last King of Scotland,"" in which Forrest Whittaker won the Best Actor award, this is another performance-driven, but deeply-flawed motion picture.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis will certainly be nominated for this, and he may actually win, but that does not mean one will enjoy the experience of watching that performance."

","There Will Be Blood is a story about greed, religion and vengeance due to the discovery of one of nature's riches: OIL!<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis) is a poor silver miner who is injured and taken in by a few men digging for oil. When one of them dies in a freak accident, Daniel brings up the man's son as his own and becomes a self-made oil tycoon in the process. After receiving a tip-off that a seemingly impoverished town out west has a whole ocean of oil beneath the surface, Plainview rushes there and stops at nothing to get what he wants. Even if it means losing all the things most important to him, especially his SANITY. <br/><br/>It was written for the screen and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who also directed Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love. This is definitely a far better than the two. He should get a Best Director Nod for his work. The music is unlike anything ever I've ever heard, and it completely drew me into the haunting mood of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie will get a lot of Oscar Nominations, hopefully Best Picture but most importantly:Best Actor. Daniel Day-Lewis is arguably the most talented living actor and his performance here clinches that title in my opinion. At first, you see how Plainview goes from being an extremely charismatic individual to a dark, insane and vicious oilman. Day-Lewis perfects all of these characteristics to a T and no other performance this year is even in the same league as this one. <br/><br/>The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes long but it certainly didn't feel like it when I watched it. Actually, I would've been happier if the movie was 3 1/2 hours. It was that good. I was simply enthralled by this work of art.

A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining and dark character study of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and deception, faith and ambition, death and revulsion. Do not be mislead by its title, though. This is not some balls-to-the-wall slasher-flick (as the ""chavs"" sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by his own persona. And it's absolutely formidable- visual and melodramatic arrestment at its bona fide best that exudes cinematic precision and awe with satire to spare. But it's also a long-winded affair. So thrill seeking, gore-craving moviegoers walk away, now. I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. Add to that list- chic-flick, rom-com and sci-fi enthusiasts. You guys may be better off buying another ticket. Taking another ride. Those left, steady yourself for, perhaps, this year's most thought-provoking feature driven by a leading character performance fit to rival the very best.<br/><br/>Ushering in a near dialogue-free opening 15 minutes with a distinct fade-in, Anderson wastes no time in introducing us to the protagonist. Daniel Day-Lewis playsno scratch thatDaniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview. An ambitious, moustached miner who, while thrashing away at the crust of his motherland- at the turn of the twentieth century- strikes oil. A profitable discovery that fortuitously leads him to H.W (Dillon Freasier), a new-born infant of whom he slots forcefully under his oil sodden wing only to drag about the entire continent in search of large segments of land in which crude oil is stirring directly beneath. Soon enough, Plainview forges a blossoming ""family"" oil drilling corporation that soon establishes itself as a force in the industry and prospects appear even brighter when, in 1911, Plainview receives a generously eerie, yet pricey tip-off as to where there may be a sturdy supply of his beloved oil. A tip-off in which he pursues like a unwavering moth to an oil fuelled flame as he meanders ominously into Little Boston, California where the true colours of the indomitable oil baron edge disturbingly into light.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an angry, vengeful man whose promises and loyalties to those around him are as false and as futile as his love and respect for God. He ""guarantees"" the people of the Little Boston ranch; food, water, schools and, to the town's radically odd preacher Eli Sunday (an inspired Paul Dano), a newly renovated church of the Third Revelation. But he cares little for the reserving of his pledges and spends little time guilt-tripping over his numerous acts of iniquity. ""I look at people,"" he says ""and I see nothing worth liking."" ""I have a competition in me,"" he continues ""and I want no one else to succeed"". Self-centred sociopath?Yep, for Plainview is as putrid and as predatory as any character to ever grace the big screen. He putrefies slowly, though. The end product appearing more entity than man. Better yet: an egocentric emblem of evil that governs the screen in an implausible manner in which only an actor of Day-Lewis' calibre can. The sheer potency of his flawless portrayal actually carries the relatively toothless narrative in areas which could be further criticised for chugging along at a near crawling pace at times.<br/><br/>Visually and acoustically, though, TWBB is outstanding- every nuance of every aural and cinematic component work so well with one another to help give the film such power and impact. It's just a shame that no real direction or purpose bled into the screenplay for which Anderson adapted from Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel- Oil. As far as storytelling goes, Anderson has underperformed here. His narrative lacks any legitimate path or hooks and, to be honest, the lack of defining moments- bar the infamous confession and milkshake scenes- within 158 minute running length is a little disappointing. But the manner in which Day-Lewis dictates the audiences' attention more or less vanquishes any negative thoughts regarding the muscle of the plot. Which is why it comes as no surprise that everybody and their brother have duly commended the London-born method actor's impeccable, Oscar winning performance: the epitome of everything grand about Anderson's fifth but not quite finest feature yet; profound, provoking, intense, immense.<br/><br/>In spite of its flaws, TWBB is still an exceptionally powerful piece of cinema that'll remain etched in the minds of those who take to it for quite some time. Even if it's quality is not there for all to see, in plain view."

"Hancock_the_Superb","6","46","79","3 February 2008"," Disappointing and empty film, with an amazing central performance
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an ambitious, slimy oil tycoon who begins building up an empire in the southwest using his considerable charm, his adoptive son H.W. (Dillon Freasier/Russell Harvard), and ruthless business acumen. He descends on the town of Little Boston, California, building a huge oil derrick and enriching the town. He clashes with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the fanatical young preacher, develops a strained relationship with his son (who is deafened in an accident), and solidifies his empire - but at the same time begins to unravel as a person.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" has received mountains of acclaim, as one of the best films not only of the year, but of the decade - and by some, of all time. It's easy to see why, as the film has a great deal going for it: an interesting-on-paper story, impressive direction and cinematography, and most of all, an amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. But at the heart of TWBB is an emptiness, which not even the greatest performance can assuage, and that is the character of Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>The film begins promisingly, with a brilliant fifteen-minute opening scene devoid of dialogue, as Plainview and his associates dig out their first oil well. The introduction to Plainview as a slippery, manipulative man is well-done, and the first two hours or so are gripping. I sat engrossed, comfortable in knowing that all of the build-up would lead somewhere great. Unfortunately, towards the end, I realized that the opposite was true; the film wasn't leading anywhere, and indeed my enjoyment of it largely ended with a painfully contrived and ridiculous anti-climax.<br/><br/>The movie has a number of problems in narrative structure. It doesn't have much in the way of a traditional storyline. This is not inherently a bad thing, but the detached nature of the film makes it hard to care about what goes on. The only fully developed thread is the troubled relationship between Plainview and his son H.W., whom the former views as prop to manipulate his competitors and showcase his success. And even this is dropped like a potato at the end of the film. There is also the digressive nonsense of Plainview's ""brother"" (Kevin J. O'Conner) which adds nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Another flaw is the movie's lack of context. Though it is set in the early 1900's - a turbulent time when the US government led by Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson were tearing down business monopolies - there is no political or historical context beyond super-titles and a few brief mentions of Standard Oil. As the film was essentially a character study, I wasn't expecting an in-depth examination of politics and history, but a few illusions to the time period beyond ""1911"" flashing on the screen would have helped. The attacks on the hypocrisy of religion and big business are socialist primer material (unsurprising given the source is an Upton Sinclair novel) and bring nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>The basic problem of the film is in its lead, Daniel Plainview. Not in Daniel Day-Lewis, mind you, who gives one of the greatest performances in recent memory, but in the character itself. Plainview would be an interesting supporting character or villain, a slimy, manipulative man who thoroughly hates everyone besides himself. But there really isn't any depth to Plainview, and thus the film has a hollow center. He doesn't develop over the course of the story; he remains the same character throughout, a bitter, greedy misanthrope, and after awhile he becomes little more than a caricature of an evil businessman.<br/><br/>The main reason to see this film is Daniel Day-Lewis. While I wasn't particularly enamored of his turn as Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis's amazing turn as Plainview almost overcomes the script's shortcomings. Day-Lewis is a fascinating premise, and the brilliance of his performance conversely accentuates the weakness of his character. If it were in aide of something better, Plainview would be the most memorable character in the last twenty years of cinema. As it stands, it's still a remarkable achievement, and if Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar there is no justice.<br/><br/>Other than Day-Lewis, the cast is non-descript. Paul Dano has received acclaim for his performance as Eli Sunday, but the role requires little more than elementary ham acting. The film's climax in particular illustrate the weakness of his performance. There are a few names in the supporting cast (Ciaran Hinds, Kevin J. O'Connor), but they remain in the background throughout. Cinematography, music and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson are all fabulous, with memorable set-pieces such as the oil explosion and the aforementioned beginning stand-out, but they do little more than cover up the weakness at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" looks like it should be a great film, but it is a deeply flawed movie with a weak central character. Nonetheless, it's worth a look, and if nothing else Day-Lewis should make it interesting.<br/><br/>6/10"

"jed_priv","3","256","517","13 January 2008"," There will be hype
","I like Upton Sinclair and I like Daniel Day Lewis (DDL) (esp. impressed with Gangs of NY), but this movie is a flop in so many ways I can't recount them all here. Generally. it suffers from a deeply flawed screenplay and what I would presume to be the misdirection of DDLs considerable talent. In roughly 2.5 hours, the movie does almost nothing to either account for or reveal in any particularly interesting way the moral bankruptcy of Plainview. Insofar as DDL's performance is concerned, it is particularly overacted at the scene of his baptism, when his overt contempt for the proceeding could not be more apparent. While we can sympathize with his plight and laugh with his sarcastic murmurings, it is simply unbelievable that such a manipulative person in desperate need of the critical lease for his pipeline wouldn't at least fake the requisite sincerity, especially as we know the Plainview character is a capable performer and has a history of doing so. The 30 minute over-dramatized coda explains nothing and adds nothing and thus the movie's conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying. We already knew that Plainview was brutish and that Eli Sunday was a fraud. Some better explanation for the distance between D Plainview and H.W. would have been welcome, but none was offered.<br/><br/>A WEEK LATER: Everyone I speak with in NYC who has seen this movie agrees that it is weak and over-hyped. How is this rated the #28 best film ever made on IMDb, higher than Chinatown, Taxi Driver, M, Vertigo, The Third Man, Clockwork Orange, Raging Bull, Rashomon, etc... etc... ???? Are the voters here truly tasteless or just studio shills?<br/><br/>TWO WEEKS THEREAFTER: With another 1000 votes in the tally, its clear that the IMDb audience thinks this is the 16th best film ever made -- which goes to show how very little great cinema they've seen. Despite their rating, the film is no better than The Treasure of Sierra Madre where Bogart essentially gives DDL lessons in how to play the miner succumbed to greed -- a performance for which he didn't even grab a best actor nomination! (Admittedly, TWBB is perhaps more ""true to life,"" and benefits from incredible staging (sets and rigs) but I take this to be a function of the present climate where audiences are willing to accept an overt ""indictment"" of capitalist speculation as opposed to the more restrictive clime of 1948 in which the subject had to be reduced to a comedy.) Interestingly, I just read on wikipedia that ""(The treasure of Sierra Madre) is director Paul Thomas Anderson's favorite film. In fact, he watched it every night before bed while writing his film There Will Be Blood"""
"ibanezman6","3","263","533","8 January 2008"," There Will Be Stink...
","First off, I'd like to say that I have enjoyed most all of PTA's films. I loved Boogie Nights, thought Magnolia was an ambitious, but not great picture, and thoroughly enjoyed Punch- Drunk Love. I, like many others have eagerly awaited Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, There Will Be Blood. In fact, I drove almost 120 miles and waited 2-3 hours in line to see it, as that was the closest showing of it. I bought into all the hype, read almost every review, watched any and all interviews of it that I could, expecting a ""masterpiece"" as so many IMDBers put it. People even had the audacity to say it's one of the best films of the decade. Some big words and shoes for a film to fit. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, after the wait, I found myself disappointed and terribly bored with this film. The movie's pacing and editing was SO slow and too long (nearly 3 hours), I felt that the editor should have had another much needed run in the cutting room. For instance, certain shots in a scene went on forever as the camera stays with a character for 5 min or more, never changing angles, creating a needlessly slow pace. There were many scenes with little to no dialog adding another dull layer. Now I appreciate films with silence that present cinematic art ( ""3-Iron"" and ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...And Spring"", two movies that are nearly all silence) yet here it granted the film unevenness. People are claiming this film had beautiful cinematography, yet I fail to see what was so unique. Perhaps the theater I was at had an inexperienced projectionist, bad print or something, but the shots, lighting, and composition were rather dull and the camera movements uninteresting. I mean how hard is it to shoot wide-angle barren landscapes and campfire scenes and follow actors with steadicam/tracking scenes? Although this wasn't a stylized movie, rather an attempt to take you into the 19th century, I thought the cinematography was mediocre at best. I've seen better work from Robert Elswit and other DPs. <br/><br/>Worse than mediocre however, is the music/soundtrack, which was so obnoxious and used out of place, that it just may have worsened the viewing experience. The horror-like, intense and unnerving score that was mixed way too loud in the soundtrack, doesn't even seem to match the images or the story. The music isn't ""bad"", but it does not fit well. The music, which attempted to create tension among the characters exemplifying greed and corruption, seemed extremely forced and vexing. Here is this rather slowly cut/paced movie displaying an ugly landscape or early America undeveloped showcasing a man being SLOWLY corrupted, scored side-by-side with this imposing, experimental, enormous, horror-like score that was woefully out of sync with the film and apparently wanted to call attention to itself, not assist the story. <br/><br/>Acting... Well, although there is praise left and right for Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, I felt both performances were lackluster, Paul Dano's being much worse. There were many times that I felt like Dano was just reading from a script and not embodying the character, for instance, the first time we are introduced to him, his lines are weak and artificial with strange speech pauses and insipid facial expressions. DDL was also nothing special. His accent was, well... certainly not mind-blowing, and didn't make me think of anything uniquely ""American"" as that was what he was supposedly trying to portray. In many scenes he was overacting and Dano was underacting, or vice versa. I couldn't get into the two personality types as they were undeveloped. Although the audience is supposed to dislike DD Lewis, I didn't care for any of the characters and completely lost interest in the film about 40 min to an hour into it. DD Lewis is a great actor and that may be an understatement, but he certainly did not shine in this picture. Yet at the same time, he may have been the only redeemable thing in this movie. <br/><br/>I can only assume that since PTA is known for giving minimal direction and following his scripts closely (he has stated this during commentaries of his films) the acting was flawed and pulse nearly-dead, due to the weak script/adaptation. There were some major/minor holes in this film, but I didn't care. I was too bored, and couldn't care about any underlying tones of greed and religion since the characters neither really embodied either very well. Some characters appear, some disappear never to be seen again, certain scenes that were supposed to be climactic and intense came off as comedic (the audience I was with, laughed a great deal during these scenes) and I wondered if that was the way PT Anderson intended it, or it being the audience I sat with. I don't know. For example, during the final scene where DDL and Dano's ""discussion"" turns into a near fight, the scene comes off as if it were slapstick and had the audience busting out in laughs.<br/><br/>In summary, this film was a major let down for me as I had high hopes for it, and was a fan of all of PTA's films. The film's execution, writing, and direction was empty and flawed, resulting in an uneven, and painfully boring film. I suppose there are different strokes for different folks, but the film really stinks."
"g0dolphins","7","80","151","18 February 2008"," The parts were greater than the whole
","This is a most difficult movie to comment on, and I find it hard to put into words as to the reason. I think I enjoyed the movie, but how, why? Did I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal as the leading antagonist? Most defiantly. DDL has provided us with many memorable performances and his role as Daniel Plainview is no less in intensity as was Butcher Bob, nor any less authentic as Nathaniel Poe. Did I enjoy other aspects of the film? Sure! The period piece was of considerable interest; how oil can transform your life, for better, worse or otherwise. The cinematography was beautiful and telling. I fully appreciate the hard, dirty, bone weary work that this occupation would entail. The rag tag day-to-day existence for those working the oil fields, and the land from whence it came. The score too was beautifully blended, adding to the epic scope of the experience. Paul Dano was very convincing too as the prophet/preacher of the small community where Plainview acquires vast tracks of land. His character was equally complex, and I felt he complimented DDL quite adequately. Even the story had many merits, as we came to understand the type of people who produced oil, and how the product of its labor and influence can impact those who were associated with its extraction. So one would think that the buzz and hype around it in February 2008 are worthwhile, yet I cannot seem to agree. There is something missing, something that falls short of the expectations. Too many people are of opposite opinion regarding this movie; it is either a masterpiece or drivel. I find it is neither, although I am much more likely to lean towards the former. For that reason alone I should be what, somewhere five or seven on a scale of 1-10? Perhaps it does, I just wish I could feel it. So should I give it a 7 and stop wasting time lamenting over it? Yes, a 7, for reasons I can explain but not feel confident about. It pains me to do so, therefore I can only conclude that my expectations for this movie were not met."

","The idea that this film is one of the top 250 of all time (let alone top 25!) is preposterous. This is the first review I've submitted, and I do so because I feel compelled to express my outrage that a movie such as this could garner such a high rating, and may by itself destroy whatever credibility the ""250"" list may have retained.<br/><br/>Count me in the ""Emperor Has No Clothes"" crowd. Look, I loved ""Boogie Nights"" as much as anyone. It was a masterpiece, a work of genius. Nostalgia for that film is the only reasonable explanation I can construct to understand why so many have rated ""Blood"" so highly.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives a fine performance, yes, but what else is new? Though well-acted, I found his character simple and uninteresting. I am stunned by those who seem to regard Plainview as a new and terrifying character, a soulless messenger of a new evil (I chuckled when the goat-ranching rube whom Plainview aims to exploit introduces himself as ""Abel"")""No Country For Old Men"" and J. Bardem covered that territory far more effectively. Plainview seemed like a pretty straightforward sociopath to me.<br/><br/>Paul Dano, who I think is a fine actor, is terribly miscast as the evangelical preacher. He lacks the charisma and presence to credibly portray a charlatan. He was shrieky, and bizarre, not smooth, charming,confident, or anything else that suckers people into falling for scams. He was utterly unbelievable in his role, and it was too large a part to make such a mistake, set, as it was, against the furnace that is Daniel Day-lewis.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the kid who played Plainview's adopted son for the greater part of the film. I am loath to criticize a child, but I can only assume this boy had the ""look"" as a prop desired by the director, b/c he displayed no ability as an actor. When called upon for dialog, his stilted performance is painful to behold. I cannot believe there wasn't another kid who could've hit his cues more effectively, more naturally.<br/><br/>I actually found the ending one of the few interesting, thought provoking aspects of the film, but by then it was far too late to breathe life into the bloated behemoth that had strewn itself out on the screen the previous 2+ hours."
"awmurshedkar","10","16","25","23 July 2011"," There Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood – 9.8/10 <br/><br/>Director: Paul Thomas Anderson<br/><br/>Writer: Paul Thomas Anderson <br/><br/>Ground-breaking, disturbing, distraught,frightening, unnerving, intimidating, and in every sense of the word –'a masterpiece'. There Will Be Blood is a character sketch so strong,so complex, that it might take an individual a lifetime of trials and tribulations to comprehend the forces of human nature at work.<br/><br/>The film is dark and desolate, like much of Upton Sinclair's works, on whose book 'Oil' the film is loosely based on. Paul Thomas Anderson's (Magnolia) vision to convert this nature study of capitalism into a stunning film, revolving around an oil baron and a pastor has yielded starkly contrasting reactions. While audiences at large have not taken to the film particularly well, most critics unanimously agreed it was Anderson's best. Daniel Day-Lewis (Daniel Plainview), who plays the role of the oil prospector, has etched a new character in the history of world cinema and Paul Dano (Paul Sunday/Eli Sunday) who became a part of the film after the shooting started has played Day-Lewis' antagonist with perfection.<br/><br/>Anderson researched this film with all sincerity and it shows. Day-Lewis spend days understanding the character he was playing, to an extent that the actor who Paul Dano replaced alleged he was intimidated by Daniel's character, off-screen as well! The cinematography of the film is simple brilliance, and rightly earned Robert Elswit, Anderson's companion from Magnolia, an Oscar for best cinematography. While the music of the film did not earn much appreciation, I thought it perfectly complemented the film. In several instances, the music lays bare Day-Lewis' emotions, especially in the instance post the accident, when he has a conversation with his son HW, played by Dillion Freasier.<br/><br/>The film had a very strong script. This is almost true of all films made from successful and well written novels. But Day-Lewis has gone a step forward and owned the character. He commands every iota of attention in the film and for the first twenty minutes, where there is no dialogue, Lewis proceeds to build and delineate a character which will ultimately define what the film will be. I am not sure if I have seen a better character sketch in a film, a character so powerful, that it leaves one disturbed when the credits role in. What has amazed me is the magnitude with which the audience and critics alike have misunderstood the character narrative of the film.<br/><br/>Lewis' character has largely been interpreted as a heartless, cruel, capitalist for who even his adopted son is just a tool to achieve power and success. I believe this widespread misinterpretation is due to a shallow approach that capitalists are greedy and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. The character of the film is so complex, that I am not sure if there is enough space and time, and ability to explain the nuances and explore the depths. But I will make a brief attempt to do so.<br/><br/>Lewis' character is shown to be highly competitive. A man who trusts no one and loves nothing; he is lonely and believes there is no need to understand people as it would be a futile pursuit beyond that what is obvious. But he is not a man driven by pure greed, nor is he blinded by wealth and affluence as many viewers have believed. His relation with his son, and his inability to chart the course of his son's life, reveal his softer side while throwing light on his own superiority, godlessness and a form of megalomania. His character is extremely rational, but his hatred for everything that competes with him ultimately leads to his destruction. Not only is he aware of this (the last dialogue of the film tells us this), we see several moments where his loneliness breaks him; but the fundamental purpose of a human being shedding tears is undermined if there is no one to wipe them. He rises spiteful, harsher and harder after each trial, like a rock hardened by the incessant heat of a volcano. He seeks some solace, something to hold on to. Any trace of familial blood (There WILL Be BLOOD) which he can create by the virtue of his will or by the hand of destiny, he shall accept. The complexities of his character are so profound, that they only reveal themselves in small and quick passing dialogues and one has to live the character to truly see through him.<br/><br/>I dread to say there are common traits Daniel Plainview shares with all and everybody. We have either failed to realize it, even though our actions would speak, or we have managed to subvert, repress and bury them deep enough for acceptance in an unforgiving, conditional society. The film is like a streak of artistic lightening in a bleak sky. Whether this film speaks of perfection or not, we will never know, but one thing is certain, we will debate its mastery for years to come."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","91","179","14 January 2008"," Brilliant and chilling, ""Blood"" will leave you speechless
","Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.<br/><br/>Anderson's weapon in this film is no secret. It isn't often Daniel Day-Lewis's name shows up on a marquee these days, especially when it's not tied to something that is sure to be good. This latest choice of his, however, is better than good and so is he. His character, Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed ""oilman,"" is deeply complex and troubled. The way that Day- Lewis plays the lighter parts and seamlessly transitions to the darker parts is chillingly believable. Plainview is not only interesting, but he's embraceable, despicable, amusing and frightening all throughout the film.<br/><br/>The only truly supporting cast is his son and a self-proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Dano's performance is unfortunately shadowed by Day-Lewis and it does feel like he was too young to be cast, but the 23-year-old is highly impressive and will perhaps be a marquee name in the near future.<br/><br/>""Blood"" is otherwise the strength of Anderson and his crew. The original score by Jonny Greenwood, who is mostly known for his guitar skills in Hollywood, brings something abstract that simultaneously fits the film's generally quiet demeanor using a variety of percussion sounds and few musical notes. While some films prefer soaring John Williams themes, Greenwood's theme for ""Blood"" is one dissonant chord and a sound effect that can be best described as a more painful version of the THX sound system effect. It's harsh, but so is the film. Anderson makes every moment count whether it's when there's music or where he puts the camera.<br/><br/>To best describe the film in terms of people familiar with Anderson's work, it's his first film that truly translates to the interests of all dramatic film-lovers. It is distinctly his film, yet viewers will be able to grasp it much more easily than the abstract and obscure multiple storyline nature of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" For people new to his work, be prepared to feel some discomfort, but if you pay attention to the way the story is told, then you'll find the mastery of ""Blood."""

It wasn't available to see locally for a couple weeks and I unfortunately didn't check the reviews again before going to see it yesterday.

Then, out of nowhere, this horrible screeching violin tears into your head leaving you wondering ""what the hell was that all about?"". I figured it was setting something up for later in the film. The only purpose of that noise that I can figure is to give the film an eerie feel though it really only helped me to understand that this film wasn't put together properly.<br/><br/>Early on, Daniel basically adopted the young son of one of his men that died on the job showing a caring side of him but not much else happened.<br/><br/>I waited patiently for the film to progress and thought it was finally about to when Daniel commenced drilling on the land he purchased from the Sundays and the feud between Daniel and Eli started to develop. But, I saw their interactions as strange and misguided along with the plot at this point in the film.<br/><br/>I had a hard time trying to figure out how religion worked it's way into the plot especially when bad things started happening at the drilling site after Eli didn't get to bless the drilling. I thought religion was going to take over a bit at that point and the drilling was essentially cursed and doomed. Nothing ever happened with it though leaving me wonder what the point of introducing religion into the film was.<br/><br/>Daniel seemed to have good moments and bad moments at this point making me wonder if he was a good guy or a bad guy. He seems to care for HW after he hit his head but then runs off to see that the fire gets put out. He seems to console HW after losing his hearing but sends him off and goes about running his operation. I guess that people can have a good side and a bad side but it was strange seeing Daniel go back and forth being good and bad.<br/><br/>The scene where Daniel gets baptized is the only entertaining and funny thing in the entire movie but it's sort of awkward seeing how religious the towns people are and how religion was introduced earlier on in the film. I wondered where they were going to take religion in the film next.<br/><br/>Daniel goes off to see that the pipeline gets built and finds out that the man claiming to be his brother isn't actually his brother after negotiating the pipeline deal. He finds this out by going along with his ""brothers"" wishes to get drunk and get women to celebrate their pipeline deal. It seemed like Daniel wanted to see if his ""brother"" was going to show a greedy side to determine whether or not he was playing him for his money. His ""brother"" gets greedy asking for money for a prostitute and Daniel calls him on it finding out he was playing him all along. My problem with this is that anyone can have a desire to go get drunk and get women; including a real brother so I don't think this scene made any sense.<br/><br/>Daniel comes back and brings HW back and strangely tries to go on with business as usual like nothing really happened. He's a good guy again for bringing HW back after the hard work is completed but is a bad guy again for ignoring to nurture HW and failing to learn sign language so they can communicate with each other.<br/><br/>The film falls apart at the end when HW talks with Daniel and Daniel basically ignores and makes fun of him until HW mentions that he's starting his own oil company. Daniel goes off the deep end and pushes HW away in a very cruel way. The most ridiculous scene of the film is when Eli pays Daniel a visit out of nowhere asking for money. I had seen way more than enough up to this point and this scene left me hating myself for wasting my time and money to watch the film.<br/><br/>I tried hard to understand the films direction and purpose but really couldn't with how sloppy it was. It was pretty much all about Daniel and that's certainly nothing that anyone wants to see. Why would I want to see a sloppy story about a greedy oil man and his messed up life? I just don't get it.<br/><br/>Regarding the reviews, how could anyone possibly give this film a good review? You caused me to waste my time and money and I'm sure there are many more just like me.<br/><br/>I will say that Daniel Day Lewis' performance was good given the circumstances. His character, Daniel Plainview, was a not so good in a horrible film.<br/><br/>Go see No Country for Old Men if you want to see a good film. Hey, it doesn't even have music added to it and it certainly doesn't have a horrible screeching violin that tears into your head leaving you wondering ""what the hell was that all about?""."

","I was greatly disappointed by the film. While Daniel D. Lewis's acting is rather impressive, the rest of the movie is disappointing and it's not clear what the movie is about.<br/><br/>The screenplay is not cohesive - many scenes and facts are unexplained and don't make sense; Examples: the first ten minutes in which we see D.D.Lewis digging in a mining pit and injuring himself; Why does his son lose his speech despite the fact he only heart his hearing? Why does the son set the house on fire when Henry, the impostor brother appears? Why does Eli strike his father and how does this relate to the rest of the film? <br/><br/>The music was simply awful and was often irritating: squealing and screeching going on and on, repetitive noises, etc. In some scenes I felt as if the music was completely inadequate and taken from a cheap horror film.<br/><br/>I feel that the director focused on shooting beautiful shots and directing long, single shot scenes, but neglected the story underlying the movie and tying all pieces together. The film appears to be a combination of good parts that simply don't fit well together."

","Hi. How's everybody doing? I just saw 'There Will Be Blood' last night. I don't like the idea of spending my whole life on the internet on message boards discussing trivial aspects of pop culture, but I felt compelled to issue a warning about this film. Critics seem to like it. Oscar nomination folks gave it a nod. Even more so, the pseudo-critic/'we derive personal validation of our innate human desire for creation and creativity by attaching ourselves to the works of others like leeches"" folks really really liked it.<br/><br/>This movie is not good.<br/><br/>It may be compelling to a degree. The acting is fine. There isn't a story. Perhaps this lack of story is OK for the fact that regular life (at least based on my perspective created from my personal experiences) does not seem to have a nice little beginning/relevant conundrum/happy resolution format. I even applaud the director for trying to make a movie such as this and ""stretch"" our thinking. Its just that this movie failed at stretching anything other than my ability to believe people who review films and decide for us what is good.<br/><br/>My warning is for those who haven't seen this movie. Please go to the theater with an open mind. Make up your own mind. Decide for yourself whether or not you like this movie. Come back home. Sit at your computer for 30 minutes if you have to and think about the movie for yourself. THEN and only then, decide what it is that you think. Write it on this website. Tell the world what YOU think.<br/><br/>As a society, we have to get away from being sheep. If a movie makes an attempt at being art, then that is wonderful. If it fails, then that is fine. Good try. But, lets please not decide that something is good based on some sort of manufactured intellectualist solidarity. It hurts us all.<br/><br/>For me, I hope someday that i get my 3 hours back."

","I heard about the reviews for this movie and my husband and I set out for a good movie afternoon. The opening scene is a beautifully shot red rocky landscape with green hills and a stark blue sky, the soundtrack is not a soundtrack but a screeching sound reminiscent of fingernails on a blackboard. I nearly left then and should have. No plot, no female characters, Daniel's son is a wooden puppet who barely speaks and at times I held my hands over my ears to block out the horrible, excruciatingly loud, obnoxious soundtrack. It was so loud, much of the time you could not understand the actors. Now what's the point in that? I wondered why we came, then figured it out. <br/><br/>In a dark theater somewhere, filled with film critics this film was first shown. The most influential one of all sighed and said ""this is sooo good!"" He was referring to the popcorn, of course, but all the rest began repeating his comment, whispering it around the theater. The soundtrack should've been the song from ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" ! I'm so glad to see I'm not the only one who noticed how bad this movie really is. <br/><br/>I often rate a movie based on how much I cared about the main character. The main character in this film had no character. He was not worth watching for almost 3 excruciating hours. I guess I only stayed that long in the hope that something interesting would happen. I was so bored I nearly fell asleep except for the obnoxious noise that was substituted for a soundtrack. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
"the-flaming-hobo","1","103","209","10 February 2008"," There will be blood... eventually
","I haven't felt so strongly about a movie in a long while but then again ""There will be blood"" is something unique. I can without doubt classify this as the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of suffering through. It is I suppose possible that I somehow missed the aspects of the movie that others seem to have experienced as profound moments.<br/><br/>This film endeavours to be about so many different things (family, religion, oil etc) but manages to explore each so fleetingly that and in such a bizarre way that it leaves the audience bewildered. There was no dynamic to keep the story (or lack there of) moving forward, at times it felt like a seemingly random series of events with no connection whatsoever to the scenes pro them.<br/><br/>The music adds to the ruin that this movie is. While possibly enjoyable if observed out of context to the scene in which it is attached is atrocious in conjunction to the scene being observed. I recall a ten minute long scene with a hugely suspenseful score that provokes a reaction in the audience in a similar way that a horror or thriller movies score would, but instead of being justified the scene ends abruptly and the built up suspense slowly dissipates. This trend continues through out the movie.<br/><br/>Through out the movie scene changes are heralded by am almost 20 second sync of sound that distracts and complicates not only the current scene but the following one as well. In conjunction with this no consideration is paid to the audience as scene changes will often rapidly change from extended darkness to eye burning brightness.<br/><br/>What remains to be mentioned is the acting of this movie. It becomes apparent that the theme of this movie is to have the protagonists portrayed as out of this world batshit crazy (forgive the curse words but trust me it's accurate). If this was the director's intent then each respective actor has done a spectacular job. Eli in particular was frighteningly insane as the priest of the small church, as was Daniel to ward the closing moments of the movie.<br/><br/>In closing I would recommend steering well clear of this disaster of a movie, save your self the torment. At over two and a half of stagnant plot and meaningless scenes you will be clawing at your eyes in frustration. I can't help but think that the entire movie was a tortuously long build up to one huge joke, There will be blood...eventually."

","Let's start with an understatement. Overstatements enough all around. This wont be the first you read about this film - this will be comment 124453. Unfortunately you probably spent some money, and more importantly, a good deal of time to see what's all the fuss about.<br/><br/>Your reaction will be one of the three possible reactions to this film:<br/><br/>1) Everyone thinks this is excellent! So I officially think this is excellent too! Especially since I am into art-house, I can not afford to call this boring piece of sh*t a boring piece of sh*t.. I will just give it a 10 on IMDb and next get something Spanish with tits in it to cheer me up.<br/><br/>2) What's the fuss about?? This is a well done, well acted period piece that is worth my time if I would stumble upon it on a Wednesday night on TV.. It might make me go to bed late just to see where it goes. It has some freaky and unrealistic stuff in it (DDL stuffing the priests face with mud for no apparent reason? among others) but hey, they took the money and effort to re-enact the time period and set a slightly boring drama. 3 drops of blood will be involved in the very last scene. Ow sorry, spoilered anything there? :P The DDL that we knew from Gangs Of New York was asked to change nothing except costume and give it a go, gang leader and oil baron is basically the same ballpark anyway.<br/><br/>3) The world has gone mad. DDL does an OK job, yeah alright, but does he save this little paper ship filled with heavy pretensions not to sink? No way! WTF is this film trying to tell us (me) ? It has NO character development AT ALL, which is pretty amazing for a piece that stretches over decades. Characters are defined from the beginning, and from there on static. Not exciting to watch them go around their unpleasant business for a few hours. (If they were even more unpleasant that might be the case, but it's all within limits, very decent middle-of-the-road unpleasantness) The few interesting bits are far apart, and exactly those are far-fetched. We have the ""healing priest"" guy, having those Texan (or what are they) farmers believe whatever he wants.. Farmers are usually the ""wanna see first believe you then"" type. Ah well I dunno, in Texas they might be like that :P But then the bit where DDL stuffs mud in the priests mouth for no reason at all! And slaps him around a bit! Interesting scene, maybe the best, but again.. WTF? There is no notion in the film that would explain this or whatever leads to it.<br/><br/>And then we have the ending.. OK it IS nice, and well acted and all.. But it is f*cking ridiculous! I would welcome it in any film with a comical undertone.. But for this film that has been taken /taking itself so very serious, it makes no sense at all! DDL is victorious in the end, and confronts his longtime enemy with his victory.. and then instead of savouring it, he kills him off in (again) a mad unprovoked rage! well i can go on but i wont, bless you all :) i liked magnolia though.. that wasn't realistic, but didn't pretend to be either. and it managed to convey the sentiment it tried to.<br/><br/>god i hope this will plummet some more in the ratings... but i am afraid that generations to come will check the IMDb top 250, see this scoring a 9, download it, and then decide that us ""oldies"" have no taste whatso-ever and just go get the newest pulp crap.<br/><br/>thank you all pretentious farts for acting like you actually enjoyed this film. my children will benefit huge improvements in reaction speed for playing more games and watching less movies."

","Daniel Day-Lewis, as always, does a fantastic job with his character. As for the rest of the movie, it was pretty hard to sit through. Let me comment on this as someone who likes to go to a movie to be entertained and not as someone who goes to movie so that I can comment on the editing or lighting styles. From an entertainment standpoint, this is borderline at best. The story moves very slowly, and transitions randomly and suddenly in 9 and 16 year jumps. It takes 10 minutes before any dialogue is spoken. Huh? As I stated, I'm not one to notice things like filming techniques or lighting. The background music in this movie, however, is atrocious. I knew there was a problem by the simple fact that I noticed it. The music's style throughout the movie is confusing and inappropriate. It is obvious that the director and the composer LOVE to use the violin to induce tension. The problem was, this happened during scenes where there was no tension or suspense.<br/><br/>I'm sure the ""art"" in this movie is superb, and my inartistic eye can't catch it. However, if you want to sit down and enjoy yourself, try something else."
"homoplasmate-1","3","72","143","28 February 2008"," One Hand Clapping
","Being a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, my expectations were high for this flick, but alas, it did not deliver. Brilliantly directed by Anderson, with a phenomenal central performance by Daniel Day Lewis, I think the problem with the film is at a fundamental and conceptual level. The work is ambitiously themed, but Anderson hasn't taken the timeor perhaps didn't have the desireto draw us into the story or the characters. Magnolia was an epic, ambitious work also, but it was on a human scale, and Anderson never seemed to be reaching for his effects. There Will Be Blood is another matter: it's all reaching, but it comes back empty-handed. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel, the film tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview, a man without substance, and apparently without heart or soul, driven by mysterious forces (forces that are never revealed), whose only passion is for oil. Plainview doesn't appear to be all that interested in profit, even, and although he is a ruthless businessman, the impression the film gives is that this is more a point of principle than actual greed. We are never given a clue as to what might be behind such a principle, however, or behind the character's stubborn, almost inhuman drive.<br/><br/>The trouble with There Will Be Blood is that, if you place a hollow man at the center of your movie, you are likely to wind up with a hollow movie. Daniel Day Lewis carries the film on his sinewy shoulders, and he keeps us gripped by the sheer magnetism of his presence; but the script doesn't provide much context for his performance, and the character seems to be almost entirely the actor's creation. Long as the film is (158 minutes), Anderson doesn't use the time to establish his characters, or appear to care about building suspense. He seems to consider such conventions beneath him, and the result is fuzzy, muted, shapeless and meandering. Individual scenes are often strongthe film is gorgeously photographedand there's certainly a dark poetry and lyricism to the film; but because there's no central thread to tie the scenes together, and without much narrative or character drive, the various episodes just hang in a void. Since we have no clue as to what drives the central character, there is nothing to drive the scenes forward either. Violent confrontationsbetween Plainview and the preacher, Ely, between Ely and his father, and the final murdershould be intensely disturbing but somehow fail to move us. Anderson doesn't make us feel the tensions that lead up to these scenes, so they appear to come out of nowhere; they seem overwrought, faintly ludicrous. Inside such a dramatic vacuum, Lewis' performanceintense as it isbecomes often blackly amusing: Plainview seems not only psychotic but absurd. Yet we can't tell if he's meant to seem that way or not. For such a bleak and violent work, Blood is almost devoid of tension. And for all the care that has gone into the film's look, and despite the central performance, it's rather slack, even tedious. It's clear Anderson is aiming for something big, but I think the ambitiousness of his concepts has undone him (though this is presumably why the film is being praised so extravagantly). He's trying to paint the portrait of a soulless man, driven by greed or unfathomable obsession, whose complete lack of feeling for anyone or anything besides oil turns him, by steady degrees, into a psychopath. And he's probably aiming at a parable for our times, in which insane corporate greed strips the Earth of its blood and man of his soul. But the film may be too finely conceived: Anderson has forgotten to take the trouble to draw us into the story and make it dramatic, meaningful, and what's on the screen are his lofty intentions, but not much of a movie. There Will Be Blood left me entirely cold. I felt nothing for the characters, and besides Plainview there are no characters, really. There is the preacher Ely, who is faintly despicable but otherwise less than substantial, and Plainview's son, who barely says a dozen words throughout the film. The rest are shadows, and Anderson seems to have intended it this way (he has cast the film almost entirely with unknowns). And although Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing throughout, there is only one scene which gives us a glimpse of what is going on inside Plainview and allows us to see him as a human being (the scene when he admits to hating people). Mostly, he seems like some relentless force of nature, a golem, driven by sheer hatred. But there's nothing to account for this hatred: like everything else in the film, it seems to exist in a void. There Will Be Blood is a tale told by a genius, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Critics may beg to differ, but if so, I suspect they are responding to the film's intentions more than what it actually achieves. Since Anderson's film appears to be about something, even though it never connects with us emotionally, it's being treated with awe and reverence (with repeat comparisons to Citizen Kane). But I think this is Anderson's weakest film, and except for one or two scenes (such as when Plainview's son is deafened in a rigging accident), it's almost entirely lacking in the compassion, the humanity, which made his previous films so remarkable. There Will Be Blood appears to be a case of a filmmaker getting carried away by the grandiosity of his vision, being too busy mapping the forest to remember to plant the trees. It's the sound of one hand clapping."
"reinbeauchaser-1","1","94","191","18 January 2008"," Where's the Plot?
","I am extremely disappointed. My son and I probably saw the most boring, plot-free movie ever in There Will Be Blood. Don't believe the critics; I'm certain they were paid off by the industry or worked on the film itself. Dialogue was meager at best (the first thirty minutes nary a word said, but the music was near deafening!). The character development was stale and uninspiring - save for that cult preacher; at least he was entertaining. Quite honestly, I didn't see any point at all to the movie and my son and I waited it out, hoping to see even a small sliver of reason why this movie received such high marks. The only thing that stood out for me was that maybe it was an allegorical tale about greed.<br/><br/>Seriously, we were scratching our head, trying to figure out why they titled it so and the only thing we could come up with is this <br/><br/>---------SPOILER ALERTS-----------<br/><br/>At the very end, we finally see blood. There Will Be Blood - at the end; get it? I think the industry pulled a fast one, if you ask me. Ha ha, I get it...but I wished I hadn't seen it.<br/><br/>There were many opportunities to justify the R rating, but none qualified, other than that pool of blood under the cult preacher's head. I've seen more blood (and gore) on CSI than this movie ever provided during its 2:45 hour snail race, not that my reasons for seeing it was to see blood, but - yeah, pointless.<br/><br/>In summary, TWBB was a shameless raping of our finances, plain and simple. Strong words? Yep, but so's my son's and my dislike for this 2 hour and 45 minute waste of time. I can't believe that Screenit.com's critic gave it 8 out of 10 stars and that people are talking about it and the 2008 Oscars in the same breath. Yes, Daniel Day Lewis did a fairly good job, but his win would be the only one even remotely deserving, that is IF he takes the trophy home next year. Anyway, I'd have rather seen Alvin and the Chipmunks - or that Veggie Tale Pirate Movie - than this poor excuse for entertainment. A classic it will not be!"
"rbischoff","4","40","75","23 February 2008"," Disappointment of a lifetime
","Just came from the theater and I have to say that my confidence in IMDb as a useful rating source has seriously eroded. Incredibly, more than 51% of over 28,000 voters rated this movie a 10! I've been viewing movies for more than 50 years and this one is by far the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced.<br/><br/>This from someone, mind you, who thinks very highly of P.T. Anderson! I consider Magnolia one of the finest movies ever made (underrated at IMDb) and I'm also a big fan of Boogie Nights, many scenes of which remain indelibly in my mind after a single viewing many years ago. But nearly everything about TWBB is wrong, wrong, wrong. The only element that worked at all was Daniel Day-Lewis, who added yet another brilliant performance to his portfolio.<br/><br/>Where to start my critique? Well, first of all, Upton Sinclair must not only be turning over in his grave but vomiting up everything he ever ate. It's sacrilege for P.T. to claim that his screenplay is based on, or even suggested by, Sinclair's novel Oil! After reading Sinclair's work a couple of weeks ago, I can tell you that only a handful of truly superficial elements made it into the screenplay. Loved the novel, hated the movie. P.T. made no attempt whatsoever to adapt the novel. It's a travesty for the Academy to have nominated his screenplay in the ""based on material previously published"" category. Especially if you contrast it with Atonement--an extremely faithful and successful adaptation of Ian McEwan's outstanding novel.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BEGIN HERE: Sinclair's novel is an engaging diatribe against capitalism involving two major themes. First, that unregulated capitalists can amass enough money/power to purchase and subvert supposedly populist governments. He wrote Oil! in 1927, just after the Teapot Dome Scandal of the Harding administration, and much of the book is a thinly veiled roman a clef that expresses his outrage over that affair. The other major theme is the rebellion of labor against rampant capitalists, through unionism and fledgling socialist and communist movements in the USA and via actual government takeover by the Bolsheviks in Russia, which had just happened in 1917 and was still playing itself out on the world stage.<br/><br/>The Day-Lewis character in the book was in fact a very successful, mid-level businessman who specialized in drilling for oil (an oil operator, in other words). He was good at making sharp deals and at bribing officials at all levels of government to gain favorable treatment. He was not, however, a crazed murderer, or even a murderer at all! In fact, he tended to treat his employees better than most of his contemporaries.<br/><br/>His son, called Bunny, was actually his son, not an orphan (the mother was separated), who remained very close to his father throughout his life. He was never deaf. Bunny was a major character and the overall narrator of the novel. Paul was another major character. He was an extremely principled and well-read do-gooder and labor organizer whom Bunny highly admired. He was not, as P.T. would have it, someone who would sell out his family for the proverbial thirty pieces of silver ($500.) <br/><br/>Overall, Sinclair's novel richly characterizes a multitude of players and epicly describes the sociological forces that drive them. The movie, by comparison, is pitifully small and petty, with players depicted as inherently evil but with little motivation for being so.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on about differences. In reality, the only way I can understand how such a disaster as TWBB could have come about is to imagine that P.T. was on crack when he read the novel and/or when he wrote the screenplay. He and I certainly didn't read the same work--the novel by Upton Sinclair! Of course that may not matter to most viewers. I am guessing that less than one in 500 of you might actually read, or have read, Sinclair's novel. The crushing disappointment for me is how such an incredibly talented director could have spent so much time and money to make such a miserable movie from such a great book.<br/><br/>Even when I try to judge the movie for itself instead of for what it could have been there are numerous things I hate about it. The music, for instance, is terrible. And I normally find most musical scores to be excellent. But in TWBB, P.T. is apparently going for some sense of tragic doom, which is highly inappropriate and ultimately annoying, particularly when devoid of any character motivation. Then there's the editing, which I found tediously long in shot after shot. The movie just drags, and for no valid reason.<br/><br/>And there's the science of oil drilling, which P.T. gets completely wrong, apparently on purpose, since it is perfectly described in Sinclair's novel (not to mention that he could have easily hired a technical consultant had he wished to get it right.) I'm talking about basic stuff here, not anything esoteric. Most egregious is the depiction of drilling as piledriving--lifting and dropping a bar. As the novel so clearly states, drilling is just that--drilling. It's accomplished by rotating a bit, just like you would with a hand drill, but on a larger scale. Arrgh--how do such changes make any sense? <br/><br/>If you don't agree with my review, I would ask that you reserve judgment until you: (1) read Sinclair's novel Oil!, (2) imagine that Clint Eastwood had spent the same amount of time and money as P.T. did to adapt it, and (3) compare your imagined Eastwood adaptation to the actual TWBB. <br/><br/>Oh, to think what might have been! Please, P.T., go back to your original screenplays and leave adaptations to those more willing to sublimate their egos."

","People, please! The 18th greatest film of all-time? are you serious??! It seems to me that almost everyone has been sucked into the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' 'performance of the decade' which is, admittedly, at times captivating and menacing, but also at other times horribly over-acted (see the cringe-worthy baptism scene and pointless ending). If this is a film about one man's descent into mental illness and moral collapse, then director Paul Thomas Anderson has made a terrible hash of it. If not, then could someone please explain what the plot of this film is? It seems to me to be a disjointed assembly of loosely-connected events that do nothing to progress the story-telling process or enhance the viewer's association with the characters. And what about the characters? We have Day-Lewis' charming, ruthless and unstable Daniel Plainview, and......that's about it. The only other notable member of the 'supporting cast' was the corrupt preacher Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. However other than serving as a frequent annoyance to Plainview - who inevitably dispatches of him - i failed to decipher the relevance of their relationship. Plainview's son, H.W. became a complete nonentity after his accident and no effort was made to develop or explain father and son's deteriorating relationship. In fact, no real effort was made to explain Plainview's personal deterioration either, leaving me with a total sense of disaffection with everyone and anyone in the film.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is slow-paced, no doubt about that - the opening scenes are dialogue-less for about 30 minutes and i regularly found myself urging the next scene, desperately vying for the picture to burst into life. It never did, and ends with a gratuitous and meaningless clash between Plainview and Eli Sunday which left everyone i was with unsatisfied and confused - where had this masterpiece gone? did i just miss the film of the decade? No, because it never was and never will be.<br/><br/>I'll concede, the film contains some meticulous set-detail, and the cinematography is beautifully precise. Even the score, which i believe some people have criticised, i found to be interesting and suspenseful. It's just that the suspense is never fulfilled, interest never ignited.<br/><br/>In the end, There Will Be Blood and the hype surrounding it, comes crashing down like Plainview's first oil derrick.<br/><br/>6/10"

There was no cohesiveness, no continuity, just a series of loosely tied together scenes about people who are not interesting, compelling, or sympathetic in any way. DDL over-acted his way through the film with an unrealistic accent for the time, place, and character. I felt like he was screaming, ""Look at me: I'm ACTING!"" I was very disappointed with all aspects of this film, and for the first time ever, was tempted to walk out of the theater before it was over. ""I'm finished"" was a welcome relief, because it expressed my sentiments exactly."

","This is the worse movie I have ever seen, and that includes Show Girls. Boring, overacted, irritating loud music, and a pointless plot. None of the characters were defined, let alone likable. I kept thinking that eventually something interesting was going to happen but it never did. I am very glad I had free movie tickets because I never would have spent money to see this stinker! Looks like all the hype for this movie is to ensure Daniel Day Lewis gets the best actor award. Don't listen to the critics! This movie was terrible!!

","I checked the spoiler box though I don't have any real spoilers.<br/><br/>I've never written here before but I just have to with this film. I am a huge Daniel Day Lewis fan. I re-watched most of his movies before seeing TWBB just to get ready for it.<br/><br/>Well, I was so disappointed. Not by DDL, of course he does a wonderful job, but the movie itself held nothing for me. Its been over a week since I saw it and I guess it succeeded in having me think about it. I keep thinking, why is this getting such good reviews? Am I missing something? The entire time I was watching the movie I felt horribly uncomfortable and just itching for something to happen. I actually enjoyed the music score (love Radiohead) and some of the scenes were visually pleasing. Like others have said the music made you think, ooh foreshadowing...or this is going somewhere. But it never really seemed to get there.<br/><br/>The end was painful to me...should of been shorter. Some of the lines were great...and I enjoyed DDL's voice. I honestly enjoyed watching the trailer a hundred times more than seeing the movie.<br/><br/>I keep reading that the ending is shocking...but I fail to see the shock factor. I assume I must of missed something. I have to say the movie kept my interest solely because i kept thinking...its all going to be worth it in the end? Nope, not for me.<br/><br/>I typically do not mind long movies and the beginning with no dialog did not bother me one bit..I think my biggest problem with the movie was just the feeling that it went on forever and never really went anywhere. I might of gotten my expectations up too high with reading positive reviews and loving anything with DDL.<br/><br/>See...even in writing a review of the film my words just go on and on leading nowhere."

","To be honest, this movie deserves more than a one star, but I gave it one star anyways as I see more than what's wrong with this movie but pop culture in general in today's world.<br/><br/>This is a movie that's solely about a man's obsession, to the point of perversion.<br/><br/>The director used a very simple trick. He created a monster that defies all valid social context but somehow thrived and survived against all odds. The movie's minimalistic presentation gives an impression of authenticity and realism, yet you have a character that's unrealistic to a comical extend.<br/><br/>There's this man who hate, distrust and despise everyone, yet he confront them constantly as he wishes to prove and validate something he believes to be non existence to begin with. From there, all manners of confusion and oddity arise. A man who had everything easily obtainable yet often frustrated and angry as if life has been depriving him of opportunities. Talking about not making sense! He's more cynical than the Satan himself. Thank God that he's been occupied by all these oil business. Otherwise, he would make a perfect serial killer.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes have no dialogs. We are presented with this character that comes off as very little human like, and he persisted to be that way through out the whole film. Once he started talking, he's all of a sudden a man of great persuasion skills, oozes with will power and determination, and some kind of unapologetic charisma. He's an opportunist, cold and calculated. Yet he comes off to be extremely emotional and are set off by the slightest detection of insincerity. When you fuse all these contradictory personalities into one man, you would end up with a Picasso piece, a monstrosity of a character that's devoid of any real human qualities that you can relate to. For those who can't see through all these trickery are easily taken by the bold style and brute force. For me, it's a disaster.<br/><br/>The music is as nonsensical, menacing and crude as the character. It is there to built tension when there's actually little or nothing happening on the screen, just like the scrutinizing cold stare of Daniel Day Lewis, it offends and provokes with little or no reason.<br/><br/>The whole thing may very well work for those who are easily manipulated, as it can be witnessed here. Beyond the facade of cinematic trickeries that feeds off the fear and bewilderment of audience, there's nothing of substance here. Same can be said about ""No Country For Old Man"". It is a trend of directory style that's heavy on niche trickery, very little on character development. Because they believe that you don't need to understand the character, you just to be overwhelmed by it. It is indeed becoming a trend, spreading at an alarming rate. Before long, the screen will be filled with psychopath with very little human like qualities. I fear the worst, when those characters are to be admired and imitated by the feeble minded, and hyped by the spineless."

","In Europe they consider the novel a nineteenth century device, and they wonder why we Americans are still obsessed with the narrative format. The novel was displaced in the 20th century, by ideas, arguments and essays. But here we are in 2008 still noodling with stories. And in the absence of artists who know where to productively lead cinema, film-novels have been artificially raised to high importance, and film 'novelists' to similar esteem: Lars von Trier (after Dogme 95), Scorcese (lately) and with this movie Paul Thomas Anderson. Their approach holds very little appeal for me, as I have to sit through an hour or two of these completely obvious movies without any real ideas being put into play; without being asked to consider anything substantive.<br/><br/>America is a culture which elevates individualism (for which stardom is the perfect emblem) to a freakish cult. I'm not one to gush over stars, and I don't agree that showy Method performances are the greatest thing in film today, but film aesthetes just love a grandiose, acting showcase. Here Daniel Day Lewis becomes the next to secure rave reviews by cranking up the Method machinery. The trick is getting old, but audiences, critics and industry people can't imagine what might dethrone it. Lewis as Daniel Plainview appears to be doing a showy impression of Walter Pidgeon for most of the movie. And because we're all familiar with Lewis from the big scorecard of great contemporary actors, we can compare how different the role is from the actor himself and say intelligent things like: ""Wow. Isn't Walter Pidgeon not at all like Daniel Day Lewis?"" and conclude therefore that we must be watching a great performance. But in 20 years Daniel Day Lewis will have ceased being a going concern, and new audiences will be asking each other ""Why did people think this movie was important?"" with puzzled looks on their faces. His performance will eventually have about as much meaning as Warner Baxter's performance in 'In Old Arizona' does today. Oh... you haven't seen that? He won the Oscar! Well how about George Bancroft in 'Thunderbolt.' Come on... you missed that one too? How can you talk about greatness when you've missed two of 1929's major contenders? They're this movies best context.<br/><br/>'Blood' pads every shot with 60 percent dead air. There's no narrative reason to do so, or for this movie to be almost three hours long. If you had to summarize the story for someone waiting for you outside the theater, it might take you ten minutes... tops. It is without embellishment. It is the most arid, non-complex three hour movie ever made. Only the silence and the violence distinguish it from movies made in 1929. Sadly, ""obvious"" is the new ""brilliant.""<br/><br/>The startlingly amateur & miscast Paul Dano plays the second annoying role here. The two beatings he receives provide the films sole interesting moments. I'd gladly trade three hours of tasteful restraint masquerading as art, for twenty minutes of intelligence, passion or creativity. Again, the logic seems to be ""If it's three hours long, it must be art."" Just because a movie isn't over-produced doesn't mean it's not over-inflated. This is a sermon."

","This movie was horrible. Absolutely so far off the themes of the novel OIL! by Upton Sinclair. I can't even begin to explain what a letdown this trash is. Evidently Hollywood is still unable to effectively tackle the struggle of Communism vs. Capitalism, even as portrayed by a well-known and respected socialist/liberal like Upton Sinclair. Most people will have not read the novel but let me just state the following: The son, H.W. (know as Bunny in the book) is Plainfield's real son and he never goes deaf. He is not an orphan and sees his mother regularly. The father, again Plainfield, does not kill anyone in cold blood. Eli doesn't play a major role in anything, the son is never sent away. The father and son don't fight. Plainfield is not an evil man, but a prosperous capitalist who cares about his workers, the lives of them and their families and so on, because it is in his best interest. Bunny, is a communist/socialist/union sympathizer who spends his fathers money bailing out his socialist, pro-union, and communist friends, skipping classes at the private college he attends, and having sex with movie stars and other wealthy women. That is just a taste of how far out the movie is from the book... Again, this is a horrible movie that took parts, very vaguely, from a great book and turned them into crap that over-glorifies evil and death and ties them to oil for the sake of protesting modern times.

","I went into this film not really knowing anything about it (apart from Daniel Day-Lewis winning the Oscar). And I left without really knowing anything about it.<br/><br/>The film starts with a fairly long segment without any dialogue, which actually I thought was quite good. A brave move in this modern day, and one which I think worked. I couldn't quite work out why the central character was mining for silver one day, then suddenly drilling for oil, but that's immaterial.<br/><br/>The second act (after DDL has adopted the son of a dead worker, for what one would imagine are altruistic reasons) involves the mining of oil in a small Northern California town. Again, this worked pretty well - going to the town, buying up drilling rights from the townsfolk by conning them etc. Then HW (the central character's adopted son) is made deaf in an accident, and suddenly the film changes direction.<br/><br/>Most of the second half of the film is confused, and in the end pointless. One minute you feel sorry for the central character, having to send his son (whom he clearly cares for) away to school. The next he doesn't seem to care about anyone but himself.<br/><br/>The whole ""long lost brother"" subplot could have been excised from the film without any real loss to the story. In fact, most of the last half of the film could have been lost, and this would have been a better film.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original book on which the film is based, but I assume it is a character piece, with several vignettes in the life of the central character. On film, this just didn't work.<br/><br/>If you are convinced to go and see this film, take a cushion, as it is overtly long. 3 / 10 mainly because the central performance is so riveting."

","I'd be so tempted to give this movie a one, just because i want to even out the ridiculously overrated ratings in IMDb. However i wanna be fair to say that there are a few redeeming moments in the movie. having said that, i truly believed this movie could have been somewhere if it were handled by a capable director with a true vision. Too bad it is misdirected and the acting choices are baffling (what's up with the accent yo?), the writing were lifeless and it sucked the humanity out of all the characters (even the extras don't look that convincing), the photography and lighting is alright, although outdated and cliché (ooh the brooding character is in the dark and the good ones is in the light), last but not least is the score, helmed by radiohead's johnny greenwood, that could single handedly ruin the movie if everything else in the movie was well done. It was distracting, instead of creating a layer of nuance and emotion, it created just plain annoyance. A score should elevate and compliment a movie, not jump away from it. And because i read that the radiohead guy was gonna do the score before i saw it, i immediately was worried it's gonna stand out too much. And it did.<br/><br/>And then there's the length. At mere three hours you would think you would get a kick-ass character developments, but what you get is just crazy characters getting crazier without delving much into their emotional complexity, it fell very cartoonish much like the tom cruise character in magnolia. and i wish the ending is raining frogs but instead we're treated to a cheap flash forward and a puddle of of blood.

","I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was ""Oil"" because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is very good. I take nothing from his performance as Oil man Daniel Plainview who starts from nothing and ultimately creates an empire at no expense including his own sanity in the end. Considering his character arc covers many years and many different situations, he does a terrific job. Its just the fact that there isn't any real plot or point to the three hour film to help support him. He definitely is the focus of the film despite a small supporting cast. The only other stand out performance is that of Paul Dano, a very gifted actor coming from an awesome role in Little Miss Sunshine. His over the top, bursting performance as religious fanatic and 'healer' Eli Sunday is really something. Its comical in this dark and disturbing way. However the previews of this film imply some sort of great battle of wits between Sunday and Plainview which never happens. Instead Eli Sunday is like an annoying little bug which Plainview swats repeatedly. Dillon Freasier also does a decent job as young H.W. Plainview, who is learning the business from his father until an accident takes his hearing. Its a subtle and quiet performance but he does well.<br/><br/>So you have these good performances, why did I dislike this movie? It is truly uneventful. I mean watching the Oil fields and the events surrounding drilling and making money is very captivating...for 30 maybe 40 minutes...but NOTHING else happens. Its the same for three hours! And then when all is said and done we have this emotional blow out between father and son after years of being apart and then the end of the film is so downright stupid and ludicrous, it just literally made me shake my head. In some ways it was the perfect ending to a film that was just a waste. I DO believe the film makers purposely mislead the general public to believe that this film is about this bloody battle between and Oil Driller and a preacher when it has nothing at all to do with that. I can't agree with anyone on this and seeing the words ""astounding, gory, disturbing"" in people's reviews make me say ""What the hell were you all watching?"" I literally had to fight to keep my eyes open. But to each their own...that's the beauty of art but for me this Academy Awards is shaping out to be a big disappointment. 4/10"

","If many of the comments here are to be believed then ""There Will Be Blood"" is an over-long and purposeless mess, but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. The story of Daniel Plainview's rise to power as an oil magnate in the early part of the 20th Century and his running conflict with the tub-thumping preacher Eli Sunday is a timely and incisive examination of one of the battle's that lie at the heart of modern America and exerts a strong influence to this day over the way that nation shapes both itself and the world around it. Essentially what the film examines is the battle between capitalism and the church for influence and power. Plainview represents the oil industry/capitalism and the obsessive greed and Darwinian competition that drives that system. His name is in fact at odds with his personality. On the surface he certainly seems a reasonable - even charming man - who tells it the way it is, but this masks the fact that he is actually little more than driven sociopath and exploiter of both his workers and the penniless farmers he buys his oil rich land from. He is motivated not by a regard for people (whom he admits to his ""brother"" he hates) or even family (his own son is discarded when his deafness undermines his usefulness and the arrival of Plainview's brother seems to provide a more viable familial substitute) - instead it is the desire to succeed and make money at the expense of others that really drives him. Indeed when offered a the chance to become a millionaire by speculators who wish to buy his operation Plainview refuses because he would not know what to do if he did not have his business to run. The search for profit is for him an existential issue - the thing that makes him what he is - and yet his inability to see any use beyond his business for that profit hints at a kind of built in madness in his brand of capitalism/the American Dream - an ultimate lack of deeper purpose bound to lead to pain and self destruction. In the hands of men like Plainview big business is a ravening beast caught in a blind and vicious circle of consumption, exploitation and expansion.<br/><br/>On some levels the film's title seems to refer to the inevitability of this man (and the system he symbolises) committing horrible acts of violence. Certainly Day-Lewis presents Plainview as a man constantly struggling with his own psychopathic tendencies - his performance is run through with a terrifying undercurrent of violence and rage which seems to bubble just beneath the surface. The main question in the audience's mind here is not whether this man will become a killer, but when this will happen. Indeed, the film's ending confirms this by offering closure at the point that Plainview brutally murders Eli Sunday with bowling paraphernalia - his and the film's final line being ""I'm, finished."" Like the title it is a loaded phrase - Plainview's/Anderson's narrative is at an end, Plainview's life may well be over when the murder is discovered, but perhaps most significantly the line hints at the idea that Plainview is now completed - has finished his journey by becoming the brutal killer that he has threatened to be throughout the film.<br/><br/>Of course if one looks beyond the surface character then the film offers a wealth of less than flattering commentary on the nature of the capitalist system Plainview embodies. Through the character a portrait is painted of an utterly brutal and self-serving system which sacrifices humanity for cold hard cash - and as such is itself sociopathic and utterly lost in moral terms.<br/><br/>The church fares little better through its representative - Eli Sunday whose crazed rantings before his congregation of desperate and poverty stricken parishioners do little to endear him to the audience. He is also depicted as utterly greedy and exploitative himself. Throughout the film he seeks to use his connections with Plainview as a way to extract money from him - ostensibly for his church but, we feel, really for him. Indeed it is this greed - the sense that in fact the Christian church in the US is itself more motivated by devotion to Mamon than Christ - which ultimately leads to Sunday's demise at the hands of Plainview as he returns to the oil magnate in an attempt to wring more money from him and get him to pay up for the $5000 which Plainview has owed him for what must be decades. The film's bleak ending leaves us with the sense that if anyone has won the battle at the heart of the film (America) it is capitalism, but in the process it has become difficult to distinguish business from church. Both seem motivated by greed are led by mad men and operate on a kind of blind faith which has resulted in them completely losing their way in human terms.<br/><br/>Given we live in a world where oil and religion are two of the biggest forces shaping our world (and hardly for the better given current realities) ""There Will Be Blood"" has to be one of the most relevant films around."
"bhamm05","1","32","60","11 January 2009"," A Sad misfire for an otherwise talented group...
","I think one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes said it best when describing this film: ""If you want to be a movie snob this year, this is the one to say you've enjoyed. If you want to be entertained, this is the movie to avoid."" I want to start off by saying that I think Paul Thomas Anderson is a wonderful talent. He made great films in Boogie Nights and Magnolia, and made a wonderful attempt with Punch Drunk Love. This film, however, misses the mark in a profound way. I gave it only one star largely because the film fails to achieve anything it sets out to do.<br/><br/>I see comments from reviewers on IMDb talking about the wonderful character that Daniel Day-Lewis has created, but I see nothing more than your garden variety sociopath. Day-Lewis is a fine actor, but here he appears to simply be performing a Bill the Butcher retread, and the character is sadly overacted. Perhaps it is blasphemy to talk of this much-heralded actor performing at anything less than Oscar caliber, but I simply found myself struggling to believe this role several times during the film. (most notably the baptism, the scene is unintentionally comical) As for the film itself, the pacing is incredibly poor, the plot is weak and disjointed, the character development is almost completely absent, and the script is simply uninteresting. The film wants so badly to be unique and clever, but sadly ends up eccentric for eccentric sake.<br/><br/>Admittedly part of the reason I gave this film only one star is the praise the film has received, from both critics and misguided viewers. This is a film that picks up steam from a critical standpoint, and viewers feel obliged to mirror the sentiment. In this case, the idea that this is a masterpiece (to any degree), is simply laughable.<br/><br/>My guess is that if you were to ask your most pretentious friend what they thought of this film, they will tell you of its brilliance. If you were to ask your most honest friend, they will tell you it bored and irritated them, whilst stealing nearly 3 hours of their life, without hope of return.<br/><br/>One last note is the score to this film. Some - again - found it inspired and the stuff of legend. For me, it was one of the most grating and frustrating parts of the film. I think I have an idea of what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish here, but instead they simply destroy even more of the film's potential coherence."

","I've heard 'There Will Be Blood' described as a portrait of an unlikable man. Sadly that also makes the movie itself completely unlikable. It's beautifully framed and Daniel Day-Lewis is undoubtedly a consummate actor, however, as a piece of entertainment 'Blood' is weaker than water. It is ponderous, portentous and overly self-important. Other than the son and his wife who we hardly see, there are no characters to like or relate to. The scenery is repetitive and bleak, the colours are monotonous. The film drags along like an overly long opera  or an epic funeral dirge. Which brings me to the award for the worst score ever. OK, I'm sure there are worse, but this movie contained some of the most annoying, inappropriate and ill-timed 'music' I've ever heard. From headache inducing modern classical  which mainly seemed to consist of murdering the entire string section, to something I could only describe as horror suspense with detuned orchestral stabs usually reserved for budget slashers. It was like I was watching the wrong soundtrack - none of what I was hearing seemed to fit with what I was seeing. If you plan to watch this at the theatre, take your ipod and crank it up, otherwise wait for the DVD and hit mute. You won't miss much and your ears will thank you for it.

It is extremely honed so that every horse is hitched to the same plow, so that power is achieved.<br/><br/>It isn't because we don't marvel at the actorly gymnastics of Day Lewis. Its because it doesn't matter. I will truly forget this film in the sense that none of it will change me, indirectly lead me somewhere or trick me into some discovery. In preparation for this, I saw ""Siberiade,"" another oildrilling epic where kinship is central and the drive to the earth is a retreat.<br/><br/>(The ""blood"" in the title is associated with family, not weeping veins.)<br/><br/>Elements of that Soviet film will stick with me forever, though the film has less explosive emotion. (It does have a far more dramatic oilrig fire  real instead of from ILM. And it has teasingly seductive songs, not the edgy, spineraising tension of here.)<br/><br/>The one element that should have grabbed me was undeveloped. Here is a man who we see is broken. There are no events to follow. He becomes a success and remains broken. The only story for us to seek is why. We know he had peculiar feelings for his sister and left home traumatically. That he prefers isolation of the most remote kind. That given any opening for bond, for blood: HW, the discovered brother, the child Mary, he will grab it with both hands and look for disappointment.<br/><br/>We know going in that the business of twins appeared only late, but it could have been central to this mystery of sucking and discarding both blood and oil. I really thought Anderson would exploit this ambiguity of identity. After all, he's made one and a half of the very best films which explores this. Films that are multilayered and reach out and penetrate instead of a barrelling locomotive.<br/><br/>So.<br/><br/>I would ask you to differentiate. First differentiate rubbernecking over a disaster from exploring and knowing a dangerous situation. Second, differentiate masterful storytelling from stories that have their own lives and catch fire in your heart.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

I'm actually surprised that a sign didn't flash up before the credits saying ""HAHA, jokes on you, we just wasted 3 hours of your life, and you paid money to do it! This movie was the result of some over idealistic, closet protester deciding to make a movie about the status quo the world has seen over the past 150 years. Despite the wars, disasters and change, one thing has remained the same: Religion and oil rape the poor, protect the rich, and occasionally cross paths resulting in disastrous consequences (cough, IRAQ WAR!!!, cough). That is pretty much the core message of this movie.<br/><br/>My suggestion to the writers of trash like this would be: Balls up, get some gumption about you, and actually write a movie about the message you are trying to get across.

","I wanted this movie to be good... I really did. But, it's really bad folks... The character development is weak, there is intense/foreshadowing music and then nothing happens... (I think because they needed to fill the time block allocated to this movie) For a while, I didn't know if the lead character was good or bad - I respected his entrepreneurship and gentlemanly ways, but you are forced to be suspicious because he's a little ""too smooth"". It wasn't until he went mad and got violent that I understood - ""oh, he's the bad guy"".<br/><br/>The main plots are about greed, oil, religion and the ""important things in life"" - but I can think of hundreds of better plots/story lines than what this movie attempts. The main actor, Mr. Plainview does a great job, but I agree with other reviewers that his character doesn't seem to fit the mold of a western oil man, set in this time period. His accent is wrong and he's a smoother talker than I would have expected. There often seems to be conflict just for conflict's sake.<br/><br/>The movie is too front heavy and does not spend enough time on the later parts of Mr Plainview's life - the resolution and downfall of the character that could be so much more interesting.<br/><br/>I can usually understand why people like movies, even when I don't agree.

","It's unfortunate that there are so many pretentious long boring movies out there under the guise of being epic. There Will Be Blood is a prime example. It is very very long and very very boring and pointless. Daniel Day Lewis waddles around the whole movie hamming it up every chance he gets. All you hear about is how great of a performance he did when nothing could be farther than the truth.<br/><br/>DDL did not in fact do a good acting job at all. His acting is so hammy I could swear I was watching a movie from the 1940's. His tone and overall delivery sounds exactly like Jack Palance. I'm utterly convinced he told people he was researching the role and sat around watching repeats of Ripley's Believe It Or Not."
"come2whereimfrom","6","46","92","17 February 2008"," OK but doesn't live up to the hype.
","Firstly let me say that this is a good film but despite that I was disappointed because it didn't feel like a Paul Thomas Anderson film. The only trace of the visionary director of such films as 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' comes right at the end of this movie, otherwise it plays quite straight. Don't get me wrong it has the stunning Oscar worthy performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, I haven't seen an actor perform with such intensity for a long time and you do get the sense he lived the part. It also has the unusual but brilliant soundtrack from Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, the story based on the Upton Sinclair novel 'Oil' is strong and the cinematography is both breathtaking and stylised. But somehow something just doesn't seem right, told over the course of twenty five or so years the only thing that seems to differentiate the decades is Daniels facial hair which starts as a Grizzly Adams and ends up Magnum P.I. and because his acting is so good the supporting cast don't really get a look in. There are shots that would make excellent stills, faces covered in oil lit only by a burning tower or Plainview sat in his chair smoking a pipe as the sun sets behind him but at over two and a half hours it dragged in places and yet it felt like, especially with the time jumps, that there was a lot more we weren't seeing. I wouldn't say I disliked this film some of it is brilliant like a drunken Plainview dribbling and bursting into a semi-controlled rage but I wouldn't go over the top like most critics have and I'm surprised it has won so many awards, thirty three and counting, because its good but its not the best film this year or the best Anderson has done. I feel strange going against the grain but I have to be objective and unfortunately this film just didn't live up to the hype."

","I love epics from Spartacus to Lawrence of Arabia to Seven Samurai to Citizen Kane. The only thing epic about this movie was it's length. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a virtuoso performance as an amoral man, who over 30 years remains amoral. But what's the point? There is no progression, no growth, no action and not one character to care about. There is nothing in this movie as big as Day-Lewis' performance, and the story remains off balance from start to finish because of it. I found myself wishing I was watching a Ken Burns' documentary on the early days of oil. The music was often atonal and intrusive, and actually lessened what little pleasure I took from this film.<br/><br/>The degradation that follows pursuit of riches was addressed admirably in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" where we see the progression of gold lust turn good friends into crazed enemies. ""Madre"" showed the joy of becoming rich. ""Blood"" had no joy. Any fortuitous discovery must be followed with pain.<br/><br/>Finally, there was about as much blood in this movie as there were lines spoken by women; almost none."

No real story line - terrible subject as as storyline (oil in the early 1900's)- no reason for any of the characters being the way they are - no reason to watch the characters as they are - no redeeming qualities to walk away with - no inspiration to gain from it - no ending worth discussing - no dialog worth remembering - no reason to see it and definitely no reason for me to have sat there for 2 1/2 hours watching it. I guess I just couldn't believe it could be that bad and that some how - some way it was going to build to something even if it was in the last 5 minutes but it was not to be.

"hpoeng-805-524438","9","7","10","30 September 2013"," There Will Be Blood - Amateur Review
","*NOTE: first time doing a movie review.*<br/><br/>Greed can lead to many things. Some good, some bad. It can often lead to a man's downfall. Set in the late 19th-century / early 20th- century, ""There Will Be Blood"" follows the story of Daniel Plainview. The story starts with the camera focused on a single man in a mine who is none other than Daniel. The movie opens up in silence. There is no dialogue, no speech. For 20 minutes I sat and observed a man in a hole mining for who knows what. In these first 20 minutes we are exposed to a number of things that set the tone for movie. We see a dry barren land, age old technology. You see a sweaty man working at a wall with his pickaxe in some dark and dusty hole. It's intense and dark. During these 20 minutes, Daniel strikes oil changing his life. Lives will be changed, decisions will be made, and there will be blood.<br/><br/>This movie appears to be filmed on location in Texas and in California, which is a great way to convey Paul Thomas Anderson's message. Half the things in the movie couldn't be done on set. Unless it was done by some type of magic, then kudos to the team. I personally think that filming on location adds another dimension of realism to the movie, especially since it is a western type movie. Back to what the message is. Well, if I were to take a swing at what the message is, I'm going to say it's about the struggle for power and control. You can take this away from Daniel and his enemy, Eli Sunday (who starts a church in Little Boston called ""The Third Revelation""). Both of them want it all, to be on top in their respective careers. However, the struggle and desire for power pits both Daniel and Eli together for control of Little Boston. It also provides a historical example for that time period. The message is conveyed fairly well in this movie. But that's not the only thing this movie has going on. I personally think the biggest aspect of this movie has to be the music. It's random, and gets you thinking. Mind you, there isn't any run in the park Benny Hill music. The music is dark, ominous and overall creepy. It sets up the scene and makes it interesting. A good example of this can be located within the first 20 minutes of the film. Creepy music starts to play when Daniel begins his descent back into the mine where the dynamite blew up. According to the creepy music, something bad was bound to happen and it did. The ladder Dan was using to climb down on broke, tossing him like a rag doll. Surprisingly enough, this is where he discovers oil. This makes me think that the music starts only when a significant moment is about to happen, which is it's own type of foreshadowing, for better for for worse.<br/><br/>As we progress through the story, you start to see the central theme of greed bloom at a rather rapid rate. Greed takes a grip on our main character Daniel and starts to drive the story in a different direction. He begins get a crazy but in a subtle way. Then, he just becomes a different man. It was amazing to the see the actor, Daniel Day-Lewis, take on this role and own it. He put so much energy and power into this roll and really convinced me that he was going crazy. I fully support Paul Thomas Anderson's cast choice. Each person totally owned his / her role, and made the movie as un-cheesy as possible. The shots were clear, and it wasn't gimmicky. We knew where all the important people were at all times during each scene. <br/><br/>I would totally watch this movie again if I had the chance. It was plot driven, it never sidetracked, and each scene was significant to the development of the main character. Out of 10 i would give it a 9 simply because there is no such thing as perfect, only what we perceive to be perfect. It was intense, unpredictable, and overall enjoyable. I don't usually watch these kinds of movies, but this one just might get me hooked to the genre."
"commandercool88","9","7","10","8 July 2008"," Brooding masterpiece from Paul Thomas Anderson.
","There Will Be Greed. There Will Be Vengeance. 'There Will Be Blood'. There's no easy way to approach Paul Thomas Anderson's latest effort, it's about as unsettling and disturbing as they come. With piercing subtlety, this haunting epic takes us to a dark place exploring business, religion, and above all else, greed. Completely enthralling and one of this year's most ambitious pictures, 'There Will Be Blood' is a near masterpiece that gives us perhaps the greatest performance we've seen in years.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson. What can you say? For a man still relatively early in his career, 'There Will Be Blood' is only Anderson's fifth feature film, and his third that tops a whopping 150 minutes. Responsible for the script as well as providing stunning direction, there are few in Hollywood today who can make such heavy, pondering films and somehow hold the attention of so many. Yet despite quite an impressive running time, there's a rich and textured story to be told here that demands every minute of its time. No filler. It's a methodical and deliberate picture, but one that pulls us in from start to finish. The script (adapted from Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"") is beautifully constructed, deep and startlingly realistic. Johnny Greenwood's barebones score is chilling and effective (sadly not eligible for an Oscar), and its cinematography is sweeping and wondrous.<br/><br/>A soul-dead oilman, hellbent on succeeding and leaving everyone else in the dust. Whatever the cost. The hype is worthy and very much deserved. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the performance of a lifetime, one that will surely go down in history as one of cinema's greatest. He is absolutely sensational, every line of dialogue delivered with such a ferocious undertone that will slice through even the toughest of audiences. A brilliantly layered and rich character, Day-Lewis brings Plainview to life with such jaw-dropping vitality. And while it's easy to focus purely on this masterful performance, it's important to keep young Paul Dano in mind as well. A blossoming actor, he shines in this fantastic role as a supposed prophet and healer. These are two actors, both on opposite sides of the spectrum, who understand the art of the craft and pull no punches. They drive 'There Will Be Blood' home.<br/><br/>In the end, I find it difficult to call 'There Will Be Blood' a perfect film. A flawed masterpiece, perhaps. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what happens, but a slight road bump seems to halter the film's final act. But any film that can lure Daniel Day-Lewis out of the shadows and back on the big screen is a notable achievement, and it's worth talking about. 'There Will Be Blood' is a deeply challenging film whose ability to rattle an audience is like few others.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

"isabelle1955","Null","17","30","3 February 2008"," Masterpiece or Over Hyped Melodrama?
","Well I can't decide. Although I'm tending towards the latter conclusion right now. I'd been looking forward to seeing this after the Oscar nominations came out, and my son gave me a good report too, but after sitting through all two and a half plus hours with a friend, we turned to each other and ""Hmmmm?"" was about as philosophical as we could get. This movie is not as good as it thinks it is. It treads a narrow line veering dangerously close to pretension, and has ""Look at me, aren't I a masterpiece?"" written all over it. But the jury is still out on that. If I wanted to be really cynical, I could just dismiss it as another movie about men doing manly things. But it does deserve more thoughtful analysis than that.<br/><br/>I'm prepared to concede that Daniel Day Lewis gives a tour-de-force performance and the musical score is good. There are some other things about There Will Be Blood which are very good too; the cinematography for instance. It's an interesting story, both as a character study of a strange, driven man and as a history study of the early days of the oil industry. The time is turn of the 20th century, the place the western USA. Daniel Plainview (D D Lewis) survives a mining accident to become an early wildcatter, strikes it lucky, and then, after a tip off from one Mr Paul Sunday, heads west in southern California to drill one of the biggest finds in the state, on the Sunday's dirt poor, hard scrabble goat farm. He gathers leases on land and eventually overcomes the locals' religious fervor, to build a pipeline to the coast, thwarting 'big bad' Standard Oil, but running foul of the preacher, Eli Sunday, Paul's brother or possibly his alter ego, I couldn't quite decide. (Paul Dano, trying hard but miscast in my opinion.) Along the way he adopts a child, the orphaned son of a worker, and the child is rendered deaf as the result of a spectacular, explosive blow out at a well. So far so good. The first hour is far better than the second.<br/><br/>To me a film needs more than a strong central performance, music and gritty filming of an oil fire, to be nominated for Best Picture. It also needs good editing, and strong writing, and to fully engage the attention of the audience. And there were times in There Will Be Blood, especially during the second half, when to call it ponderous would be putting it kindly. It is painfully slow in places, almost to the point of tedium, and the fact is that Plainview is an unpleasant man, with whom it is hard to sympathise on any level. He is unpleasant from beginning to end, and except for a few moments of affection for the son, we see a one dimensional character. The obvious character to arouse our sympathy is the adopted son, but he is presented as pretty much functionally mute even before he loses his hearing, so there is little even there to grasp on to as a character with whom to identify. The rest of the cast are bit players, and this is definitely a girly-free zone. Plainview reneges on a promise to give $5,000 to Eli's church, and seems to renege on other promises too, such as drilling for irrigation water, building a road and a school (situation normal for the oil industry, I'm sure viewers are muttering.) He does whatever is needed to succeed, shunts his deaf son off to boarding school by cruelly tricking him onto a train, beats up the preacher in a weird scene, murders a man who poses as his long lost brother and generally seems to be someone for whom arrest and a strait jacket are long overdue. We are given little insight as to why he is such a piece of work.<br/><br/>Eventually he makes his huge bundle of money and lives as an alcoholic in a vast mansion. The final dénouement is played out in his private bowling alley after his son, now grown up, has left him to set up on his own as a rival. The pesky preacher  who strangely seems not to have aged a day. Very poor characterization in my opinion  meets his maker via an appointment with a bowling pin.<br/><br/>So what are we to make of this? Is there some message to be read here? Power hungry control freaks often meet a nasty end? Beware preachers who have read Revelations once too often? Goat's milk is better for the liver than whiskey? Insulting your adopted son and mocking his use of sign language will leave you lonely in your old age? I wish I knew.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this. I don't want to be totally negative. It's certainly interesting in concept. But it's far too flawed to deserve Best Picture, and I've seen better movies this year. Sweeney Todd, for example, which truly IS a masterpiece, or even Michael Clayton, which I thought excellent. There Will Be Blood is, however, far, far better than Juno, a movie whose nomination for Best Picture has left me truly bemused."

If you want to make a movie about a misanthrope, at least make it interesting. Give me a reason to care or understand.<br/><br/>I did not mind the slow pace, (and believe me when I say it is slow paced). But I hoped it would lead to something, and I don't mean a shootout, just some interesting revelation or change or SOMETHING.

Have these people not seen very many movies, are the starstruck by a great performance, or are they just sheep? Heck if he liked it maybe I should too.<br/><br/>No this is not a good movie. It is in fact just a marginally watchable movie. But if you want to see it, rent it. When it comes out on cable, you will not be able to watch it without switching away at a commercial and never coming back."

Why did every scene have to contain a 5 minute silence where you are forced to look at a character doing nothing?

","I could go on for pages and pages about this movie but I'm going to keep this short and sweet.<br/><br/>'There Will Be Blood' is a masterpiece due to two factors, Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>First of all, Paul Thomas Anderson is a proved visionary of cinema and he's quite obviously mastered the art of storytelling through character development on screen and most importantly, he knows how to get the absolute best out of his actors. Although 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' showcased a magnitude of talent in its ensemble performances, this film is all about Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Daniel Day Lewis is the greatest actor on the planet, his range is unequalled and I have never come away from one of his performances not in complete awe. This is his greatest work, both subtle and grandiose, genuine and brutal, it is something to be marvelled at and a best actor Oscar has never been so deserved as the one that he picked up for this.<br/><br/>Just like Joaquin Pheonix in his latest 'The Master' you come away from this viewing almost exhausted at the raw emotion that spills out on the screen throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Perfect filmmaking, this is why I watch movies."

Cinematography was boring. OK so there were long shots brilliantly blocked, but did they help the story advance? no, they didn't. It was a mishmash of ideas that created expectations which were all unrealized during the movie.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie as I love DDL and I also love period movies. For me, there is something special in a slow told story, with long shots that let you delve in into the characters subtleties and the total energy of the setting. IN this movie though, there is no real story. In the theater I kept telling my self, 'it cant be it. Something must happen eventually' but the only thing to happen was just another brilliant agonized look from Lewis and maybe another weird and over the top piece of music.<br/><br/>Sorry guys, but the story is not there, I left the movie without knowing anything about the characters and there lives. In fact, most shots are spent stuck on Lewis in close-up. We really don't get a chance to get to know any one, even not Daniel, as he is too flat as written on the script. Lewis had to take him to an extreme in order to give the narrative a bit of interest, but quick enough you realize that nothing surprising will happen.<br/><br/>A good try to make something different, but not good enough.

","What can I say about a film such as ""There Will Be Blood""? Consummate acting by principles Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. Beautiful cinematography and devoted, visionary direction by Paul Thomas Anderson. It is a very nicely done film by people who think they are really plumbing the depths of reality and making a profound statement about American society. The problem is that this story is a badly dated allegory by Upton Sinclair about the corrupt nature of American capitalism and its doomed partnership with popular religion. These strange bedfellows form an uneasy partnership based upon their mutual goal of exploiting the masses for their own profit. But the ruthless, competitive nature of capitalism is prophesied as eventually destroying its religious partner once it has outlived its usefulness, or rather once capitalism itself has outlived its usefulness, they will both destroy each other, thus fulfilling the hoped-for leftist apocalypse that will usher in a new age of altruistic socialism where past exploitation is replaced by the communist ideal. Of course, this allegory does not include the happy ending, just the destruction of the demonized institutions of capitalism and religion. I can only release a deep sigh of boredom over this artistically superior but misguided attempt to resurrect the leftist dream of western society's demise well after the leftist ideal itself has already self-destructed. If you are inspired by this sort of dated propaganda, you'll undoubtedly see this film as an unqualified masterpiece. For the rest of us, it merely amounts to a bleak, obscure story about a bunch of miserably corrupt people leading meaningless, mutually destructive lives. The big message to all of us is OIL=EVIL. Got it, people? Very good! Just remember that oil, competition, and religion are the sources of all the evil in the world and you will be on the communist road to utopia. Yippee!"
"iamtherealace","6","22","41","20 January 2008"," A magnificent performance from Day-Lewis in a film that was only about his performance. SOME SPOILERS
","I went to see ""There Will Be Blood"" expecting the best film of year. What I got was a highly absorbing, intriguing and beautifully well-shot first hour before the picture collapsed. When Plainview's son is sent away because of his deafness the only interesting emotional relationship in the story is removed, leaving Day-Lewis and, um...that's it. Even though HW Plainview returns later on, I was so mind-numbingly bored with the total vacuum of any other dynamic relationship that the film was passed saving at this point. When Plainview set up his big Oil plans in Eli Sunday's community, I thought the story would kick on and evolve in some way. Instead it just stagnates. The major problem here is with Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. Dano has performed very well in other movies I've seen him in, and he clearly has a fine talent, but here he is poorly cast. If Eli Sunday had been played by a heavyweight actor of equal power and intensity as Day-Lewis, then the struggle between the different types of greed bound up in the church and business symbolized by Sunday and Plainview respectively would have been more powerful and significant. As it was, the young and innocent looking Dano came across much more as some kind of crazed weirdo than as the spokesman of this community. The moment that summed this up was when Plainview went back on his word to Sunday at the opening of the drilling site and didn't allow him to bless the new project. The close-up on Dano's face revealed nothing of the anger and belligerence that an older actor might have brought to the role. A stronger, more aggressive performance would have ensured that when HW Plainview vanished, the underlying tension at the heart of the film between spirituality and materialism would have been played out as a real battle, rather than the one-sided demolition job Day-Lewis' powerhouse character did on the weak and submissive Sunday. Such a relationship might have provided a better structure in which the story could have grown. The problem that emanated from Dano's casting as Sunday was that there was a giant vacuum in the story that some people clearly thought was adequately filled by a ""character-study"" of Plainview. Whilst Day-Lewis' performance was sensational-intense, emotionally charged, and so believable, I don't think that any character, however well acted, is interesting enough to justify being the sole subject of a film for an hour and a half. ""Into the Wild,"" a film just as much about the main character as ""There Will be Blood"" is, benefits from the number of relationships Emile Hirsh's character has along the way, which succeed in creating the tension and dynamism that make the film enjoyable. Here the story didn't go anywhere, and the film didn't really know how to finish itself, ultimately ending rather weakly with the terribly contrived confrontation between Plainview and Sunday. Some people will add to the argument that the film is a fantastic ""character study"" by talking about its war on terror orientated themes of power, religion, greed etc. etc. If someone can tell me what the point of the allusions to the war on terror business were (""HW"" Plainview etc.) then I'll be grateful, because as far as I can see the film raised the fact that greed and religion exist, and then left it at that, smugly thinking that making such clever links to the current political climate is an intrinsically valuable act, and that any development of those themes is entirely unnecessary. Day-Lewis here gives an outstanding performance in a film that suffers hugely from its weak story. A real disappointment."

It probably was more of a 6, but the marks it has been getting have been a bit too generous. It was meandering and boring and in the end told us nothing except what we already knew it was about-a greedy man looking for oil at any cost. The acting was okay but DDL was much better in Gangs of NY.<br/><br/>Are you really going to tell me that TWBB is better than Psycho, Dr. Strangelove, Citizen Kane, Silence of the Lambs, Fight Club, the next 5 movies right behind it. Please! Lately the voters on IMDb's top 250 have been giving high marks to films that just don't measure up.

","After all the hype, this was very disappointing. Its all been said in other reviews. The story rambled and jumped around without any regard for continuity and plot or character progression. All the characters were one dimensional. The score seemed to be in competition with the movie instead of complimenting it and Daniel Day Lewis, who I consider to be a great actor, was way over the top with an accent reminiscent of agent Smith from ""The Matrix"". I half expected him to attach a ""... Mr Anderson"" on to some of his lines. I think its crazy that this is currently ranked at number 33 in the IMDb most popular movies. I fear there's a strong element of ""The emperors new clothes here"""

","There Will Be Blood (2007) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Ambitious film about an oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis) who will stop at nothing to find the black gold. I must be honest and say I don't know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson's camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis' rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn't a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn't call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that's certainly not a slam against his performance here because he's great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he's doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis."

This film has the worst attribute of anything in the entertainment industry - it is not entertaining. Boring would be a better term. Dull, plodding and excruciatingly long. The moments of interest are few and far between, and far too fleeting to make this movie worth watching. One leaves the film primarily with a sense of wonder as to why Hollywood thinks it is so noteworthy. It is not, except perhaps as a example of the bad films Hollywood increasingly tells us (the public) that we SHOULD like. There is a growing disconnect between the films celebrated at the Academy Awards and those films that the public actually enjoys. No wonder the audience for the Awards dwindles each year. Continued celebration of boring, forgettable films such as this will ensure the Academy's increasing irrelevance."

"cdelacroix1","5","31","61","26 January 2008"," Great sets, good cinematography, lousy story.
","I just saw this movie today ... ""Whoa yeah ... finally!"" I thought when I saw it in the movie listings here. It was released here yesterday ... about a month after it had hit wide release, I think. By now there have been so many positive reviews ... and I liked the trailer ... so I was looking forward to seeing this movie very much. Unfortunately, it really didn't live up to expectations.<br/><br/>First, though, the good things. I really liked the sets and scenery and cinematography. The good folks in charge of such things really seem to have worked hard to give us a vivid, convincing vision of period oil and period settings for oil production and life in a dry, arid land in the period West.<br/><br/>The acting performances ranged from very good to excellent throughout. Daniel Day Lewis did a wonderful job giving us as convincing a depiction of Daniel Plainview as I for one can imagine.<br/><br/>Having said that, though, Daniel Plainview as a character came across to me as affected, posturing, and very unconvincing. For that matter, most of the characters in this movie were to me unconvincing. And the script that gave them birth was to me generally very, very unconvincing. The action was slow, even boring, without being redeemed by any kind of realistic character development or story development. I honestly thought about walking out a few times, but persevered until the bitter end ... and ended up just shaking my head at a final scene that was to me just utterly incredible.<br/><br/>My own view of almost any movie that professes a realistic historical setting is that there are two major pitfalls to avoid: (1) treating a historical period as if it's a reflection of our own time: ""just like us"". And (2) treating a historical period as if it's a caricature, almost the opposite of our time: ""nothing like us."" <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood makes the second mistake,IMHO.<br/><br/>A movie about a bygone world that's really just a caricature, seen through eyes that don't have any sympathy for another time and another place, is an expression of what has sometimes been called ""chronological snobbery"": the idea that just because people and place belong to the past, they must be brutal or inhuman or idiotic or venal far beyond what we know in our own here-and-now.<br/><br/>So in this movie everyone seems driven by brutality and greed and inhumanity and sheer stupidity far beyond what we would regard as credible in our times, but apparently we're supposed to buy this kind of vision about the past. Why? Because ... ""they lived back then"" while ""we live now"" as if that's some kind of automatic reason to embrace a dehumanized view of people who lived and moved on this old world before we were born.<br/><br/>So we have a movie full of people who are all ... meaning, all, with (perhaps) one exception that I can think of ... driven, uncaring, brutal, greedy ... and too stupid to get out of the way of obvious dangers although somehow they've managed to survive, for years and years, in a dangerous, inhospitable environment. Not to give away anything, but the final scene gives examples of all of these incredibilities (if that's the word) in an especially unrealistic vision that (I guess) must be the scriptwriter's idea of how things were back in the early part of the century. Yet anyone with any actual knowledge of the period ... or with any actual knowledge of people in general ... would consider this to make no sense at all.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong ... a bleak, Hollywood-type nihilism may not be appealing ... not to me anyway ... but it can at least be rendered realistically and convincingly. See for example No Country for Old Men ... another 2007 film that in some ways has the same ""flavor"" as There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>But No Country for Old Men gives us a well-scripted story with a strong, convincing plot. There Will Be Blood, in contrast, unfortunately serves up a script that is unconvincing, unrealistic, incredible, ahistorical, and boring.<br/><br/>Charles Delacroix"

The soundtrack is excruciating. It begins slowly, but the grind on you gets worse and worse. The same agonising sequence over and over again. But the ultimate problem with this movie is waaaaay too long. It suffers from the tragedy of 'Dances with Wolves'. It can thank DWW that it does not become the pop culture joke that DWW has become in that respect. Ultimately this movie could have been told in an hour. Setting this movie at nearly 2.5 hours suggests that either the producer is trying to squeeze out a feature film from a tele-movie that want over budget, or that the director grossly underestimates the intelligence of most movie goers."

His morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth.<br/><br/>At the moment ""There Will Be Blood"" is the top 23th film on IMDb. People hail Daniel Day Lewis as the best living actor, and this is his best performance. According to the posters in the local cinema, Daniel Day Lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations for this role alone. As a result, I have very high expectations on this film.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is definitely great as Daniel, but I find it rather unfair that Paul Dano does not get any attention. Paul Dano is excellent as a religious leader, and he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches. The other characters, I am afraid, are not as memorable.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it is good in outlining how Daniel's morals decline deeper and deeper. However, I think it does not portray the consequences of his declining morals enough. It would be great to see the moral repercussions of his dirty deeds, and the emotional impact of such acts on others. The current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted, and I find this less than satisfying.<br/><br/>The beginning speechless introduction is far too long, and the ending is far too abrupt and fast. It is disappointing that it does not portray more of Daniel and his son's relationship between his son coming back and his marriage. I would also liked to see more of his son's reaction and emotions after being told the truth. The initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened to make way for interaction between Daniel and his son. Actually the whole film can be shortened, and the pace quickened, without affecting the story.<br/><br/>I think ""There Will Be Blood"" is not as legendary as people claim."

If they had they would have seen a social commentary, a chronicle of the times, some incredible Americana but what we get here is drivel. This film seems to have been scrubbed of all reference to greed, the struggle of working people to unionize in America, the complicity of law enforcement with the rich. What an incredibly disappointing film. So much effort and talent, time and money wasted. The team that made this movie had an opportunity to do much much more. <br/><br/>""Oil!"" is full of amazing scenes and characters and while it drifts like the film, at least it has something to say about life. 2008. What a perfect time to learn about oil. As we fill our gas tanks we might be thinking about how hard it was to develop this resource; to find it, release it, and tame it for our benefit. But that would be an industrial film. Of course that is also history, a theme Hollywood has a reputation for playing fast and loose with. Too bad we couldn't have gotten a story about a man with ambition who succeeds. What's wrong with that? Contrasted by his son who observes life and doesn't do much with those observations or his money (except enjoy himself). There are women characters in the book too (not like the film). The book has nudity, and lots of sex (not like the film). The book has some violence but probably not enough for audiences today, so I suppose that didn't sit well with the ""suits"" at the studio. Can't sell a film these days without killing of some sort can we? So let's get some fights going, and homicide might be helpful. This whole bum-numbing 2 hour mess was probably edited by teams who worked at different paces. But that's no excuse for such inconsistency. We get panoramic shots that never want to end and are boring as hell. It's like the team who shot the B-roll got to edit it!! We get Lewis erupting with no real motivation. What's he so worked up about? He doesn't seem to have any competition, at least not that I can see in this film.<br/><br/>The book has elements of real people like J. Paul Getty, Howard Hughes, William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, and Billy Graham. These are people who helped define America (with the exception of Davies). But I guess these figures have been largely forgotten or removed from the record by some sort revisionist new-think ministry that is subtly altering America these days. I can't see any future life for this movie."

I think his talent became more obvious as the film dragged (and i mean dragged) on to portray his descent into madness. (Is that a spoiler? If so, sorry.) After it ended, my wife turned to me and said ""How much did we pay to see this?"". I then realized we just wasted 18 dollars.

I'm not saying he's a bad actor, he was terrific in Little Miss Sunshine, but utterly unconvincing in his role. - Other than those two, who else had any memorable role? Is this just a platform for DDL's talent? - Why weren't there any roles for women in this movie other than bit parts. In fact, I think the longest line of any woman in the movie is ""Yes, Father"". - Story line. Well, what story line. Local boy makes good. Man goes crazy. Seriously, I saw nothing in the relationship between DDL and Dano. It was just there to add another 30 unneeded minutes to this film.</li></ul><br/><br/>My advice, read the reviews.

","This movie is a tedious bore. The main character, oil wildcatter Daniel Plainview, is a callous guy when we first meet him. His only hint of complexity is his relationship toward his son, but this possible redemptive aspect soon dissipates. <br/><br/>Plainview cheats people out of their land, strikes oil, gets rich, and matures into an overt villain who simply gets worse and worse for another two tiresome hours. Plainview is devoid of redeeming characteristics. He is a repellent character who goes from mean to meaner to monster.<br/><br/>I am astounded that anyone enjoyed this movie.

"zetes","10","25","48","13 January 2008"," One of the most memorable characters of 2007 in one of the year's best films
","Wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson's new film calls to mind Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in its themes and subject, and, shockingly, it's a good enough film to sit side by side with the one most often dubbed the greatest movie ever. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who will do anything to be a success in the business. Much like Citizen Kane, There Will Be Blood depicts how the lust for money will eventually alienate every human being around you, and eventually make you completely isolated from the world. Unlike Citizen Kane, Daniel Plainview doesn't just grow apart from the world, he also becomes insane. There is a lot of metaphorical subtext lining the film's bottom, especially concerning the relationship between fundamentalist Christianity and big business. It's all very interesting to ponder. I don't know if I think the film is one of the most intellectually stimulating movies I've ever seen. For the record, I don't think Citizen Kane is, either. The message ""money corrupts"", while probably true, isn't especially insightful. What both films have in spades is a director with incredible talent who can envelop their audience in the rapturous experience of pure cinema. The desolate, desert setting sucks you in deeply and never lets you go. Every gravelly word spoken by Day-Lewis is anticipated with both glee and dread. It could have went on for three more hours, and only my bladder would have given notice. My only small grumble is Paul Dano in the final scene. He's good throughout, don't get me wrong, but that final sequence takes place over a decade after the last time we saw Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview has aged, his son (as a child wonderfully played by the wide-eyed Dillon Freasier) has aged. Why is nothing done to Paul Dano to make him look older? At least give him a mustache! I think there must have been a reason for it, but I can't for the life of me imagine what that would be. Otherwise, an amazing experience."

Daniel Day-Lewis give a strong performance as a sociopath and that is the only strong point in this film.<br/><br/>There is flaws in this movie and the major one is the development of interactions between Daniel and the rest of the cast, it is nonlinear, full of holes.

","I was in the mood for a movie a couple of weeks ago, but had seen everything in the theatres. Reluctantly, I forced myself to go see 'Meet the Spartans,' and paid dearly for it. It took everything I had to stay until the end. It's one of the first comedies since the 80's that I have seen which did not manage to get a single smirk out of me. Hands down...the worst movie I've seen in years.<br/><br/>That is, until I saw 'There Will Be Blood.' I've read through some of the positive posts on here highlighting the acting and cinematography and can see where some people might be split on these elements (personally, I wasn't impressed with either). Even if I did agree, however, I just don't think that these alone can carry a movie to a 9 or 10 rating. Some other reviewers on this site hit the nail on the head: this film was just plain boring.<br/><br/>Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theatre throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the film's plot still hadn't gone anywhere. This is like a couple of snapshots in the life of some oil baron. Nothing really ever happens.<br/><br/>Did we really have to wait 2 1/2 hrs. to see an out-of-place conclusion to the movie which turned out to be yet another Hollywood shot at religion? Really? C'mon...hasn't Hollywood's take on religion been thoroughly documented in every film made that touches on the subject? I get it already.<br/><br/>What was there that could ever be mistaken as being inspiring or even entertaining in this film? If it weren't for the two or three scenes of bloodshed (mild at best) and some profanity, this is what I would put on TV to get my kids to sleep at night. I can only reason that the studio has hired tons of individuals to write positive reviews on this. Surely, IMDb users have better taste than this.<br/><br/>Pass."

The first third or so was good despite the awful soundtrack, but after the pivotal accident scene with his son, I couldn't stop looking at my watch. NOTHING HAPPENS. Was it supposed to be a fascinating character study? Daniel Day-Lewis plays an evil (or just ""competitive"" as he says) cyborg who spends most of his time chewing imaginary tobacco that never gets spit out. The only time he seems remotely human is in the occasional scene where he almost manages to seem like he cares a tiny bit about his son. That's it. I should say, that's it except for a stupid ending involving a bowling lane. The best thing about the movie was the excellent cinematography.<br/><br/>Spend your money on No Country for Old Men instead of this - it's about a million times better in every way."

If DDL was up for an Oscar for this (and i'm no way sure of this) I have to say that the overall quality of Oscar nominees must be slipping - the storyline just got lost in an over-long rambling mess of a film. I have to say that mile for mile DDL's films SEEM to run into an overlong mess (see Gangs of New York) and it seems at times the direction of this movie gets waylayed. This is of course just my opinion and maybe you might get something out of this movie that I did not - Satisfaction - satisfaction that I longed to crave especially after a good opening - but ultimately its promise was larger than its delivery - one for the straight to video I fear with boredom a high factor in the latter stages of the movie and DDL just becoming an annoying inclusion in a thus ultimately unsatisfying experience"

"info-15983","4","16","29","24 February 2008"," Misleading title, excruciatingly slow pace
","This movie has the slowest pace I've ever seen, and at 2 hrs 40 minutes, it's very unnecessary. Nobody says anything for the first 10 minutes, and the first two hours could easily fit into 60 minutes without compromising the character or plot development. If anything the slow pace lends a sense of the pace of that period, but there's a reason we've moved on.<br/><br/>There is also a huge error in the oil rig operation. When the rig is allegedly drilling, only the pump is seen operating, even though there was nothing to pump yet. There is no drill or bits to be seen, except during one scene where a crewman is hit by a bit extension - but they were never actually drilling! Considering the extent they made everything else period-accurate and realistic, I find that horribly unacceptable.<br/><br/>And with all the hype implying it would be an action-packed western, it was anything but. I can appreciate a good drama, but not in slow-motion! Daniel Day-Lewis transforms himself amazingly to suit the role, but why on earth did he put so much work into looking exactly like Tom Selleck and sounding exactly like Clint Eastwood?! It completely killed the realism of the character for me. Ironically, it was the most entertaining aspect for me, but at no point did I feel he was anything but an actor playing a role.<br/><br/>Overall it was a huge disappointment for me, and the only Oscar-worthy aspect would be the cinematography, at best."
"Jacques98","6","15","27","10 January 2009"," Oh yes . . . There Will Be Boredom.
","If you find a single cliché-ridden scene in this entire movie even mildly unpredictable, it must surprise you every single time the crap in your toilet magically disappears when you flush it. People like to ironically throw around the mindless phrase that whatever movie was ""and insult to"" their ""intelligence"". I have never once stooped so low in a review to say that, but I'm going to go even further here. There Will Be Blood is a downright insult to the intelligence of anyone who has so much as graduated kindergarten. And here is why: <br/><br/>First and foremost, every single scene in There Will Be Blood is an unabashed cliché, copy/pasted from other ""epic"" (major emphasis on the quotes) movies just like it. From opening to close, there isn't a single thing you wouldn't expect. Calling There Will Be Blood unoriginal is an understatement. Calling it so unoriginal it's a blatant waste of time is a better way to put it. While people say something doesn't have to be original to be goodand there may be some truth thereit's almost impossible to be fully engaged with something you've seen before. It's like repeating a joke a second time: sure, you may laugh, but it's not nearly as funny as it was the first time. Taking the metaphor further, with There Will Be Blood, the joke is ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" It's been said so many times people don't even know why it's funny. The only people who could even remotely find any entertainment value, or, much less, intellectual value, in There Will Be Blood are the fine-wine-sipping, fine-cinema-whores. The kind of people who are so brainwashed into believing every word the critics say is correct, they'd believe the critics no matter how bad a film is. And There Will Be Blood is pretty bad. I mean, seriously, folks, when a movie has to even copy its title (from Saw II's tagline), you really think the directors have enough imagination to even think of a single creative, much less original, idea? Excuse me as I laugh.<br/><br/>The second condemning flaw is that the film has no story. It's just the everyday life of an oilman. While I can sometimes appreciate movies about everyday life, the problem here is there is nothing whatsoever remarkable about it. The man's life portrayed is just as dull as my own. It's as dull as your own. It's completely, utterly unremarkable. I'm pretty sure the movie was trying to ""haunt"" the viewer with its negativity, as the back cover says. However, as I pointed out above, every problem that goes wrong and is intended to ""disturb"" the viewer is 100% cliché and predictable, as well as downplayed without any overt emotion until the very ending. Someone can say it is character driven, but the main character and his son are both, again, cardboard clichés who add nothing to the movie whatsoever. Because of this, the movie just goes on and on without any focus or anything at all worth watching. It takes 1 hour and 3 minutesyes, I timed itbefore anything even remotely, mildly interesting happens, and after that, the movie remains deadpan until the end. This review is actually very hard to write because of the simple fact that the movie is like that old politician phrase: it runs on and on for hours, but never really says anything or does anything. It's a lot like trying to review a 2hr, 30min session of staring at the wall.<br/><br/>Other complaints: <br/><br/><ul><li>The cinematography is stunning at the opening. It has an old-fashion look. After the first 20 minutes, however, it completely becomes average. Almost as if it was just a way to hook the viewer, then died off.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Giving this film an R-rating is completely ludicrous. Despite the title that it directly stole from Saw II, it literally could have been G-ratedthere was no blood, language, or nudity whatsoeverand certainly no worse than PG.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting was nothing special. It's solid, sure. It's average. It's run-of-the-mill. Oscar-worthy? Again, that's a joke. I saw nothing special about any of the performances, and some of them (such as Ailman) were downright cheesy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's always easier for movies like this to portray cliché Christian extremists instead of accurately portraying what 95% of real Christians actually act like. I actually find it rather humorous. I've seen hundreds of films portray Christian extremists, but I can literally count the realistic portrayals of a Christian in a movie on one hand. It's a paradox that There Will Be Blood tries so hard to be realistic, while it uses every over-the-top Hollywood cliché ever used.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending is an absolute safe, self-parody. It's where the entire bland joke-of-a-movie finally gets a punch line. The ending, without spoiling anything, has to be one of the absolute cheesiest endings of all time, not to mention the way it's played out is, who would have guessed, another cliché. I've seen the exact same ending in countless other movies (for example: Hannibal Rising, Hostel: Part 2, etc.).</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall: There is no point of viewing this movie. It's just a rehash of everything you've seen before, with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's bitingly predictable and unoriginal, and you'll see every turn in the first fifteen minutes, like I did. The story is simply nonexistent, and the characters all have about as much personality as a tree stump. This movie is a whitewashed grave: nice cinematography, but once you look past the pretty movie pictures, you see it's dead inside.<br/><br/>0/10"
"CyrusBBales","5","20","38","25 February 2008"," A Whole Lot Of Nothing
","THERE WILL BE BLOOD<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood,is a film that has picked up a lot of notoriety for the past few months, picking up steam towards it's inevitable Oscar success. However, there has been a significant movement of critics who's opinions of the movie lie further downstream than originally thought.<br/><br/>The film is about, well not much at all to be honest. Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a man obsessed with the oil trade just after the turn of the century(1900's). The film follows his acquisition of a new property and the drilling of oil that follows.<br/><br/>Daniel Day -Lewis, who is probably collecting an Oscar as I write this, has received a lot of acclaim for his performance, which to be honest is rather undue. A decent portrayal is most certainly there, but through Daniel Day-Lewis and the script we're never allowed to get into any sort of relationship or suchlike with the character. It's only in the second half of the film that we really get a sense of quality performance, which whilst above average, gives nothing exceptional as the viewer feels nothing either way for the character.<br/><br/>The writing is rather on the dull side. Most of the screen time is taken up by mid-shots of actors staring blankly, or uttering each line of dialogue several times over. Whilst there are moments of creative writing and impelling speeches, the overall outcome is pretty much detached from the viewer.<br/><br/>To consider the point of this film is a very interesting notion, as Daniel Plainview fails to develop as a character at any stage of the film, and the narrative itself fails to offer the viewer something to take away in terms of a message or even portrayal of the story itself. Cinematography offers us no greater meaning, no further insight in this filmic world or even reflections of our own. This lack of any real substance leaves the film feeling rather empty overall, with a few semi-emotional scenes spattered throughout which is really just not even close to being enough.<br/><br/>Direction is simply wonderful at a few select moments, but the emphasis is on few. Generally we find ourselves staring at the image of a character doing not an awful lot, or an uneventful scene overlaid with unfocused music ranging from orchestral to electronica, in a repetitive pattern. Moments have been described as almost 'Welles-esque', but these sections are far from Citizen Kane, as a few minutes of something between homage and the plagiarised meets our eyes. The ending almost like something straight out Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange'. All in all, director Paul Thomas Anderson shows not style of his own nor consistency as most of the film remains void of directorial mastery.<br/><br/>Overall, There Will Be Blood is a definite let down, over two and a half hours with a few impressive scenes and one solid performance, but nothing else at all. The movie feels like an empty egg shell without the substance of a yoke inside, very much lacking in all departments and hugely disappointing. Not without it's qualities however, but certainly nothing special whatsoever."
"digitalchic","1","14","25","24 February 2008"," Paul Thomas Anderson's huge disappointment
","I feel duped by the reviews of this movie and that 2.5 hours of my life were wasted. I now know not to trust movie critics. How can so many people give this move 10 stars? How can this movie be in the top 25 movies of all time? I am baffled. I have been literally angry that I wasted my time, and that this movie is so highly rated. I understood from the reviews that this movie would be nothing like Magnolia or Boogie Nights, but at least expected a captivating movie with an interesting plot given Paul Thomas Anderson's other triumphs and the raving reviews from other users and film critics. If you like Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies, don't think for a second you will like this movie. Apparently a lot of people do, so maybe you will be one of them, but many of you will hate it. One of the greatest things about his other movies (specifically Magnolia) is that, even though many of the characters are ""bad people"", the characters and the story line are developed so well that the movie elicits an emotional roller coaster...you feel disdain for some characters, then you feel sorry for the characters, and even feel compassion for those same characters at other points in the movie. The only emotion I felt in this movie was disgust and hatred for the main character, and no emotion for any of the other characters which were few.<br/><br/>The movie was so damn boring I almost fell asleep several times during the movie. I understood why this director's other movies were so long...the plots were so intricate that they required that much time to play out. This movie is plagued by an editing crisis. There was enough plot in this movie for about one - 1.5 hours of movie. At least if there is going to be such a lame plot, the movie could have some character development. There was only one character really, and I kept wondering when they were going to explain why he was such a hateful human being, give us some glimpse into the main character's lack of a heart, the slightest granule of a background or if he even had a childhood, but nothing ever came! Just a VERY drawn out sequence of events and acts of immorality that I had no compassion for, because I didn't know or care about any of the other characters. For the main character there was absolutely nothing to feel except contempt...I didn't feel sorry for, compassion for, empathy or understanding for the main character. So at the end of the movie, after waiting for a revelation of the point of the movie, it never came. I sat there wondering if all these people were crazy who had reviewed it, and if the film critics were paid bribes to give this film the ratings it was given. The acting was pretty good, although like many others it's pretty apparent that Daniel Day Lewis overacted this part. I guess it was the screen play and editing that really made this movie suffer. Paul Thomas Anderson's newest work is a disappointment, a waste of almost 3 hours, and a complete ruin of a coveted Saturday night."

","As a struggling silver miner, Daniel Plainview scrapes together a living until he stumbles upon a more profitable route for this talents  oil drilling. Starting small with one crew and one pitch, the film follows the growth of Plainview's business as he starts to expand. When he learns of oil-rich land out west in California, he and his young son head out there to capture the land and the rights to drill in the area. It is here that he meets the aspiring preacher Eli Sunday, who is interested in what the oil profits can do for his church. As with many of his recent ventures, this new location is a success although, with every victory and crushed competitor, Plainview's drive and ambition grows and consumes all around him.<br/><br/>I had heard so much hype and praise for this film on its release that I decided to wait a while before going to see it; after all then someone is saying that it ""rewrites cinema"" (or words to that effect) then it is hard to come to it as an individual without feeling the pressure to praise it and love it so as to not stand out from the crowd. Recently I watched it and was pleased by how easily I was drawn into it but also how quickly the three hour running time flew past. From the very start the story-telling begins and through simple scenes we come to understand the drive and sacrifice made by Plainview to even have a foot on the ladder. It is to the film's credit that it does not paint him as unworthy of the success he will find this way and the viewer is not able to hate him for his intrepid spirit and hard work. It goes without saying that the film follows the logical extension of his drive to succeed and that the next two-thirds of the film presents a much harsher and unpleasant side to this ambition.<br/><br/>It is a subject I have often wondered about because the CEO of where I work is in his sixties but is still working and active, making hundreds of thousands each day with shares movements and deals  what makes him keep going when he could clearly just pack it in, buy an island and sit on it. Well, whatever it is, it is probably the same motivation that got him to the position he is in. I am not in any way aligning the two men, but with There Will Be Blood, this is very much the crux of the film as it is a character piece looking at Plainview in this regard. The way it does it is with patience and intelligence so that it is never a matter of one act that pushes him too far, or one moment that flicks a switch within him but rather that it is simple, logical and totally natural for this character. I do think that the conclusion perhaps could have been better but otherwise it is a faultless piece of work.<br/><br/>Visually the film is striking. Not for any one image or moment of style though, but for the endlessly eye-catching framing of shots or positioning of the camera. The canvas of the western is of course present but we are never staring at it and somehow, even as two characters greet each other by a pipe being buried against a wide horizon, we are still focused on the tiny characters. A lot of this has to do with an utterly convincing performance from Daniel Day Lewis  it has been said loads but I cannot help but repeat how good it is. Again, it is not down to one moment that can be used as a clip for the Oscars but rather a complete immersion in the character so that he is able to convince whether as a man starting out or a man who is at the end of his life. No matter how impressive the visuals, you never take your eyes of him. To me he is the whole film and the support cast do struggle by being in his shadow to a certain extent, but mostly they all still work. Dano is probably the secondary most important character in the piece and he does pretty well with it although he doesn't really seem to age across the film, which I found distracting and detracting from his work.<br/><br/>Along with the visual structure, the use of music is impressive, never forcing its way over the action and only ever being part of what is happening  it is the Academy's loss that they ""couldn't"" recognise the score because the absence of this film makes them look daft. Indeed, in hindsight, so does the dominance at the awards of No Country For Old Men and it should have been more of an even split because they are both very good and very thoughtful films  although for me There Will Be Blood has it over the Cohen's here. OK it is not as entertaining or as accessible a film as that thriller but it is much more engaging and interesting in what it does. From script through acting, filming, scoring and total delivery, it is a magnificent film."

","I just don't understand the Academy Awards rating system. This movie was such a drag. I tried really hard to appreciate it, but I couldn't find anything to attach myself to in order to stick with it. Everyone was just so dam weird and unlikeable. I couldn't make it to the end to find out if there was a point to this sad character mess. I didn't want to know how it ended. I made it about 3/4 of the way through by telling myself, ""any minute now this is going to turn in to a 'Best Picture of the Year' event"". It was so slow and so boring and I wasn't even that impressed with Daniel Day Lewis. He was slow and boring. I think Tom Hanks got a raw deal and for that matter, everything about Charlie Wilson's War was better than this one. Certainly Juno had so much more to offer. What exactly are the members of the academy voting on? Certainly not quality entertainment. Guess I'll have to check out the People's Choice Awards this year."

","I thought based on the genre and overall rating of this movie that it might be worth watching. In the end I find that I have wasted 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back.<br/><br/>The ""award winning"" musical score consists of a horrible screeching noise that I would compare to fingers on a chalk board. The movie does contain some very good acting, but this cannot overcome the fact that there is no plot. At one hour into the movie I was asking myself what big event, what life changing statement was going to come out of this movie to justify my time spent watching it. Unfortunately, at the end I was still asking myself the same question.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie was trying to point out that the main character was a jerk and that he could have wealth but not a good life. Big deal, I can see that every day, I don't need a movie to tell me. Perhaps the movie was trying to document the techniques used for turn of the century oil drilling. A documentary would have been much more informative."

","So I've charged myself with the task of reviewing this movie because I sat through a very long 2.5 hours watching this Hollywood ""earthquake seepage,"" with the complete and total intention of loving it. Everything i have read about this movie had peaked my interests and titillated my taste buds. I guess the point of my little intro here, is that i could not have been more willing to accept this movie as one of the all-time greats.<br/><br/>When i woke up this morning and went out to my car to go to work, i noticed that all my crap inside had been thrown around and my ipod had been stolen from the console. At least this incident, in which someone broke into my car overnight, was able to take my mind off of what a horrible movie this was...for a little while. I'd sooner forgive the soulless piece of garbage who stole my wonderful MP3 player, than Paul Thomas Anderson for taking a dump on a stack of papers and calling it a script. ""there will be blood"" has no substance, or storyline, or plot whatsoever. I could not agree more with the people who reviewed this movie as being awful. I also feel vindicated in accusing it of being a bunch of random, pointless scenes, loosely tied together to create a very unfulfilling ""story."" I'm not sure who in America really liked this movie, and why it is that they really liked this movie. This is the slowest, most improperly titled movie i've ever come across. For a movie named ""there will be blood"" to not have any real violence until after an hour and a forty minutes of some ancient western scenery and a delusional soundtrack had gone by, sounds like grounds for a ""false advertising"" suit. There was more blood in one ""problem child"" movie than the 3 hours of dreary, incompetent, confusing, and misguided story-telling of this movie.<br/><br/>real quickly on the soundtrack, Punch Drunk Love featured an un-mistakingly similar score...and it was marvelously perfect for that movie. If you're going to want this movie to sound like Punch Drunk Love, that's fine, just don't make it LOOK LIKE TOMBSTONE...<br/><br/>I do see how much potential there really is for this movie to take shape and find an intriguing direction to go in, instead all your privy to is the inappropriate soundtrack, lack of substantial supporting characters, and an un-earthing of a secret from young HW's past that really needed to become more than it was.<br/><br/>I watch movies constantly, I guess it's a side-effect of being an only child, or I just really enjoy the stories, histories, and experiences others have had, brought out into a film. In any case, i'd love to rally as much support as possible to have these people (who enjoyed this movie) to have their eyes opened...OUT DEMONS...OUT GHOSTS, AS LONG AS I HAVE A SOUL I WILL HATE YOU, AS LONG AS I HAVE A REMOTE I WILL 'STOP' YOU, AS LONG AS I HAVE A MOUTH I WILL SCORN YOU...LEAVE NOW 'THERE WILL BE BLOOD' AND NEVER RETURN!!!!"

","This film desperately needs an editor, but even with editing you would not come out with a dramatic, tension-filled conflict. It may be desired and may be hinted at, but there is no conflict played out by the actors in this film. What does this film mean? The oil man and religious never play off each other,they do separate scenes--usually kooky--but they do not relate to each other. Is it about greed? I thought the oil man was a hard worker and smart, and generous in what he offered to town. The religious aspect failed as a serious examination because of the bizarre acting. There was one interesting moment when Lewis brings up the little girl to christen the well and cheats the evangelist of his hoped for moment of fame.<br/><br/>The music is abominable; cliché use of themes for scary, moving, enormous, etc. It tells you what to feel but often what you simultaneously see on the screen does not match the music's dramatic theme. And, it overwhelms you--this is not a musical or an opera.<br/><br/>How could a film this poorly crafted get out of its cage?"

","This film was not true to its trailer or the ballyhoo. <br/><br/>Seems all a studio has to do these days is exploit the words, 'Blood', 'Evil' or 'Death' in a film title to get today's violence-rabid video game audience to buy tickets; that strategy has worked here. However, it was apparent last night the packed house was expecting astonishing raw action akin to the oft-compared, ""No Country for Old Men"" ...and were greatly disappointed as was I. <br/><br/>(NCFOM is a grisly film depicting endless murder scenes which I abhor yet told in a edge-of-your-seat thrill I admired since the eventual hopelessness it depicts matches what would most likely happen from similar events).<br/><br/>With TWBB, I did not seek violence as much as I sought a similar thrilling film experience -- which did not every occur in the three hours' running time of plodding scrutiny of central characters I did not understand, doing things I did not care about! <br/><br/>Since I don't 'get' Daniel Day-Lewis and never saw one film he's made, to see a role he prepared wha? six years for is a big stretch as I'm sure researching ways to talk like Calvin Coolidge cannot take that long! (Also, how can it be that in 1898 everyone has straggly hair yet DDL has a perfectly coifed 1940's hair-do throughout the film?)<br/><br/>Therefore, on many levels except for the sets and styling, this film is pure rubbish!<br/><br/>Also, the after-thought, sub-plot of debunking a faith healer as some sort of stab at Christianity was heresy beyond belief.<br/><br/>A sham minister is a sham minister but from some audience responses, it was clear some people thought this revelation of a sham faith healer validated their own mis-guided agnostic beliefs when greedy DDL makes the preacher humiliate his religion for money.<br/><br/>If there is some ersatz sub-text that oil represented today's Big Oil money and the preacher stood for today's fanatical religious right most people (especially downtown hipsters) cannot deal with...then the director missed the mark entirely.<br/><br/>The film IS shocking to me because I wasted time to see it.<br/><br/>If it gets any awards at all it will be solely due to Hollywood's romance with its own hype!"

"temsayed","5","17","32","2 March 2008"," Frustrating
","I was eager to see this film for months but my wife had no interest. Finally, I got a free Sunday to take in this film after reading innumerable reviews calling it an instant ""classic"" and ""masterpiece."" I kept hearing about this ""descent into evil"" that we are supposed to witness in Daniel Plainview, and I expected that, in a film entitled ""There Will Be Blood,"" there would be blood. I was anticipating a convincing transformation from mere ambition to amorality, in the manner of Michael Corleone - in my opinion, The Godfather Parts 1-2 are my gold standard for a charismatic hero tragically brought down by hubris and greed, devolving before the viewers' eyes until the same character we admire in the beginning becomes truly horrific and despicable. In Corleone's case, he clings to an internally consistent logic in his behavior - defense of family honor and loyalty to the larger cause. In the case of Daniel Day-Lewis' Plainview, we see no such (d)evolution. Instead, we hear an audio assault of TOTALLY inappropriately dramatic violin and percussion spasms which bear no relationship to the events unfolding on the screen, while we watch DDL brilliantly inhabit a character who instills in us a sense of dread about what is going to happen ... except ... it never quite does. While I sat engrossed in the lines and stubble of DDL's weary face and kept trying to anticipate what event would mark the dramatic turning point that leads Plainview to make his tragic choices, that point never arrives. For reasons never clear or logically portrayed, Plainview develops an enormous hatred for Eli the preacher that is far out of proportion to any real encounter that could explain the animus. All of a sudden he beats the preacher up but even that scene plays more comically than forebodingly. While DDL made me believe from the outset that his character was capable of a transformation to extreme violence and hatred, I never fully understood what would ultimately motivate them - his adopted son's accident and inability to continue as a partner and heir to his business? A teenaged charlatan preacher who embodies the worst of hypocrisy in organized religion? A big-oil representative who insults Plainview's parenting skills? A scam artist masquerading as the half-brother we have no reason to believe Plainview would ever have known or cared about otherwise? What the heck is going on here? Plainview lashes out, perhaps from the same frustration the viewer is feeling, at the pointlessness of it all. After reading media reviews about DDL's menacing performance as a ""murderous"" oilman, I was extremely disappointed that his two acts of murder seem like such exaggerated responses to minimal injustices suffered by Plainview. At least in the case of a Michael Corleone or a Bill the Butcher, we can understand what it is that causes the antihero to become a frank villain - in Plainview's case, it is plainly not in view. Thus do all of DDL's amazing talents ultimately go to waste in pursuit of a nonstory.<br/><br/>The cinematography was superb and the pacing, slow as it is, could have been perfect if the character arc had any logic. Instead of an arc, we have a flatline punctuated by impulse function spikes in intensity, which makes for an ultimately dissatisfying watching experience. This movie could have been so phenomenal, if only there were an actual story to care about. The other actors do what I would consider no better than a serviceable job in their roles; the young boy is mostly mute even before he loses his hearing and Paul Dano has an irritating milquetoast facies that could have been truly creepy if only Eli's motivations for his hyperreligiosity and hypocrisy were ever explained. Instead, I just found him to be an irritating weeny. BTW, I for one can not stand when characters who are supposed to be aging in a film show no physical change despite the alleged passage of several years in the storyline. Paul Dano shows absolutely NO evidence of aging over the same timespan that H.W.'s character transforms from a 10 year old boy to a man in his mid-twenties. We are denied any demonstration of the transition undergone by the characters as we move from the oil prospecting years to the depiction of Plainview as a crazy old Kane in his mansion in the final scenes. Why are we supposed to believe that Plainview would so deeply resent or hate H.W. at that point, or that all the apparent affection he showed the boy through most of the film would be instantaneously snuffed out? Again, compare this to Corleone in the Godfather - we watch Pacino physically transform from a doe-eyed young idealist into a weathered, wrinkled, unsmiling, aged loner staring vacantly with resolve, if not remorse, at his dissolution and we are convinced of it because it has played out with a logical, linear plot line. <br/><br/>As for Paul Thomas Anderson, I am still at a loss to understand why people think this guy is a genius. Other than Boogie Nights and marrying the supremely talented Maya Rudolph, most of his other choices have perplexed me. I for one HATED Punch Drunk Love (another pointless exercise in self-indulgent, albeit gorgeous, cinematography that fails to advance a storyline) and never quite got through Magnolia.<br/><br/>This is probably a movie I would sit through again on the small screen just because I find DDL engaging, but I would not recommend anyone spend 3 hours and $10 in a theater to end up just as frustrated. Finally, for a movie entitled ""There Will Be Blood,"" there wasn't nearly enough of it - the deaths are fairly bloodless, in fact, and nowhere near as uncomfortably gruesome as those in ""No Country for Old Men."" Both this movie and that one have unsatisfying auteurish endings that basically defeat the purpose of the great acting that precede them."

I had no expectations going in - hadn't even seen the trailer - but left wanting my time and money back. I urge others to avoid this movie and beware of the phony positive reviews from those that worked on the set (amazing what only a few people can do to get a few thousand votes in).<br/><br/>On a positive note, I thought the score/sound was interesting and well done.

We are ""told"" the whys, but we can't see under skins of the characters.<br/><br/>& that's why it's such an unsatisfying film - by the time get to see the final scene & appreciate the acting (again) we feel cheated. Because we are left with a desolate, bitter drunk who's hurt himself more than anyone else. & we've heard that one before, & with more punch, panache, brevity & passion. I didn't need to sit through this long film to get that pay off - it's not enough, cuz I coulda been watching Escape from New York & drinking a beer!<br/><br/>And what bugged me most, & leads me to believe the director had no idea how to use his considerable resources, is that Ciaran Hinds is utterly wasted - he could have added some dark depth & a show of dedication in his relationship to the man we see baldly as a liar & a scoundrel. Hinds is shot so he almost slinks off the screen; perhaps his small on-screen time is due to editing down a cumbersome film & keeping the action moving. Pity.

","With There Will Be Blood I was expecting to see something truly epic and memorable. What I actually saw was an excruciatingly long, often boring and not at all memorable let down. It's been a while since I've been in a cinema and people have walked out before the end of the film, but it happened twice during the movie and I wish I'd joined them.<br/><br/>What began as excitement at seeing this film quickly evaporated and turned to mind numbing boredom, inter-spaced with occasional moments of entertainment. However these are few and far between and you'll be left wondering when the story is going to start and your mind is going to be engaged by what's happening on screen. The plot is uninteresting and incredibly slow and nothing seems to connect very well. At the end (if you survive that long) you will be left wondering what the point of it all was as well as what the hell happened and why.<br/><br/>The movie is also accompanied by a truly horrible soundtrack which plays far too often and really grates. Imagine nails chalkboard annoying and you're almost there. The final nail in the coffin but also the one saving grace of the movie is that the serious bits of the film are actually really very funny, but be wary of laughing too loudly because you may annoy the people that are pretending to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to love this film, I will always think back on it as being a hugely prententious disappointment and thats a massive shame, especially when you look at all the acclaim it received and in my opinion didn't deserve."
"Grant_Price","3","10","17","15 February 2008"," There Will Be Boredom
","After reading all the hype surrounding There Will Be Blood (Daniel-Day Lewis's Academy Award nominated performance, Paul Thomas Anderson's directing, the cinematography etc) I expected the pièce de résistance of 2007 cinema. However, it was actually more disappointing than American Gangster. Sure I may (and most probably have) missed the point of TWBB, but even if I did get it, I doubt I would have been any more entertained. It really was boring. The story, the characters, the setting, everything. Well, everything except Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance as conflicted small-time oil baron Daniel Plainview is exceptional. So is his mantastic moustache. If the whole film was stripped down to him offering profound monologues on various turn-of-the-century American Midwest sets, it would be acceptable. He really was the only factor maintaining my interest in the film, although he should still lose the Academy Award to Viggo Mortensen. However, if there was an award for hobbling duck walks, Day-Lewis would win by a mile.<br/><br/>One particularly irritating aspect of TWBB is the character Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. Yes, I realise he's supposed to be irritating; that does not make his screeching voice or perpetual presence any easier to accommodate. Though evidently supposed to be a focal point of TWBB, his very existence drags the already unpromising premise (Oil! Wow!) into insipid mess territory. I cheered (well I didn't, but I could have) every time something bad happened to him, which was not often enough. Another annoying character is Plainview's 'son', H.W, who we're supposed to feel sorry for, for some reason. Considering his total absence of character development and the way he magically ages about ten years near the end of the film, the only feeling he evokes is puzzlement and indifference. And they're pretty much the only people I can recall. Oh, except for Plainview's long lost 'brother', the human equivalent of a plank of wood with a moustache drawn on by a Biro which has been chewed on incessantly by a moron. <br/><br/>Other than Daniel Day-Lewis, the only positive aspect that can be taken from TWBB is the score composed by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. Paranoid and edgy, it fits the bleak atmosphere of the film perfectly. Actually, I would rather just listen to the score on its own. Although then it would remind me that I watched this in the first place. Great, everything is ruined.<br/><br/>So, don't bother watching this turgid shambles unless for some reason you derive some kind of sadomasochistic pleasure from boring yourself stupid. Instead, just download the soundtrack instead and listen to it free from lingering, unwanted vestiges of There Will Be Blood invading your thoughts. To amend a quote by Plainview, ""That wasN'T one goddamn helluva show."""
"cmarra1020","3","10","17","5 February 2008"," Absolutely Horrible
","And all three stars are for the Greenwood soundtrack, which is the best part of this movie. I've seen all five Academy Award nominated films for 2007, and this one is by far the worst. Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor, and he can't save this boring script, which meanders aimlessly through the years of his characters life without really digging deep into it, or any other characters for that matter. It also seems like every P.T Andersen movie since Boogie Nights (brilliant I might add) gets progressively worse, and with ""blood"" he's really hit bottom. I really wanted to like this movie, and was ready to give up several times, but stuck it out. I would rather have watched Juno or Michael Clayton again. And I can think of a couple of movies which should have been nominated for Best Picture over this one. Save your money, and more importantly, your time."

"asda-man","10","5","7","19 March 2013"," There is a classic
","I heard a lot of praise and superlatives for There Will Be Blood with critics calling it a 'masterpiece' a 'classic' and Daniel Day Lewis' performance being hailed as one of the best performances in cinematic history. Thus my expectations were high and surprisingly they were met. There Will Be Blood astonished me right from its sublime opening. We're introduced to a fabulous shot of somewhat threatening desert mountains with The Shining-esque dissident music playing over it, immediately giving the film a sinister quality. Then we're showed the corruption of Daniel Plainview as he discovers oil by accident and elaborately draws it out, presented entirely with no dialogue, just striking direction and visuals. It's a gripping sequence and the film doesn't let up from there.<br/><br/>Let's start with the visuals. There Will Be Blood features some of the most stunning cinematography I've ever witnessed. Sometimes it looked as though it was a stunning oil painting (pun kind of intended) with awe-inspiring shots of landscape, almost eating up our anti-hero. Daniel is often presented in raw close-ups like the characters in Les Miserables, giving him a domineering look throughout the film. Daniel is so powerful that he even controls when the film is going to end with a haunting, ""I'm finished."" Paul Thomas Anderson (who's works I've never seen before) directs with amazement. There are often very few camera shots, focusing on the intensity of our protagonist.<br/><br/>And let's face it, There Will Be Blood succeeds so spectacularly because of it's terrifically memorable main character. At it's heart, There Will Be Blood is a character study and an intense one at that. Daniel is basically in every scene and he's a compelling character to watch. At first I felt admiration for his ambition, but then we see him turn into someone totally ruthless, filled with greed and anger. I also loved how the two contrasting characters of Daniel and the preacher interacted. The preacher thinks he's some sort of God, whereas Daniel could be alluded to Satan, however in the end the preacher and Daniel are nigh on opposite sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>Of course, the character of Daniel Plainview is made all that more compelling thanks to the other Daniel that's playing him. Daniel Day Lewis is truly electrifying and is up there with Heath Ledger's stonking performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He has a wonderful charisma about him, he's a great public speaker and has great ambition. However, he turns into someone almost psychotic. I found the final moments to be the most memorable and haunting as we see Daniel in the future, clearly succeeded, but has he? It's here that Daniel Day Lewis is at his most intense and jaw-dropping, helped by the wonderful writing.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a tour-de-force of writing. It sometimes reminded me of Quentin Tarantino as it often featured long scenes of dialogue, but written with such suspense it made it all the more gripping. All the characters are developed wonderfully, but of course it's Daniel that we're focused on most. The directing also reminded me of Stanley Kubrick at times, filled with atmosphere and dread just like the extraordinary, The Shining. One of the most intense sequences features Daniel getting baptised in Church in order to secure an oil deal. It's jaw-dropping to watch as one of my favourite critics Chris Tookey pointed out that Daniel is full of rage, yet also genuinely calling out to God. It's quite heart-breaking.<br/><br/>After seeing There Will Be Blood I thought that it deserved a definite 9/10. However, it's been almost 48 hours after watching it and it's still swimming around in my head. I also felt utterly compelled to buy it on blu-ray (as I catched the film on the telly) which is certainly telling. Thus, I have to give it the perfect 10/10 as it just resonates in your mind. Plus it just feels right to do so at the moment. There Will Be Blood is an unforgettable film which you'll either get or you won't. I loved the atmospheric music and atmosphere which prevailed throughout the film. Daniel Day Lewis gives an astonishing performance, playing one of the best characters in the film world. It's final moments completely amazed me and immediately made me want to see it again as it's heft two and a half hour running time flew by. There Will Be Blood is a true masterpiece and an utter modern classic not to be missed!"

","An immense steamroller of a film. Much that has been said about this jaw dropping film served to put me off watching it for a long time. However that just made it better when it finally happened! Day Lewis is quite brilliant and dominates every scene he appears in, indeed he even matches the majesty of the wild scenery and industrial landscapes so startlingly depicted.<br/><br/>The score is a very important part of this film and drives the narrative to such an extent that I felt very uneasy at times, such was it's power. Indeed unease for me is the central emotion generated by this brooding film, one which asks many uncomfortable questions from the viewer and returns far from pleasant answers about the nature of humanity and our relationship with each other and the landscape we inhabit.<br/><br/>Religion and it's place in modern capitalist society is another central theme and again a subject from which uncomfortable conclusions are made. In all an engrossing, affecting film which shall inhabit my imagination for some time!"

","Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricaturesand that is not a good thing.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed ""masterpiece!"", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.<br/><br/>To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).<br/><br/>The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a ""nail-on-chalkboard"" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.<br/><br/>For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.<br/><br/>I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.<br/><br/>Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) that the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition)."

","I wanted to like this film. I truly did. How could all of those critics and Awards panels be wrong? It was always going to be unlikely, with Daniel Day Lewis having the lead role, but sometimes an over-rated actor can put in a great performance (Tom Hanks in The Green Mile being a case in point).<br/><br/>But this was just another over the top performance from a mediocre actor who for some reason gets the critics excited.<br/><br/>He's not the only problem though. There is not a single likable character in this film - even HW, the 'son' of Daniel Plainview, is happy to rip off the landowners at his tender age.<br/><br/>The pacing was slow to the point of 'GET ON WITH IT!' and the directing was lazy. Any director can get a bad performance out of Day Lewis - they all have so far. How about trying something new, like getting him to put in a subtle, understated performance? Is that too much to ask? The rest of the casting was no better, with Paul Dano being woefully cast as the smug, self-serving Eli.<br/><br/>The entire film has no direction, it just plays out like a rather boring episode from someone's life, and you don't care what happens to any of the characters.<br/><br/>The son being struck deaf should have been a traumatic moment for the viewer, but it's so badly done, so clichéd (Struck deaf by his 'father's' true love (oil)). Is that really the best they could come up with? This film has nothing to recommend it to anyone looking to be entertained."

","I had heard about what a great movie ""There Will Be Blood"" is. A friend of my family said that she didn't really like the movie, but described a certain sound in it.<br/><br/>Well, now that I've seen the movie, there are a few things that I can say about it. First, Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing the completely maniacal, amoral, self-aggrandizing oil magnate Daniel Plainview. Second, Plainview's speech about how he'll bring all the modern amenities to the small town; that brings to mind the fact that the whole American west now does have all those things...they put all these things in the middle of the desert, prompting everyone to use a lot of water, resulting in water shortages. Third, the subject of petroleum calls to mind present-day international politics. Finally, I would say that Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano each individually are better than the movie as a whole (not to diminish the film).<br/><br/>Probably the most intense scene is the final segment: there's what Plainview does to his son and then to Paul Sunday (or is it Eli?). All in all, it not only adds up to a very good movie, but Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"") is showing himself to be a very good director."

","Anderson is the best American director working with big budgets, period. Which screenwriter who has penned a masterpiece on paper (and not wanting to do the dirty work themselves) would not want Paul making their film? I have the highest regard for him. The highest. In the league with Mikhalkov and Almodovar. I think I know what's wrong with this film. To me the catchism ""character study"" has always been a cop out for not making a film which works on what Robert Mckee terms the ""extra personal"" level of conflict. That, or has not classically arced the character which feels completely wrong for this film. It is fantastic to begin to show this devastating greed of the American flavor in such detail, but to what ends? To the spiritual and moral devastation of one man, but so what, meaning that what Anderson has here is the primordial greed that is still destroying this country, and with what he has written it is not enough to make an aesthetically definitive statement on how it effects everyone of us.<br/><br/>Many people are confused by its message, as they were with the central message of Magnolia...which was unavoidable actually..(who's fault is it that people aren't versed in the Bible....The plague will come if we don't wise up.) <br/><br/>If the film were to have shown, for example, how this redoubtable myopia affected at least the townspeople already in the film, or to write more emboldened (WARNING: The budget just went up considerably) if Mr. Plainview becomes Senator Plainview and naturally continues his cultivated habits of the perfect businessman really in the political arena, then we would start to care, because then it would be plain to comprehend and appreciate what a felt monster this character truly has become, and the consequences of the propagation of this cherished American ethos (when unchecked by other forces like religion, or love of family) when applied unilaterally ....work hard, be number one, etc. This film does not go far enough."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","9","16 February 2008"," Dano holding his own against Day-Louis to the last point in the tiebreaker for the match
","Magnolia's (1999) director Paul Thomas Anderson tells the story of turn-of-the-(20th)century oil legend Daniel Plainview (fictional character) in such a solidly linear fashion that it can almost be divided into chapters (as some other movies do). The focus of the chapters is in the scenes highly-charged with palpable tension, so mesmerizing that the audience will not notice the passage of the some 160 minutes. In addition to rewarding the audience generously for the admission price they paid, these scenes also serve admirably for Plainview's character development.<br/><br/>Among this rich pageantry of cinematic feast, the particularly memorable ones are Plainview's initially punishing experience as a lone oil prospector, his adoption of an orphan infant H.W., his brilliant speech to small sellers of potentially oil-rich land, his several duels (throughout the movie) with evangelist fanatic priest Eli Sunday, his exuberance at striking oil and his devastation at his adopted son going deaf, his soulful conversation with brother Henry that he never knew he had, his violent reaction to perspective buyers unintended insult of offering to buy him off so that he can have enough time to care for his deaf son, his even more violent reaction upon finding out that Henry is an impostor, his reluctant baptism as a price to buy the only piece of land that stands in his way of constructing a pipeline that will free him from the clutch of his rivals and finally, the dramatic conclusions (which many have pointed out, quite legitimately, have become a tad melodramatic).<br/><br/>Needless to say, this movie is all Daniel Day-Lewis. Right from the charismatic speech in which his eyes, brows and lips collaborate to portray the contradictory and controversial Daniel Plainview both from the surface and inside, the audience sees this self-centered, pragmatic and ruthless man take shape with chilling intimacy. At the same time, his simple longing for kinship from his adopted son and impostor brother exudes an irresistible demand on the audience for their sympathy.<br/><br/>Due credit however must also be given to Paul Duno whose portrayal of the disturbed brother in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) was quite unforgettable. In ""There will be blood"", in the mental and psychological duel of soulless religious pseud with ruthless capitalist that is not unlike a see-saw tennis game, young talent Duno stays up there with veteran Day-Lewis up to the last minute, holding his own. His portrayal of Eli Sunday would have been exactly the way Richard Dawkins wanted had the author of ""The God delusion"" been the director of this movie. It's unfortunate that he ran up against Javier Bardem for best supporting actor in BAFTA, and a gross injustice that he was not even nominated for either Golden Globe or Oscar.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie that will not go unnoticed is its background music that continuously threatens to take the foreground. It is good  creative use of percussion and favourite pulsating strings used liberally for mood-enhancing and tension building  but at times just a little overwhelming."
"Turfseer","3","13","24","10 February 2008"," One-dimensional portrait of American businessman
","I haven't read Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"" which ""There will be blood"" is based on but I understand that the main character in the movie is depicted as being far more demonic than the character shown in the book. So apparently it's the screenwriter who we can heap scorn upon here and not the novelist responsible for the original source material.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson, the screenwriter, has borrowed a page from the second half of ""Citizen Kane"" where a multi-dimensional character suddenly morphs into a one-dimensional bad guy. But in ""There will be Blood"", our anti-hero, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is one-dimensional throughout! There seems to be a mantra uttered these days that Day-Lewis's performance is a masterpiece and he deserves the Oscar. Except for a few dramatic angry outbursts, Day-Lewis's performance appears to me as entirely one-note! That's really the fault of the screenwriter, who believes in the ""I'm not OKyou're not OK"" school of screen writing. Make your character someone who openly admits that he has contempt for everybody and also (unconsciously) dislikes himself. <br/><br/>Anderson's Plainview is a metaphor for big business past and present. It's a puerile view of American business and American businessmen since no one is like that in real life. Evil characters need to have likable and hence charismatic characteristicsthey attain their objectives by seducing their constituents (e.g. Tony Soprano). One wonders how such a surly and nasty character as Plainview actually succeeds. Notice how the peripheral characters in this film have virtually nothing to saythey are completely underdeveloped. The screenwriter is content to explore only his relationships with three main characters, his son, Eli, the minister and his pseudo half-brother (who he ends up killing after he realizes that the man is really a con artist). <br/><br/>One wonders why Plainview has to be so demonic and unlikable. Would a person whose main goal is to be successful jeopardize his entire career by murdering the man who pretended to be his brother? Would a person who purportedly did everything for his handicapped son throughout the boy's childhood suddenly turn around and disown him simply because he wants to move away with his wife and start his own company in Mexico? And finally, does it make ANY SENSE AT ALL that he would risk imprisonment by murdering the minister who comes begging to him after he's lost all his money in the stock market crash? I understand that Plainview was getting back at Eli for humiliating him after he was forced to undergo Baptism in order to lease the land from one of the parishioners, but to suddenly murder the fellow with a bowling pin at the end made no sense at all!<br/><br/>""There will be blood"" is melodrama which descends into cheap propaganda. While Daniel Day-Lewis will probably win for best actor (and I don't think he should), my prediction is that this picture will not win the Oscar. The truth of the matter is that it's too much of a downerand downers don't win Oscars!"
"Quinoa1984","10","19","38","5 January 2008"," Who has the milkshake?
","Curious that both of the two best films of the year (the other No Country for Old Men)- likely two of the most daring and great of American films I've ever encountered- both are measured, classically told stories of the pit of greed that encapsulates in the soulless. In the case of Paul Thomas Anderson's film, he uses a source which, as one might expect if one's read Upton Sinclair, there are as many metaphors to be had as blood. <br/><br/>But not poorly laid metaphors at all, or ones that hit you on the head without reason or proper impact. These are the kinds that enrich a work of art, where they can be thought of later as with the themes, while in the midst of things you're just wrapped up in the solar-plexus of the story, and more crucially the storytelling. Daniel Plainview is a prospector at the start of the picture who has an image of himself, one that must never be broken. He digs for silver, then digs for oil, and strikes it rich. But he wants more. He buys up land from an Able Holiday, who's closest related Eli is welcoming, but at a price that the Lord has set (assumingly). Soon there is much oil, lots of it, and a pipeline as well. Eventually, like CF Kane, he's by himself in his big, dark mansion, without a Rosebud to boot.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is such a great character because he is, as played to complete astonishment and embodiment by Daniel Day Lewis (reincarnating, ever so slightly, his volcanic performance in Gangs of New York), a servant to a God that leaves nothing in its wake. He and Eli, in a more-than-subtle sense, are kindred spirits: they worship their idols, one being money and one being God, but they also have a commonality, which is that what they want is never really enough, and what they want relies on those around them at their blind will. When the two, after years of ""ups and downs"" as Plainview says, have their final meeting in the bowling alley, it becomes less a revelation than a staggering scene of hell. It's one of the most absurdly dramatic endings in all movies.<br/><br/>But there's also a greater metaphor, which is the oil itself (by the way, Sinclair's novel is titled ""Oil!"" with exclamation point). Anderson's picture is carefully constructed around a man who for capitalism is his lifeblood, for lack of a better term. The oil keeps flowing, and flowing, as does the money. But it's never really enough. There's an inherent fascination with watching a man, like Kane for example, who can never have enough because of a crucial defect in his humanity. No real friends, no real family (a re-emerging ""brother"" is a big sub-plot), and a son who, when a tragedy befalls him, can never be apart of his own self-created image. Rarely has a character been portrayed, by the actor as well as the director, in such a way that makes him so hateful, so unsympathetic, but never one we can look away from. It's capitalism unforgiven, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>And meanwhile, with his characters of Daniel and Eli locked in to the web of money and religion in the center, Anderson crafts a film loaded with visual beauty. He's a director known for elaborate long-takes and tracking shots, but here it's even more measured, more in tune with a classic epic, as though the Grapes of Wrath were turned on its head. The dialog cuts like a knife, the cinematography has a visionary quality that brings out the spectacle and the personal feeling (less mood, though there's that there too) of the compositions. And the music by Greenwood is unlike any ever produced, with strings and wailing chords that pierce right along with the narrative.<br/><br/>Altogether, it creates in There Will Be Blood a truly horrific and yet ever so recognizable truth in the American dream. And like No Country for Old Men, none of the characters have a ""happy"" ending. Not that a bleak ending a great films makes. But if it fits, it should be rode out till its logical conclusion. There Will Be Blood can be called all the big words- masterpiece, classic, essential, must-see, and that it's maker is worthy of comparison now (more than ever) to the great filmmakers of old. But it's above anything else a precise drama of conscience, or lack thereof. It's a fine, fine milkshake indeed."

","This film starts with a dark, almost demonic foreboding of doom and evil, accompanied by the harsh landscape and harsher score. The title also warns us of almost Biblical level horrors to come. An oil prospector works with grim determination, falls and presumably breaks his leg, finds oil and broken leg or no, somehow crawls to the claims office to stake his claim. This accident is the first of several. We see the human animal at it's lowest and meanest throughout the 150 minutes of this bitter film. The bottomless pit of capitalistic greed is pitted against religion, and if the first here defeats the latter - which is shown to be far from truly pious anyway - it does so by simultaneously destroying itself. The oil man's last line is 'I am finished' - and he truly is. He never really stopped falling ever since that first drop in the shaft. This is a riveting, nasty film, though there is some light in the almost fairy tale love that develops in the background between the oil man's adopted son and the preacher's younger sister, both of whom offer a ray of innocence in the general nastiness. The tale of the oil man's long lost brother adds one more nail in this coffin of human misery and despair. Performances by all are very fine with Paul Dano walking a fine line between innocence and cunning, while Daniel Day Lewis shows the human animal trapped by its own pride, greed and ambition into an almost frenzied desire to step all over its fellows, till there's no one left to threaten it's isolation."

","I've seen one Daniel Day-Lewis film before now (Gangs of New York with DiCaprio), and I wasn't massively impressed then, but There Will Be Blood is a completely different beast. The premise - a man driven to build his family oil business as big as he can - really appeals to me, and the stills I'd seen of some scenes only added to this anticipation. After the tortuous 2 hours and 38 minutes of screen time, I was left scratching my head, wondering if I'd even seen something I would remember tomorrow morning.<br/><br/>The first half an hour is devoid of speaking: only the sounds of oil bubbling through the ground and the grunts of the men drilling it can be heard. It's probably the most emotive and accurate of the film, and I was really enjoying the finality of every decision Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) made whilst he was starting out his business. Unfortunately, the director then feels the need to add more characters - they are well-acted, that isn't the issue, it's more just the lack of necessity to each one. One moment they are barely acting at all, speaking at a murmur, the next they launch into a volley of screaming tirade, acting irrationally.<br/><br/>As the plot creeps along, you wonder what the point really is. Plainview succeeds early on (this is no spoiler), and has some nonsensical relationships with his adopted son and a local preacher who told him where to drill. It doesn't offer any peril, any drama - weirdly, this felt like a film that might have been better fleshed out as a television drama over the course of a season. There are nice shots throughout using oil as the artistic medium, almost to represent blood within the plot; the music, however, is quite erratic and jarring, not always fitting the moment comfortably.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal, but frankly all I saw was really aggressive over-acting alongside a ""method-acting"" ethos that seems to earn more respect than it sometimes should. When the end credits rolled, my mum and I looked at one another, and the first thing she said was ""What a  waste of time"" - so Happy Mother's Day to you."

"frankde-jong","9","2","2","15 February 2020"," A film reminding of Citizen Kane
","""There will be blood"" is about the rise of the oil industrie in America (like ""Giant"" (1956, George Stevens)) and about the rise and fall of a tycoon (like ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Orosen Welles)). So the film can be compared with not the least of films in film history. Nevertheless it withstands this comparison rather well.<br/><br/>Central to the film is the conflict between the tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). This is however not a conflict of principles. Eli Sunday is also interested in money and for Daniel Plainview oil is a holy substance. This is illustrated by the way he baptizes his stepson H.W. with oil. The conflict is rather a powerstruggle in the course of which the two combatants mutually humiliate each other.<br/><br/>H.W. is the stepson of Daniel Plainview. They have a rather curious relationship. For Daniel his stepson is a way te present himself as a family man (a necessary condition to do business in this very religious part of America), something he definitely is not. H.W. made me think of Oskar Matzerath from ""Die blechtrommel"" (1979, Volker SchlÃ¶ndorf), although he does grow up. As a grown up he disappears however from the scene.<br/><br/>Both Daniel and Eli have ""the gift of speech"", and they use it to cheat on the farmers of the neigborhood. The voice of Daniel is so confidence inspiring that it can only belong to a crook. The film starts with a long silent opening, after which there is a speech of Daniel trying to buy the land of farmers in order to drill for oil.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very beautiful, in particular in the scenes of wide landscapes. Landscapes who will be damaged forever by the activities of Daniel Plainview. Coincidentally the Coen brothers filmed in the same part of Texas as Paul Thomas Anderson for ""No country for old men"", a film from the same year (2007).<br/><br/>The score sounds very much like a Philip Glass score, but is actually by Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead. There are dissonants in the music by uncomfortable scenes in which the hard selfishness of Daniel Plainview is revealed.<br/><br/>In ""Citizen Kane"" there is some sort of redemption at the end. In ""There will be blood"" there is only madness."

","Once again a film has been produced(to much critical acclaim),that has no entertainment value whatsoever! I will not be writing any spoilers as this movie is truly what YOU the viewer make of it. How can i spoil that? The insinuation i have seen repeated on some of these boards is that if you do not appreciate great movies like this one you are either not smart enough, not trying hard enough or simply haven't seen it enough times.<br/><br/>Personally i watch movies to be entertained. That does not mean movies must always work out the way i want or be positive in tone.I am just very tired of the excitement generated by going against convention these days,as though that in itself constitutes great film.And the idea that film is not about entertainment, but about creating pieces of....""art"".You do not have to pay for art before you are allowed to see it.<br/><br/>There are many great artists who work on film, but the end goal should always be to satisfy and/or entertain the audience on some level.When i watch movies like this and NCFOM, i realize that these filmmakers do not care about the audience. Only about showing what brilliant ""artists"" they are.Who can blame them? They are rewarded with much praise and shiny statues.<br/><br/>This picture was depressing and pointless at best.(the reaction of the friends i viewed it with) I personally didn't feel anything but the all too familiar disappointment associated with trusting the IMDb ratings.And a complete lack of interest in the fate of the unredeemable psychopath that was Daniel Plainview."

","I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first place <br/><br/>There's a term invented by the American film critic David Bordwell called "" intensified continuity "" which in its simplest term is "" MTV style directing "" . Scorsese did this with GOODFELLAS and CASINO , Oliver Stone with all of his 90s work and Francis Ford Coppolla with Dracula . Bordwell does make a point that shot length seems to be increasing in the late noughties compared to the 1990s . Interestingly NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN which came out the same year as this had a similar , long , rather slow , old fashioned feel to it . But at least NO COUNTRY was a plot driven thriller where as THERE WILL BE BLOOD is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some points <br/><br/>The cinematography is good and Lewis certainly isn't bad as Plainview , but the problem is in the cinematic storytelling . The film starts with long sequences with no dialogue and these scenes drags on . There's also a problem with trying to figure out what the message is . You could understand if there's a sympathetic Marxist slant on the fundamental flaws of capitalism but then Plainview's nemesis is shown to be a preacher who isn't exactly portrayed in a good light . Moral ambiguity or moral equivalence ? A thinly disguised attack on George W Bush ? I doubt it , more likely it's just an art-house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved .<br/><br/>There's not much wrong with it per se . As I said it's a film that is shot and framed well with good cinematography and good performances . However for audience members like myself whose main interest in watching cinema is narrative it's a film that I'm in no hurry to rewatch"

He played his part well in this, and quite frankly that was probably the only thing that kept me watching.

","While not truly terrible, this is still an extremely over-rated movie. It's more of a boring, meandering mess than a cinematic classic. I was fighting sleep at points. There's no way this movie will stand the test of time. I know I couldn't sit through it again.<br/><br/>First, the good news. As always, Daniel Day Lewis turns in a wonderful performance as Daniel Plainfield, a prospector and oil speculator who slowly succumbs to the effects of greed and madness. Also, the cinematography is excellent as is the score by Johnny Greenfield of Radiohead. Actually, the score was the most remarkable thing about the movie for me. It was like no other soundtrack I've heard, and was at times spooky, frenetic, moody and moving. Well done.<br/><br/>Now the bad news. Despite the director's best efforts, the movie is pretty boring and pointless, mainly due to the weak script. There's really not much of a story here beyond ""look what greed can do"", and the characters don't draw one in enough to care what's going to happen. Consequently, by the half-hour mark I found myself wondering if a plot was going to present itself. Two hours later I was just praying for it to end.

It seems to be the trend, and, why do we as consumers keep 'gobbling' this crap up? Because we get duped into thinking that there is something of value by the amount of 'hype' that goes into the promotion of these movies.

"DaveDiggler","10","10","18","16 April 2008"," There Will Be Vengeance
","""There Will Be Blood"" is an instant classic, very much in the mold in of ""Citizen Kane,"" but much more effective. This is one of, writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson' finest achievements and is certainly in the discussion for his best work along with ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" P.T. Anderson is quickly rising as this generation's best director and maybe the greatest visionary film has ever seen. On a technical level, ""There Will Be Blood,"" is near perfection and may end up near the top of AFI' 100 greatest films list in another 20 years or so. The Cinematography is gorgeous. The score is incredible- sometimes a little overused. The acting is great, lead by one of the best of year- see Viggo Mortensen of ""Eastern Promises"" if you want to see a performance that rivals one of this magnitude. Paul Dano was, however, over the top and just couldn't match up with Lewis as he was outclassed and out performed, but some of the smaller roles were played with incredible realism and felt completely genuine. The direction is flawless. The art direction will put you back in the late 1800s on through the late 1920s. The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis will the thing that's remembered for years to come as he now owns title to two of the greatest acting performances of the 21st century (""Gangs of New York""). Like, ""Gangs,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" is powered by Lewis as it's lead by Daniel Plainview, played magnificently by one of the best actors cinema has ever seen as he carries this ambitious film. Without this incredible performance to lean on ""There Will Be Blood"" just can't hold up to what it sets out to do. As we watch the development of Daniel Plainview and his hatred culminate we quickly realize just how deadly Plainview becomes. Where there's oil there's greed, and where there's greed there's disputes, and where there's disputes there's blood, and there will be blood. The greed in this film is saturated through the characters with one after another looking for money. Oil is the source of money and no one can get at it except for Daniel, so his greed is going to come into conflict with the spectators greed, who all wants a piece of the proverbial pie.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film is the big gusher scene and it's also the turning point in the film. The cinematography in this five minute scene alone is worth a nomination and the score will sing your ears as the fire will sing your eyes. After years of drilling for oil, Plainview becomes powerful, but not as powerful as he will or dreams of becoming. The big gusher represents Plainview's boiling greed and once the ocean of boiling oil erupts, Plainview, is overcome with the prospect of making so much money that he could move away from everyone and live in a mansion, away from ""these people."" He hates most people and he doesn't see anything worth liking when he looks at people. Everyone that crosses his path is just another spectator getting in the way and taking the money that he has rights to. He does all the work- the drilling, he does all the finding, and he leases all the land so he should get all the money. This is how this works, you see. When his adopted son H.W. goes deaf from the blast of the big gusher, Daniel, no longer knows of any way to talk to him. When his partner asks him, ""How's H.W."" as Daniel is mesmerized by the fire and the ocean of oil under his feet and the kind of money he can make- the real money- he uncaringly says he's ""not good."" Then, just like that, H.W. becomes a burden instead of cute face to help him buy land. H.W. is a tool in Daniel's eyes. Everyone is a tool. Just like a pickaxe or a drill, people are tools, and Daniel uses those tools to get what he wants, but when they start acting like people instead of tools is when we have big problems. H.W. just gets in the way like everyone else and the love and bond of a father and son seem to take a back seat to greed and competition.<br/><br/>Daniel sends H.W. off to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. While he's away his brother Henry is the next in line of spectators getting in the way. And Eli Sunday as well, the evangelical preacher for the Church of The Third Revelation. Paul Dano plays Eli, and his twin brother Paul Sunday, and get's into dirty business to provide for his church so he can preach to a bigger congregation. Sunday becomes immersed in his own greed and eventually finds himself corrupt and looking for help from his ""brother Daniel"" who doesn't exactly see himself as his brother. Greed and power sit atop the focal points of the film in regards to self examination. Sometimes you have to take a look at the ugly side of yourself. Some may question their actions as they try to change and some continue those actions without remorse. Daniel's plunge into madness is dark and prolonged and gradually alcohol and hate become the driving force in his life. As Daniel plunges into the never ending abyss we see that his hate knows no boundaries and he will hate anyone and turn on everyone. You'll come away questioning if he loved or cared for anyone. As Daniel comes to a point in his life where he wants to be: Alone and on top with his rivals drowning in a pool of their own blood. Whether he eats someone or isolates himself from people, he succeeds in whatever he does."

","""There Will Be Blood"" reminded me very much of ""Gangs of New York,"" which also featured another scenery-eating performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The cinematography is lush, the acting deep and the overall feel of the film majestic. But it is ultimately unsatisfying. The movie traces the life of a misanthropic loner who turns the American dream into a nightmare. Day-Lewis refers to himself as an oil man, and that's what he is. He lets nothing get in the way of getting what he wants, though we're never really sure what that is. Money isn't really the goal, as he turned down a deal offered by Standard Oil that would have made him a multi-millionaire. ""What would I do?"" he asks as he turns down the deal. No doubt, Day-Lewis is a masterful actor, adept at turning in performances of larger-than-life characters. I was disappointed, however, in the Eli Sunday character, as played by Paul Dano, who was so good in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's unfortunate that a movie often praised as being iconoclastic reverts to the tired stereotype of the hypocritical, self-aggrandizing preacher. And, frankly, Dano's performance is somewhat lacking in nuance. The movie meanders over 2 1/2 hours before crashing to a jarring end. ""I am finished,"" Day-Lewis's character pronounces. He should have said that about an hour earlier."

","After seeing There Will Be Blood last night, I am filled with the desire to fetch the nearest sharp twig, run over to P.T. Anderson's house, and poke him in the eye, repeatedly, with it.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers - not that there's anything to spoil, as the concepts of ""plot"" and ""motion"" are nearly absent from this film - I would venture that the only redeeming quality of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis, who can act in the same way that Maria Callas could sing, Bill Robinson could tap-dance, Ted Williams could hit a fastball, or Warren Buffett can make money. The man is simply a prodigious talent. Still, even with Mr. Day-Lewis' tour de force, he could not save this stem-winding, meandering movie from itself. Ideas which were interesting were aborted in the womb. Characters with real promise and sparks of uniqueness were not fully fleshed out. Dialogue waffled between inventive and just plain weird.<br/><br/>As a friend remarked, there's one sure tell that a writer is struggling with dramatic exposition, and that is the introduction of a new character halfway through. Mr. Anderson committed this foul, along with many others, in creating the failure that is this film. I did not like There Will Be Blood and I suggest to anyone who might be reading this that you take your money and spend it elsewhere."

Digging oil wells is dangerous."" <br/><br/>Anderson never directed a crisp, concise scene in his life. ""Boogie Nights"" (155 minutes), ""Magnolia"" (188m), ""There Will be Blood"" (158m)-- that's 8.5 hours for three movies. And before someone points out that ""Punch Drunk Love"" was only 95 minutes, I would counter that it felt twice that. At least.<br/><br/>Pascal wrote, ""I am sorry for the length of my letter, but I had not the time to write a short one."" Amen. It does take time-- and talent and discipline-- to sculpt and winnow an idea down to its most purposeful and powerful elements. But Anderson doesn't winnow, he wallows. He seems to think that if a four-minute scene is good, then it'll be twice as good at eight minutes, and three times as good at twelve. It's a wonder his movies aren't six hours long.<br/><br/>The best way to deal with this endlessly over-rated film is with adjectives, starting with endless and over-rated. Then, of course, bloated. Slow. Fatuous. Loud. Unfaithful (to Upton Sinclair's original satire, ""Oil!""). Sentimental. Confusing (Paul Dano's twin characters). Abrupt (the ending). And, finally and crucially, pointless.

Daniel Day-Lewis seems to always impress in any role he plays & his character was intense & very intriguing but that doesn't make a movie on it's own! Nothing unexpected happens at all (except an over the top murder right at the end) & nothing interesting seems to develop. Initially, i thought the 1st couple of sub-plots weren't developed on purpose in order for ones further into the movie to be developed or a surprise plot to appear but nothing happened at all. Very linear story, good dialogue & great acting but not a good movie for me.

(although by itself it would be quite a weird listening experience). 3) the main weakness of this movie is (and possibly that was a precise strategy) that it it is not involving the audience feelings. Even in the most desperate moments (= the abandoning of his son / the abandoning of his father), the main character's solitude and desperation are portrayed in a very dry and cold way, the audience (at least me) is not moved. 4) The plot has major holes which remain unexplained. 5) the character of the young priest does not show signs of becoming old later in the movie, when everyone else does. 6) This movie has been compared to Kubrick's 2001 Space Odissey, or to Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West for its epic, but such comparisons are nonsense.

","The acting was good. The directing (Paul Thomas Anderson) was terrible. I am at a loss to understand why so many people enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>It was very disappointing to me, I thought I was going to see a first class film but instead saw something that was bizarre. This should have been a great film. The nearly 3 hour run time (2hr 46Min) could have been cut down to at least 2 hours and would have improved it. The Director had many scenes of completely empty meaning. Example. My Son daughter and I just made the start of the movie. We got settled in and I had to make a run to the mens room after a minute or two of watching him hammer away at rock. I returned after about six minutes and he is still hammering. No meaning what so ever. There were other scenes likes this where men are working an oil rig up, down, up down. And a scene where Kevin J. O'Conners character is sitting on the beach. Why am I staring at him looking up down and just sitting? Stupid. It's like Anderson sees this as artistic. I think its useless and a waste of film and run time.<br/><br/>Again, to me this should have been much better. I have seen several epic films, Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With the Wind, Ten Commandments, A Bridge Too Far, and more. They didn't waste run time. They WERE artistic, this one falls far short. <br/><br/>The first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis he was starring in My Left Foot for which he won his Oscar. And He was absolutely superb in Last of the Mohicans. This is a good performance but not my favorite (Mohicans is one of my favorite films, mainly because of DDL's acting). If he wins the Oscar that is fine with me, it was a good performance. But I will say, that by the end of the movie he reminded me more of Timothy Dalton in Hot Fuzz, looked like him and sounded like him. Strange, but thats how he came across to me.<br/><br/>Paul Dano does a good job in his role of as does O'Conner.<br/><br/>Bottom line from me. Wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>Gary"

","After watching this movie, I thought Mr. Lewis did a pretty good job, and the story was fairly interesting if nothing new. That's why I am once again flabbergasted at the reaction of the critics, press, and now the awards. This is as classic and timeless as was the Western, 3:10 to Yuma. Please don't miss the sarcasm. 3:10 to Yuma was a second rate western and an insult to the original. Both the story and the performances were rote and unconvincing. There Will Be Blood was a better effort. But my God people, Rendition, Atonement, The Quiet American ... THESE are movies !!! <br/><br/>I'm afraid it's yet another Oscar year based on some criteria I haven't been let in on. No doubt Daniel Day Lewis did a good job, but great? There was hardly enough to his character to base that opinion on. The film depicted how the oil industry began and told us that yes, the same type of mentality which drew people to the'oil-rush', are basically the same as they are now. Manipulative, controlling, and capitalistic to the point at which it's their God given duty to give little or nothing while taking all if you can, cause goshdarnit, that's the daggum American way. If that sounds harsh, do a count of the Native Americans and Mexicans in this movie. They'd been 'dealt with' thoroughly enough at this point to find it best to lurk in the background of this movie. Kind of ironic, isn't it, what with the 'immigrant problem' now. You know, when a lot of the people wanting in are those the land was stolen from in the first place.<br/><br/>Lewis played a cold, emotionless bastard, he portrayed that without equal. But that's all he did. His character was so one dimensional that it's over two and a half hours of playing the same note perfectly, while ignoring the exploration of all those other keys. There's nothing historical to be proud of here, no nugget of information previously unknown. It was simply a character study of a controlling man who's psychosis eventually pushes him past the point of no return. With a conscience as baron as the landscape, and the sole driving force to gain more, there was no opportunity provided for an actor no matter how talented to exhibit the range of emotions a supposedly Oscar worthy performance provides the evidence for.<br/><br/>Mr Lewis is an amazing actor who's done work of that caliber before and no doubt will do so again. There Will Be Blood, a title which still has me puzzled, just wasn't it. All of this enthusiastic praise for this project does little other than further remove the public's credibility as far as the awards are concerned, or leaves them feeling stupid for being too thick to see something that was never there in the first place."

","There's a recurring nightmare of mine where I am falling down a well. Our reality is an illusion. This life is simply the dream we have while we are actually falling down a well. It always seemed as if the well was bottomless. After watching ""There Will Be Blood"" I discovered the well has a bottom. At the bottom of the well is one thing. Oil.<br/><br/>Also falling down this well was ""The Performance."" Watching Daniel Day Lewis play the unstoppable, unshakable, unfathomably misanthropic and greedy oil man that is Daniel Plainview, one is left to imagine that ""The Performance"" was always out there. It always existed somewhere in the ether, in our collective unconscious, in our nightmares and anxieties. It took a visionary auteur like Paul Thomas Anderson to realize that if he did a modern film update of Upton Sinclair's early 20th century novel ""Oil!"" and ominously renamed it ""There Will Be Blood"" then this performance could be channeled onto celluloid as a testament to the defining struggles of 21st century mankind.<br/><br/>Blistering cinematography of stark California landscapes from Robert Elswit, an evocatively organic and haunting music score from Jonny Greenwood (from the rock band Radiohead), and the beautifully fluid movement and framing of Paul Thomas Anderson's maniacally calculating camera grab you from scene one and never let go. Daniel Day Lewis moves through the film like a cold burning firestorm combining and combusting with the technical elements and the fabulous ensemble cast around him to create a rising tension that is unlike anything experienced in cinema since the golden era of Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>The story is multilayered and allegorical. Led to an untapped area floating in dust on rivers of oil by a mysterious young man, Plainview soon comes face to face with that young man's twin brother, Eli Sunday (a fecklessly manipulative Paul Dano). Eli is a wunderkind preacher at the Church of the Third Revelation and has the town wrapped around his finger with his claims to be a healer and prophet. Eli agrees to let Plainview buy his family's land for the right price. The profits are to be used to build a bigger church. But when Plainview refuses to let Eli properly bless the drill site, a series of events unfold that Eli trumpets as acts of ""God"" while Plainview views them as results of meddling people he can scarcely see any good in and must crush.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie lies in Plainview's relationship with his adopted son H. W. (a wonderfully naturalistic and quietly expressive Dillon Freasier). When the boy is injured on a drilling site and loses his hearing, Plainview, torn by his love for the idea of the boy looking up to him and the friendly face the boy has leant to the family business, abandons him only to latch on to a shady vagabond (Kevin J. O'Connor) who trots into town claiming to be his long lost brother Henry. Plainview's replacing of a fake son with a fake brother shows his character's deep-seeded and wounded need to connect to someone when insatiable greed has been his only driving force.<br/><br/>To explore in detail the film's deeper message and resonance for today's audience would be to spoil the ending. Suffice it to say, after the slowly infectious, nerve-shattering build-up, the film culminates with a soliloquy from Plainview to Eli that will make your jaw drop. In the end, it lives up to its title. There was blood. Whose was spilled is not a matter of debate, but what that blood says to its 21st century audience will be discussed and argued and studied for years to come. If you want to know what happens when greed guised in religious zealotry falls down a dark seemingly bottomless well with greed blatant as corporate capitalism, look no further than this film. There is a bottom to that well. There is a winner at the finish line. Meanwhile the blood is on the floor, the walls, the desert sand, the silver screen, the nightly news, and pumping through our bodies until we die."

"peruviansilver","1","8","14","25 June 2010"," A glorification of being mean?
","It appears that many people like this movie. The only explanation I can give of this is that people have watched so many movies that they have become completely numb, and the only thing that tickles their brain is shock value. Basically, this is the same reason people watch slasher horror movies. I find the movie critics have this same flaw in their thinking. That is judging a movie as good just because it is ""different"".<br/><br/>Well, I'll tell you what makes this movie different. It is so painful to watch that movie makers in the past wouldn't even consider making it. This main character has no redeeming values and is so completely vile that he's not even believable. The preacher is so annoying and pious that he is also very hard to watch.<br/><br/>If this movie was based on a true story it might have some value because it would be a study of reality. Its not though. Its complete fiction. Its like somebody took all their bad child hood experience, hates and prejudices and attempted to hold the audience down and force feed all those dark unhappy feelings down their throat.<br/><br/>Its like watching a completely spoiled child throw a temper tantrum, but instead of being able to ignore them or walk away, you are forced to have the tantrum thrown right in front of your face.<br/><br/>In other words. This movie was disgusting. Feelings such as these do not need to be shared. People that behave like this should be ignored, not paid attention too, and not have movies made about them.<br/><br/>For those out there looking for the latest kick because the drugs have worn off and hardly anything can possibly get the dopamine flowing again. Watch this movie, or maybe snort some pepper spray."
"audience_X","6","11","21","3 February 2008"," What is this mishmash of self-indulgent scenes all about?
","There are 2 things that disquieted me after watching this movie: <br/><br/>1) Despite the absolute dryness of the plot, it is rated so highly by critics.<br/><br/>2) Everyone who watched it admitted its boring, but they still said its a good. Talk about influences...<br/><br/>This is by no means a poor film, but its definitely one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>There are many scenes that can simply be removed without having any impact to the film. In fact, after the atrocious 2 hour and 40 minutes, I still could not feel anything or tell you what the movie is about. I have absolutely no connection or understanding of the contradicted character Daniel. For a film that revolves entirely around an individual, thats quite an underachievement.<br/><br/>This film has no soul. While it is a character study, but many of its scenes are so drawn out that the impact of the acting is sometimes drowned out by the seemingly senseless wandering of the camera. You see many scenes of characters walking in vast barren lands, standing around, waiting and doing nothing in a variety of scenes. Yes, the scenes are very believable, because they are so mundane. If you put all those scenes together, you will have a decent documentary about oil drilling in 1900s.<br/><br/>Yet, the film happens to be a mish mash of scenes that lead to nowhere. I waited till the end, expecting a scene of absolute emotional explosion, but non ever come. <br/><br/>Music at times was good, but at times was simply incongruous to the atmosphere of the scene. A good musical score is supposed to bring us closer to the atmosphere of the scene, but the scores in this movie often achieve the exact opposite. You got shaken out of the scene and can't help but wonder ""why did they put this weird tune in there?"" The indulgent cinematographic attempt to earn an award nomination is all too obvious... so much so that it came across as pretentious, excessive and sometimes painfully out of place. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie is not without its merits. Daniel has delivered a consistent performance throughout the movie. Excellenet acting, but certainly not to the level of ""perfection"" that many people claim. Its hard to act a character that is so unreal. Yet, when you only have meaningless drawn out scenes in a barren land, audience can't help but pay attention to the actors. In this case, its all good. Because thats the film's only saving grace."
"TheMovieCritique","1","31","72","12 January 2008"," Really? Did I watch the same ""#44 best"" movie that others did?
","For once I have to ask myself - did I watch the same movie as the others on this page did? With overblown reviews and 10-star ratings I walked into the theater expecting nothing short of a masterpiece. And what I got was a two hour long saga of nothingness on the screen which I got through with a valiant effort to keep my eyelids open.<br/><br/>The good aspects first: The turn of the century period has been captured in its authenticity and grit very well on the screen. And as we all know by now - Daniel Day-Lewis has given a masterful performance. He manages to come across as authentic, despicable and scary at the same time. Quite an achievement. But his performance is towards the flawed enterprise called this movie. Paul Thomas Anderson has come up with very clever movies in the past - in Boogie Nights and Magnolia. But the important difference between those relatively better products of cinema and this aberration is quite clear: Narrative.<br/><br/>Mr.Anderson, I know that you're supposed to be a genius and all, but at the risk of making a fool of myself I'm going to give you a quick ""Narrative-101"" lesson: The protagonist's character/sensibilities are established. And then life experiences throughout the story make him/her richer. There are changes - some good, some bad - which makes for an interesting (and possibly visually enthralling) story. ""There will be blood"" fails miserably in this aspect.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is ruthless oilman back in the early days of the black gold business. From buying up land by tricking simple village folks to showing religious fervor to further his business ends - he does this and more. The value of human life is little in his quest for wealth. But therein lies the problem, this aspect of his character has been established in the scene two of the movie - there is NOTHING to add to character development in the two hours that follow. There are some interesting scenes juxtaposed with a plot of angst against the local priest-boy Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). The enmity is flawed in every way - it is a battle of unequals and the climactic sequence does not help change the inequality in their status one bit.<br/><br/>I walked out of the hall asking: ""What the hell was all that about?"" Maybe I don't have the evolved sensibility to appreciate the intricacies of the message that this movie wants to convey. But I'll tell ya this much: Movies are meant to entertain. Movies are meant to make us think. The best ones entertain while making us think. ""There will be blood"" neither entertains, nor made me think. <br/><br/>1 star out of 10."
"jon5cts","5","17","36","19 December 2007"," Really Misses
","Beautifully shot and amazing sets. Everyone did their homework and Daniel Day Lewis does a great job, but then it all begins to go wrong.<br/><br/>Paul Dano was horribly miscast and cannot keep up with Day Lewis blowing the climax with a pitiful performance. Plus, he actually looked younger at the end of the film! Jonny Greenwood, while an interesting choice for music, really seemed to miss the point and turned this into some kind of an experimental piece. Some great music, but often distracting with the feeling of a Horror film rather than a serious drama. I'm all for different and exciting, but you should never be taken out of the film as this soundtrack so often does.<br/><br/>This could/should have been a masterpiece, but it's way too long and loses it's direction about three quarters of the way through. I was eagerly awaiting this film and was extremely disappointed."

","An arid, featureless, drawn-out affair - not unlike the vast expanses of the western landscape in which it is set. And that creaking sound one can hear is not just coming from the ancient oil-extracting contraptions; it emanates from the acting, the soundtrack - but especially the direction.<br/><br/>Everything takes an inordinate amount of time. Fifteen minutes is spent on an opening which tells us little - and could perhaps have taken fifteen seconds in the hands of a more capable director.<br/><br/>But Paul Thomas Anderson seems to be in thrall to the long, lingering shots favoured by the likes of Orson Welles and Sergio Leone. Unfortunately he appears to have little idea how to use them while maintaining dramatic tension, plot drive or the interest of the viewer. The problem is compounded by the way the choice of shot and technical execution of each scene conspire to distract, rather than illuminate.<br/><br/>Neither a highly-mannered performance by Daniel Day Lewis nor Johnny Greenwood's portentous, and possibly misused, score aid matters. But the blame for this interminable fiasco surely lies with a visually-incontinent director in desperate need of an editor."

There is a trend of excessive violence and brutality in many films these days, instead of a good story and great characterizations. Ciaran Hinds is underutilized Much is promised- nothing much delivered but an ""ambitious man"" story. Taken from ""Citizen Kane"", and a cheap supernatural thriller hinted at when it seems God will take a hand. He never does. There is also a frisson of ""Moby Dick"", man pursuing the leviathan.

When he abandoned his child, I wanted to punch him. I have three children of my own, and I was heartbroken by his stupid action.<br/><br/>Let me tell you something about the writer. Terrible. Extremely poor and without suspense and emotion. Almost no action whatsoever. The director, known for Casino and such movies, should retire. The only thing he was filming were mountains and oil.

"sddavis63","2","10","19","22 November 2008"," A Rather Excruciating Two And A Half Hours
","I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it."

Why put those kind of music during the whole film? It's really slow, too. people may fall asleep of those long slow-moving moments. By the way, there isn't much dialogs, that's fine to me, though. And it's pretty hard to get the plot. Oil? Blood? Like, it does make sense sometimes, but it's just... weird. When it ends i was like, what?! i don't get it! However, Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job as we can see. He deserves the Oscar. I think he expressed the longing of power, greediness, and regrets of the protagonist very well. I don't quite understand why it won 2 Oscars and got nominated for MANY others as well. I'm sorry for my bad taste in film and my ignorance. But I have to say I didn't enjoy at all.

Kevin O'Connor turned in the only supporting role good enough to give Lewis a character to get some believable interaction with. Paul Dano contributed the worst performance to Little Miss Sunshine and here, as Ely, he is truly dreadful. His acting would have been comical in a community theater production. I can't understand how anything about this movie merited nomination for an award, let alone a win. This word is over used, but ""pretentious"" really describes this film for me.

"imdbfriend","9","6","10","22 April 2008"," Shot at Greatness!
","This movie is absolute masterpiece in terms of story, direction, screenplay, cinematography, background music and acting. Daniel Day Lewis has yet again delivered a packed powerhouse performance. Firstly, Anderson has made a gem of a movie. Anderson's story telling style is quite unique; he doesn't rely completely on dialogs but rather on camera movements capturing the characters emotions and expressions. This style of story telling might make one bore with the movie but believe me not his movie. He knows his trade very well. I have only seen his other movie 'Magnolia' which I liked too but in this movie he excels not just himself but many other filmmakers of this generation too. He definitely seems a director to rely on delivering master pieces. Now, coming to the main man movie belongs too, i.e., Daniel Day Lewis, is undoubtedly the most talented actors of our generations and this movie only strengthen his place further among one of the greatest actors of all time. He portrayed ""Plainview"" so perfectly that I cannot even begin to imagine some other actor playing this role the way he did. Watch the intensity with which he delivers his dialogs, intensity when he is digging for oil, when he is protecting his kid and almost every frame he is in is a shot of greatness, how competitive he is, how chilling he is. Other actors too are good, especially Lewis Kid (as a child), Elli the preacher. I don't want to reveal anything here why Lewis is superb here; why direction is superb here, as to mention those I need to describe some specific scenes and moments in the movie that with the help of the director, and Lewis who takes them to the extreme height of perfection and superiority and which might not give you a full satisfaction of seeing those for the first time in the movie and I don't want to take any such moments away from you. So it would be in your best interest that you watch the movie and decide yourself why these gentlemen's were so amazing in TWBB and why the movie is a masterpiece. Just Watch it.!!!!!

","I am mystified by the proclamations of greatness for ""There Will Be Blood."" No film has disappointed me as much in ages. When a film runs long, it is expected to provide quality. ""Blood"" is merely tedious. I almost laughed out loud at the ""I drank your milkshake"" part. The overacting by DD-L is ludicrous and unappealing. I half suspect that the attacks on oilmen (I have no problem with Luddite views if they are justified) and religion (if merited, fine) are the source of much of the raving on behalf of the film. But the silliness of ""Blood"" cannot be overlooked by intelligent viewers. If it is post 1929, why does Eli still seem to be 14? Why does the Sunday family not discuss Paul's absence? Why would a shrewd man like Plainview wait so long to test Henry? What happens to his sidekick (the former Julius Caesar of ""Rome"") whose skills alas are seemingly shunted to the cutting room? Why does HW speak like a person always deaf rather than like a person born hearing? Perhaps an actor who could sign was needed and the adult HW is portrayed by an actor actually deaf? As for the music, terrible. ""No Country For Old Men"" is so superior in its rendition of a nihilistic view of America that the two films ought not even be mentioned in the same breath."

","Perhaps I went in with high expectations, but I was quite disappointed. The long opening sequence designed to show the hard, hard determination of Daniel Plainview was just OK and at times rather self indulgent (where is the editor??). I am sorry but it wasn't visually that great. Yes, the setting is spectacular... But you have to do more than just show up and turn the camera on. And please don't tell me it was ""understated"" or meant to be done that way. It was just really average. There is nothing wrong with long sequences. One of my favorite scenes of all time is the opening from The Sacrifice (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091670/) so I am happy to be patient if there is some sort of artistic payoff. But sadly, not enough of one. The film is two and a half hours long, yet I never get a sense of the where the characters come from. The basics. Whats their motivation ? What drives them ? I am happy to connect the dots or fill in the details, but a film maker has to give you *some* structure on which to let your imagination work. Otherwise, I can just stay home and engage in wonton speculation. Is Eli supposed to be the mirror image of Daniel ? Or just a pale wannabe ? Sure. What about the son ? I was hoping more would be done there or at least focus on the tensions between father and son.. But not really. The ending ? That was just inadequate and in bad taste. And I have to mention the sound. At one point I started to giggle when this incredible overbearing Shostikovitch like tempo set to Daniel and his faux brother.. surveying the land. Yes, that's right. Imagine the Star Trek fight music set to guys staking and surveying the land. Huh ? Michael Clayton and No Country For Old Men were far better movies."

I thought Daniel Day Lewis was terrific (and yes, channeling John Huston, clearly), and I liked all the other actors. It's nicely directed and happily none of the cast whispers, which seems to be today's generation's idea of acting. Some scenes crackle with energy and good dialogue. But, at the end of the day, what exactly is being said here? That greed and power exist? Okay, great. I had no problem with the length, but it just became repetitious after a while.

","I didn't think it was possible. I didn't think it was in the least bit possible to make a film that I would forever despise more than that film dreck known as ""Armageddon"". But somehow, Hollywood manage to produce a filth of a movie called ""There Will Be Blood."" My title says it all: I consider ""Blood"" to be vile, sadistic garbage.<br/><br/>I can find practically no redeeming qualities about this film at all. The plot, centering around a success-driven early-20th century oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis), is only vaguely interesting. The first half is just a series of the same, tired ""independent businessman tries to make deals"" storyline that we've not only seen dozens of times, but is patently boring. I nearly fell asleep during most of it. Then it turns into ""independent businessman becomes malicious psychopath"" that is so utterly repulsive, I just wanted the ruddy thing to end. I don't think I've looked at my watch more times during any film, ever, just praying for the closing credits! The only thing that kept me seated in the theater was inertia  <br/><br/>The pacing is terrible. This is a film that could use a good 45-minute edit. There's no need to have this movie two and a half hours long, it says all it can possibly say (which isn't very much) in a lot less than that. But it just gurgles along like oil seeping out of the ground: slimy, filthy, and repulsive.<br/><br/>The characters were practically devoid of any interest whatsoever. I can't remember any that had any redeeming qualities. Day-Lewis' character was vaguely pitiable for a while, but then becomes just a sordid pile of hate and intensely unlikable. The son is mildly interesting, more so after a tragedy takes his hearing, but then is cast aside and so mishandled by the writers he almost becomes a write-off. Then there's a preacher, such an insane caricature (even by anti-religious Hollywood standards) he's instantly unbelievable and just ridiculous. I found nothing ""fascinating"" about any of these people, nor of the actors who portrayed them.<br/><br/>This isn't a case of ""I can't tolerate evil characters"". I just can't tolerate evil characters who are simply caricatures of evil characters! They aren't Gordon Gecko or Alex from ""Clockwork Orange"" or the cast of ""Pulp Fiction"". These are one-trick characters, whose only trick is repulsiveness, something they (admittedly and unashamedly) excel at.<br/><br/>And the music! I don't think I've heard a ghastlier soundtrack on a major motion picture in my entire life. Whomever did the score doesn't understand anything about cues or setting mood or anything that goes into making a good film score. It's a cacophony of ill-timed, poorly mixed, angry themes. This score suits this film like iron nails on a chalkboard suits a memorial service.<br/><br/>About the only redeeming feature of this film are the period set design and costume pieces. There's also a terrific sequence involving an oil derrick fire. It does give the sense of the time period. But this is such a small part of the film, it's not enough to redeem it.<br/><br/>Looking back on this entire, miserable experience that is ""There Will Be Blood"", I can only say, with all seriousness, that everyone associated with this terrible motion picture, including those who rave about how terrific it is, needs to take a serious look at their own lives. If anyone I knew actually said ""this is a good movie"", I would instantly recommend counseling for what must obviously be severe depression. I could not even fathom reducing myself to a state so wretched that ""There Will Be Blood"" would be considered, by me, to be a creative endeavor! This film is a cry for serious, serious help.<br/><br/>I think the members of the Academy have gone completely nutters if they consider any part of ""There Will Be Blood"" is even vaguely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I consider it pure garbage."

Daniel Day Lewis truly deserved the Oscar for the kind of acting he displayed including the lust for money,insanity,anger,ambition,emotional trauma.I have never ever seen a Hollywood piece of work like this. This movie follows the life a ambitious young man of early 1900s from building up his small oil well to discovering the greatest oil reserve in his life and how this discovery effects his own life and how he starts taking pride in himself building hatred towards other people in pursuing his lust for money. It also explores the type of superstition prevailing in that era among the local countrymen. In a nutshell this movie deserves a special place in the Hollywood because this is just one of its kind to be made. Don't miss it!"
"treadwaywrites","8","5","8","8 January 2009"," Complex Character Creation Raises Bar For Others
","Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal in his portrayal as an early oil baron or should I say the earliest oil baron. In fact the synopsis of the movie is really that simple: the early life of an oil baron. Just when I have used the word simple I have to back up. The movie and certainly Daniel Day Lewis' performance is anything but simple. Lewis creates a complex and difficult character in the title role. Just when you think you have a handle on both the story or this character another twist appears that makes this movie juicier and more interesting.<br/><br/>The movie was two Oscars in 2008 for cinematography and for Daniel Day Lewis for Best Actor. Lewis does his best to not only act, but to physically channel his character. He does a masterful job that continues to set the bar ever higher for actors of his generation. It was nominated for a total of 8 making it one of the top films of 2007.<br/><br/>Overall it is difficult to classify this film as it has so many wonderful qualities. It is a terrifying biographical tragedy. The timing of the movie's release hits hard with today's newspaper headlines. The audience is simply slapped in the face with our country's dependency on oil and how oil barons in this era set a tone for the next 100 years. At times I found this movie chilling, masterful and compelling. Surprisingly however, I was never sympathetic to Lewis' character which I'm sure was very challenging for him to create. This is a must see film from 2007 and one is hard pressed to find many flaws, a credit to talented director Paul Thomas Anderson. ****/*****, a standard held for the higher films of the day.<br/><br/>The posters for this movie are endless. There are some 23 versions of the U.S. poster alone. The second poster pictured here is the international version, which really gives more insight into the story line."
"MaltinsBeard","10","5","8","22 May 2008"," To forget you are watching a film
","Daniel day Lewis gives possibly the best acting I have seen, ever. When I'd read my own words without having seen there will be blood, I wouldn't believe it too. For the record, I've seen quite a few good movies in my life, just as most people here probably will have.<br/><br/>Whether Deniro plays a disturbed cabbie in taxidriver or a boxer falling from his throne in Raging bull, or even when Brando plays parts like the famous Don Corleone, they are only acting their parts.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis IS the part. And that is the biggest reason why this movie is already destined to be remembered by coming generations.<br/><br/>One could argue that this movie stands out so much because of the overall lack of quality coming from Hollywood for the last 10 years or so. I beg to differ. Were this movie made in the good 70s, it would still be one of the high and mighty.<br/><br/>So why is this film so astounding to me? It's certainly not perfect! It has a few scenes of which (I think at least) are either too long or just obligatory. The Preacher role by Paul Dano isn't hardly fitting or acted too well for the claims I just made!<br/><br/>Well, first of all; if you get this film, you can proudly say you are a lot smarter then all the self-proclaimed film-critics who saw this movie and immediately drew lines to citizen Kaine and socialist themes. That's just incredibly silly. Whereas Citizen Kaine is indeed a movie with a clear objective against materialism (as well as a personal vendetta with Welles and the man he portrayed behind the screen), this movie is much more alive and breathing. The main character can't be summarized in 1 sentence, only the full 2,5 hours will do. This is where all similarities end, besides the fact that both characters are becoming wealthier, and the perfection of both movies. <br/><br/>There will be blood isn't about one theme really, the circumstances (the oil, greed, time and other characters) function more like a setting, where the main character is created and evolves. Although the movie does (very) effectively display the use of new technologies, and sketches an especially accurate image of the circumstances of small towns during the oil rush. <br/><br/>I am fond of history and I really like it when movies accurately portray such things whilst not bragging about it, or making it hinder the plot or feel forced in any way. Because it oftentimes goes so horribly wrong I'm under the conviction that this is also a showing of true artistry, combining this element of film, without the viewer noticing it.<br/><br/>I think the greatness of this movie can be summarized in 2 things. The perfect acting that daniel day lewis is doing here. I can't even remember the last time I saw a flick in which I was terrified and melancholic at the same time about a character. Mister Plainview (d.d.l.) isn't good, bad white or even gray, he's very complex, and it will be quite rewarding to study this film more than once to just see more of this conflicting behaviour. Just like the real world (something movies always have difficulty portraying for obvious reasons), this character is not just hard to read, but wholly multi-interpretable. This makes watching his actions and reactions to his surroundings very rewarding and looking closely is not, as in 99% of any stories in any form, something you shouldn't do, in order to find the boundaries of the creator's mind. In fact, it only gets you deeper into it. I can't even remember the last time I had that notion on film or book. <br/><br/>The story is also superb, and while complex and long, it's also great writing that revels here. Why is the story so great? Same reason like the acting: It takes a hold of you and you'll forget that you are looking at a movie or a story. You are experiencing it. <br/><br/>Personally I think method acting is just a Hollywood fad, I'm partially referencing to this inferior actor who was in the machinist and lost some weight with a lot of huzzah. The Stallone's Or even Deniro who started boxing.. for one of his parts. For Daniel day Lewis however, it seems to work perfectly. I've yet to meet the Hollywood actor who refuses medicine against pneumonia on ground that those things weren't there in that period of time, because he's playing bill the butcher and want's to ''stay in character''. I think that's just nuts, but I can't praise his stellar acting enough, so I won't.<br/><br/>I doubt this movie will ever get as much credit as it deserves. I think it's a little too dark and difficult for that. But in my opinion it's the nihilist and very human (although many won't see it) touch this story has, which makes it one of the best movies created so far."
"eightiesscinematic","10","5","8","19 May 2008"," There will be amazing performance!
","This is an actor that just cares about the work! Not Hollywood itself. Brilliant! I always love it when Daniel decides on a film. Never falters and never sells himself short. An actor that commits and throws himself into every role. This is an actor that is worthy of appreciation for the work he does. I'm excited to see what he does next. Paul Thomas Anderson never disappoints as well. I love every piece of film he's done. He's a very humble man and always makes the right decisions. I hope to see these two team up again in the future. I look forward to Rob Marshall's ""Nine"". Mr. Lewis is rumored to be a part of. I'd love to see more of him in action."
"Kanadiz","9","5","8","17 May 2008"," This is one of the greatest performances I've seen in a long time; it is so great that it is absolutely terrifying at times.
","Daniel Day-Lewis has got to be one of the most dedicated actors of our time, giving us one great performance after another particularly in these four; ""My Left Foot"", ""In the Name of the Father"", ""Gangs of New York"" and now ""There Will be Blood"" in his darkest role ever. One a whole his performance in this film reminded me of Orson Wells from the great ""Citizen Kane"".<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest performances I've seen in a long time; it is so great that it is absolutely terrifying at times. For insistence there is a scene where his competition is trying to buy him out and tells Plainview that he can spend more time with his son but Plainview feels that he's trying to tell him how to raise his family and he says the following: ""One night, I'm gonna come inside your house, wherever you're sleeping, and I'm gonna cut your throat."" Now that just put chills down my spine and the way he says it with that 'John Huston' kind-of accent is just brilliant. There is also a great scene where he is burying someone in the middle of nowhere in order since he felt that this person was after his money. It just simply reminded me of Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" when trying to kill Curtin, looking out for his share of the gold along with some other scenes since the director (Paul Thomas Anderson) went to sleep every night watching ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" while filming ""There Will Be Blood"", and you can tell.<br/><br/>The film basically is about a man who is looking for silver but instead finds oil and is now determined to be the best in the business and make sure that he ranks on top and above the others along with his partner H.W. Plainview, his young son. In the process he finds difficulties in gaining all the land he desires and in building his pipeline. Every single scene is extremely well made and shows us Plainview's ruthlessness slowly turning into madness.<br/><br/>One of the film's finest scenes is the opening scene when Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is on his own in the middle of nowhere and is trying to wrest silver from the earth with a pick and shovel and a stick of dynamite. There is no music in that scene, you just here the sound of the pick hitting the rock and Plainview moving around in the hole and it works perfectly. Not to mention the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in almost every scene.<br/><br/>This film is defiantly film making at its best but it could have been a lot better since it had quite a few flaws in it and the major flaw is the annoying Eli Sunday (played by Paul Dano from ""Little Miss Sunshine""). I didn't care one bit for his performance and in fact it even got on my nerves at times, especially his 'church scene' where he 'casts the devil out of people' in his little chapel.<br/><br/>This is Paul Thomas Anderson in his finest hour as a director, his best film since ""Boogie Nights"" one of the best films of 1997 since I wasn't a fan of his last 2 films: ""Punch Drunk Love"" & ""Magnolia""."
"sioenroux","4","5","8","1 March 2008"," Hugely overrated, though Daniel Day Lewis is always a star
","First, let me say I enjoyed watching ""Blood"" if only to see some of Lewis' tightly woven intensity after too long away.<br/><br/>But wow, this film is a meandering, steaming pile of Figure Out Where You're Taking The Story Before You Release The Movie.<br/><br/>I was alternately lost, confused by on screen developments, bored -- and occasionally mesmerized by a tight, powerfully done scene.<br/><br/>Sadly, those powerful moments, which hold up very well upon repeat viewings, are sandwiched in and around a story going only somewhere sort of, with a purpose that is difficult to discern.<br/><br/>Is this a parable for America's growth, or simply a slice of one part of the ugliness of it? Is there a story being told here, or just some atmospheric scenes being strung together to build a mood? Is the ""battle"" between Plainview and Eli really a plot, or more a distraction? And would those violins please stop that noise already?<br/><br/>Any one of these answers would have been fine, and might have made for a really enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, I never got the feeling Paul Thomas Anderson knew the answer.<br/><br/>A good director lets you know what part is for plot, what is for character and what is for atmosphere. The great ones, however, tell a story where all three work together more or less seamlessly. Here, I was never sure which was which, and they created no whole at all.<br/><br/>Or as a friend said to me, it seemed like the parts were greater than the sum of the whole.<br/><br/>Those individual scenes are great for trailers and retrospectives -- just don't watch the whole thing."
"ccthemovieman-1","3","24","57","18 April 2008"," Unrelentingly Bleak And Brutally Biased
","I'm glad to see there are many other people here who were very disappointed with this film, although for other reasons than I was. <br/><br/>I am sick and tired of the film industry's bashing of Christians and this is just the latest in the hate-spewing of celluloid secularists. Can you imagine depicting anyone else like this and getting away with it? Of course not, but anyone wearing a cross and quoting Scripture is ""fair game"" for all kinds of abusive characterizations.The tipoff, by the way, always is a closeup of the ""bad guy"" (Christian) wearing a cross. That is the case in this movie a number of times when they really want you to hate ""Eli.""<br/><br/>The last scene in this movie, in particular, is absolutely, so over-the-top that even non-believers gagged at how overdone it was with both main characters being almost cartoonish. That this ludicrous exaggeration took place is no surprise when you look at who directed the film. Mr. Anderson done this before in his other movies.<br/><br/>""Eli Sunday,"" a Pentecostal preacher, spouts so many un-Biblical statements it would make your head spin. There are false prophets everywhere, no doubt, but who sounds and acts like this guy? Clueless filmmakers like Anderson don't know, that's obvious. For example, Sunday yells, ""God doesn't save stupid people."" Nobody - even a fake preacher - would say that. Come on. Does Hollywood ever portray a normal minister or priest? To emphasize, their agenda, Anderson made Sunday into such a whiny wuss that nobody would like him, regardless of his beliefs.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, meanwhile, fares a lot better, of course, as filmdom's favorite: an anti- hero. However, his fine performance goes down the tubes, too, in that long finale. The whole last 20 minutes is overwrought and ruins whatever value this story did have to that point, which wasn't much to start with because the other main agenda is to bash capitalism by featuring greedy oilmen.<br/><br/>Actually, the reason I watched this was that it won the Academy Award for cinematography. Since photography is what I like best about films, I was anxious to see it. Well, you can add this to the growing list of Oscar-winning duds. It's okay, but nothing spectacular. Cinematographer Roger Deakins had two films up for the Oscar and both were far, far better filmed than this winning one. The only reason I give it a couple of stars is that Lewis is so interesting as an actor, and is here, too.<br/><br/>If you like bleak stories about a scumbag guy who cares only about making money drilling for oils - even at the expense of his young boy who suffers abuse from him, and another preacher given the typical Hollywood treatment, and you're big into depressing soap-opera- like stories, you may like this 160-minute disaster. For the rest of you who have better taste, prefer a little more optimism and objectivity in life, skip this bummer."

"Amyth47","9","3","4","27 October 2018"," Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career.
","My Rating : 9/10<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson took the first few pages from Upton Sinclair's novel Oil! and ran with them taking creative freedom to bring us this modern day classic. Oil! is more focused on the political and socioeconomic side of the oil boom that occurred in California during the early 1900's and the class warfare that was being waged, whereas Anderson's screenplay is focused on a story of a man, his son, and their relationship which makes for better cinema than the original source material. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance of his career (obviously in my humble opinion) as Daniel Plainview: a wealthy independent oil man, who battles with the big oil conglomerates along with a vengeful Evangelical Eli Sunday (played fantastically by Paul Dano) all the while trying to do right for himself and his son. Anderson delivers a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word and it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it was beat out by No Country for Old Men. Though No Country is a great film it is nowhere near the level of There Will Be Blood."

Manohla Dargis wrote, in her review for The New York Times, ""the film is above all a consummate work of art, one that transcends the historically fraught context of its making, and its pleasures are unapologetically aesthetic."" Esquire magazine also praised Day-Lewis's performance: ""what's most fun, albeit in a frightening way, is watching this greedmeister become more and more unhinged as he locks horns with Eli Sunday ... both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke.

The plot is a bit predictable and there is very little dialogue so this film appears to move slowly, yet keeps the viewer interested.<br/><br/>Superbly-acted, the characters are very realistic and recount the struggles faced by pioneers of that era. I can't recall too many other films where I felt empathy for a one with questionable ethics.<br/><br/>As some have suggested, the film is depiction of ""true"" capitalism, that built America over the last few centuries, with its inherent requirement of hard work ethic, ruthless pursuit of profit, and, at times, setting aside family values.<br/><br/>If you like art films and are interested in Americana, this is a film worth checking out."
"jematticusxe","9","3","4","10 August 2013"," A modern fable of greed that is both gorgeous and terrifying...
","Paul Thomas Anderson had proved himself a masterful filmmaker with titles such as ""Boogie Nights"" and of course ""Magnolia,"" and the wonderful, surreal comedic Adam Sandler outfit ""Punch-Drunk Love."" All of these tales involved broken people who we were able to care for. And then comes ""There Will Be Blood,"" a film about broken people who we do not care for, but learn to hate strongly. Anderson does not go out of his way to make this film intricately plotted, but instead simply focuses on two influential forces in America, forces that have been with us since the countries founding: Ruthless business and greedy religion. The primary focus is on Daniel Plainview, a man whose voice flows like molasses. He is the single most deplorable character in film since Scarface, and he's even less forgiving. He adopts a child in the name of having an heir to his business, only to later abandon him. He is the man who looks at people and sees ""nothing worth liking"" as he himself embodies the very greed that is wrong with mankind. And then there is Eli Sunday, the young preacher played by Paul Dano in a breakout role. He cares less for ministry as he does for himself. Any true man of faith (myself included) should see past the mask that this false prophet puts on and realize that the church he builds is for his greedy goals and monetary gain, putting him pretty much on the same level of Plainview in nastiness. The pressure builds and builds, and at the end the viewer is left breathless. So sit and watch this, set aside an afternoon to turn it over in your mind, and brace yourself, for there will, indeed, be blood."

'There will be blood' is a tale of greed and tragedy as Daniel Day Lewis delivers alter ego Daniel Plainview, a sneering up and coming oil baron in ruthless pursuit of valuable land to increase his wealth and dominance in early 1900's America. Little is known of Plainview's past, and domination not only of the oil world, but of his own realm is the only certantity as we see a man burning with hatred and equally desire manoeuvre his way to oil immortality. Utterly convincing acting, screenplay and cinematography, Anderson has hit the film making jackpot with this one, a movie so captivating and enthralling I consider it almost perfect. I would have to say its PTA'S most complete, mature and acclaimed film, one he would find almost impossible to top with future works.

","You may hear that Daniel Day Lewis is responsible for making this movie a masterpiece. For the most part, that is true. His acting is some of the most phenomenal work I have seen. Considering his regular accent, mannerisms, and appearance, he really transformed himself into the character of Plainview. <br/><br/>That is not to say Paul Dano wasn't wonderful. His quirky character sometimes explodes with shocking malevolence just as Plainview does and works fantastically as an antagonist.<br/><br/>The scores are astonishingly eerie. From the moment the film begins, you see a lot of build- up that is supported by eccentric music. <br/><br/>The only problem this movie faces is that it does not appeal to all audiences. Some may see the movie as slow and boring because the length of some scenes matches the pace of life back in the early 1900s: much slower than today.

"Koundinya","10","3","4","18 July 2012"," Method-acting revived through a brilliant script and direction
","Daniel Day-Lewis chooses his movies assiduously. He chooses a script in such a way that he gives his hundred per cent involvement in the role he is supposed to play. It's a 158-minute long movie with more than 95 per cent of the running time showing the actor in the lead role and no one else could have given an unblemished performance as Daniel.<br/><br/>I was quite convinced it was a biography until i realized it wasn't. Daniel Day-Lewis gives life to a character that exists in the form of written text. He, with the help of Paul Thomas Anderson, has created a hard-working turned money-devouring, impertinent, petulant owner of an oil company. While the present day audience demand CGI and breath-taking visuals, Paul Thomas Anderson has shown us what the movie-making in its pristine form and standard really looks like.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the life of a certain Daniel Plainview who struggles over the years searching for the 'black gold' until his efforts bear to fruition one day. He expands his empire and with money comes the pride and power and thus a plutocrat is born. He talks in terms of money and likes to prevaricate when it comes to buying land. He even abandons his son, feels betrayed by a person who convinces him to be his half-brother and beats up a local evangelist. He resorts to feigning to have faith in god in order to acquire land, land that would help him lay pipeline all the way up to the sea.<br/><br/>He ages with time and the obduracy and petulance he once possessed do not seem to have dwindled. He admits to not having any blood relatives when his son announces he was to start an oil company in Mexico with his just-married bride. He beats up the preacher he long despised to death.<br/><br/>The movie may have lacked the gravitas that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science demands to vote it the Best Picture of the year but by all film-making standards set by The Godfather, One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest and The Shawshank Redemption, the movie has found a place among the most-vaunted movies of the world."

"eddiez61","9","3","4","29 January 2011"," Why So Many People Hate This Excellent Movie...
","Why Daniel Plainview becomes such an evil character - that his personal motives are not clearly stated - is too much of a question for many people. The ""answer"", if in fact there's any real mystery, can be found in the film's superb cinematic method. This method is the curious angles, the vast vistas, the jump cut edits, and the subtle rhythms that form an eloquent but mute narration that tells a much more vivid story than any dialog or exposition ever could. It's in the near silences of pure movie action that we are able to glimpse the the dark forces that drive Daniel Plainview. People unaccustomed to or ignorant of the pleasures to be found in the act of reflection and contemplation will likely find these moments of the film to be very boring and too self indulgent. That's a tragedy, for them, because it's a great thrill to be included in the creative process, to be counted on to complete the story in our own minds where the creations of our own imaginations are so tremendously satisfying. Apparently, so many people are just too intellectually limited, to damn impatient, to appreciate this film's subtle power.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis has created a genuinely sinister persona, a compellingly complex villain, from just a few scraps of curious behavior. When we first meet him as an ambitious young man he already is something of an oddity. Daniel's character, his temperament, is powerfully restrained, disciplined, but volatile, explosive. Though his outbursts are few, they are impressive, and the threat of their recurrence at any moment darkens all his encounters. But his fiery disposition serves him well in forging his own path, in carving out a life for himself in an unforgiving, harsh environment. And it's precisely this fierce individualistic streak that both fuels his professional progress and sabotages his personal relations.<br/><br/>His great ambitions - an obvious parallel of those of our republic's early years - seem reasonable and worthwhile. And, as Daniel is fond of professing to the naive, vulnerable locals whom he so willfully defrauds, all our achievements are worthless if not done for the benefit of the family. His family, a chanced upon orphan boy, serves him well as an effective prop in his nefarious deceptions. But he does love the boy, and he does otherwise treat him quite well. It's complicated.<br/><br/>And it gets very complicated when he chooses to send the boy away to school following a tragic accident. It seems a reasonable enough decision at first, difficult as it is for us to witness. Daniel is blind to the error of this choice till it is made clear to him in a miraculously complex moment of self realization. This moment of clarity occurs while he is performing a very public ruse before the local congregation, pretending to be born again as a ploy to gain possession of a local man's land. As he begins his renouncement we sense that there's a sly devil at play within him. Daniel barely conceals his raging contempt for the young minister who is sincerely relishing this very public humiliation of his bitter rival. But soon Daniel's defiance seems to relax, his hidden rage transforms. He is, it seems, experiencing a genuine revelation, as he roars louder and louder the words the minister feeds him: ""I have abandoned my child. I have abandoned my boy!"" <br/><br/>""Yes, you have abandoned your boy"" I was almost saying out loud, as the truth of his action is suddenly revealed. And he has this charlatan minister to thank for his redemption. Daniel realizes this and he smiles as the howling minister violently slaps him in the face harder and harder, again and again. Soon, the passion of the moment recedes, and Daniel is accepted into the community, and sits exhausted in the pew with a warm embrace from the young girl who happens to be the daughter of the rancher he first conned and is the sister of the disingenuous minister. Daniel has simultaneously gained a profound insight into his own character and has amazingly dodged the corrupt minister's envious wrath. Has he beaten God, the Devil, both, or maybe neither. Then, without any obvious cues or overt indications, I was then somehow increasingly aware that Daniel's psychic triumph will now only lead to a harsh retaliation against the minister. Just what form that retribution will take or when it will occur is unclear. This all is transmitted so very subtly, so very artfully, without any dialog, just through Daniel's remarkable performance. This subtlety is the reason so many viewers are so underwhelmed by and contemptuous of this mature, intelligent film. There is then a profound sense of impending doom infusing the remainder of the film. It's just a matter of time now till destiny is fulfilled, till providence wins out. And when it suddenly, unexpectedly does, it's doubly shocking. How and why Daniel does what he does is so grimly, so exquisitely satisfying, that I was shocked with myself, with my primal reaction.<br/><br/>This self revelation, that I can be shocked by my own impulses and desires, is a deeply disturbing aspect of the human psyche that PT Anderson has chosen to illuminate. It's the point, it seems, of the movie. And then I was stunned to realize that what I had just witnessed may well have been merely the hysterical delusion of a crazed, relentless, senile mind. Did what just occur ""really"" happen, or was it a brutal dream, a waking nightmare? This remarkable, challenging question of whether or not we can trust our own eyes, apparently, is lost on just about everyone who has seen this film. And that's a very big, very critical loss. But I think I shouldn't be surprised..."

","You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission."

","When one of the finest filmmakers teams up with one of the most accomplished actors of our times, you know you're in for something unique.<br/><br/>P.T. Anderson has made us wait far too long since his last feature, Punch Drunk Love (2002), as has Daniel Day Lewis, (only one indie film since Gangs of New York). Intelligently cautious about selecting their projects, Anderson wooed Lewis to his script based upon Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil! A title the film kept while shooting. The current title is a little deceptive, as the blood refers to the relationship between father and son which makes up the core of this film and not greed versus faith as the marketing would have us believe.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is an oil man, something he is proud of and yet has isolated himself from the world in order to follow his dreams. When the world catches up, unexpected interactions come into play. Like Faust, Plainview loses more of himself as his wealth increases.<br/><br/>This is a fascinating story in the vein of 'Giant', a rare dramatic background of oil drilling, though this is more reminiscent of Citizen Kane than anything else.<br/><br/>Anderson, perhaps all too aware of the similarities, steers clear of the journey of a tycoon, whose soul is slowly shedding and strips it back to mere one on one interactions, unlike his previous films such as Magnolia where numerous characters shift across the screen in a lush tapestry. Indeed, much of the action takes place outdoors, in isolated settings and this is no coincidence. Anderson knows what he wants and he expresses it; Plainview with his son, with his brother, with his young mirror image, the evangelist, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). Daniel Day Lewis is the showman and Anderson gives him the stage.<br/><br/>Anderson's style is dominant, his trademark long steadicam shots, tracking in and out of poignant character moments and a stunning soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, (sadly overlooked by the Oscars), which brings attention to itself but that's the point. Anderson has always favored a heavy soundtrack, the odd effects of Punch Drunk, the disco tunes in Boogie Nights, and the Aimee Mann laded Magnolia.<br/><br/>Blood is a remarkable actor's film, delving deep into theatrical tradition. You can almost hear the 'Rosebudian' whispers of Orson Welles as he spies the black seeping up from the desert with fascination and the subsequent malevolence it inflicts on those that are near it."

","There will be blood is a Path breaking Artistic Cinema of an Ambiguous & Epic Tale, so uniquely different that it will influence filmmakers for generations. Seemed to have written with a definitive pattern, Paul Thomas Anderson successfully exemplifies the most top-notch character study ever written in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The Post TWBB viewing experience has lead to Innumerable conceptions & misconceptions amongst different viewers. This is because, this movie neither allow us to get linked with the plot which lays underneath nor letting us into the character's shoes. So the after effect is nothing but confusion about various events of the plot lying on its surface and struggle to understand the meaning of those events.<br/><br/>But once you are in it, the blood will flow through your veins with a force so stout, that the Movie will haunt you. The more you watch again, the more you shall extract and gradually break through its enigma.<br/><br/>The significance of this Movie's greatness is that it's been gifted with a screenplay deliberately planted with loose ends and missing links, but filled with allusions.<br/><br/>At first place, TWBB is a homage paid to Stanley Kubrick Movies and many other classics. In other way, the entire movie can be said as an elaborated portray of the first section of 2001: A Space Odyssey's ""The Dawn of Man"" Again here, ""The Dawn of Man"" depicts the invention of 'Tool' (which lead to a perpetual progress of mankind) and domination of the Inventor in the fight of conflicts for drinking water of the land. TWBB too, illustrates the discovery of 'Oil' by the protagonist and his conquest over the conflicts with various other opportunists.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie remains less significant to what is shown in the Movie. The crux lies in what is not shown in the Movie.<br/><br/>Set at the Turn of the 20th Century, The Lead Character of the Movie is Daniel Plainview, a ruthless & highly ambitious opportunists who struggles his way up to become an Oil Tycoon; a person for whom the only route for salvation is accumulation of unlimited wealth. On surface, we only see him as a greedy businessman, but as soon as we try to think what makes him that, we are on a journey of understanding this vibrant personality - The terrible past or childhood days of Daniel Plainview, not shown or narrated in the Movie, which molded the mind of this man. And then you have all answers, for why Plainview never hits his son, why he hates common people, why he never worship god.<br/><br/>The Movie depicts the Two Primary Driving Forces of Human Civilization which is Capitalism & Religion, in its early stage. The Petroleum Boom & Religious Propaganda intensifies as all human sentiments of greed, social recognition, religious fanaticism, love, family, ambition & survival unravel amongst the various characters setting up an odyssey of conflicts of opportunists for who shall defy or abide whom.<br/><br/>Leaving the Plot aside, There will be blood has one of the greatest one man towering performance in the history of cinema. Daniel Day Lewis accurately depicts the central character of Daniel Plainview immortalizing that character.<br/><br/>""I can't keep doing this on my own with these  People"" - The dialog will remain immortal."

","Based on a novel ""Oil!""..A very strong & theatrical performance by Daniel. Music was loud and brought about a stillness and grandeur to the desert, oil and sweat. Daniel's swagger as a businessman (OILMAN) carried the movie till the end. Eli, the self-proclaimed priest character, was suppose to be the anti-thesis to Daniel's character, but the portrayal wasn't done as strongly as Daniel Plainview's character. Many viewers, after watching this movie, could be confused and left with bitterness. I was simply stunned. <br/><br/>For me, the highlight of this movie was the screenplay and the depth of Plainview's character. 2 scenes bring out this aspect - one where he was drinking with his newfound brother, Henry, and claims that he does not like anyone else to succeed around him. You could feel the hatred, the jealousy and the scorn inside the man. Second, when he kills henry, buries him and sleeps on that very ground. Cold! <br/><br/>Not a happy movie, but a good work of cinema."
"DubhDoo","10","4","6","17 August 2012"," Filmmaking at its best.
","The opening 15 minutes of this film are a thing to behold; while we have no dialogue or exposition, it is the score by Jonny Greenwood which is most striking, with a dissonant, strained note that sets the tone for the remainder of the film (it is easily one of the best film scores of recent times). Along with Robert Elswit's sumptuous cinematography it conveys a mood of impending doom, as we witness Daniel Day-Lewis, entirely alone, at work in a barren landscape. The sound design as he breaks his leg or the sharp 'chink' of the axe is a perfect example of truly cinematic sound design. And that is precisely what this film is - truly cinematic; it is a film in the purest sense: on a visual level, a aural level and a visceral level. And for that it's mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Yet upon my initial viewing the most impactful aspect was, of course, Day-Lewis' tour-de-force performance as Daniel Plainview; channelling Orson Welles and John Huston, he is just a revelation to watch, giving a towering and unrivalled piece of acting, that is just flat-out astonishing, grasping you by the scruff of the neck, to the point where you just cannot turn away from this flawless portrayal of a hideous monster, who is one of the most horrible, rapacious and power-obsessed characters to hit cinema screens this past decade. His genius just drips off the screen, as it conveys the proper skill of an unequalled actor, of someone who firmly took this role with a fierce determination, illustrated by the fact that even before he utters a word, we have grasped the depth of this character. His detractors will say his acting here is too histrionic or even ostentatious, but Day-Lewis is aware that Plainview is supposed to be showy, being a larger-than-life businessman with a ruthless drive for power, and because of that we are given a wonderfully bravura performance.<br/><br/>The only other considerable role in the film is that of Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. While receiving much criticism for being nowhere near Day-Lewis' level of acting, this is undeserved as he is excellent in the supporting role he's given. And while he doesn't deliver the performance of his career, his turn as Sunday is very watchable and proves to be great foil to Day-Lewis with their brilliant scenes together. The remainder of the cast work as best they can with secondary roles, in what is essentially Day-Lewis' show, when it comes to the acting.<br/><br/>Ever since he made considerable waves with 1997's Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson was always a name to watch, with many regarding him as one of the most interesting and best filmmakers of his generation, yet when this was released, he became lauded as ""THE filmmaker of his generation"", and after my second viewing of There Will Be Blood, I came to agree with the statement wholeheartedly. Anderson is a auteur with encyclopedic knowledge of film and the technique. He gets it, basically, unlike say, Tommy Wiseau. He is a real master director, and this film exemplifies that, whether it's the breathtaking set-piece involving a derrick going up in flames, the opening or the THAT end sequence (which contains what is quite possibly the greatest piece of acting I've ever witnessed). Here we have a cinematic poet, defiantly refusing to work as part of a digitalised film business, by shooting on 35mm; which only strengthens the film's relationship with it's closest cousins: the old-school Hollywood epics.<br/><br/>This is a stunning and sprawling work of intelligence, originality, ambition and blistering intensity; one of the few films I would call, without any hesitation, ""a masterpiece"". Easily the best film of the past decade, it's a mesmerizing, epic cinematic feat about greed, lies, religion, capitalism and insanity delivered by a magnificent director and the best actor working today."
"KnightsofNi11","9","4","6","24 June 2011"," A Modern Masterpiece
","There is a way to turn storytelling into true art through the use of a camera. Paul Thomas Anderson understands exactly how and he has proved again and again that he is a master of powerful, moving, aesthetically brilliant storytelling. His most recent film was the 2007 period piece There Will Be Blood. The film is about business man Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the greatest performances of the 21st century. Plainview starts out as a dirt poor oil field worker who grows into a deranged and greedy oil man who plays a vicious game of deceit and treachery with a poor town whose devout faith is the only thing that keeps them all going. It is the complex tale of one man's rise to power and descent into greedy insanity. It boasts a kind of intelligence that modern American cinema rarely achieves. This is a film that feels like it should have been made decades ago during the fruition of the American movie industry, yet instead it was made in 2007 and has successfully revitalized the potential of American filmmaking.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood succeeds so extravagantly as a careful blend between artistic imagery and cinematography and sincere storytelling. This films story is strictly for intellectuals. It doesn't spell out anything for the viewer and it doesn't hold your hand as you watch it. You have to absorb the film rather than just watch it. It is subtle and quiet and yet so enthralling and so moving. The film's incredible focus drives home all of its meaning and messages. It isn't just the story of one man's trial and tribulations in the oil industry. It is a story of greed, obsession, cruelty, and faith. The film cleverly blends two different lifestyles, one of the stalwart business man and one of devout religious passion into an ingenious story of ambition versus faith. Few films are able to so intelligently tell a story of such calibre against such an unlikely backdrop.<br/><br/>It is one thing to be able to piece such a sophisticated story together, it is another to tell that story in such an artistic and captivating way as Paul Thomas Anderson's direction of There Will Be Blood. The cinematography of this film is incredible and Anderson's camera work is astounding to a cinematically intellectual eye. His camera movement is so subtle yet so brilliant in its quiet complexities that you are driven to feel so much more emotion and captivation while watching this movie than you would expect. The sweeping pans, the immaculate wide shots, the enthralling close-ups, are all what make There Will Be Blood such a subtly excellent work of art. This film demands a higher level of appreciation and I can easily say that it isn't for everybody. It works on such low key levels that it unexpectedly grabs hold of you carries you along for almost three hours of pure captivation.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a prime example of modern aesthetic storytelling. The film is practically flawless in its execution and it achieves all of what it set out to do. It makes you think and it also mystifies your eyes as you gaze into its immaculate lens. And with the addition of Anderson's fancy script and Daniel Day-Lewis' magnificent performance you've got yourself a modern American masterpiece."
"ElMaruecan82","10","4","6","22 March 2011"," The most flamboyant portrayal of materialism and its alienating effect ...
","It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything  <br/><br/>There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...<br/><br/>And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.<br/><br/>And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.<br/><br/>And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!"

It conveys grandeur and imagery spectacularly in it's cinematography and direction, it's acting is spectacular and larger than life, the soundtrack is haunting and shocking and the story is universal and surprisingly relatable.<br/><br/>Daniel-Day Lewis portrays Daniel Plainview, a great actor portraying a great character. Daniel succumbs to greed and human indulgence. He addmitedly ""hates most people"", and wants to be alone. He uses his son for a sales tactic. He's a drunk. So why do we like him so much? Because he is us. He is what we are if we truly succumb to human nature. He descends lower and lower into this personal hell until the name of the movie comes into play.<br/><br/>His adversary is Eli, a evangelical preacher. The characters contrast well and gives Daniel chances to show his personality. Eli is played by Paul Dano. I honestly don't understand the criticism of his acting in this movie. I thought he was a fantastic actor worthy of standing next to Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>I really can't describe this movie.

","I was blown away by this movie, totally and completely!! Daniel Day Lewis plays the role of his life, I've never seen such an authentic performance (except perhaps Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth)!! <br/><br/>The complexity of Daniel Plainview's character is greater than life and I could not refrain from sympathizing with him, despite of his greed and his ruthlessness. Because what I see in the character of Daniel is one of those pioneers that helped build America, people with blood on their hands, but who had this strong, relentless will to succeed, to be number one, to be the best. This strong will bring them fortune and power, but will also be their downfall. Daniel loves his adoptive son underneath it all, but when his son threatens to become his concurrent in the oil business, he renegades him. That scene, showing the victory of the dark side of Daniel (greed) over his feelings for his son, is absolutely heart-breaking and to my surprise I found myself crying and hoping that he will not do it. It's like seeing Anakin Skywalker become Darth Wader, so to speak, but much more complex. To me, Daniel is a good person, he protects a little girl from a violent father, adopts an orphan (mingled with personal reasons to benefit his business, it's true, but still, he loves that boy), and accepts a long lost brother. But his inner demons estrange him from the ones around him, and when the brother turns out to be a phony, he kills him. <br/><br/>Another absolutely brilliant point of this movie is Paul Dano, playing the fervent priest Eli Sunday. I don't know for other people seeing this movie, but the character of Eli Sunday is to me the typical cowardly, week and despicable person that will use any means it can to get the power it so desperately desires. In this case, it's by founding a religious cult. Daniel and Eli both desire power over the ones around them (hence the conflict between them), but they achieve it differently: one by sheer force,violence or money, the other by manipulation. Personally I prefer the methods of Daniel, there's plenty of despicable ass-kissers of the likes of Eli just waiting to have you at their mercy nowadays and I sure can't stand them. I was really glad when Daniel tells Eli at the end there's no more oil in those fields, it warmed my heart to see that hypocrite worm squirm...after which comes that rough ending, which is hard to endure, but describes Daniel's complete descent into darkness and his total separation from human kind (""I am finished.""). <br/><br/>What a great movie! What a fine performance! A true masterpiece and I'm sure it will become a classic. <br/><br/>10/10"

","*There are a few plot points that are discussed in this review* <br/><br/>I don't write a lot of reviews on here, but for a movie like this, I think I will. Of all of the best movies I saw from 2007, the quirky and original Juno, the suspenseful No Country for Old Men, and the hilarious Hot Fuzz, There Will Be Blood remains the best. Very rarely does a movie appear where EVERYTHING comes together perfectly. The acting, directing, writing, music, and cinematography are all top notch here.<br/><br/>The film involves Daniel Plainview, a prospector who agrees with the Sunday family in the town of Little Boston, California to drill on their land for oil. When Daniel does discovers oil, tensions between himself and Paul Sunday, a priest in the town, rise as they both become more and more greedy as the oil keeps coming in.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives the performance of the decade as Daniel Plainview. Paul Dano, who was in Little Miss Sunshine, really surprised me here. There is a scene late in the movie where Daniel is baptized, where Dano and Lewis both really shine. It's a chilling scene that is still just as effective no matter how many times I see it.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, the entire movie is filmed with images that stick with you long after you've seen the movie. Daniel falling down the mineshaft early in the film, an oil derrick catching fire and the many workers who rush to snap the cables and wait until the time comes to dynamite it. The aforementioned baptism scene. And of course the ending, undeniably one of the most surreal and jaw-dropping moments in recent movie history. Watching this movie for the first time (on blu-ray, which I highly recommend), I had to rewind it and watch the scene again 2 or 3 times, just to be sure that what I was seeing was actually happening. I know it sounds strange, but it's true.<br/><br/>This is the best film of 2007 and probably of the decade."
"Ziya90","9","4","6","15 February 2010"," A very powerful film and different on the subject
","There will be Blood is an example of quintessential cinema, also it is an entertainment as an adventure film and this is Daniel Day Lewis's second greatest performance after My Left Foot. Even if it is not superhuman like My Left Foot, it was amazing. As for direction, as said, this is a masterful work with a powerful story telling. Honestly, I had not supposed that Anderson was such a master director, despite I have seen Magnolia which is a masterpiece for me. At this point, it is frustrating that some people find the movie very boring, slow paced and even some say that nothing happens in this movie! This is funny, because There will be Blood is not an art house film-I don't mean that art house films are boring, but this is an adventure film like Gone with the Wind or something. This is an adventure with a rare and important plot which had not been handled before: oil! As known, Anderson inspired from the another masterpiece The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The story is very adventurous here and Daniel Day Lewis is Bogart? Anyway, the moments take place in the train station affected me a lot, for me it is may be the zenith of the movie. It was touching but in a silent and deep way. However, I had a problem with this movie which is the final act. This is the only disappointment for me. The final act clashes with the atmosphere, the tone, the spirit of the movie that is built throughout. it is like the movie steps into a new age and the movie turns into something postmodern and this post-modernism doesn't fit the movie. Then, Daniel Plainview starts to talk about milkshake, milkshake??? Also, the twin stuff was far fetched and not convincing."

","Just got done seeing this film for the first time, and it punched me dead in the face. Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation of the main character Mr. Plainview is an absolute tour de force. His crystallized greed and over-the-top bitterness jabbed a nerve ending in me. I can understand how some viewers might call his approach too much, but considering the source material (a moralizing novel written to generate an inflammatory response), it felt right. the atonal musical score has been a bone to pick for many viewers as well. for me, although it did not seem to fit with the time period of the movie, it felt right to me as well. It reminded me of some of the music that filmmaker Stanley Kubrick put in his movies, and since Kubrick is my all time favorite director, i'm probably a little biased. but i think this movie is meant to be a work of art that tries hard to provoke an emotional response. the film could be seen as a moralizing tale, a cynical comment about the potential depths of mankind's greed, a stern warning, or a dozen other things. i got a great deal out of the film, and i think it will age pretty well as the years go by. it may feel admittedly boring and too drawn out at times, but it came across to me as a richly textured piece, showcasing Lewis' performance.

","This movie had fantastic acting, beautiful visuals, and a tremendous authentic feel to it. On the other hand, the story was slow in parts, the soundtrack was ghastly, and the movie was a tad pretentious. Let's face it, Daniel Day Lewis is one of this generation's finest actors and deserves any accolades for his performance. What I don't get is why this movie is being touted as the one of the 200 best movies of all-time. It was OK. Some great things, some not so great things. Could it have been shorter? Probably. But there are plenty of fantastic, epic 3 hour movies for all kinds of taste (Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Gone With The Wind, etc). I just don't think this was one of them.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of DDL, then you will likely enjoy this movie. It had some funny moments and several great scenes. But it is boring. Heck, there isn't a single word spoken for the first 30 minutes. OK perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seemed like 30 minutes. In fact, during the first scene, I thought, ""That has to be the most boring job in the world."" 60 minutes later I realized I was mistaken - a film critic having to sit through this movie would be the most boring job in the world. However, it did improve, if only slightly.<br/><br/>In the end, this was really nothing more than a turn of the century period piece about the oil rush. There was a lot of ""I'm going to buy that land!"" and ""I like to quail hunt"" and ""we believe in God, you heathen!"" I think I expected too much and was let down. I wanted Gangs of New York and The Last of the Mohicans and instead I got The Aviator....a fine movie, about a crazy rich guy. Don't give me my money back, just warn me next time."

Think of a lot of other anti-heroes or antogonists in movie history: Jake LaMotta, Darth Vader, Travis Bickle, Gollum, Tony Montana, or even Bill the Butcher. Each of these characters had some sort of positive quality that you can relate too. Daniel Plainview's character arc is just a slow steady descent into a black hole. I understand that not every movie can be sunshine and roses, but I just can't revel in this kind of nihilism. There has to at least a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel."

I'm no reviewer, but I feel compelled to add a review here just to bring the rating down to something reasonable...like a 6/10. The beginning starts out interesting enough, but, like many other viewers, I was waiting for something to happen the entire movie. When it did, it was a let-down. In Juno I felt the same way, but when the bomb dropped in that movie, it was actually interesting. This was just a mess. The director may have done a good job, but he was dealing with a terrible story. I haven't read Oil, but I can bet its better than this. The only movie worse than this is Pirates of the Caribbean 3."

","Do yourself a favor and do not waste your time or money on this film. It was the longest 2 and a half hours that I have spent on a movie in a very long time. The movie is boring and very slow moving. They think they are clever and artsy by not having any dialogue for the first 25 minutes. Then when the dialogue does begin, you wish it was a silent film. The producer of this film should thank his lucky stars for Day-Lewis as he was the only thing to keep one interested and that is still debatable. In addition, like many movies of today, it also takes a bad view on religion and leaves a very bitter taste. This was a classless and tasteless movie and I am disappointed that Day-Lewis was a part of it."

They can be art, and Im the first person to admit that. But you know what you call art for arts sake? BORING CRAP.<br/><br/>I understand nowdays its trendy to go against the basic layout of a story, initiating event, conflict, climax, and all that.

","I have never seen a film to deteriorate in the last 20 minutes in the way that ""There Will Be Blood"" does.<br/><br/>The film has a great plot- a man who becomes very wealthy from oil drilling, and the apparent abandoning of his son who is deafened by the blast of oil being discovered.<br/><br/>I thought that this would be the basic story line, the relationship between father and son through the years. Instead, we see the horrible relationship between Lewis and the town pastor.<br/><br/>This film is certainly an anti-religious one. At the end, we see the human frailties possessed by the pastor. The two had a fight by film's end in a manner that reminded me of Max Bialystock and Leo Blum fighting in 1967's ""The Producers."" The ending is simply awful.<br/><br/>Before the last 20 minutes, Lewis gives a restrained but powerful performance as the wealthy oil driller who is really insane.<br/><br/>A the time of the horrible ending, Lewis announces to his valet that he is finished. He should have been so 20 minutes sooner."

","I'd read other stories about the hard lives and deceptions common to the early oilmen seeking their fortunes. It was thus with trepidation that I went to see this film. One definitely gets a flavour of the hard stoicism of the participants as the script and acting are superb. Nevertheless, I'd liked to have seen more of the slimy/silver tongued ruthlessness in the later dialogue with the corporate oilmen that is reputed to have persisted at the time. The film as a whole is a great testament to the many tales that no doubt can be told about this period in the US's history. However, I found great fault with the musical choices throughout - all overly intrusive, clanging and orchestral when something more basic and wild would have coloured the scenes much more effectively. Daniel Day Lewis was fabulous as usual but the Director should have insisted that he maintain the 'limp' more consistently - a major scene early on after his injury sees him running without impediment...such a shame as otherwise Daniel's performance was spot on. A hard film to watch."
"Rathko","10","9","18","22 January 2008"," Absolutely Mezmerizing
","The movie opens with an almost Wagnerian prelude of discordant chords and leitmotifs, of flickering candlelight and abstract images, that climax in Daniel Plainview's birth from the ground, fully grown and covered in oil, the blood of the earth. Like some kind of primal being from ancient mythology, he has no childhood, no family, no background. He exists for oil and the power, not the wealth, that it can give him. He is matched against an equally ambitious and ruthless individual in the form of Eli Sunday who, like Plainview, has no real interest in wealth, but in power. As Plainview exploits the blood of the earth in his quest to manipulate those around him, so Eli exploits the blood of Christ.<br/><br/>And so we have an American Epic that is reminiscent of John Steinbeck and Sinclair Lewis in its depiction of the nation's formative years and the battle between the excesses of capitalism and religion and the weakness and frailty of Man in the face of temptation. Loneliness, desperation, love, betrayal, greed, pride, and a ruthless and unquenchable thirst for power are all explored in a dozen degrees of subtlety. It's played with the full-bloodied brio of archetypes with a sweeping grandeur of image and theme that used to be common fifty years ago but is almost extinct in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Overblown, fascinating, beautiful in its period detail, ""There Will Be Blood"", is a richly rewarding intellectual and aesthetic experience that deserves much award recognition."

","Lewis hams it up in his Oscar winning role as Daniel Plainview. His performance is truly phenomenal. But unfortunately, this is all TWBB has going for it. There is simply not a rich enough storyline to justify the film's close to 3 hour running time. Plainview comes across as a boorish, manipulative hustler in the first 2/3rds of the film. Not until the film's final act does Lewis get to go full throttle and act like an unpredictable sadistic madman. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"", the title of the film is misleading to say the least. I've seen more blood in the average Nip/Tuck episode. To the film's credit, the cinematography and set design are superb.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays twin brothers in the movie who befriend and cross Plainview. I did not know these were supposed to be two separate characters until I read an article about the film after I saw it. Paul Thomas Anderson is hardly the cinematic auteur critics would have you believe. On the plus side, this is clearly PTA's most accomplished work thus far. At least he didn't try ripping off Scorsese's GoodFellas (Boogie Nights) and Altman's Short Cuts (Magnolia) this time around.<br/><br/>Long story short, There Will Be Blood shows PTA has grown slightly as a moviemaker and story teller. DDL confirms the notion he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. But that is where the praise begins and ends. TWBB is not the work of a gifted filmmaker, and is surely not one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>As a side note, I fail to understand why the MPAA gave this an R classification. This film could very reasonably have been rated PG-13."

","Well, I feel a little better knowing it's not just me that was disappointed, (After reading other comments here). This just can't be one of the greatest movies of all time. There wasn't much freshness to it. (Not like No Country or Juno) The theme of greed is just....there. Not new or enlightening. No real revelations, aha moments or really shocking or surprising moments. Despite the building and dramatic score, the anticipation......not much happens. We don't really get to understand the history of the times, nor do we get to understand the characters. I think under further scrutiny and some time, the hype will die down. Too bad, it could've been so much more."
"rhinocerosfive-1","7","8","16","1 February 2008"," there will be no good reason
","Sometimes a single virtue can outshine many glaring inadequacies. A lot of folks, understandably awed by Daniel Day-Lewis's titanic central performance, have mistaken THERE WILL BE BLOOD for as good a film as his acting would warrant. I don't think it is, for a single big reason, but the opportunity to see a master at work is plenty of excuse to see this movie anyway.<br/><br/>The rest of the acting is alright, some of it better than that. The movie has a very specific look, which works to sustain the mood of menace and mounting tension. But none of the characters has an arc. Nobody grows except the son, and that happens for the most part off camera. <br/><br/>The trouble is a lack of drama. Daniel Plainview's central conflict is within himself - everybody else he defeats with deceptive ease. Now, that's perfectly acceptable as far as theme and character go. But this is a story, and even more than that it's a movie: the conflict requires visual externalization. So nothing happens that really matters, until the last five minutes; and, typically, of the last fifteen minutes, ten of them are just an empty rehash of the previous two hours' Pyrrhic battles. Nothing matters to a man who wins everything, so the story doesn't matter to me, until it's over. And that's too late.<br/><br/>In a short career, PT Anderson has already made a few movies that don't look like each other, and only a couple that do. That's nice, and shows a breadth of ability. This is his first movie that's no fun to watch, and that's okay too, because it's not supposed to be fun. But it's not anything else either. The joke of the picture is: here's a guy who would not be satisfied, who finally, Oedipally, must destroy himself to make room for his own following generation, because his son refuses to do it for him. I hear the joke, I get the joke, I just don't think it's funny.<br/><br/>But this actor is his own show. He does not require a script; he does not need a director. In fact, something happens to directors who hire Daniel Day-Lewis: they get steamrolled by the awesome fortune of possessing such a spectacular camera subject. Scorsese and Mann (not on their best days anyway, it must be said), Nicholas Hytner and Phil Kaufman, everybody since James Ivory: they all have fallen down before the prospect of working with this immensely talented fellow. And you can't say it was the worst thing they ever did, this relinquishing of control. If you're going to give it up, you could do worse than give it up to this guy."
"bariswheel","10","8","16","12 January 2008"," Timeless Classic
","There are SPOILERS all over this interpretation. So please don't read any further if you don't want to spoil it for yourself. You have been warned.<br/><br/>-----------------------SPOILERS BEGIN-------------------------<br/><br/>Not a very religious man, this Daniel Plainview, one of the first things I noticed, and also which I think is KEY to better understand this movie. It seemed like he was actually very spiteful of religion, that it had somewhat betrayed him because he didn't have any loved ones, blood related. You also don't know his past, maybe he was abandoned when he was a child, why didn't he keep in touch with his parents? Was he not loved? So yeah he's a very 'This is a ruthless world, everyone for himself, no one's here to help' kinda guy.<br/><br/>The part of the movie where you see him angriest is when his 'brother' tells him he's not his brother. Right after this moment his character becomes more and more sinister as the movie progresses, and takes a sharp downturn as soon as he realizes his only family left had actually died from tuberculosis. After that, his greed for success overtakes him, to the point where he starts using his 'son' to buy more property.<br/><br/>Now of course he can't fully shake off the human in him, so I still think he struggles with his love for his 'son', but it's a SUPER close second to his addiction to greed, which I think explains the scene where his 'son' tells him that he will become his competitor and build his own business. In that moment, he is compelled to choose between the empire he dedicated his entire life building, from scratch, or his 'son'. You can see in his eyes, he's overwhelmed by an intense internal conflict there; should he keep his empire, or endorse his son's prospects...love for son, or greed? Wait! I don't have to choose, yay!... he's not my son! (which becomes very convenient for his internal battle) At which point he goes on a ruthless diatribe and tells him the truth. It's really not much different from him shooting his 'brother', metaphorically speaking. Connection by blood is very important for this guy, he ditches his long-time business partner immediately after his 'brother' contacts him and becomes his new partner.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end, him killing the 'fake priest' could be taken many ways. One interesting way to take it would be the score he needed to settle with what represented a super being. He was never religious, and perhaps this was out of spite for God not blessing him with blood-related 'loved ones'. He kills the priest, and this is actually a pretty clever (maybe not Hollywood-esquire, or satisfying) ending for the movie, since he finally attains closure and gets his revenge by killing a messenger of God, to which he follows it by ""I'm done."" Perhaps this is why he never decided to marry and have children. I don't see Plainview as someone who would say, well, I did get screwed for not having any close relatives, oh well, I'll give this another shot and try to raise a family of my own, and perhaps they'll love me. Plainview does not compromise! No way. this guy has a ""Oh yeah?! Well, !@#$ you!!!' attitude to everything and everyone he comes across. You have to really look at it from his persona, really become this guy to understand his motives, his demeanor. Plainview was out for revenge, and love, couple with unparalleled greed to achieve his objectives. Everything was a competition for him, he hated everybody.<br/><br/>""I don't want anyone else to succeed; I hate most people."" So all in all, I think this movie is a story of greed, vengeance, and a sad search for love. It would be pretty interesting to see a prequel of this movie.<br/><br/>So why call it 'There Will Be Blood', It's definitely a clever way to quote Daniel's sub conscience, i.e. ""there will be vengeance"", ""there will be greed"", ""there will be blood-related family"". It's Daniel Plainview's harbinger, in a sense.<br/><br/>----------------SPOILERS END-----------------------<br/><br/>You can piece this movie in so many ways, which is why I truly enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Everything aside, I think everyone agrees that DDL's acting nothing short of timeless and legendary. He's only done 4 movies in the last 10 years, known to be one of the most selective actors in the world."
"gamer8740","9","8","16","1 January 2008"," Worth Your Time
","Yes, I liked this film. A lot.<br/><br/>But there are some aspects I found disappointing or even objectionable: Why was the intensity of the film destroyed at the end in the bowling alley/mansion scene with the Milkshake nonsense. Laughter, the best mood breaker. It seemed to almost mock the submersion which the film had demanded up until that point. As if to say, so what? <br/><br/>Eli's dual personality is left up to the visual evidence he is the same person as Paul and the subsequent descents into lunacy, such as his attack on his father. Wouldn't it have been a more forthright treatment if Plainview had looked into his eyes when he first introduces himself as Eli and said something. Such as, ""Oh really?"" <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is in every scene. A cinematic breakthrough some will shout. I felt that some perspective from without, from someone else's point of view, would have helped better define Plainview.<br/><br/>I've never read the Sinclair novel. I'm wondering if there's any insight into Plainview's later life, after he ""makes it"" and builds his house. It would have been a better use of time than the so, so long unspoken mine scenes at the beginning.<br/><br/>I suppose those were used to set up the harshness of the business, the physicality of success in oil and the likelihood of mishap. Okay. But why so very long? Yeh, we understand we can't see at the bottom of the shaft. Let's move on.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is excellent, but one dimensional. The script and his approach doesn't allow us any view of Plainview's doubts, did he ever have any? Or his humanity, was it beaten out of him? <br/><br/>Also, the score was a complete imposition. Slowly increasing sound level equals increasing tension. Oh, come on. More subtlety would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>God and greed and guts and good, very good. But just short of being the best film of the year."
"Navaros","1","12","27","2 April 2008"," There Will Be Ripoffs, Stale Old Clichés, Repetition , Boredom and an Overlong Running-Time
","First of all it must be said that Saw II called, and it wants it's catchphrase back. Saw II made famous the catchphrase ""Oh yes, there will be blood!"" as stated by the excellent actor Tobin Bell playing the amazing character Jigsaw in that movie. The title ""There Will Be Blood"" is in my opinion quite obviously a ripoff of Saw II's catchphrase after Saw II popularized it. But the ripoffs don't end there. Not by a longshot.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives a magnificent performance as Daniel Plainview, an evil & insane oil tycoon from the early 1900's. The problem is, he also gave the *exact same* magnificent performance in the old Martin Scorscese movie, ""Gangs of New York"" when he played Bill the Butcher. The *only* difference between Lewis' performance in these two movies is that he changed his accent, and his hairstyle is slightly different. These are minor differences. Other than that, the two performances and characters are completely identical. Daniel Day Lewis is just re-hashing here the same thing he's *already done* just as well in that older movie. His character even bludgeons another main character to death, off-screen, in both movies, in an almost identical way. Having said that, he gives great performances in both movies so he's interesting to watch due to his undeniable acting mastery. But there is nothing *original* about his performance in There Will Be Blood (TWBB). And great acting alone can't save a movie that has nothing else going for it.<br/><br/>TWBB is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, but it doesn't need to be. Most of the movie spends gratuitous amounts of screen-time showing repetitive shots over and over again. Showing lots of CGI fire and black smoke for 10 minutes in a row, on more than one occasion. Shots which drag on and on needlessly for several minutes long-after the audience has already gotten the point of the scene. The content of TWBB could *easily* fit into 1 hour and 10 minutes or less.<br/><br/>For some very bizarre reason, TWBB *thinks* it's a horror movie. It is constantly blaring cheesy ""scary horror movie music"" over every scene. Horror music that in my opinion rips off the theme from the Hitchcock movie ""Psycho"" as well as a host of other horror movies over the last 50 years. This is only speculation, but my guess is that perhaps they started with the title of the movie first, and since it was ripped off from a horror movie, decided that they might as well go right ahead and make TWBB *into* a horror movie. Then made the cheesy horror movie music score before doing anything else. But somewhere down the line some smart person realized that they weren't supposed to be making a horror movie and they stopped trying to, yet decided to save some money by using the cheesy horror movie score anyways.<br/><br/>One of the main characters in this movie is a fraudster ""faith healer"" Priest who doesn't believe what he preaches. This is a stale old cliché that has literally been done *thousands* of times in movies and television ever since they first existed. The only difference in TWBB's take on this is that there is no balanced perspective. TWBB *only* presents an anti-God, atheist point of view. Whereas other productions that have explored the fraudster faith healer theme have done it in a classy way that shows that while faith healers are indeed bad, not all Priests are bad, and bashing God or religion is not cool. For an example of a balanced and much better-done take on the same thing, try watching the television episode ""The Faith Healer"" from Little House on the Prairie which was produced in 1979.<br/><br/>No doubt one of the main reasons TWBB gets so much undeserved acclaim is because it bashes Christianity and has the Priest in the movie saying ""God is a superstition"". In Hollywood, it is very fashionable to bash Christianity and religion in general. Doing so is almost a guaranteed way to garner critical acclaim. However, for those who are not atheists, this is derogatory and an unethical thing to be doing in movies. Just because not everyone is religious - which is fine - it isn't an excuse to trample on the beliefs of those who are. Everyone is *supposed to* be respected, but this movie doesn't respect anyone other than the evil psychopath oil tycoon character who also happens to be an atheist.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is virtually non-existent. The entirety of the plot boils down to Daniel swindling some communities out of their land so he can dig oil wells and/or build pipelines in it, and murdering some people along the way. This too, is a stale old cliché that has been done - and done-better - thousands of times before.<br/><br/>The dialogue is banal. In one case ripping off 70's Blaxploitation flicks. TWBB has a line in it, ""I'm your brother from another mother."" In another case it rips off the Kelis song ""Milkshake"" with the line """"I drink your milkshake. I drink it up."" It sounds like I'm making that up, but I'm not --- both of those lines are in the movie, verbatim. It is kind of funny that they lift lines from Black culture, yet there are only White people in this movie. Maybe it's their small way of not being accused of being a racist movie? In any case, the banal dialogue doesn't work on any level. Another example of verbatim banal dialogue from this movie: ""You are a stupid man."" <br/><br/>TWBB is a waste of almost 3 hours. You'd do much better to watch the originator of it's title instead, Saw II. At least Saw II *knows* it's a horror movie and has some interesting dialogue and plot in it. Much moreso than TWBB does."

","""There Will Be Blood"" is impressive on some levels. Set pieces such as the oil well fire are handled with eerie, remote precision and weird alienating music that bring Kubrick to mind. In fact the chilliness and sudden, jolting brutality of the movie are very late Kubrick. Still, great an actor as Daniel Day Lewis is, his character here is revealed right away -- greedy, egotistical, unstoppable -- and never grows or deviates, so the role is not a vehicle for a great performance. Day Lewis delivers an all-stops-out, bug-eyed, mannered, finally monotonous performance. It's the centerpiece of a film that finally seems uninterested in exploring human or social issues, preferring to go grandiose on us and trumping up (it's apparently not in the book) a metaphysical duel to the death between Day Lewis' oilman and Paul Dano's preacher (another over-the-top performance). It finally rings hollow, schematic, humorless, lifeless. This is a film made with amazing skill and care and control, but like the late Kubrick films you're left wondering why. One hopes that Paul Thomas Anderson isn't turning into the kind of hermetic obsessive Kubrick became, losing touch with humanity and making ponderous films about abstractions. So unlike ""Boogie Nights""!<br/><br/>The film is dedicated to the late Robert Altman. Perhaps Anderson should have viewed Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" again. There's an exploration of American capitalist greed that makes ""There Will Be Blood"" feel...bloodless."

","""There Will Be Blood"" is nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and let me tell you, it's deserving of every one of them. The composition of directing, cinematography, musical score, and the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis make this an experience; one of the most riveting in cinematic history. You will likely be shocked, or befuddled, when it's all said and done.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is a character of complexity. His true nature is a mystery, especially early in the film, and you never quite know what goes through his mind. Daniel Day-Lewis gets this part, and his portrayal of Plainview is masterfully dark and engrossing. He becomes a figure of cruelty, and coldly dispenses of people when they no longer suit him. Yet ironically, his sanity seems to be held intact solely by the singular relationships he does have. Plainview maintains a ""business partner"" because he claims it helps legitimize him to the community. In reality, his motives are selfish. He needs an ear to bend with the hatreds that swell in him, someone to shoulder the weight of his personal demons. He is a classic people user, and when there are no more left to suck from, he devolves into a loathsome recluse. There is no need to hold an award ceremony this year, at least, not for Best Actor. Daniel Day-Lewis will win the Oscar without so much as a contest.<br/><br/>There is an unnerving atmosphere that pervades this film, and to credit the vision of Paul Thomas Anderson, it leaves you with a constant feeling that something bad is going to happen. So much of this feeling is stirred by the incredibly alarming music. It is chaotic, and at times even feels out of sync or inappropriate for the moment. This serves a purpose, however. Every musical sequence was unique, and many were employed to clue the viewer into something beneath the surface. I can't say enough how integral the score was in maintaining the unsettling mood of this picture.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful. I remember one part specifically when Daniel and H.W. were driving through town in their Model T. I love this scene, and it was so well executed I almost could believe it was actually shot in 1908. Another striking sequence that really stands out was when Daniel carried H.W. from the burning oil well. The way the camera follows him in one uninterrupted shot, the music plucking away violently. There is a sense of something amiss, and the suspense of the moment is fully realized through its impeccable design.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis gives a mastered performance (the character Daniel Plainview rivals even Amon Goeth of ""Schindler's List"" in the breadth of his villainy), and Thomas Anderson delivers what will stand as one of the great films of the 2000's."

This is the bones of a great movie - it has been well shot and has great atmosphere but it is so ponderous in its execution that it leaves one anxious and wanting to shout ""Get on with it!!"" The director has held onto scenes and shots far too long to entertain the viewer - it becomes ultimately boring. Daniel Day-Lewis overplays most of the time and underplays the rest of the time. His voice reminds me of Jack Palance -it is rather mannered and does not really convince. Only Mr Palance can do it. 2 hours and 40 minutes is more than is needed to tell this tale and the soundtrack just does not suit the movie at all for the most part.

","Ten years from now, people will be wondering what the Academy, or anyone, saw in this film. It's really that awful. But it manages to coat its awfulness in a glossy veneer of style, and to buttress its vacuous plot with big-budget production values. And it mounts a full-frontal assault on Hollywood's twin bugaboos, religion and capitalismwhich makes it oh so chic.<br/><br/>The traditional Hollywood potboiler achieves its effect by insisting on a moral universe that rewards the good and punishes the bad through all sorts of coincidences, distortions, glib inferences and clumsy symbolism. If that is true, then this movie must be seen as the absolute antithesis of the typical Hollywood potboiler. It insists on an amoral universe that exhaustively punishes the good (or morally neutral, e.g. nature) and rewards the bad through the absence of coincidence, meaning, pattern, or symbolism. In the real world, Daniel Plainview would have been shot less than 30 minutes into the film and the grateful settlers would have erected a statue to the assassin's honorand those events would have transpired not necessarily as an illustration of divine justice, but simply as an expression of social utility. ""There Will Be Blood"" is as unnatural and contrived as ""Die Hard,"" just a lot less fun.<br/><br/>While watching this ghastly spectacle, I kept thinking about other ""dark"" films, films which posit the total absence of any transcendent good or moral order. Even ""Reservoir Dogs"" contains the leavening of humor, as does ""No Country for Old Men."" These, among many others, have created the equivalent of a moral vacuum into which the void-filling substance of dark laughter has insinuated itself. Not so with "".....Blood."" There is not a single moment of humor in this film, unless you count the unintended humor of the final sequence when Satan attempts to kill his disciple with bowling balls (they might as well have been custard pies). Plainview doesn't just hate the world; unlike Anton Chiggurh, he hates himself and all his works. His is a self-devouring sickness that might be interesting as the frozen embodiment of a theological principle, but utterly fails in a dramatic context.<br/><br/>Which brings one to Daniel Day-Lewis' performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is a great and gifted actor, and with a better script he probably could have made the character genuinely terrifying. As it is, we are treated to a mustache-twirling cartoon of evil who delivers his wooden lines with unvarying literalness. This must have been a conscious choice by the directoras was the refusal to offer us any glimpse into the whys or wherefores of Plainview's sociopathy, or any semblance of character development. Plainview begins as a cipher and ends as a malignant cipher. The only sympathy he elicits is through his early, apparent concern for his sona sympathy which is completely dissipated by the unmotivated and unconvincing disavowal of that same ""son"" at the end of the film. This was the final straw for me: a director so utterly imprisoned by ego that he could throw away a casual, probably unintended residue of meaning to achieve the seamless nihilism of his overarching vision.<br/><br/>I give this film 3 stars for the excellent use of natural settings and its competent, if uninspired, cinematography. The use of non-diegetic music, both the Brahms violin concerto and Arvo Part's ""Tabula Rasa"" as well as the loud, brazen mau-mau ostinati meant to accompany Plainview's sorties through the moral wasteland (Ugh. Ugh. Me Big Malefactor) showed a complete insensitivity to the melding of musical and visual rhythms. Maybe he should have studied ""2001"" a little more.<br/><br/>Ugh, indeed....."

","So you want to go see a movie. You check the IMDb and see this film is getting an 8.9 rating (#16 on the top 250). It stars Daniel Day Lewis, he's a great actor. The TV ads look smart, and what's that ""milkshake"" line about anyway? Off you go. Three and a half hours later you return home and go on the IMDb and vote it a 10 out of 10. Why? Because you are a secret mind-controlled drone of the company that made this film and you always do what you are told. That is the only plausible explanation I can come up with for the extraordinarily high ratings There Will Be Blood is receiving. That or your moral compass only points south.<br/><br/>This film is nothing more than a magnificently crafted pile of poop and frankly, I find its undeserving numbers highly suspect. There are plenty of examples where most every critic gets it ""wrong"" on a popular film, so no need to re-trod that ground (watch The Aristocrats if you don't believe me, I dare you). But a quick perusal of the IMDb comments index for this film seems to tell a different story than a movie voted higher than #18 Raiders of the Lost Ark or #36 Apocalypse Now. Searching in chronological order, about half the comments say they hate this film. Another quarter didn't think it was as good as everyone said, and only about a quarter praise the film. With that track record, this film should score somewhere in the 5 to 7 range. We should all hope that the studios have figured out a way to pump up IMDb scores. Otherwise, we live in a world where pointless violence and hypocrisy are celebrated as the ideal.<br/><br/>No doubt, this film has its merits. Daniel Day Lewis gives an award winning performance. I love it when an actor takes chances and I think it works here, many disagree. The film making is top notch, all the acting too. Most everything from cinematography to wardrobe is as good as it gets. Were this film to have a point, it all would have worked together for a powerful addition to the American film atheneum. As it is, it does nothing more than underscore tired stereotypes and leave its audience wondering why so much effort would be put into such depraved proclamations. Perhaps worse, it glorifies the most evil of human intentions.<br/><br/>Can we agree that more is required for a great film then just good film-making? Otherwise, Gigli deserved better treatment. Here, Daniel Day Lewis plays an oil man in the morally corrupt laissez-faire American big business culture (seen it) fighting with a morally corrupt Christian minister (seen it) in a society full of have-nots (seen it) controlled by gilded evil white men (that's new) and everything, eventually, adds up to nothing but gruesome, vivid murders and pointless hatred. Roll credits.<br/><br/>I found the portrayal of the young minister to be particularly vapid. Pastor of ""The Church of the Third Revelation""  please. Even the church name is painfully hack. Look, I can handle stock stereotypes, but can anyone in the film industry portray a Christian leader as anything more than a sad, money grubbing miscreant? And how many times are we going to need to see this before it gets tired? Not that any other religion or group could have taken its place. I wonder what the reaction to this film would have been had the Snidely Whiplash minister been portrayed as a Rabbi, and all the Jews in his congregation nothing more than gullible or emotionally weak? Never mind the cartoonish unfairness of it all, don't you think it makes for uninteresting character development? Whatever.<br/><br/>All the ""smart"" people will go away from this film figuring out that the world is a hopeless dog eat dog jungle. The rest of us will go home and do all the work that holds society together and hope for some other film to take our minds off things like this. 1 out of 10 for a pointless and grotesque story."

","There Will Be Blood is excessively long, with absolutely no point, nothing but a good score by Arvo Part, and this really terrific acting job by Daniel Day-Lewis (who, by the way, is not the son of C.S. Lewis but rather of a British poet laureate). I cannot emphasize enough how disappointing this film was for me. I never read reviews until after I have seen the movie so I have no idea what the New Yorker has to say, but it was nasty, brutish, and about an hour too long. Lots of internalized rage, so if you already get that with your patients, you may want to give this a miss. I really do not see what there is to laud other than D D-L's great acting.<br/><br/>I would have gladly spent the $10 to see either of the other two again (Juno or No Country for Old Men). Can't understand why the AFI has the hugely boring movie in the large theatre. Or why the public is attending (sheeple -- they go where they are told to go, I guess) since aside from a few laughs everyone seemed fidgety and yawning. I've never seen so many people leave during a film. (Yeah, most came back after a pee or a smoke or whatever they did, but if it's a good film people don't leave.) Just my opinion."

None of the characters are likable, so I could never get interested in what happened to them.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis' character is similar to the one he played in ""Gangs of New York,"" but that movie was more interesting because he was evil in contrast to the other characters. In this film, he has more in common with his rival and the film is mostly about how they are the same.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" was a very hard movie to sit through.

Bizarre behavior not explained like the main character promises to ""cut his throat"" while asleep for making a possible offensive comment about him and his son's relationship. Paranoid characters. The whole cast comes off as self-serving and quite barbaric. Another bizarre showing of fundamentalist/pentacostal religious services. Not much spirituality and bible knowledge in context but plenty of showmanship; something Christ did NOT ever display. I do not like pentacostal/charamasatic churches because 90% is showmanship and little is REALLY of God. Also no such thing as modern day prophet(at least I never have seen or met a REAL one). Never seen a real one. Anyone can shoot their mouth off and claim they are a prophet but lets see some examples. Then we find no power of God their just human boasting. Jesus said ""You will know my disciples by their love for one another"" No disciples of Jesus in this movie I see.

","Daniel Day Lewis puts in a great performance as Proudview, an oil man. This is the story of a man consumed by greed, the need to dominate others and without any redeeming qualities. He is a fascinating character. The problem with the movie is that he is slowly unveiled to us in the first hour, but then there is another 90 minutes to the movie where additional details are revealed, but nothing more is revealed about his character. There is no plot, just the arc of his life. Unlike some other unlikable characters, e.g. Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, there is no compelling reason to keep watching.<br/><br/>I have not read Oil, the Upton Sinclair novel, but I have to believe that something is amiss when the men from Standard Oil are treated as normal but greedy men rather than the same harsh treatment of Proudview.<br/><br/>The soundtrack has got to be the worst I have ever heard. OK, I get it. Proudview is a man whose entire life is composed of sour notes, but 2.5 hours of sour notes is just unrelenting. I nominate the score as the Plan 9 from Outer Space of soundtracks.<br/><br/>Again I haven't read the novel and Hollywood has never needed to adhere to the source material anyway, but a battle a wills between the greedy oil man and the hypocritical young preacher (Sunday) would have made a more interesting story and still be true to Sinclair's darkly negative view of powerful men.<br/><br/>Finally I think there is something wrong with critical review when a great performance is sufficient to earn a movie a great review. Yes this movie takes lots of risks and fails in many of them, but just give an honest review of the movie as a nice try but a miss."

I will hear of many accusing this master character actor of overdoing it at times, serenading the camera with eyes viewers needn't peer too closely into lest our own humanity become compromised. The truth is, for every over-the-top scene which almost always remains justifiable in Day-Lewis's astonishing hands, observant viewers will be equally if not largely rewarded by the boiling subtleties which ripple throughout, just beneath this menacing surface of a man.<br/><br/>As engaging a character study the movie feels (and this it firmly remains right up until an overworked finale), There Will Be Blood shines equally as bright as a brave new step for period westerns. Not in some time has fictionalized American history been so bold with creative and thematic assertion, yet accessible enough to render this harrowing study into greed without generation, and one for the books."

It sounded more like someone attacking a rock with a pick axe rather than a movie soundtrack.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the storyline (if there was one) made absolutely no sense.

","Has Daniel Day-Lewis EVER been in a film that wasn't all about Daniel Day-Lewis and his self-indulgent, narcissistic intensity as an actor? He is consistent as ever in this one. Yes, he's intense, and yes he inhabits the role with his entire being. It's just ... from the start, there's no reason to give a damn what happens to Daniel Plainview: who cares? <br/><br/>I wanted to like this film. I seem irretrievably drawn to Day-Lewis films, yet almost always walk away feeling that for all his effort and craft he can ONLY carry acting to the level of CRAFT, and not to the level of ART. I suppose that's not a terrible thing, at least not in some films. But this film held nothing more for me than a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis' craft. And that wasn't enough to engage me in any of the characters or the story line. For all the talk of character development, I didn't see any with the possible exception of son H.W., as he developed into a young man who wised up. <br/><br/>I was interested in seeing what Paul Dano would do with this film, and I will continue to watch his career with interest. I think he did as much as could be done with this role, but the script does a weak job of character development here as well. We won't even go into the bone-headed decision to make ""identical twins"" out of Eli and Paul.<br/><br/>And let's not dwell on how years pass and yet characters never seem to actually age, certainly not HW until he magically transforms into a young man at the end; not Eli who is entirely unchanged from his introduction as Paul to his bowling alley finale; and not even Daniel Plainview, but for a gray grizzled beard in his later years. <br/><br/>I did grudgingly give the film two stars for the stunning cinematography, and also for the interesting film score. The use of sound in general held at least intellectual critical interest for me, including the score but beyond in the use of silence, and the use of intimate dialogue between father and son as we watch them engage in a distant long shot, that sort of thing. This film actually has lots of elements worthy of consideration in any film criticism.<br/><br/>But was it a stimulating cinematic experience as a whole? Apparently for some it was, but it left me cold. Left me feeling dirty and used. Wouldn't it be interesting someday to see Day-Lewis in a movie where the point was ... the movie? And not DDL's ego? But it was worth the viewing just to share the laugh out loud list of 100 things we all learned from the film."

His character is supposed to be a nihilist who hates people (SLAP) and who is tightly wound and angry to his core (SLAP), so maybe the boy is his only conduit to human expression (who cares!? - because it's done badly if that's the case).<br/><br/>Plainview is tipped off to an amazing oil field by a young man we never see again, and comes to loggerheads with a young ambitious and equally morally corrupt preacher (the brother of the young man - played by the same actor), and (SLAP) we're off to the who-will-dominate races (SLAP) ... but it doesn't pay off. There is no particular point at which the film pivots on their conflict. It was intended to, but the preacher is pathetic and the conflict contrived. PTA would have you think it works and the legion of this film's fans with their bad taste bought it, but it doesn't catch gear ... it's all pretense and phoniness. There's even a scene where Plainview SLAPS down our annoying preacher into the mud *SLAP*SLAP*SLAP* And the finale, where his grown boy (My BOOOOY!!) faces down daddy and says he wants to open his own oil business is met with a petulant - nya nya you were never my son retort ""just a bastard in a basket"", and the son leaves with a whimper not a bang. I would much prefer hearing Rip Taylor deliver that line, I'm sure it would have been better.<br/><br/>There is an interlude where a drifter pretending to be Plainview's brother comes into the story and Plainview ends up killing him, yet no one thinks to ask Plainview what happened to that brother of his. Pathetic.<br/><br/>The last scene is of the corrupt preacher now begging for a financial windfall from Plainview - but they've jumped the story ahead many years and never showed the evolution of these two enemies' relationship - like all GenX directors PTA merely sketched it - and badly - and that's supposed to be enough ... and another (SLAP) beatdown ensues - this time for keeps ... but all I could do was laugh. It was just STUPID! Unbelievably stupid, as in unbelievable.<br/><br/>What a ridiculous film."

"jackharding89-1","10","6","12","19 February 2008"," A near unblemished semi-classic tour de force driven by a leading character performance to rival the very best.
","""I'm an oil man!"" Proclaims Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a township brimful of naïve citizens of which he is astutely wrapping around his finger one by one. However (in this case) the man speaks no lie for his veins do indeed run rich with plutonium oil. A crude, black substance embedded deep in the heart of director Paul Thomas Anderson's gargantuan North American epic- There Will Be Blood. A perpetually steady, emotionally-draining tale about the evil deeds of an oil guzzling tycoon that vigorously chews on the themes of gluttony and narcissism, faith and ambition, death and abomination. Do not be mislead by its title, though. For this is not some hysterical slasher-flick (as the juveniles sat behind me seemed to think at the outset). It is a gruelling, drawn-out dissection of a loathsome yet sinisterly-comical individual consumed and maddened by his own persona. And it's absolutely formidable. But it's also a marathon, meaning that it's not for everyone. So if movies of the elongated breed just aren't your thing, then I'm afraid there will be no blood for you. Sorry. However, if you sincerely believe that you've got what it takes to go the 158 minute distance, then brace yourself for a near unblemished semi-classic tour de force driven by a leading character performance to rival the very best. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood begins, then, with a poignant fade-in of a series of desolate mounds scattered across a dauntingly atmospheric New Mexican landscape. This is the first of many deeply satisfying fades employed that are aided quite brilliantly by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood's unsettling score which helps underline the overall mood of the tale. Add to that, every nuance of every cinematic and visual component which all work so well with one another to help give this: Paul Thomas Anderson's fifth feature film, such power and impact.<br/><br/>More importantly, though, than any of the cinematic aspects citied above, is the protagonist. Well, antagonist to be precise. Daniel Day-Lewis playsno scratch thatDaniel Day Lewis is Daniel Plainview. A late 19th century Sean Connery sounding miner who while thrashing away at the crust of his motherland strikes silver and several years later, oil. But Plainview's profitable discovery comes at a price as one of his fellow miners pays for the unearthing with his life, leaving Plainview with the moral duty of raising the desist's new-born son, H.W (Dillon Freasier). And so, with the youthful, innocent H.W poised firmly under the oil sodden wing of Plainview, the two travel the continent, Dad: buying up large segments of land in which crude oil is stirring directly beneath, and son: smiling chastely for the native punters to help sweeten the deals. Thus, Plainview's success, reputation and wallet all begin to swell at a rather substantial rate and in 1911 he receives a generously eerie, yet pricey tip-off from Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) as to where there may be a sturdy supply of his beloved oil. And, like a moth to an oil fuelled flame, Plainview meanders ominously into Little Boston, California where the true colours and characteristics of the indomitable oil baron edge disturbingly into light. <br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an angry, vengeful man whose promises and loyalties to those around him are as false and as futile as his love and respect for the lord. He promises the locals of the Little Boston ranch; food, water, schools and, to the town's irregular preacher Eli Sunday (also Dano), a newly renovated church of the Third Revelation. But he cares little for the reserving of his pledges and spends little time guilt-tripping over his numerous acts of fraudulence and immorality. ""I look at people,"" he says ""and I see nothing worth liking."" ""I have a competition in me,"" he adds ""and I want no one else to succeed"". Harshly honest words, from a partially harshly honest man for Plainview is as putrid and as predatory as any character to ever grace the big screen. He putrefies slowly, though. And to be honest, the end product is more entity than it is man. Plainview is a symbol of sin. An emblem of pure self-serving evil, and from the first frame to the last, the sheer presence boasted by the oil sucking chief governs the screen in an implausible manner in which only an actor of Day-Lewis' calibre can. The critically marvelled, multi-award winning performance of the unfaltering London-born method actor is the epitome of everything grand about Paul Thomas Anderson's finest feature yet: intense, immense and utterly, utterly chilling. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, for all its blood soaked and oil sopping glory, There Will Be Blood requires a patient, focused audience who are not fazed by its unhurried temperament. Admittedly, the film does have a tendency to slowdown to a near crawling pace at times, and I can't help but feel that the colossal performance of Day-Lewis carries the narrative in certain areas. But to begrudge There Will Be Blood for those slender drawbacks would make youwella sinner!"

","The movie was bad enough, slow, plodding and populated with unpleasant characters, but it is accompanied by the worst score in history. The music never matches the action and whoever did it had a tin ear. Then a couple of classical pieces are misplaced and are completely out of context; i.e. Brahms Violin Concerto at the end. This so detracts from the rest of the film that its few virtues get buried. Sure, there is Daniel Day Lewis performance, but despite 2 hrs and 38 minutes we don't learn much about his character or why he's doing what he's doing. I had looked forward to this with anticipation but was deeply disappointed. The treatment is just terrible and watching it is a very unsatisfying experience."
"TheSmurphinator","5","4","7","17 May 2016"," Well crafted dullness
","Plot summary: Oil guy gets rich, becomes somewhat unlikable.<br/><br/>I had heard good things about this movie, so I had decent hopes going in. The movie certainly started off good - watching the rise of Daniel Plainview had me interested. Plainview starts out in a hole, then builds a rig, then buys a lot of land, gets townspeople to work for him, buys more land - you get the idea. But somewhere along the way, you realize there isn't much of a point to anything. We all know this kind of story - what's different here? Actually, not much. The plot kinda just does its y=mx+b thing. We climb the roller-coaster, just, ploddin' along, you know, but then we stop after 2.5 hours and someone just says - ""Hurray, you're at the top! Hope you had fun.""<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood was mostly watching people do stuff. Sure, that's every movie, but ever tell a story at a party, and it turns out there was no point and you feel dumb because people listened for like 4 minutes and it just kind of trailed off? I mean, it sounded interesting in your head, right? And it was! You should probably just practice your storytelling. That was this movie, except it was 2.5 hours and not 4 minutes.<br/><br/>In addition to being rather uneventful, the movie suffers from a distinct lack of character development. Plainview is the centerpiece, and the entire movie is about his quest for oil. Plainview himself starts off interesting enough, but after a while he's just the guy you end up watching because everyone else is even less interesting. In his quest for oil, he never has to make any difficult decisions. Why do I care whether he makes a deal with A or B for the pipelines or railroads? We see him set up to swindle people out of their land, and we're prepared to see greed take over, but his actions leave us ambivalent. As he keeps buying and building, he never has any hard obstacles to overcome, has essentially no meaningful interactions with other characters, and basically amounts to some guy getting progressively richer off of oil, whose morals sometimes dip their toes into what I think is supposed to be avarice. You don't feel bad for other characters he sometimes foils because they're either irritating and deserve it or too stupid for their own good. Overall, he's just some guy. A convincing, well-acted portrayal of some guy, but just some guy nonetheless.<br/><br/>Everyone else is a temporary prop intended for Plainview's marginal character development. His young son is dapper, and it's a bummer when he loses his hearing. What a jerk Plainview was to put him on a train when he got sick of him. Their pedestrian activities continue on like this, fascinating us like rain in London. Plainview meets some yokel masquerading as his long lost brother. Now, whether you bet that such a man would turn out to be a fraud or not makes no difference - he was, and when Plainview figured it out, the man ended up in a shallow grave. If I was supposed to care, I didn't because I was probably too busy not caring. The only other character of partial significance was Eli, an obnoxious preacher whose melodramatic antics would surely make anyone's skin crawl. There is a power play between Eli and Plainview, each one finding a way to grind the other under his heel from time to time. But there was no real point, and nothing ever comes of their interactions. These were collectively the only other characters, yet they had no depth and did not develop. They hardly added to the plot, and they were neither interesting nor entertaining in their own right. They weren't even in most of the scenes. Effortlessly forgettable, really.<br/><br/>The movie also didn't convey any interesting themes or messages. Are we supposed to see how money and power corrupt? On the spectrum of good and evil, Plainview is too close to boring to represent that (maybe a 4, just below normal). What about father-son themes? Again, no, because their interactions are limited and shallow; if Plainview's angry words to his son at the end were supposed to convince us of something, they were a day late and a dollar short. What about the relationships or similarities between business and religion? Perhaps we are supposed to see how both are evil, or evil when taken to extremes? But Plainview and Eli are just unlikable, and the link to business or religion just isn't important. We briefly see how dumb religion makes people, screaming and superstitious, but that clearly wasn't the message. We don't angry at god, or the church, or religion, or any of the values or ideas they represent such as faith, forgiveness, worldly corruption, misguided morality, intrinsic falsehood, or so on. And so it is with Plainview.<br/><br/>I will say that despite being too long, the movie is well put together (like those Led Zeppelin tracks everyone enjoys in the background at Guitar Center but doesn't actually elect to listen to for the full 8 minutes on their own time). The actors were good, the sets were convincingly barren, and they got costume people who really knew how to make those perpetually-dirty- how-is-anything-ever-clean-in-this-poverty-stricken-former-era type clothes. The orchestra always showed up 30 seconds to 1 minute ahead of time saying, ""It's time to be antsy. We're going to play antsy music now to help you feel antsy. We're going to compensate for the overwhelming dullness of the desert. Ready? Drone!""<br/><br/>Overall, this movie doesn't have any real redeeming factors. I mean, watching people do stuff is not painful, really, so it's not bad per-se, either. I wasn't entertained, but I wasn't particularly put off. Even though the acting was good, the actors had little to work with. There Will Be Blood was a profoundly mediocre cinematic experience."
"bobhartshorn","4","4","7","4 August 2010"," Punch-Drunk-Blood!
","Two-thirds of the way through 'There Will Be Blood', it suddenly dawned on me that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson must be a film student from ""The longer the movie, the more seriously i'll be taken!"" school of thinking. 'Important' film critics seem to lap up lengthy, historical epics as if they're objects that contain the meaning of life within, and judging by their hysterically over-positive reaction, they must have thought all of their Christmas' had come at once when this self-important ogre first came tumbling over the horizon.<br/><br/>Despite pretensions alluring to an allegory of the Iraqi war, there isn't any story so to speak of other than a series of Mexican standoffs between a piece of pork (Day Lewis' thoroughly unpleasant oil-baron-to-be, Daniel Plainview) and a rash of bacon (Dano's equally unpleasant, charlatan preacher, Eli Sunday) who indulge in a self-serving handbags at dawn spat over some black liquid spillage in New Mexico circa 1898. <br/><br/>These hammy confrontations are very entertaining and the two actors cheerfully chew the scenery for all their worth - but by god! - without them it would be interminable, as the sliver thin plot (adapted from a book no one's ever heard of, let alone read) is dragged out over TWO-AND-THREE-QUARTER-HOURS!!!<br/><br/>In between Lewis & Dano's colourful interludes are vast, vacuous chasms containing some beige mountains, a crushingly obtrusive score by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood and a disgracefully wasted Cirian Hinds, who has almost literally nothing to say or do for the whole movie. He's not alone however, as this elephantine husk has plenty more squandered opportunities waiting up it's flabby sleeve. <br/><br/>A number of scenes whet your appetite for some great drama, but ultimately deflate you by fizzling out into nothing. Too often Anderson places the despicable Plainview into circumstances where his self-obsession threatens emotional fireworks & nitty-gritty theatrics, and too often they're just left dangling in thin-air and end up head butting a dramatic cul-de-sac brick wall instead. <br/><br/>The segment involving the sudden appearance of Plainview's (alleged) younger brother, Henry (Kevin J O'connor), could have been an exception to this rule as it contains a beginning, middle and (very sticky) end. But Anderson executes it with such an arrogant disregard for timing and pace, that it ends up getting crushed pancake-flat beneath a cliff-face of tedium.<br/><br/>Even the final scene takes the wind out of the sails of expectation on account of it just being plain daft. Time Out magazine commented that "" the climax contains the lunacy of 'Dr Strangelove' and 'A Clockwork Orange'"" which it does and, taken on it's own terms, it is (in a Monty Python kinda-way) actually quite funny. Yet, it's absurdly at odds with everything preceding it, leaving us by contrast with a silly, puny looking pay-off.<br/><br/>Stylistically speaking, TWBB is at least free of the embarrassing Scorsese aping traits found in 'Boogie Nights' & 'Magnolia', and Roger Elswitt's sobering lens work is very fine indeed. On the other hand though, those two movies did at least contain a sense of life and (whisper it) fun, in their bones. So even though they unravelled into a big pile of nothing at the halfway mark, they did (if only for a short time) make a game attempt at proper audience engagement. TWBB just splutters & spurts on it's back for a third of the duration and spends the rest of it's time sound asleep. More likely than not, so will you. <br/><br/>Lurking somewhere within this Death Star sized suet-pudding, is a lean, decent little movie trying to fight it's way out - a taut chamber piece that could have set the world on fire. But it wasn't to be. PTA obviously believed there should be excessive width to 'enhance' the quality and ends up gorging his baby into obesity, boring us sh*tless as a result. Much much less, could have been so much more."
"dualistically","10","4","7","3 December 2009"," One couldn't make a film on carpentry without churning woods.
","On verge of souding hyperbolic, I regard ""There will be blood"" as unheralded modern masterpiece in tradition of John Huston and John Ford. Done in vein of a character study in proportions of Welles ""Citizen Kane"". DDL's performance merits engagement on its own, an aggressively driven protagonist that almost embodies the ambitions of the film. Intense to a great degree, and yet with nuance no less important. The film is centered on dawn of 20th century, with themes resonating to present-day. Something that works on different levels. Starting with personal & cultural decadency, the facade, and overblown uprightness of the nation through two important factions of it. A bold framework, and a denouement that answers and questions in equal measures. Yet it is vague and disguised. Akin to ""Apocalypse now"" in that respect. <br/><br/>""There will be blood"" paints a polemical subtext on Oil and Religion, Capitalism and Evangelism - the fraudulence of it all. Or maybe the moral shortcomings of the two main protagonist. As failed human beings. With that, the ability to ""attack but not necessarily antagonize"" is achieved. And this is less problematic. The narrative is NOT a mere carrier for such reflections. I ascribe the underlying piece-de- resistance of what is in show. By canons of film criticism, it is essential the social and political persuasions of the creation had to be dissected. The very absence of such a statement is in itself a political viewpoint. The filmmaker cannot hide. One couldn't make a film on carpentry without churning woods. <br/><br/>It's a showdown of two pivotal characters, Oil prospector in Daniel Plainview, and a young priest, Eli, as two-fold manifestation of essentially the same. Daniel Plainview is flamed by burning desire to ""hunt"" for gold. As a characteristic baron/salesman, connives people for cheap off their land to drill oil. Eli is of ignoble ilk, connives people with false prophecies and superstition. they are both failed human beings. A film theorist once said films are moving pictures with accompanying sound. The story and themes are excuses to entice & indulge the audience. There will be blood provides enough to relish the experience.<br/><br/>The Oil drilling has never been captured cinematically and as thrillingly as in show here. This being the primal period of drilling, the film stays true to some of the medieval methods, with stew-pans and sauce-pots. An unreliable Pumpjack made with manual shafts. There will be casualties (and therefore, of 'blood'), but the drive of the protagonist remains unmatched for treasure. In that, it is no different to ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"" and many great Hollywood epics from 30- 40s. There is one major set-piece where the fire gulfs from ground, almost too hellish and devilish of a grasp to let loose. Visual metaphors are aplenty. Yet, such cinematic devices and symbolism are not aberrations to the narrative. <br/><br/>A final word on DDL's performance to end this writeup. His rendition is probably the best of modern era. When we see aging Plainview and ensuing character dynamics, we are convinced he had gone through all the dangers and asperities of hands-on Oil drilling and continual failure in human relation/connection. His rough edged surface is backed by subliminal subtleties. His reaction, introspection, and secretive quirks in private, especially to his son & faux-brother, are utter genius. This film makes use of father-son thematics like other PTA films."

","I took this movie at a video store without knowing anything about it. The reason I took it was that D. D. Lewis is one of our most favorite actors. And a very good actor he is indeed, and this movie definitely shows it. However, I will definitely NOT recommend this movie to my friends, unless they have an extra two and a half hours in which they want to get utterly bored, disappointed and depressed. Why bother seeing a movie in which whenever something happens it is disturbing? One in which every scene takes forever with no particular reason. I have seen other movies about oil magnates and their greed. Anyone remembers 'The Giant'? That's the movie with Rock Hudson, Liz Taylor and James Dean, who died during its shooting. That movie describes greed and ruthlessness, but without being boring. I have learned on this board that HW was somebody else's child; that's not clear at all in the movie. The director takes his time in showing Daniel shoveling for a piece of gold in a very long scene, but we are supposed to 'understand' that the child shown in his arms wasn't his? The movie develops a character all right; my problem was that this character does not interest me at all. His development from a nice guy looking nicely after somebody else's child (as it turned out) as his own, worrying about Eli's treatment of Mary, and being overall a fairly reasonable oil digger, into a greedy heartless monster is unclear, and many other things are unclear. No wonder it took Andersen two years to raise the funding. A great movie? Perhaps. A real masterpiece? Maybe. But definitely not for me."
"hjemmefra","10","4","7","22 November 2008"," An examination of alienation
","Contains spoilers. If there's one thing that's absolutely certain about Daniel Plainview, it is this; There Will Be Blood. This movie is a study of the singular man. A man probably emotionally crippled by his past, causing a paranoid fear of intimacy. Believing himself utterly isolated in a meaningless universe, without emotional connection or outlet. On the run from his past driven by spite, he makes for an excellent prospector. Toiling alone in the wilderness. Mining for silver but striking oil amalgamates spite and intellect into pure ambition. The movies eerie, unsettling score charging every scene is, I think, a device to show Plainview's emotional state, reminding us that this is a character study,foreshadowing his ominous fate. His newfound riches lets him blossom into a power-player, a shrewd manipulating businessman.-And a sadist. And ultimately a sociopath while he medicates his emotional isolation with copious amounts of alcohol,despising all weakness in others as he despises his own self-pity. Plainview has a special hatred for religion which is possibly an extension of his issue with intimacy, or probably connected to the past he fled. Despite all his faults he can also seem a man of principles, as he takes care of the orphaned boy and admonishes Mr. Sunday for beating his daughter. But the admonishion carries with it a feeling of power-play against Mr. Sunday and his religious practices.And he of course ends up exploiting and disowning the boy. Several years later when all his ambition is realized we see a shell of a man, finally alone, in his ornate cage of a mansion with nothing left but his bitterness. But still alive. Then comes the priest and Plainview turns the tables on him, returning the favor of betraying his own convictions for greed. He kills the priest and wins his final battle. Vanquishes religion with a few strokes of the bowlingpin-wand.And conquers the universe. ""I'm Finished."" He can die."

I want to remember this movie also because of such a solid performance from almost everyone. Daniel Day-Lewis with his long swallowed English accent and impeccable looking like a fortune hunter in early 20th century and Paul Dano with his malicious tone and power monger preaching style for ""the church of 3rd revelation"" would be remembered for days to come. The story line is just rock solid for a period film based on 100 years back. This has got several pickup lines althrough also but then you need to watch it out yourself. First 10 minutes of this movie has hardly any words and that just makes the base of the film so firmly that once you get into it you will love to see what is happening next.

","Seeing this movie last night, I realized even from the beginning of the film, from the first scenes that this film was made with a craftsmanship that you see once in a couple of years or even decades.The first thing that hits you is the haunting score brilliantly composed by Johnny Greenwood.The next thing you notice is the cinematography: the film is beautifully shot, as you can see it in every scene.It really manages to capture the essence of the story making great use of the shadows for the more dark scenes but also of the beautiful landscapes.The art decoration is also amazing as you can see the attention given to details in recreating that period.The screenplay is just perfect as it doesn't pop out, it isn't the central piece of the film(like in Juno for example) but more it is like a natural part that just fits perfectly into the whole ""mecanism"".The acting is top notch as the cast mirrors the dark mood of the film.But eventually this film isn't an epic because of its stunning cinematography, perfectly written screenplay, haunting score, or incredible acting.It all comes down to Paul Thomas Anderson's vision of Oil! by Upton Sinclair and to the central piece of his vision: Daniel Day-Lewis's acting.Never have I seen a man, an actor so completely and utterly transformed and so into the story, maybe only a mad man or a possessed person.Even though it may probably sound like a cliché: He is Daniel Plainview.How does he do it?? I keep asking myself, but it in the end lets just leave it as a mystery as he says and just pray to God he's gonna' keep making this kind of roles for as long as he will be able to. Yet, all of this could have not been able without Paul Thomas Anderson's directing who takes each part of the film and puts them together in a perfectly balanced film instead of giving too much attention to only one part.This is way this film is an epic;it's a story about power, greed, anger, hate, maliciousness, and religion.It is beautifully shot, with a powerful screenplay, top notch acting and masterfully directed.And this is way it resembles so much to Citizen Kane and I would go so far as to say that it's the only movie worthy of the comparison and the only one that can match the greatness of Citizen Kane."

There are a lot of important aspects of the story, of every scene that viewers should keep in mind. This is very much a character-story. Daniel Day Lewis plays his character, Daniel Plainview, and completely transforms himself into character. His acting, every single scene, it's as if Lewis had to completely get into this mind and soul. It is seriously a performance of the decade. Daniel day Lewis proves he is the actor to beat. Paul Dano, who plays Eli Sunday(and Paul) also gives a very different performance. Some say he overreacted, but his character is that way too. His performance totally captivates the character, and the way his character lives. The script is seriously amazing!!! This film is a lot about religion, faith, greed, family, etc. It has almost everything that a film should have. It has moral lessons and themes, and very haunting scenes.<br/><br/>From the technical part, this film succeeds. The set designs and the cinematography are simply first-rate. The musical score is simply WOW! It really defines a genre of music scores of the last decade, and it is so haunting! The direction that Anderson took is amazing. He had to really create passion and force to every single scene. Every single scene is driven powerfully, and you are never left wondering why it was done that way, but to just capture more to the audience.<br/><br/>This film is perfect! There is no other word. It is in many ways a horror film, it is in many ways a life-lesson, and also a tragedy. It has one of the most intense and powerful endings in cinema history(if not the best!) It truly is the best film of the decade, and one of the best films ever made! A force to be reckoned with!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","4","7","30 May 2008"," Violence begets violence
","In watching There Will Be Blood, I was a little worried to consider the old saying, like begets like, because it makes me realize that violence has always been too much of a prevalent part of American history. I am sad to realize that we might be one of the most violent countries in the world, in a way, at least because American history is peppered with intensely violent episodes, starting with the very first settlers who arrived here in the 18th century. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood takes place in turn of the 20th century America in the classic American frontier. Expansion is taking place everywhere, and we meet an ambitious prospector curiously named Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis is clearly one of the most talented actors working today, and is a giant among even the greats of film history. There is a lot of talk about how he created the unique voice for his character, and it has an introduction that Orson Welles would have appreciated, in that there is not a word spoken in the movie until 15 minutes into it. <br/><br/>It is curious the way music is used in the movie, as we get some suspense music at many points of the movie, perfectly relating the sense of unease and uncertainty that must have permeated through those times. <br/><br/>We never learn anything much about Plainview. We don't know where he comes from, only that he has no friends and no family except a man who shows up midway through the movie claiming to be his long lost brother and an adopted son, who Plainview seems to take under his wing out of an inability to leave him for dead after his father was killed in a mining accident, but later it becomes clear that the boy can be put to good use for business purposes. When he grows up and wants to go into business for himself, Plainview's view of their relationship becomes clear. This is the ruthless business that was taking place in the early American oil industry. <br/><br/>Plainview, a wily businessman if ever there was one, soon becomes immensely wealthy through his drilling ventures, so much so that he is able to effectively compete with the oil giant Standard Oil, throwing million dollar offers back in their face at a time when a million dollars was a truly astronomical amount of money. <br/><br/>Standard Oil has been casing an area around the Sunday family ranch, until one of the Sunday sons, Paul (Paul Dano) introduces himself to Plainview and offers to tell him of a place where there is surely a huge oil deposit for payment of a few hundred dollars. Plainview is suspicious but pays him with a vicious threat if the tip turns out to be false. Upon arriving, he basically cons the Sunday father into giving him drilling rights for next to nothing, making a permanent enemy out of the other Sunday son, Paul's twin brother Eli, an evangelical nutcase. <br/><br/>Paul Dano has made a jump that I didn't predict in his acting career. He was so good in Little Miss Sunshine that I didn't see him making such a big jump into such a completely different role, and even though his character was a little too over-the-top for me once or twice, it's clear that his acting career is progressing much faster than I would have anticipated. <br/><br/>There is also, by the way, an interesting dichotomy in Eli's character. His only motivation throughout the movie is the propagation of his church and religion, which drives him to constantly try to wrest money from Plainview from his drilling profits, which reminds me of the constant relationship between organized religions and the never ending requests for donations from church members. According to the movie, religion is as much a business as oil drilling. We even see a variety of early ""photo-ops,"" one of which Plainview publicly throws back in Eli's face. He has nothing but contempt for religion, as he does for most people.<br/><br/>The movie is loosely based on Upton Sinlair's novel Oil!, which I understand tells a remarkably different story, but nonetheless this is a fascinating story about the formation of the American oil industry. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that is alone worth watching the movie for, and while the film is not without it's imperfections, the effectiveness with which it recreates the American past is nothing less than stunning. I can't wait for a film adaptation of Sinclair's The Jungle!"
"fwomp","9","4","7","25 May 2008"," It's All Daniel Day-Lewis ...And Rightfully So
","Similar to the film CASTAWAY in which Tom Hanks carries the entire production, THERE WILL BE BLOOD has that same air due to the phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis ...with one big exception. Hanks was alone, so there really was no other supporting cast to compare him against while on his little island (unless you count the volleyball, 'Wilson'). Daniel Day-Lewis was surrounded by a fine cast, but he outshone everyone of them by leagues.<br/><br/>Not surprising, Day-Lewis won every acting award in every awards ceremony in 2007 (from the Oscars on down).<br/><br/>More of a story about greed, There Will Be Blood is also a battle of wills: one with god-fearing faith and the other without. The faithful is represented by a fire-breathing preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). Apparently an identical twin, Eli's brother Paul finds the successful oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and offers up his family's ranch in California as a place where ""oil runs on the surface of the ground."" Daniel and his 'son' head onto the ranch and discover that there is, indeed, a lot of oil to be had. Making an initial promise to Eli that they'll ""build a new church"" for the local congregation, Daniel sets to work buying up all the surrounding property and dropping his first rig into the ground. Problems quickly arise with Eli, however, who has his own form of greed: the greed of religion. Wanting his money to build his church, Eli inserts himself into Daniel's business and the two quickly bump heads. Bad things begin happening around the new oil derrick: a well-man dies, an explosion and fire, and the sudden head injury of Daniel's son, H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier).<br/><br/>The greed of Daniel Plainview knows no bounds, and the internal corruption that it causes is eked out in terrible portions. When Daniel put his son on a train and abandons him, we see that there's much more beneath the surface of this fractured man. Morality isn't something he's familiar with. Eli quickly zeroes in on this and all but forces Daniel to be baptized and saved in order to continue his successful drilling of the area. This is something that will come back and haunt both Eli and Daniel at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Again, it is the awe-invoking performance by Day-Lewis that carries the film throughout its 158 minute length. The other actors do fine jobs, no doubt about it, but they pale in comparison to Day-Lewis' John Huston inspired performance (his voice was impeccable).<br/><br/>This is a pretty dark film with not-just-a-few allusions that lean toward biblical text (many of the character names are taken straight from the bible, including Abel, Mary, Daniel, and Eli). The allusions go deeper than simple names, however, and watching There Will Be Blood one can't help but see them. The great part about this is that the ending doesn't wind up where you think it should. Forget redemption. You'll know how harsh Daniel Plainview's life has become when you hear him say, ""I'm finished."" {shiver!}"

","There are a certain group of films, films so elite in the quality of their design, production, and originality, that they are remembered in culture as true classic works of art, the masterpieces that will never be forgotten. The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner, Fargo, and now, i believe, There Will Be Blood. It is a flawless movie that is expertly crafted and masterfully carried out. The way that the movie is set up in terms of it's music, cinematography, themes, and characters is the definition of memorable. There Will Be Blood sets up a very dark theme with these things, making you think that something terrible will happen. The one, the only problem with this movie is that not enough terrible things happen. There is not enough blood, and so the dark atmosphere set up by the film is not totally justified. But when you are caught up in the mesmerizing characters and performances and lines, you just won't care. A lot of people think this movie is boring, but i'm a 15 year old, who does love all sorts of summer popcorn movies, and There Will Be Blood didn't bore me at all. Just watching the film will give you a little tinge of joy, especially when Daniel Plainveiw is doing his thing. This movie, trust me, is the rightful winner of the 2007 Best Pictur award. It is also right now #58 on the IMDb Top 250. It should be in the teens. See There Will Be Blood, and you will see how great movies can be."
"TxMike","Null","4","7","17 May 2008"," Epic movie, the oil boom, and Day-Lewis shows why he may the best ever.
","The story begins in the late 1800s and continues into the 20th century. It starts out about mining for gold, but quickly shifts to the oil boom.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, prospecting alone, finding small amounts of gold, but his big break, serendipitous for sure, comes when a heavy metal cylinder of ore falls to the bottom of his vertical mine shaft and breaks open the ground to expose oozing oil. Plainview is smart and ruthless and quickly changes his focus to the ""black gold"", oil, which he knows will make him richer quicker.<br/><br/>As his drilling technique and wells start to pay out, unfortunate accidents result in deaths. One of them orphans a young boy, which Plainview begins to call his son and takes along with him. At first we think he is just kind-hearted but we eventually find out is was just part of his approach to get the cooperation of others and to help him buy up cheap land that appears to have oil reserves under it.<br/><br/>The second major character is Paul Dano as Paul Sunday who approaches Plainview with information, for a price, that will yield much oil. It turns out that ""Paul"" is really Eli Sunday, local preacher, who wants the money for his church. (It isn't clear if Paul and Eli are identical twins, or Paul is an alter-ego of Eli, but it doesn't matter for the story.) So the long movie, almost 3 hours, traces the life of these two strong-willed men, who have a number of very dramatic encounters.<br/><br/>Plainview is ruthless, he does whatever it takes to get at the oil he wants. He also has an anti-social, confrontational streak that shows itself often. Yet when he wants something, land and oil, he can be most charming. Day-Lewis was awarded ""Best Actor"" for this role and it was well-deserved. He is the main reason to see this movie."
"scschell","9","4","7","15 May 2008"," Oh Yes, There Will Be Blood
","Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Cinematography, ""There Will Be Blood"" is based upon the 1927 novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair and takes place in California during the early 20th century with an oil prospector making his fortune. Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the aforementioned oilman, is a shrewd businessman and sees death early on as a part of life in the industry but it is only after he is challenged by a deceptive evangelist does death go from inadvertent to unmistakably discriminate.<br/><br/>In a cacophonous mix of cutthroat business and zealous religion, a war is instigated when a young man named Paul Sunday (Dano) comes to Daniel and offers to point him in the direction of a surefire fortune in exchange for a handsome sum. Paul's hometown village of ""Little Boston"" is a figurative gold mine, the family farm and the hundreds of miles surrounding it an untapped wealth of crude oil. Under the guise of pheasant hunting enthusiasts, Daniel and his son H.W. (Freasier) start investigating the property and their suspicions are quickly confirmed. Within no time, a deal is on the table but Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a local preacher, impedes the contract by not only demanding a generous portion of the proceeds but also the chance to expand his modest congregation. Hiding behind the façade of Christianity, he is motivated by greed, only to be unexpectedly matched by the cruelty and cunning of Daniel.<br/><br/>The film is more than deserved of both of its Oscars, namely Day-Lewis's riveting performance as Daniel Plainview, a man who is torn between the love for his son and his love for self-affluence (or so one thinks). The 52-year old Oscar winner's performance is matched by that of his 24-year old co-star Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. Though he was cast as both of the Sunday brothers, it is as the sanctimonious Eli that Dano makes a pointed connection with the audience. He is the character whom viewers love to hate, using religion to veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.<br/><br/>Stunning cinematography comes courtesy of Robert Elswit, a man who served as director of photography for P.T. Anderson's much-discussed '99 film ""Magnolia"". Filmed in greater part in Marfa, Texas (neighboring with the cast and crew of ""No Country For Old Men""), Elswit recreates and highlights the best of old California's sweeping vistas, its rustic mountain ranges, rolling hills and dry desert-like tundra the picture-perfect backdrop.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson has a short but unique body of work and this film has created the official apex of his career. It is also a sign that there will be many more interesting projects to come from this 38-year old writer/director/producer. Dusting off the ashes ten years after the outrageous cult favorite ""Boogie Nights"", ""There Will Be Blood"" is a definitive sign that this director has matured.<br/><br/>Out of a total of 10 stars, I give it a 9. I can only hope it will parallel to Joel and Ethan Cohen's magnum opus ""No Country For Old Men""."

","I've never seen anything quite like this! Daniel Day Lewis did a great job with this; he really made you hate the character. Paul Dano was great at bringing no redeeming qualities to Eli Sunday. I also liked the final scene where the famous ""I Drink Your Milkshake"" line comes in.<br/><br/>But all in all, the most mind-boggling thing about ""There Will Be Blood"" is the ending where Daniel Plainview says ""I'm finished.""

"kaaber-2","9","4","7","1 May 2008"," There won't be much talking, though ... (SPOILERS)
","P.T. Anderson's film is the saga of the making and destruction of the enterprising Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), with crucial bits left out for us to guess. Starting out as a lone prospector, he expands his small fortune by drilling oil, and, for some reason, he adopts the infant son of a fellow oil-driller (a partner it seems) who is killed on the job. <br/><br/>Rather than suspect (as one of the other posters here does) that Plainview takes on the kid to trick prospective clients with a pretty face, I believe that his love for the boy is quite genuine, the sole redeeming feature  apart from his obvious head for business  in the man. His pride, however, grows into downright hatred for other people. We are never told directly why or how, since dialog is pretty scarce and what there is, is hardly to be taken on face value. I think Plainview just plainly hates and fears to be made a fool of and, paranoid as he is, he tends to think that happens more frequently than is actually the case. <br/><br/>As I see it, Plainview's love for his adopted son, H.W.  brilliantly played by young Taylor (I can't tell from the IMDb cast list which Taylor plays the boy aged ten, but he is certainly up there with Jack Rovello  young Ed Harris in ""The Hours""  and the boy in ""The Bicycle Thief"", which is to say, top notch child performance)  remains constant throughout. He is accused by the phony evangelist Eli of abandoning his son, but as we are given no specific reason, I prefer to think that he sends the boy off to a home for deaf children and also to keep him out of harm's way after his accident at the oil well. <br/><br/>We gradually witness Plainview's mental downfall, first when he threatens to cut the throat of a business man who peacefully proposes to buy his oilfields, later when he actually kills Henry  the man who made him believe he was his half-brother - and finally in the humiliation and killing of Eli. Although Eli does not inspire much sympathy, he is killed when he is at his most pitiable in what is indeed a gruesome scene. The murder, however, occurs after Plainview's break with his son, when he is emotionally exposed  this being offered as an explanation of Plainview's enigmatic mind, rather than a defense.<br/><br/>TWBB is a wonderful slow-moving film with a sort of 70s feel to it (I was time and again reminded of Jan Troell's ""Utvandrarne"" from 1971)."
"kellyadmirer","8","4","7","22 April 2008"," A Masterful Performance that answers a Question that is never asked
","I think that Daniel Day-Lewis is the best actor right now. Period. Every time I see him on screen, he captures misanthropy in a way that no other Hollywood pretty boy or girl can even approach. He is a throwback to a time when even famous actors actually struggled on the way up and had some personal understanding of hate, malice, struggle, failure and redemption. Not the ""I didn't get paid enough for my last film"" kind of hatred, or ""I didn't get in the tabloids enough last week,"" or ""My girlfriend left me and now I have to find another one."" No, the ""I have to literally kick my competitor in the head in order to feed my family"" kind.<br/><br/>A performance can make a movie. It sure does make this one. But what is the film about? An oilman at the turn of the century? Yes. Greed and betrayal and murder and hatred? Yes. A parable on what it took for hard men to succeed in hard times? Most definitely yes.<br/><br/>But the question that is answered has nothing to do with any of the above. Those are incidentals to the real answer that the film provides. The question to be answered only comes in the last five minutes of the film. Everything before that is an explanation of why the film ended as it did.<br/><br/>Now, you may not think that the question posed at the end of the film - why did the aging oilman do what he did? - is worth making a film about. I think it is worth answering, because of the insight it gives into a time and place and human nature. But the film definitely answers that question. Brilliantly. So, if you want the answer to that question, this film gives it to you. But telling you what the question is would spoil the film for you, because of the sheer randomness with which the film seems to end.<br/><br/>As for the journey the film takes, well, it is a look at a total misanthrope who explains quite succinctly his philosophy of life to his ""brother"" - namely, ""I hate everybody and want to make enough money to not have to deal with anybody. It is not enough that I succeed - everyone else must fail."" Now if you think that is an uncommon feeling, well, maybe you're right, but I sure think I've met people like that along the way. And this film portrays pure misanthropy in what I think is a brilliant way. A long, roundabout, circuitous, mysterious way, but still brilliant.<br/><br/>I recommend this film if you are in the mood for a very dark but profound experience into the human psyche. Or if you just agree with me that Daniel Day-Lewis is awesome."

"MartinHafer","7","7","15","18 November 2011"," The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is superb.
","Before I began watching this film, I read through the IMDb trivia for ""There Will Be Blood"". It mentioned that Daniel Day-Lewis got inspiration for his role by listening to recordings of John Huston's voice. Well, it's pretty amazing, as his voice DID sound just like him--and it's a bit weird. His acting throughout the film is exceptional--and I can see why he earned an Oscar for this performance.<br/><br/>Despite this and despite this being a quality film, it's also an incredibly oppressive and dark film---and I am sure it will NOT appeal to everyone. The plot is just unrelentingly nasty and the final portion where the film appears to have a strongly anti-religious bent will alienate people. However, at the same time, it impressed many--and is currently a very highly rated film on IMDb.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis plays a misanthropic jerk--one of the cruelest and nastiest in film history. He makes Ebenezer Scrooge look like a pussycat--and late in the film it becomes apparent that he not only hates everyone and is evil but he's also a sociopathic killer. This ending appears to come from out of no where...and once again is bound to alienate more than a few people.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a masterful performance by Day-Lewis and the film has many fine moments. I was also impressed that the latter portions of the film actually used real deaf folks using real sign language (this is not always the case in films)--and they were quite easy to understand if you know the language. Oddly, however, when I watched this movie on cable, it was NOT closed captioned!! I assume the DVD did have captions. Turnoffs would include pretty much the entire last 10 minutes of the movie. It just seemed too foul--too dark. And, I felt a bit cheated, as I'd spent so much time on the film and had enjoyed it up until then."

Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.<br/><br/>There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","An enigmatic, savvy silver and gold prospector in California in the late-1890s eventually makes enough money to hire a crew and drill for oil; several years later, he gets a curious tip about a possible boom-town up north where the oil is right up on the earth's surface. He views the poor, humble residents there with a jaundiced eye--perhaps they're ripe for the picking--but quickly finds himself battling a religious zealot, the forces of fate, not to mention the greedy, encroaching railroad executives who want to muscle in on his progress. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who also adapted the screenplay from Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"", opens his picture with a brilliant fifteen-minute prologue with no dialogue (the gripping, extraordinarily physical visuals carry it). Once the characters begin to take shape--particularly Daniel Day-Lewis' distrusting, cynical Daniel Plainview--the dramatic narrative becomes orchestrated in an even more grandiose fashion. Many splendid sequences come of this, yet one gets the feeling that Anderson is trying too hard to bowl his audience over with sneaky plot mechanics (Jonny Greenwood's insidious score always telegraphing us to the upcoming horrors). The ingredients become overcooked, and with such a lengthy running-time it isn't long before the film's early promise leaks out. Day-Lewis, perhaps channeling the ghost of John Huston, won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar for his crafty performance, though it isn't a multi-layered one; the script steadfastly refuses to reveal its characters in any shades other than black and white. Anderson may have hoped to create a swirling sort of mysterious typhoon here, but the artiness of this concept results in impatience over genius. ** from ****"

An underused Ciaran Hinds is in a sidekick role, beautifully played.<br/><br/>The less than best:<br/><br/>The oddly lifeless script and the persona of John Huston channelled by Daniel D-L in the part of Daniel Plainview. Paul Dano, playing the parts of two brothers, overacted to the point of irritation at times.<br/><br/>There are no women in any kind of part in this movie and this results in a regrettable off balance. Surely the men had needs?<br/><br/>There is virtually no plot but the drama is not character driven either. Daniel is narcissistic and avaricious from the outset and remaines unchanged at the end when he sets up his nemesis, Eli, to deny the existence of God. Earlier Daniel had been set up to get baptized and admit his wrongdoings towards his son. Payback. Shrug.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>There are touching scenes between father and son which are negated subsequently. At the end I had to admit to a feeling of total disengagement from the movie I had just seen. <br/><br/>It is hard to care for such a completely narcissistic and greedy character as Daniel Plainview.

"jamesdamnbrown","Null","31","93","7 November 2007"," great but not awesome
","It seems one should state where they stand on previous Paul Thomas Anderson films, so let me preface this by saying I enjoyed ""Boogie Nights,"" walked out of ""Magnolia"" after about thirty minutes, and thought ""Punch Drunk Love"" was stylistically his most consistent, least flawed movie. This film is very loosely based on Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" I like the broad liberal social criticism of Sinclair's writing and was hoping for a more faithful adaptation, but those expecting to find that political dimension in ""There Will Be Blood"" will be disappointed. The film strips the story down to a rather narrow character study of a greedy power-mad oil man named Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who seems to be channeling John Huston's performance as Noah Cross in ""Chinatown."" Day-Lewis is, as always, flawless and a joy to watch. The last part of the movie, with Plainview living rich, mad and alone in his mansion, invites a comparison to ""Citizen Kane,"" but unlike Kane, Plainview is a much more static, one dimensional character who hasn't changed much over the course of the film, except to get even meaner and more misanthropic. His foil throughout the film is Eli Sunday, a young evangelist played by Paul Dano, who struck me as not having quite enough gravitas for the role, but then again the relationship between Plainview and Sunday is increasingly played for laughs as the movie draws to an end, spinning toward a final scene that ends the film on a note of farcical Grand Guignol that represents an abrupt shift of tone from the austere beginning and middle of the film and threatens to thematically undermine what has preceded it, leaving the viewer to wonder about the ultimate meaning of the film's portrayal of Plainview. The picture is beautifully shot with gorgeous cinematography, and the musical score is effective although it's mixed painfully too loud into the soundtrack. A masterfully executed film, but one that in the end simply revels in its depiction of an entertaining psychopath without taking advantage of the broader social and political context inherent in the source material of the story, which could have elevated it to the status of a more meaningful work of art."

","I completely agree w/ this comment. I couldn't say it any better myself. The movie is over-hyped, boring, non-cohesive, plot less, and way way way too long.<br/><br/>""Are you kidding me? This is a classic masterpiece? My word, I don't know where to begin...I am still in a daze as to what exactly I watched last night.<br/><br/>It was so ridiculously boring, I amazed myself that I actually stuck with it and sat through the whole 2 hr 40 mins. Frankly, I don't think that I have ever been as remotely near as bored watching a movie to the extent I was with this. The first dialogue-less 30 mins or so were excruciating enough - I kept convincing myself throughout that things were going to get better and that the good IMDb reviewer folk who had so ranted about how good this movie was were not totally off their rockers. Sadly, it never did. The ""story"" (I use that word loosely) was a mish-mash of events that do not provoke any feeling or care about what the film is trying to portray (which I am still trying to figure out).<br/><br/>The score is an absolute butchery on the ears - way too loud, incessant violin screeching with random percussion pieces thrown in now and then for absolutely no purpose at all. All it succeeded in doing was add to the ""why are we here?"" atmosphere the whole theatre had. Daniel Day Lewis we all know is a very talented actor, but his over acting in some scenes and the absolute non-connection felt for his character didn't add up to anything in the end. His son, HW, had no character development whatsoever, he just sat in the scenes for the vast majority of the movie. I was desperately willing something to happen with his character (by that time I had long been scratching at straws to keep watching). We go from seeing him as a child for 90% of the movie to then suddenly being grown up, and then straight into probably the most poignant part of his and his ""father's"" relationship - him being disowned by DDL (which I am guessing was intended to illustrate how low and out of touch DDL's character had become). But who really cared? In fact, there was minimal character development for DDL and practically nothing for anyone else - the long, drawn out scenes with no direction or clue as to where we were going severely impacted the ability to really care for what was going on. And what did the film's title have to do with anything? It obviously wasn't literal - at least there wasn't really enough violence or blood to count. Nor was it really figurative - honestly, totally meaningless with regards to what the film was portraying."""

","I thought this film was terrible all the way around. Lousy acting, lousy script, the sets were okay. The script was boring, uneventful, uninteresting. No wonder the studios don't want to pay these guys more money. I don't enjoy seeing a movie about a man who is so very ruthless, stingy, selfish, and a real fathead with no personality good or bad. It lacked all types of character motivation; Dans performance was totally over the top. There was no love interest in this film; I presume he wasn't gay (no guy would go near him) and he had no girlfriend or wife. As for being a modern day 'Citizen Kane', let's get real. Kane was excellent film all the way around. As Archie Bunker would say, this movie is ""stinkeroo""."

","2007 was indeed both a good & bad year for films. Then again, 2008 was no better. There Will Be Blood. I came across the flick on Netflix & I gave it a try. I watched it with my dad and I was glad when the credits rolled. The film got so much hype and went on to win a but load of awards at the Academy Awards. Now here are some stuff I didn't mind about the show<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>~ I liked Daniel Day Lewis. He was great in Gangs of New York. When we first meet his character, he's traveling with his son (wait scratch that, it's not really his kid. It's one of his coworker's kid who had died in an accident at his company) and is just desperate to make some money off of some oil drilling ~ It was based off of a book. Yes pretty much all films are nowadays. ~ The final scene. The famous lines ""I drink your milkshake!"" as well as ""I'M FINISHED!"" that follows after the showdown between a fake priest (played by the over the top Paul Dano who would later go on to play in 2013's thriller Prisoners). The fight was well done, and felt like I was watching a cage fight. Well done screen writers! <br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>~ Directing. I didn't like the director. Yes the hippie geek himself, Paul Thomas Anderson. The man has not done anything good. Admit it! He was the wrong choice to direct this bloated thriller and needs to retire ASAP! ~ Runtime. The movie was too long. I felt like I was being strapped down and forced to watch this! Even my dad kept saying ""Is it over yet?"" The film went on for two and a half hours and was so forced. Cut it down ! Chris Nolan is the only one that can director movies that are over two hours!<br/><br/>~ Acting. I didn't have a problem with Daniel Day Louis or Sir Ciaran Hinds since both are my favorite actors. The rest was terrible and cringe inducing. Paul Dano was too over the top and was so stupid in his part! Might as well make me sit on nails Paul !! ~ Music. The music was the worst part of the film! I'm pretty sure it was a straight off copy of The Dark Knight soundtrack, which is known for it's screechy music. Listening to this so called music seriously got way too over the edge, it seriously made me wanna shove nails in my ears and it felt like nails were being dragged on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>All and all, this movie is a huge let down. Value your time & watch a Coen brothers film!<br/><br/>One outta Ten stars"
"alw-5","6","5","10","11 January 2010"," All style and no substance
","This is not a bad film, but it is a seriously flawed one.<br/><br/>It is clearly the work of a highly original and creative mind. The opening wordless sequence is visually and dramatically stunning, setting up expectations which the rest of the film does not fulfil. The cinematography is of an extremely high standard throughout. Lighting is realistic and atmospheric, camera angles are arresting and disturbing. The depiction of Texas in the early 1900s studiously avoids the clichés and sentimentality of say, Ron Howard's Far and Away.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood could have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately it lacks three elements vital to good story-telling, namely, character development, suspense and motivation. The whole movie is constructed around Day-Lewis's detailed and mesmerising portrayal of a man driven by his own hatred of his fellow men. The problem is that once you have seen five minutes of this meticulously observed, barnstormingly Oscar-friendly impersonation of a ruthless misanthrope you have seen the whole performance. The same can be said of Paul Dano's disappointingly lightweight Eli Sunday, who brings a much-needed comedy element to the film at the expense of the character's credibility. The only character who develops is Plainview's son H.W, who in one of the strongest scenes of the film, challenges his father in a few broken words after Daniel mocks him for using an interpreter. Is it believable that this man would not have learned to sign, fifteen years after his son became deaf?<br/><br/>There are many other aspects of Plainview's character which are equally unconvincing. Although he claims to be motivated by anger and hatred , his violence has more glee and good humour than blind rage. He shows no remorse for his actions, not even his appalling lack of paternal responsibility to the boy he claims to care about more than anything else. Identification with character is an essential component of tragedy. Plainview has no redeeming features and is thus utterly unlikeable. We feel for Macbeth, for Michael Corleone, for Yves Montand as the father who misguidedly kills his own son in Claude Berri's Jean de Florette. We observe Plainview with detached horror, but we feel nothing. He is inhuman, a man reduced to mechanical actions dictated by his own hormonal urges. Although admirable from an existential philosophical perspective, such a character is boring as hell on the stage or the screen. Emotions are the life blood of drama. There is no love in this film, so the hatred is meaningless and mundane.<br/><br/>The lack of suspense should have been addressed at the scripting stage. No amount of stylish camera-work and modish lighting can compensate for the absence of plot which becomes apparent around the halfway mark. After the arrival of Henry the storyline simply stops. One of the greatest opportunities for conflict ( another dramatic essential) could have been the relationship between father and son. Apart from the penultimate confrontation mentioned above, there is virtually no interaction between the man and the boy. Paul Sunday is another character who could have played a useful part in the story, but he never appears again after his first tense meeting with Plainview, one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The near-total absence of women is one of the film's major weaknesses. Incredibly, two of the critics who lavished the most praise on the movie saw this as some kind of positive factor. Was the West built by men alone? Seriously? The appearance of a wife and mother could have given a real injection of drama to the plot as it meanders unconvincingly towards its end. <br/><br/>The music has been praised as groundbreaking but for me is intrusive and annoying. At times it signals plot too clumsily - the accidents in the mineshaft would have been so much more shocking without those spooky sliding strings alerting us to imminent doom (Nic Roeg demonstrates the suspensefulness of silence in the sequence in Don't Look Now where Donald Sutherland has a nasty accident high in a church tower) - while at other times it seems superfluous, inappropriate and jarring. <br/><br/>A minor fault is the absence of visible signs of ageing by most of the supporting actors. In particular Dano looks exactly the same throughout the film's twenty-year timespan. Day- Lewis's accent at times betrays hints of Surrey, and the revivalist church alternates between a windowless barn and a Tele-evangelist's set complete with giant illuminated cross.<br/><br/>All in all, a huge disappointment."
"baumer","3","5","10","11 September 2008"," There will be boredom
","I have seen some very bad films, most of them horror or ""movies"" that are spoofs of other films. I thought Meet The Spartans was the worst movie I have ever seen, and even though it is, because it is not a film in a true sense of the word, I have to go ahead and say that There Will Be Blood is perhaps worse than it. Because this is a real film, with a real theme and real actors and a director and so on, TWBB should be in the category of one of the worst films ever made.<br/><br/>Reading through some of the glowing reviews here, you'd think this film reinvented the wheel. They praise the acting, the directing, the cinematography. While I'll agree that Daniel Day Lewis was quite good, it does not make up for the rest of this turd. I'm still waiting for something to happen. I know there was something about a bowling alley and milkshakes, but other than that, I'm still waiting for blood. Keep waiting.<br/><br/>Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theater throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the film's plot still hadn't gone anywhere. There's some stabs at religion, oil tycoons and imposters, but when you keep waiting for the plot to pick up and looking at your watch every few minutes, the film is in trouble.<br/><br/>All this film can boast about is Daniel Day Lewis. He is a fantastic actor, but his over acted and misguided interpretation of this maniac is good but not enough to carry the film. This has to be one of the most misleading titles in the history of film. I remember snickers when sitting through the trailer of Blood For Chocolate. What the hell did that mean? But at least There Will Be Blood whets your appetite. I'm here for blood. Where is it? A drop...anything? Sadly, no.<br/><br/>I sometimes think the masses are sheep. How else do explain the insane IMDb rating for this film. Powerful? Brilliant? Classic? This sounds like something to describe Titanic or the Godfather, not this charlatan of a film. If you suffer from insomnia, watch this, it is a definite cure.<br/><br/>3/10"
"thegreatwatsit","8","5","10","3 March 2008"," Visual Epic. Needs more Beef.
","There will be Spoilers.<br/><br/>It certainly clicks the right buttons: a world dominated by gangster capitalism and exploitation shown in the image of one man? Check. A world where the most holy men are little more than charlatans and frauds? Check. A world where family is a little more than a token for genuineness, to be disposed of whenever it becomes useless or a hindrance (usually for economic reasons)? Check. A world where one must be a psychopath to make it 'to the top'? Check. And the funny thing is, was how goddamn predictable all that was. These hoary old clichés seem to come around in cycles  this film is after all based loosely on a novel by Lewis Sinclair, perhaps every time there is an unpopular and blatantly corrupt Republican in the white house? <br/><br/>That is not to say the film is bad - far from it actually and yes, Daniel Day Lewis is not as good as you have heard he is. He is far better than that, in a multifaceted role which demands both bluster and subtlety. But the really impressive thing from my Point of View was the dialogue  not so much the words spoken but how they were spoken. Every conversation was delivered with awkwardness, or with stuttering silence, or was clearly performed within the movie like Plainview's ""I'm an oil man"" speech at the beginning. Talk ebbs and flows penetrated by the occasional silence with none of the characters except Eli or Plainview at their most hysteric or determined, speaking with great conviction or believe. There is though very little dialogue in the film as a whole.<br/><br/>This gives off a strong sense of realism there as opposed to ""Movie acting"". Imagine the scene where at the end where Eli and Plainview confront each other, lesser actors with lesser scripts would have either gone the typical indie route by exaggerating each characters mannerisms to show emotions and/or individuality or would have gone the Hollywood way and minimized subtlety in favor of the obviously dramatic. Here is there none of that, Eli's character, facial expression and yes, way of speech during his ""confession"" do not feel like performances at all but looking into  what? His soul, maybe? But that does sound pretentious.  That is not to say that this in itself is much new but the quality at which achieves it puts it above most recent releases. Add to that your cinematography and your long dialogue less scenes which have an almost Leone-like quality in showing so much by silence you have something of a classic of realism. Pure visual cinema.<br/><br/>Recently in his review Mark Kermode, the critic for BBC, said that the film was like watching a new grammar of cinema being made in front of him. I wouldn't go that far, it is more an evolution of what already exists done by the best around (Surely if the Oscars were a serious event, P.T Anderson would have won best director). It is just a pity the storyline is nothing new under the sun. Its psychology being limited, dated and incomplete going into ""dollar book Freud"" territory. Its politics are similar as already mentioned. In the end it is a film to enjoy for 2 and a half hours and admire; but it just can't inspire passion in you. Perhaps that is where too, the comparison to Kane come in."

","A movie of epic proportion and ambition. Daniel Day-Lewis with an Academy Award worthy performance. THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a portrait of the human stain with hope, belief, greed, corruption and all that comes with living and thereof with oil. Daniel Plainview's(Day-Lewis)story goes from a down-on-luck silver miner raising a baby son, H.W.(Dillon Freasier),to a self-made oil tycoon languished in alcohol and self-exile. Daniel makes his son his partner while turning a small patch of dirt into a small rambling oil town. Along the way, Daniel will not exactly make a deal with the devil, but with a charismatic young preacher Eli Sunday(Paul Dano). That deal will prove haunting for decades and end bloody. A lucky strike, massive fortunes, ill health, and big oil companies will leave their mark on both Plainview's. The father and son bond will be tattered...victim of ambition, human value, deception and all that comes with the discovery and profits of the black gold called oil. Also in the cast: Kevin J.

","Although I found ""There will be Blood"" to be excellent in all aspects. What intrigued me the most was the cinematography of the movie. There were some scenes of which I was completely blown away. In particular the scene when the oil well catches fire against the backdrop of a dark blue sky. The mixture of the smoke, fire, and the oil painted sky in the backdrop was truly remarkable. In addition, the scene when Daniel is on the train with his son had a very old fashioned feel to it, reminiscent of the black and white picture days. <br/><br/>One piece of the movie that will no doubt go over looked pertains to Daniels relationship with his son once he had become deaf. Clearly a difficult situation to deal with for anyone, especially at this juncture in time when not much had been known about this sort of problem. I felt that enough had been done to show Daniels sympathy for his child without making him seem colder then he was. Anymore of this would have been simply harping on something very few of us can relate to."

Off and on the dates of the years are shown to indicate the passage of time. But you learn nothing about the character. Although the film is very long, the interesting things are left out. Especially the last third of the movie is very boring. Important events like the marriage are shown very shortly instead we see Day-Lewis being drunk on the floor for endless minutes. Daniel Day-Lewis is very pretentiously acting. If you compare it to Raoul Walsh's SILVER RIVER you know how bad this new film is.

","I had so been looking forward to this movie, for so long, and had to bide my time to see it.<br/><br/>However, on a wet Monday afternoon in Glasgow my chance finally arrived.<br/><br/>PT Anderson is right up there among my favourite directors of all time with Magnolia in my top 5 films, ever! News of Daniel Day Lewis' performance and his (as it turns out justified) favouritism for the Best Actor Oscar only added to my anticipation.<br/><br/>The film's position as No. 23 EVER on IMDb's review list (my filmic bible) meant it had to be a total classic.<br/><br/>So I'm afraid I have to beg to differ.<br/><br/>Whilst much of it amazes there is just too much indulgence in this movie. The first 20 minutes when, famously, not a word is uttered feels to me like film w***. It is overlong as well and I felt the cinematography failed to reach the top drawer; it's simply too dark in places.<br/><br/>The theme of greed is interesting but it feels a bit derivative of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand - the famous book of the 50's - although I gather the inspiration was drawn from a little known novel called 'Oil'. And there are rather too many moments where Daniel Plainview played, mostly magnificently, by Daniel Day Lewis, is symbolised as the Devil incarnate sheathed in shards of flame and plumes of smoke. OK PT, we get it The context in which this greed is acted out is Oil Boom America (the first third of the last century). It centres around an oil prospector's run ins with an unnamed fundamentalist Christian outback church.<br/><br/>The parallels between Bush and Iraq are not difficult to see.<br/><br/>Whilst the congregation may be innocent worshippers, the relationship between the young pastor (Dano) and Plainview, is the real axis of the movie and it meets with mixed results. Partly because Dano's performance is not 100% convincing. Close, but no cigar.<br/><br/>Indeed the denouement was, I thought, verging on the absurd.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis' descent into madness is well observed and he manages to avoid the excesses of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. However, having seen most of the big movies of the year his was probably the best male lead performance - although I felt Ellen Page in Juno and Javier Bardem in A Country For Old Men were better, purer, more believable constructs.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my final point. The Coen's movie beats it hand down on every level except for the score, which is stunning.<br/><br/>Jonny Greenwood was responsible.<br/><br/>Verdict? 7/10. (Still an A in old money, but I was expecting a straight 10)"
"fosterino","7","6","13","5 February 2008"," it's good, but oddly unsatisfying
","I have to say right away that the first half to two-thirds of this movie are totally, completely, and unquestionably mind blowing. The film combines eye scorching cinematography, fierce acting, dynamic, unpredictable characters, bold imagery, revolutionary music, and an overall style and pacing that grant the movie a sort of tension and realism that are absolutely palpable. <br/><br/>What I really liked is that for most of the film the story if of such epic proportions that it seems as if no actors could contain it. However, Daniel Day-Lewis internalizes his role to such an extent that the huge scope of the story is almost a reflection of his character's (and humanity's) dark complexities. He and Paul Dano give electrifying performances, and Day- Lewis's Oscar will be well deserved indeed. The film pulsates with its own evil, manic energy and boldness, thanks in large part to Johnny Greenwood's revolutionary score. Calling it music wouldn't be very accurate. Instead, I think of it as primal noises and tones, signifying Daniel Plainview's primal urges of greed and power. For the most part, this is a stunning work of cinema.<br/><br/>During the majority of the film all the good elements of the film I listed above are firing on all cylinders. In one of my bigger film disappointments of the year, in the latter 40 minutes to an hour of the film, these components fall puzzlingly out of place. The story all of a sudden contracts into a psychodrama, standing in stark contrast the the two hours of allegorical oil drilling and evangelizing that preceded it. After this point most of the film takes place inside, depriving viewers of the beautiful cinematography they had been treated to. Paul Dano, the yin to Day-Lewis's yang, leaves the picture for a while, depriving the viewer of their delicious (and frightening) rivalry. The music gets less edgy and more conventional, eventually sounding like something you've heard before. And, most puzzlingly, while all these things are being scaled down, Daniel Day-Lewis's performance gets more and more over the top, eventually bordering on dark comedy. This is fine, I suppose, but I feel that in the context of the rest of the movie it just doesn't work at all.<br/><br/>In a way, There Will Be Blood is a lot like oil itself. It starts off with the joy and energy of discovery, and makes the viewers very happy, just as it makes Plainview and others like him very rich. However, just like oil, ever so slowly it dries up."
"Rogue-32","6","6","13","1 February 2008"," Like watching a man attend his own funeral
","There is no denying that DDL is a superlative actor, capable of delivering a 125% commitment to any character he takes on. This is a given. His performance in There Will Be Blood is indisputably stupendous, and he does deserve the Oscar he no doubt will receive later in the month.<br/><br/>That being said, this doesn't make the movie all that great; it's hardly perfect and hardly the masterpiece so many critics are deeming it to be. For a film to be truly great, you have to have a brilliant concept going in, and said concept must then be brilliantly executed. I think this film had a very good concept but its overall flaws lie in the execution. Haven't read the source material (the novel by Sinclair) but I do think there is enough of a grand story here to warrant a better execution.<br/><br/>Some films give the viewer too much information on the characters, which generally leads to triteness and loss of edge; others give too little. There Will Be Blood, for me, falls into this second category: we are never given enough background detail, or - even worse - enough CURRENT detail, to have the Daniel Plainview character fleshed out enough to even begin to understand him on anything other than a superficial level. All we are given to work with is an empty shell of a man, with hatred for himself at his deepest core, and that hatred festers from the inside, until he is, by the end of the movie, a drunken rotted-out, still-breathing corpse. He has monetary success, sure, but with no one to share it with, it is meaningless.<br/><br/>The battle of egos between the Eli preacher character and Daniel is at the root of the film, and this was played out in a very intriguing way, the question being, which one of them is actually phonier, more psychotic and more evil? <br/><br/>Partway through the film we know that Daniel, who at one point submits himself to an act of vile and ridiculously overplayed humiliation at Eli's hands, will be getting revenge. Therefore, the ending that so many people have found to be surprising came as no surprise to me; it was the only possible way the movie could conclude, in fact. The ending was not as powerful as it could have been because I just didn't feel Daniel's character deteriorate the way he obviously had as depicted in the 1927 sequence. There's a character that shows up halfway through, who tries to pass himself off as Daniel's brother (from a different mother); this character turns out to be nothing more than a plot device, a person to whom Daniel speaks of his true nature - it's not enough for him to succeed, he reveals, he's not happy unless others fail. He hates nearly everyone and cannot wait to make enough dough so he can get away from them all, blah blah blah. From then on, his character becomes more openly hateful, but we never really FEEL this happening from the inside of the man. This bugged me.<br/><br/>The most frustrating part of the film is Daniel's relationship with his son (or the boy he apparently chooses to adopt as his own, not really sure how this worked). At the beginning, we see him showing what appears to be genuine affection for him, but this deteriorates so quickly that it just didn't seem valid. I think a little more subtle nuance in Anderson's writing was called for - this would have elevated the film to possible mythic status, right up there, say, with No Country For Old Men although I hate to compare."

In fact I could not be bothered to watch it to the end because there was some important paint I had to watch dry. Plot holes galore, melodramatic music, over stylised. Lets just start with the Daniel Day Lewis character, Daniel Plainview. In every film there is a protagonist that we go on a journey with (if you don't agree with this then stop reading) the protagonist must have have some redeeming quality and we the audience go with him or her. The protagonist does not have to be a hero, see (Kevin Bacon in ""The Woodsman for very grim example or Eric Bana in ""Chopper"" for a charismatic anti hero)"" We go with Daniel Plainview on a nihilistic capitalist spree driven by greed. That's fair enough. I like unpopular people, I am one. However, the film relentlessly shows us how awful Daniel Plainass is. It shows no human, balanced redeeming qualities and therefore I (we) don't care what happens to him. The sub plot about him meeting his ""brother"" was excuse the pun ""overkill"" we understood way back that Plainview would go to any lengths why show us again????? <br/><br/>There was such a promising start, the ""Ely"" character who appears so integral to Plainview's ""redemption"" is side stepped for 20 minutes of the film then turns up ten years later looking exactly the same age - Couldn't Make Up have given him some kind of beard? <br/><br/>There is a comment in the church that Plainview has been ""whoring or lusting"" This is one damn thing we don't see him do? Really bad. <br/><br/>THE MUSIC!<br/><br/>Now I liked the music, as music, the opening chords were foreboding and malevolent, two things I like. However, given its emotional context during the burning of the first Oil Well/Mine it was WAY WAY over the top and necessary. It was Horror in a drama and the sort of directorial decision that detracted from the emotional weight of the story. The percussive music later on also appeared totally out of place given its emotional and dramatic context. Don't get me wrong, it sounded great, but it just did n't reflect the mood of the plains.<br/><br/>Dylan Buckle"

","Unlike many people are saying, ""There Will Be Blood"" is not Paul Thomas Anderson's first epic. If ""Sydney/Hard Eight"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" were minimalist pearls, ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" were superb mosaics of epic proportions - PTA himself defined ""Magnolia"" (by the way, my favourite film ever) 'an epic about common dramas'. ""There Will Be Blood"", on the other hand, is an epic at the core of the term, but with PTA's unique style in lieu of old-fashioned clichés, powered with a tour-de-force performance by Daniel Day-Lewis (the best of his career and, since we're speaking of DDL, that's quite a feat). His extraordinary story of greed, family bonds, and vengeance (based upon Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"") could be defined as a bravura meeting between Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" and Malick's ""Days of Heaven"", mixed with the grandeur of John Huston (""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") and George Stevens (""Giant""). Alongside the Coens' ""No Country for Old Men"", this is the best film of 2007 (it's one of the few times, perhaps the only, when my two favourite films of a certain year are actually the favourites to win the Best Picture Oscar, so I will be glad if either of them gets the top prize next Sunday), a treasure that'll amaze audiences for years to come.

","The magnificent Oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis, the stark cinematography of Robert Elswit and the great direction and screenplay of Paul Thomas Anderson coalesce to create this masterpiece about the early days of the US oil industry. I love the way Anderson brilliantly adapted Upton Sinclair's 1920's novel ""Oil"" eschewing the epic political/historical narrative and focusing on the characters that continue to dominate the American scene,i.e., the ruthlessly ambitious and the self-righteous eager to enforce some religious orthodoxy on the rest of us. Daniel Day Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a wildcatter insanely determined to beat the Standard Oil boys who've defeated so many other independent drillers. He is a man of singular passion with no tolerance for what he considers religious nonsense. On the other hand there's Eli Sunday, beautifully played by Paul Dano, a pastor of a church located in the midst of oil-rich country Plainview is eager to exploit. The natural antagonism between the two adversaries escalates with the advantage shifting from one to the other depending upon the exigencies of the moment. From the opening scene to the shattering climax with its unmistakable symbolism this is a modern masterpiece."
"Desertman84","10","3","5","19 October 2012"," A Great Movie About Oil
","Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson steps outside his contemporary world of dysfunctional Angelenos to explore a very different dysfunctional man that happens to be an oil pioneer whose trailblazing spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition.The movie entitled,There Will Be Blood is Anderson's loose adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair that features Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano together with Dillon Freasier,Kevin J. O'Connor and Ciarán Hinds.<br/><br/>The screenplay focuses its attentions on Daniel Plainview, a miner who happens upon black gold during a disastrous excavation that ends in a broken leg.Pulling himself up from the bowels of the earth, both literally and metaphorically, Plainview embarks on a systematic and steadfast approach to mastering the oil business. Using plain-spoken and straightforward language, Plainview launches a campaign to convince small-town property owners they should let him drill their land. Without him, they won't have the equipment to access the profit beneath their feet. He builds an empire this way and gradually becomes obsessed with the intrinsic value of power, growing increasingly irascible and paranoid in the process. Plainview meets his match in Eli Sunday, a teenage preacher in the small California town of Little Boston, whose brother tipped Plainview off to the town's plentiful supply of untapped oil. To fully reap the benefits of the land, Plainview must suffer the opposing whims of this ""prophet,"" whose legitimacy is questionable at best. And it's unclear if either man is prepared to pay the humiliating price the other wants to exact.<br/><br/>A sprawling epic of family, faith, power and oil, this film is set on the incendiary frontier of California's turn-of-the-century petroleum boom.Also,it establishes itself as a film of Darwinian ferocity, a stark and pitiless parable of American capitalism.Anderson has truly made an old fashioned, great movie. Not to be missed!!!"
"dramos971","10","3","5","2 September 2012"," A landmark in modern film
","When I first saw ""There Will Be Blood,"" I didn't really know what to think. It was a movie that grew on me, and in time I had to watch it again. Not solely because the plot itself is great, (which it is) or the cast is great (which it also is), but mainly because all the aspects of film that make a great movie great are in this movie. The cinematography is great, as Robert Elswit asc. gives the audience vivid, powerful shots of Texas in the early 1900s throughout the film. The film starts with a very quiet Daniel Day-Lewis in a mineshaft chiseling away what will be his future. After an incident which causes a broken leg makes the audience wonder why Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is the way he is, i.e. full of hatred, greed, and disgust for man, the audience will also grow to like him in parts of the film. That is, until the climactic ending in which we find out that Plainview is really insane.<br/><br/>The movie is about Plainview's life around the oil industry at the turn of the 1900s and how the wealth and success that he encounters slowly kills him (figuratively speaking). His character is confusing, as you don't really know whether to like him or hate him--but if any other actor had taken on the role of Daniel Plainview the movie would not be nearly as good--or probably not good at all. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a decade. He is absolutely excellent in this film, and it made me fully appreciate what actors do for a living and how hard the job can really be. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in to Daniel Plainview in this film.<br/><br/>The film is disturbing at certain parts, as we watch Plainview abandon his adopted deaf son H.W., after H.W. attempts to burn down a cabin that Plainview had been sleeping in, or at the end of the film when Plainview ends up killing a young evangelistic preacher after he embarrasses Plainview in front of a church congregation. Having said that, you know that Plainview loves H.W. unconditionally throughout the film, and up until the end H.W. loves him back. The relationship that he has with his son in the movie is really the only thing keeping him from going fully insane.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is a landmark of a film. Paul Thomas Anderson did a phenomenal job making this movie, as it will no doubt be a classic for years to come. This is a movie that should be taught in film classes as a masterpiece, a work of fine art, a film comparable to other greats such as Casablanca, La Dolce Vita, and Citizen Kane. And after this performance Day-Lewis will go down as one of the greatest actors of all time.<br/><br/>A must see for anyone who truly appreciates film for what it is."

","A story about family, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn- of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.<br/><br/>Impressed with PTA's work with the mesmerizing Punch Drunk Love, I checked out his other work. Mongolia, Boogie Nights. They all seemed good, but nothing that suits my interests. But what intrigued me the most was There Will Be Blood. I've increasingly become a fan of modern westerns with the work of the Cohen brothers. They are genius. No Country For Old Men and True Grit were all very great, and they all contained heart + soul. But something about TWBB was different that made me have to go see it... <br/><br/>Expectations were moderate, they exceeded like no other has. TWBB can be passed as a western, but contains so much more than you know. First of all, the STORY contains it all. Speaking figuratively, there is no story. It moves along precisely and easily, with giving us story easily but also giving us much more than we asked for. It's easy to follow, needs no complex plot twists, and gives us the perfect ending that makes this film a classic.. The acting was top-notch. Daniel Day Lewis isn't the most known actor today and frankly, he's not the person I hear everyday. But his performance was so disturbing, so perfect, that your going to get chills down your spine. He perfects his character like no actor was portrayed. He was the perfect Daniel Plainview.. The haunting feel of the film was perfectly chilling. While most people complain about the soundtrack (PTA really loves loud soundtracks) I, for one, loved it. It fit the film in a strange way, and it kept me at the edge of my seat. But it also did one other thing: set the mood. The movie isn't like any ""western"" (if you even want to call it that) you've seen before. It was disturbing, haunting, and might I say beautiful. Everything was done so brilliantly, I cannot explain how much I loved it. The characters were portrayed wonderfully, and you can feel their emotions and needs. The acting, which ties in with the characterization, was perfectly done. Everybody gave it their best, and their best was all we need. The soundtrack and the atmosphere gave this film a perfect bleakness that you aren't going to find out what's next. If you love clever, brilliant, and haunting stories; this will suit you. There Will Be Blood was a masterpiece. I could say it was one of my favorite films. It was wondrous, beautiful, haunting. It will stay with you for days, and you won't be able to stop thinking about it until you see it a few more times. I'm finished. <br/><br/>10/10."

","As close to perfection as one can possibly imagine. This film is simply stunning — an incredible artistic achievement, which is shocking, thrilling and totally absorbing.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives a brooding, mesmerizing performance as the deranged prospector who rises from near broke to major oil baron through sheer force of will. He is not alone, however, in making the acting exciting, believable, intelligent and highly watchable — nearly every spoken line, gesture, look or presence in this work is thoughtful and bold — he just happens to give one of the best screen performances ever in cinema.<br/><br/>All other aspects of the film are of the very highest quality, from the music to the cinematography — they hardly matched in even the very best pictures made throughout the decades of cinema.<br/><br/>The story evolves slowly, but surely and the situation becomes increasingly tense.

"jordnthoms","9","3","5","14 June 2011"," Well worthy of the hype
","I really enjoyed this movie. The three most valuable aspects of the movie are the music, acting, and story. I am a big fan of Jonny Greenwood and I've read a lot of complaints about the soundtrack to this movie. You shouldn't review a film if your idea of a good movie is Wall-E and you shouldn't open your mouth about music if your idea of good music is 50 Cent. I own the soundtrack to the film and I occasionally listen to it while studying or on the train. There are two or three songs that only belong in a movie, but the rest are excellent and all are fitting for a soundtrack to such an eerie and violent film. I honestly put the soundtrack in the ranks of ""Amelie"". As for the acting, Daniel and Henry Plainview were well played. HW Plainview and Eli Sunday weren't truly very convincing, but it wasn't devastating to the film. I truly felt the need to review this movie because I read reviews by so many people who didn't understand the story or thought the movie had no plot. Of course, like any good movie there isn't a linear plot built as predictably as a tunnel with a light at the end. I think many people didn't like the end because it was unsettling to their worldview. I think the director, whoever he is, was trying to give an accurate portrayal. Perhaps it is because I am an environmentalists but the character of Daniel Plainview is still alive and kicking. I liked the theme or religion throughout because it demonstrates how people will allow others to take advantage of them because their focus is on divinity and eternal life. Daniel Plainview is the man on top. He is easy to hate for no reason, but this movie gives plenty of reasons to hate him. The movie is an accurate representation of the aggregation of power and the path to success, especially in the business of oil."
"runamokprods","10","3","5","10 November 2010"," One of the best, most important films of recent years
","If the early Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be channeling the young hyper-energetic Martin Scorsese, 'There Will Be Blood' - a more quiet and thoughtful, but no less amazing and cinematic work shows Anderson working in the vein of Stanley Kubrick. In place of a hyperactive camera, there is now a coldly, brilliantly observational one. In place of empathetic if damaged characters there are now people drowning in their own poison and lies.<br/><br/>He has created a film both boldly theatrical and subtly real, both broadly political and intensely personal. Complicated and confusing emotionally and full of ideas and themes, this feels more mature and focused than Anderson's earlier work, brilliant as that all was. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, the film looks incredible (if simply shot for an Anderson film), and I'm sure I'll only see more and more layers and meanings on repeated viewings. <br/><br/>One of the more important films of recent years, this critique of the American dream of success, of conquest and of control is mesmerizing, and ultimately devastating."
"alexbeene","10","3","5","16 August 2010"," ""Blood"" nothing short of a masterpiece
","There is a certain amount of dread surrounding the release of ""There Will Be Blood,"" Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" I anticipated disappointment in thinking Anderson's film would be yet another imitator of ""Citizen Kane."" After all, the story of Daniel Plainview plays out in the same epic fashion as that of Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Anderson is wise enough to understand that this is not and does not need simply to be a ""Kane"" clone. Instead, ""Blood"" is a deeply devoted and emotionally engaging telling of one man's quest to reach the top of his field.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives what can only be described as the best performance of the decade thus far as Plainview. Day-Lewis's Plainview is a master of coercion and social understanding, but these traits go from strong to weak as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Equally as interesting is Eli Sunday, brought to life by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" star Paul Dano. The brilliance of Dano's performance comes from the overzealous and almost comedic nature of Eli's ambitions for his faith and church.<br/><br/>Eli's larger-than-life personality to the rural people of his small town puzzled Plainview, who wonders how these men and women could be so idiotic in accepting Eli's principles.<br/><br/>In this questioning lies the essence of Day-Lewis' character, a hungry oil tycoon in the making who is as much of an enigma as the members of Eli's church. By the film's end, one could view all of Plainview's actions, which include murder, bribery and theft, as being the products not of selfishness, but, as Plainview explains, of a hatred for the simplicity of the people around him.<br/><br/>Just as grand as Plainview's desires is the scope of the picture itself. Anderson vividly brings to life early 1900s America in a desolate, distraught matter that is not easily achieved.<br/><br/>Robert Elswit's cinematography is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the vastness of the then-undeveloped California land with the grand scope of the open fields that hold the promise of oil.<br/><br/>In terms of score, Johnny Greenwood's composition for the film is revolutionary. Not very often do audiences see such a dynamic flow of music combined with notes that set off a sense of urgency even in the weaker moments of ""Blood."" It should be noted that the film's less powerful segments are few and far between and are mostly produced in the first half when viewers see Plainview simply toy with his violent nature.<br/><br/>Still, this film has such a grand ambition to it that its ultimate goal almost seems to override every other aspect of the film, except for Day-Lewis' performance. The greatest achievement of ""Blood"" is in shooting for the highest sense of dramatic purpose imaginable, and on many levels, it achieves its hopes.<br/><br/>The end result is nothing short of an American masterpiece and a film that I feel safe in saying will only become more respected as time goes on. ""There Will Be Blood"" returns the epic film genre to its most basic, yet effective, roots and succeeds in grabbing our attention time and time again."
"Magenta_Bob","10","3","5","15 August 2010"," An epic tale of biblical proportions
","Paul Thomas Anderson has never been shy of high ambitions or grand statements. In Magnolia he drew up a complex set of themes and characters whose interactions were profoundly touching, and in Boogie Nights he made an equally ambitious depiction of the porn industry as well as the people within. There Will Be Blood, his 2007 masterpiece, is, however, an epic tale even grander in scope, a story of almost biblical proportions that feels like the kind of film that Anderson has been working his whole career towards making.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood spans several decades and follows the oil man Daniel Plainview (a fantastic Daniel Day-Lewis), whose economical success is juxtaposed by personal tragedies and an increasing detachment from the world. It is, in a way, a traditional character study of a person's rise and fall, but the scope and the direction is almost unparalleled in recent filmmaking. In fact, it reminds me quite a bit of another one of my favourite films, Barry Lyndon, both thematically and stylistically, and in a sense you might say that it is the Barry Lyndon of the 2000's; they share the same stunning cinematography, the same mesmerizing score (here by Radiohead member Johnny Greenwood), and Daniel Plainview's fate is not entirely unlike that of Redmond Barry.<br/><br/>In one of the best scenes of the film, Daniel explains to his brother how he doesn't want anyone else to succeed, how he sees the worst in people and how he has built up his hatred over the years. To me, this is a key scene for different reasons. First, throughout the film, there is something slightly strained about the way Daniel Day-Lewis talks and acts, and this is the reason why; we see a man trying to maintain a façade of kindness and sympathy, when all he really feels is contempt for the world and the people he meets. Furthermore, in his brother he finds someone he can confide in, and when this man is later revealed as a fraud, his whole world turns apart and he loses his last parts of sanity.<br/><br/>In another powerful scene, Daniel Plainview is being washed from his sins by the pastor Eli (Paul Dano in another Oscar-deserving performance). He is made to confess his sins, that he has abandoned his child, in order to build a pipeline through the land of a very religious man, and seems to feel remorse. And yet, when the procedure is over he whispers to himself that he can now finally build the pipeline. I am not suggesting that Daniel is a cold man; on the contrary, I do think he feels remorse for some of his actions, but his highest motivation is nonetheless his oil and the success leading from it.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film, Daniel finally dissociates himself from his son and is ostensibly left with little else than his money and his oil. While he said that this is what he wanted, there is nothing but tragedy written over the final act. His recurring conflict with the aforementioned town pastor is also given a macabre ending. We are not sure what happens to him then, but his final words certainly bear a sense of impending doom; ""I am finished"". And since Daniel Plainview ultimately is the heart of the film, so it finishes as well."

","I want to preface this by saying I am in no way a fan of pretentious art house dreck, but I didn't find this movie to be in that category. <br/><br/>It's definitely on the slow side but I didn't really have a problem with the pace given the content. I have to admit I was sucked in. I thought they did an excellent job putting you in that time period and it felt very historically accurate to me. I thought the lack of dialogue at the beginning was a risk that paid off. It made me curious and interested enough to start anticipating what would come after.<br/><br/>I thought Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job. I think his performance starts springing some leaks in the last 45 minutes or so but otherwise I thought it was spectacular. It's a great portrayal of a character who you hate to love if you're one of those people that realizes that the anti-hero or villain is usually the most daring and interesting character.<br/><br/>Like I said I almost always hate movies that are slow-paced and aren't at least punctuated with a few grand scenes but I didn't feel that way here. I think the reasons are those stated above: the settings just jumped off the screen and felt real and Daniel Day-Lewis gave me a character I was highly intrigued by and couldn't see enough of. <br/><br/>This definitely isn't a movie you watch with your spouse while reading the paper or pause in the middle to grab and eat a pizza, but if you're in the mood to engross yourself in a movie you might get a lot out of it."
"warthogjump","10","3","5","3 February 2010"," Brings a new meaning to the saying: an instant classic!
","What better two to put together than Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis. PTA is a favorite writer and director of mine from Magnolia, being one of my favorite films ever. As such, going into TWBB, I expected very highly of it.<br/><br/>I was rewarded with an absolute shattering of my high expectations. Watching this movie is akin to watching a miracle. The sheer brilliance of it is simply unexplainable. High expectations doesn't even begin to describe the greatness of this movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the directing and script are spot on. But, what I would like to expand on is Mr. Lewis' acting. Lewis becomes Daniel Plainview in such a smooth and seemingly effortless manner. He demonstrates to us the terrible consequences of greed, especially in relation to oil, and the way his life and ""family"" fall victim to it.<br/><br/>I may get criticized for making the following comment, but I believe Daniel Day Lewis delivered, in TWBB, the most Oscar deserving performance ever in the history of cinema. He completely shines in this movie and is a sheer joy to have watched on the big screen and at home on the smaller TV. His acting is like an explosive masterpiece that reawakens viewers and critics of all kinds what the really talented actors are capable of.<br/><br/>Lewis undergoes a complete transformation of character in TWBB, and his transition is flawless. For people who cannot appreciate true acting, you will probably find this movie boring. But, in my review, I must declare that PTA has made several masterpieces, which, in my list, include TWBB and Magnolia. There Will Be Blood will remain in my top 10 movies of all time for the rest of my life!"
"smcbrides","10","3","5","19 January 2010"," human greed goes as deep as the ocean
","There Will Be Blood might possibly be one of the greatest films ever made. Certainly stands in line with Shawshank,Citizen Kane,and all the other timeless American classics. The story of Daniel Plainview who at first is a silver and gold miner, but discovers oil, and from then on is like he is searching day and night for it. Things escalate when he meets a young man/priest Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, who in my opinion was perfect in this film)who wants him to drill on his fathers land but wants as much money as he can get from Plainview. The tension grows and the film dives very deep into the sanity, hatred, and greed of both Plainview and Sunday. That being said, There Will Be Blood shows all of us how much human greed can control our very lives, and how we can stray away from the most important things to us just to be rich. This film will shake some to the very core, leave others speechless, and others just angry because they think they could never get like this. In all reality though we are all capable of this. Some may say this film didn't make sense, others might think its too long, but to me it is a perfectly made movie with an amazing cast, awe inspiring cinematography, and a musical score that sends shivers up and down the spine, There Will Be Blood is without question my favorite film."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","3","5","21 December 2009"," He's still got it
","Has Anderson made a single bad film? This is the third picture of his that I watch(the other two being Boogie Nights and Magnolia), and he has yet to let me down. He continues to reject commercialism and the mainstream approach, and now brings us a story set during the oil boom in California, with a clash between greed and religion. The long takes and ambiguity is still present in his work, and he certainly isn't holding back on his vision, either; at no point in this does he shy away from the ills of the period. There is a tremendous level of detail to the depiction of the drilling, the machines, etc. This is immensely realistic, and partially because of that, it can be rather unpleasant at times. The plot is interesting from start to finish, and this has good pacing. Every role is well-cast, and the acting is flawless; they all disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. If I hadn't known it was Daniel Day-Lewis, I would not have been able to tell from my viewing. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This is astonishingly well-shot. The music is mostly classical pieces, and it fits beautifully. There is some brutal violence, a bit of disturbing content, and very brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD holds a well-done fifteen minute featurette of sorts, or, in its own words, ""pics, research, etc."". I recommend this to anyone who is not dissuaded by anything I have written in this review. 10/10"
"gainestillinger","10","3","5","1 November 2009"," A sinister allegory.
","With an opening score that could have been used for any of the really scary bits in Kubrick's The Shining, this film is in many ways just as terrifying. Although not written as a horror film, the terrible things that we humans do for power and gain are on display for all to see in this allegorical tale of how capitalism spread across America like some kind of slick plague.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector in the early twentieth century who has a very plain view indeed of how the world should be. He sees America as one big lake of oil and himself as a very elite fisherman. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants, which is essentially to gain until there is nothing left to gain. He is greed personified with a voice so unearthly that you may believe that he is some kind of capitalist deity. He is human, however, and a father. His fathering skills are focused entirely on training his son to be like him; that is until his son is deafened in a freak accident. Then the world is not so simple. Then he can only do what he does best: put out of sight and mind that which stands in his way between getting and not getting.<br/><br/>Plainview's nemesis and counterpoint in this film is at the centre of the community that he is trying to rape of its black and precious natural resource, a small town preacher Eli Sunday (played by the excellent Paul Dano). Sunday is the mouthpiece for the town and the only one ready to ask Plainview difficult questions. He is the white purity to Plainview's black soul and these two very big characters come to extraordinary blows metaphorically and physically. Plainview baptises Sunday after being asked for the payment he agreed to drill the land with a gigantic fat-cat-slap-around-session where he rubs Sunday's face in the soil that, interestingly, they are both in some way slaves to. This is reciprocated when Plainview seeks redemption through an actual baptism in Sunday's church (for purely selfish reasons) and is slapped around whilst having water poured on his head in the name of Jesus. Through this conflict we see two very powerful symbols of religion and capitalism at a crisis point and it is very much about who is going to blink first. Will Plainview see the light or will Sunday see just how shiny oil can be? I loved this film. The actors are tremendous and play their parts as if this is the last film to ever be made on this subject. Thomas Anderson's direction is masterful - he may only make a film every decade, as it seems does Day-Lewis, but by Jove does he make it count. It is a rare thing that you can stop a film practically anywhere and have a picture worth framing on your screen. Although, the most memorable aspect of this movie for me, again, was the soundtrack. It is just so eery. Something terrible is coming and you know it in the first two seconds of the film; it sets you on edge like few other films can. Marvellous."
"m_namie","10","3","5","5 August 2009"," A film for the ages
","Granted, this film is not the greatest of all time for most, myself being one of the exceptions for this is my favorite film of all time. Opinions aside, this is a film that should be recognized in the highest regard when it comes to the technicality that went into its making for the attentions to detail are absolutely mind-blowing.<br/><br/>The Good: Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Godly cinematography, wondrous editing, beautifully written script, a score that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The Bad: Not a very entertaining film, emotionally exhausting, drawn-out, a very boring film for those wishing to be entertained, stylistic film-making may be difficult for people to really admire unless they are willing to look into the film rather than the narrative of it.<br/><br/>This is a warning to any people who still haven't seen this film, watch it with caution because there are not that many entertaining aspects of this film that will really draw you into it aside from certain parts with very dark humor, among a couple of scenes where Daniel Day-Lewis truly shows his acting chops by putting on the performance of his career.<br/><br/>For those who have even the slightest background in analyzing films, or even have the will to look past the narrative, this is a must-see for any of you. The cinematography in this film is to absolutely die for. Robert Elswit truly deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography because of his use of long-takes, panning shots, darkness and composition. On the acting front, Daniel Day-Lewis is truly phenomenal. The way he plays out his character, Daniel Plainview, a greed-possessed oil prospector at the turn of the century who is seeking to make a fortune in the oil industry, is unlike any other role I've ever seen before. The only role I can think of, which comes close to his caliber and depth into the mind of a composed psychopath is the late Heath Ledger's role as The Joker in the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Day Lewis' role is an inspiration for actors everywhere, giving a superb performance and allowing them, as well as the audience an incredible insight into how far an actor/actress can push him/herself to create a character that doesn't simply exceed the role, but is in fact the creation of a complete body-mask that is so flawless, they could almost fool viewers into believing that this is how they truly are in their every day lives. His interpretation of Plainview brought the character to life and made the film seem as if it was a biographical documentary rather than a film based off of a fictional novel.<br/><br/>What is more on the acting front is the incredibly done supporting role as Eli Sunday by Paul Dano. His role as an up-and-coming priest of his own church, known as the Third Revalation is done well in sync with Day-Lewis' role. As far as the supporting role goes, he did a spot-on job in portraying a pious human being masking his own greed with religion, and thus, through his own methods, does his best to scam Plainview into giving him money for his church. The chemistry between Dano and Day-Lewis in this film is another example that actors should follow when it comes to creating a film with an other-worldly tension between two characters.<br/><br/>The last aspect to really touch upon because of how noticeable it is would be the score of the movie. For about half of the film, by an estimate, there is no score except for the truly climactic parts of the film that send the intensity of those scenes to a whole other level. In this writer's opinion, it is worthy of an Oscar nomination, at least. But, such will be Hollywood for it is far too unique to be compared along the lines with the orchestration of John Williams or the subtle, magical quality of Thomas Newman.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this film to be an incomparable experience that pushed me head-first into a world rich with oil, competition, betrayal, deceit and, as the film's name promises, blood. The name can be very misleading because it lets the people assume that there will be possibilities of gore or scenes of violent murder and such, which really isn't the case in this movie. There Will Be Blood is a film about an oil prospector fighting tooth-and-nail, stepping on whoever he has to in order to achieve his goal, while at the same time it is fictionally biographical, thanks to Day-Lewis' acting caliber, because it follows a single character around, briefly taking the focus away from him at times, as he goes through whatever he has to do to achieve his success.<br/><br/>The Ratings 10 out of 10 for film analysts 5 out of 10 for average film-goers over 18 2, 1, probably even 0 out of 10 for film-goers under 14 And finally, an incredibly biased 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 out of 10 for me because I loved this movie so flipping' much.<br/><br/>'Til next time, keep watching movies, my fellow movie lovers!! :)<br/><br/>Cyrus out!"
"erod2000","10","3","5","3 August 2009"," A modern classic.
","Simply said, ""..Blood"" is a modern classic. One of the top movies of all time. Day-Lewis is absolutely spectacular. One of the most memorable and entertaining performances by an actor you will ever see on screen. And Dano delivers a breakthrough performance that should've gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Both actors display an amazing chemistry in the baptismal scene and the final climactic bowling alley scene in particular.<br/><br/>Coming from a Kubrick fan, ""..Blood"" has all the makings of a Kubrick-like film. Stanley would be proud. No dialogue in the first 10-15 minutes of the movie, but it sets the groundwork and tone for the movie, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the well-placed eerie background tones, reminiscent of The Shining. The moving camera shots, time period costuming, and the lighting, for instance in the church, reminiscent of Barry Lyndon. This movie didn't win a cinematography Oscar for nothing. The close up on Day-Lewis' face covered in oil and sweat showing the madness in his eyes, as well as the bashing with the bowling pin in the final scene, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange. And the ending that cuts to black and into a great classical music score, reminiscent of Eyes Wide Shut. This film cements PTA as a great director. I never thought we'd see another director like Kubrick, but in this film, PTA comes pretty damn close.<br/><br/>Superior acting performances, great directing, beautiful camera work, and a compelling screenplay. This one's got it all."
"Reef-Shark","10","3","5","2 April 2009"," The most awe inspiring, thought provoking film I've ever seen
","What is the defining aspect of P.W. Anderson's There Will Be Blood that kept me so captivated throughout its running time that fell just under three hours? I think it's probably a good many things. There's the beautiful, Oscar winning cinematography, there's the driving message of greed and corruption in society, there's the Kubrickian styled direction, and of course there's some of the best acting performances of the year, but only one stands out to draw me into this film. The character of Daniel Plainview (Oscar winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis) is perhaps the most complex character ever captured on film and is one with whom I found myself strangely attracted to, for I saw something about his character worth pitying.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is a cut throat business man during the industrial revolution (an ""Oil man,"" he calls himself) who uses a persuasive speaking voice and enticing promises, but at the end of the day he only is wishing to fulfill his everlasting greed. Eventually he is lead by the tip of one Paul Sunday who tells him of oil in a far off location known as Little Boston. Plainview takes the bait and moves in and realizes that this could be his big haul that makes his fortune, but in the process he meets his greatest adversary. Eli Sunday (a very underrated performance by Paul Dano) owns and operates his own church (The Church of the Third Revelation) where he claims to act as a prophet and the embodiment of the Holy Spirit. Naturally the two of them clash as the audience realizes they are both driven by mostly selfish desires.<br/><br/>As Daniel's fortune increases his hatred towards himself and mankind expands, and he realizes that all he wishes is to be far from it, but it is apparent he has become incapable of being happy. His son, H.W. Plainview seemed to be his only way to happiness, but Daniel in his denial just push H.W. and everyone around him far to the side, preferring to suffer miserably by himself until he completes his long drawn out self-destruction.<br/><br/>This is why I pity Daniel Plainview when others say he is a character that deserves our loathing. What they are failing to grasp is the inner struggle taking place in this man and how very confused he must be, because they only seem to note the negative things he does in the film. Daniel Plainview is a man who has let the natural desire to compete absorbs him and he has given up the fight to suppress it.<br/><br/>Is Daniel Plainview a man, or is he the representation of a spirit that is found throughout mankind? Each time I see this movie the impact increases. Every single time I watch this two-hour forty-minute film I find more reasons to be in love with it. Each time I find more ways that Daniel Plainview can be related to the human race as a whole.<br/><br/>""I don't want to talk about those things. I see the worst in people, Henry. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little. Having you here gives me a second breath I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people. {Daniel laughs as if his final comment were a joke}"" ""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."" I think everyone occasionally has thoughts such as those stated in the above quotes. We just don't act on them in the manner in which Plainview does. The problem with Daniel is that he never lets go of the feelings and lets them push him forward rather than think to the back of his mind.<br/><br/>This movie deserved Best Picture and Director for 2007 because of the fact that I have never seen a more stunning, magnificent illustration of human greed and corruption. There Will Be Blood is a movie that will be seen twenty-years from now and like Apocalypse Now people will believe that the Academy made the wrong choice in regards to choosing their Best Picture winner (like anyone REALLY cares what the Academy has to say now of days). I think everyone will need to see this film at some point or another or they will have missed one of the most important films of the 21st century, and that is just a fact, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Just you watch. Ten years from now this film will be taught in film classes and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance shall undoubtedly be used as a subject of study in drama classes for aspiring actors and actresses."
"axismladen","10","3","5","17 January 2009"," A masterpiece that's not made for everyone!
","As i already wrote on my The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford title,this is an artistic movie.It's a movie that radiates with perfection and life.When you watch it look more carefully and you will see that it's a very realistic movie.It's Like Jesse James,a psychological movie that studies a mental condition of the certain person or person's under the different term's of life.For example through the movie you can clearly see how he slowly start's to be more and more greedy and what kind of pathetic meat sack he really is which you definitely couldn't see in the first hour or fourthy five minutes of the film.And that's what i think that's very,very skilled made in this film because at my opinion one of the hardest thing's in screenplay writing and directing is character development!...Which is perfectly made in this movie.In the first hour of the movie Daniel Day Lewis or Daniel Plainview look's like the most carrying father and the most decent person that tries to make it in oil business so he could give his son a great life.However as you watch the movie you start to notice that it's nothing but an illusion.Or better yet that it's a lie.The first time it get's obvious that he is a moron is when his son get's deaf an he gives him alcohol so he shouldn't watch over him.I mean what kind of a person you need to be to get your son drunk just so you could get him off your back.<br/><br/>I wont write anything else of the character development in this film because no matter how many thing's i write about it,it wont really matter because you have to see it your self.However i must say a few more thing's about acting.This movie is one of the best acted movies ever.Not only by Daniel Day Lewis who gave one of the best performances ever in this film but also about Paul Dano who was surprisingly worth of at least being nominated.In this movie he proves how stupid the Oscar's can be.He definitely deserves at least a nomination.He was brilliant as a frustrated,fanatical,lying and sick priest who believes to be a prophet.The relationship between his character and Daniel Day's character is best to be described as a fuel that wait's on that one spark to light it up.The tension's between the two of them are followed through the entire film.An the best part about it is that they are both the same greedy and sick kind of men.Actually on the second thought Paul Dano's character is worse because Daniel Day's character at least never said for him self that he's not what he is.<br/><br/>Another thing that's great in this movie is directing and the story it self.The story get's incredibly good at the very ending of the movie because then all the thing's come together and because then you actually see what's the movie about.I'm not saying that the story isn't good through the entire movie but that the ending is the best part of it.The directing is also great because it gave the artistic and realistic atmosphere to the movie.It's not directed on a usual way so everyone could look the movie and enjoy because a lot of people will think it's a very boarding movie but on the way so a certain people as my self could watch it and exam,with satisfaction the art of film making.<br/><br/>There is nothing more to say about this movie but that you should watch it carefully with patience and see that it's a great movie worth of a few more Oscar's.At least at my opinion.But as i already said it's not made for everyone even though i personally think that it's a masterpiece.Enjoy!"

","""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."" - Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), THERE WILL BE BLOOD.<br/><br/>In the words of Jack's Joker, ""I like him already."" Yet I fear him like I've feared no other man. Speaking of Jokers, Daniel Day-Lewis is probably the only person on Earth who could replace Heath Ledger in a sequel to THE DARK KNIGHT and still scare the makeup off our pants.<br/><br/>In THERE WILL BE BLOOD, as in many of his films, Day-Lewis is once again the char-blackened engine and screaming lifeblood of the movie. Without him, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's tale of a ruthless oil baron would simply be a very good movie, rather than a steel-toed boot to the groin and a good cry on the shoulder of a wild west hooker.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar 2007 for this role as Daniel Plainview, a hardworking prospector who exploits the turn-of-the-century American oil rush by buying drilling lands from uninformed homesteaders, convincing them of his good intent for their properties with a charm and duplicity like the talking snake from the King James bible, ultimately elevating himself to power so absolute that it not only teetered on the edge of madness, but dove in and sensuously rubbed madness all over its thrumming willy.<br/><br/>A brutal accident kills one of Plainview's oil-hands, who leaves a baby, which Plainview informally adopts as his own, calling him H.W. At first we believe this shows a tender, humane side of the monstrous Plainview, but we soon realize H.W. is merely a strategic prop for Plainview's pitches to land-owners, to lull them into believing a doted-upon son signifies Plainview is a ""nice family man."" Which is farther from truth than the King James bible is from reality. When an oil-rig explosion deafens H.W., Plainview spends the whole night kneeling before the shattered rig, before visiting his son and discovering his deafness.<br/><br/>From a novel by Upton Sinclair, with a soundtrack that threatens to beat you senseless (by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood), THERE WILL BE BLOOD is not concerned with the macro historical significance of the oil rush, only with this one amoral, irreligious sociopath whose veins flowed with the viscous black lubricant of the land, intent on keeping humanity at a distance - he never takes a wife, sends his adoptive son to a home, and a long-lost brother proves fake - to the extent that he will ultimately forget what made him strive so hard to amass a fortune he would never have the capacity to enjoy.<br/><br/>Paul Dano plays Eli Sunday, who also sees potential in the untamed wild land and takes advantage of the simpleminded folk - but in a diametrically opposite manner to Plainview - as an evangelist. In any other movie, his flamboyant, frenetic performance would have gobbled scenery more than Matthew McConaughey in REIGN OF FIRE, and stolen the show. But there is no overshadowing Daniel Day-Lewis and his scary mustache.<br/><br/>Not averse to faking remorse in order to secure the contract for a piece of land, Plainview ""confesses"" publicly at Eli's church, to handing over H.W. to a tutor, sending him off to the city for want of patience in raising the deaf lad. Eli badgers Plainview into screaming ""I've abandoned my boy!"" Later, Eli is bitchslapped by Plainview for his troubles. By movie's end, Plainview has forced Eli into ""confessing"" himself that he is a false prophet and that God is a superstition - on the proviso that upon his recant, Plainview would buy land from Eli and save him from bankruptcy. One of the movie's best scenes, illustrating the shallowness of the Christian ""faith"" when poverty scratches at the door.<br/><br/>Some may say Plainview's ""descent into madness"" was foreseen, but he was already there at the start of this tale; movie opens by showing us his formidable resolve to power, as he breaks his leg falling down a mine, then claws his way out to strike black gold. His soaring dollar value only heightened his ambivalence towards humanity - if that is called madness, I wanna be in that straightjacket. ""I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."" Plainview wielded unlimited power as flippantly as any man with inherent power who knows how to bend people to his will. In this story's telling, that characteristic proves to be his downfall. But we don't see his undoing unfold as - <br/><br/>An unresolved sudden ending snaps our necks, and we wonder how to stand and exit graciously while kneeling in awe at the altar of Daniel Day-Lewis."
"jzappa","10","3","5","18 July 2008"," Greed Comes at the Price of One's Soul
","Daniel Day-Lewis has always been fascinating to me. He's an extraordinary actor who I believe I saw for the first time when I saw Gangs of New York, in which he was one of the most lovable villains I'd seen up till that time. But with each role I've seen him play, he has an entirely different presence. For instance, he seems like a totally different person in every way when he's shaven as opposed to mustachioed. Despite Day-Lewis's intriguing stiffness and Minotaur-like density, he is capable of inordinate transformation to the point of complete contradiction. In There Will Be Blood, his physical inhabitance of Daniel Plainview, accompanied by a brilliantly realized sandpaper voice, is a lurching cartoon villain of opaqueness, impossible to probe. Day-Lewis's portrayal is so deeply subjective that the innate content of Plainview asserts itself thoroughly over form.<br/><br/>A rivalry is sparked between secularist rags-to-riches oil magnate Plainview and ambitious young priest Eli Sunday, played powerfully by Paul Dano, as Plainview, feeling secure in his dissociative feelings, sees himself reflected in Eli's anti-social greed. Plainview's son is the only person he trusts amidst all of his shrewd manipulations and pragmatism, but when his son goes deaf after an oil rig incident, they estrange and his trust becomes totally displaced and his soul is eclipsed, and the world dances around these inert, degenerate people until, well, they are ""finished.""<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson, all of whose films so far have become favorites of mine, has succeeded in setting a new bar in cinema, having bewilderingly gotten away clean with an incredible amount of risks with this shifty, cynical, mystifying masterpiece. Like Day-Lewis playing Daniel Plainview, he has plunged into a solitary subjectivity that has removed him from the influences of mainstream convention. It's an unremitting film, relentless to be completely itself. One of the less subtle examples would be Jonny Greenwood's atonal and dissonant music score.<br/><br/>A key scene in this movie is the first sermon given by Eli Sunday. It is a perfectly directed and acted scene. Eli proceeds to make an extreme fool out of himself, with total confidence. What he says and does are all completely ridiculous, often contradicting himself or failing to make any sense, and no matter how far Dano goes, Anderson's tone remains undisturbedly cynical. Just as he did with the documentary interviews in Boogie Nights, we aren't put off by the self-indulgent idiocy of his characters; in fact we laugh a bit without losing touch with the film's current.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is the fascinating sort of film out of which you stumble, distraughtly rummaging for an adjective or neighborhood of feeling that are both vivid and explanatory enough to cover all corners of your experience and individually characteristic enough to identify your mind, which is routinely on a different wavelength that this movie. It's an indictment of the sociopathic institutions of industry and organized religion. It's a character study. It's a clash of egos. It's an impression of a time. It's a detailed account of a time.<br/><br/>This is a film movie buffs will analyze, debate, and rewatch endlessly. Now of course the snobs will retort with claims that each other does not understand the context and meaning and this and that, but the important thing to do with this film is wash away all that you hear from pretentious pseudointellectuals and let the film effect you on your own terms.<br/><br/>It can hardly be argued that there was most certainly kismet involved in the overlapping productions of There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men, two films released recently very close together, having been shot in the same West Texas locations and at times getting in each other's way."

","I believe this is reminiscent of The Emporer's New Clothes. There is so much Oscar talk that to say you hated the movie would be tantamount to showing how much sophistication you lack because you didn't ""get"" it.<br/><br/>Long and slow is not necessarily a bad thing except when there is no point whatsoever.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no redeeming quality in the Daniel Day-Lewis character, which again is fine. There are plenty of hateful characters in the movies that we still love to watch. But this character is just plain angry, hateful, cheats and disrespects pretty much everyone he comes in contact with. There is no rhyme nor reason to this character's anger and hatred of mankind. You get no insight into what fostered all this animosity.<br/><br/>The story goes absolutely no where and the ending left pretty much everyone in the theater going.. ""Huh"".

","I haven't seen any convincing explanation for the accolades given this film. That is not to say that Day-Lewis' acting is not deserving of enthusiasm, but acting does not make a film.<br/><br/>The film is a character study of paranoid personality disorder and greed. I see little else beyond that. I sense PTA was trying to tell me something about men, their relationships to each other, brothers and sons, but what it is I defy you to tell me, let alone what is so profound about it. A man who is given no love has no love to give? I think Citizen Kane took that one and ran it to it's end. In fact, Plainview is pretty much the same as Kane, if slightly more violent (though, remember, Kane too releases his violence when he feels betrayed). They both pretend to be champions of the people, but are incapable of caring enough to deliver true love or caring, only the material scraps from their barreling capitalist enterprises.<br/><br/>The religious charlatanism angle is vapid and translucent from the start, not to mention trite. The lighting is above par and the burning oil derrick scene is visually stunning. It is an entertaining movie until the end, which appears as if it were written by some college student high on pot. There are definitely at least two clear 2001 homages, which is cool. But if a film is not stunning in every other regard than story, which this film is not, than it cannot be great. It lacks this critical redeeming quality."

","I would like start by saying the only good part (if you can say that) of this movie was the acting of Daniel Day Lewis. As I sat there with the credits rolling, I asked myself, ""Will I ever get this 2.5 hrs of my life back?"" How can this movie ever be considered for the top 250 movies of all time? Throughout the viewing it leaves you wanting...wanting some sort of...anything. When I think back, besides Daniel, I think maybe 2 pages of script was read. WHY? Why did I ever listen to my friend who recommended this? Why was was this movies in theaters? Why was this not first released to DVD? Why did I not ask for a refund? Why do I feel the need to drink after leaving this film? If you believe one comment on this site, believe this one!!! Overall, acting by Daniel Day Lewis great...the rest of the movie terrible!"

","Two hours of bleached-out austerity followed by twenty minutes of expressionist lunacy. A man driven to succeed by his hatred and contempt for humanity has occasionally figured in literature (e.g., Absalom, Absalom!), but not very often in film. Unfortunately, the director drains the juices from his story with his bone-white palette, his tamped-down emotions and his penchant for shooting dramatic scenes in long shot (Man as a tiny figure against a harsh and unyielding landscape, etc.). Daniel Day-Lewis has little more than a dry, rasping authority, while Paul Dano is simply bad as a revivalist preacher and his brother, a piece of dual casting that makes for enormous confusion. Near the end, the film veers to the other extreme, with Day-Lewis acting in a florid, hambone manner that makes one blush. It takes a long long time for this bloodless film to get some color, and when it finally does, you may wish it hadn't."

","If you feel like spending the next 2+ hours watching a painfully slow, extremely dark, sad film about dysfunctional people, and then it turns worse...then I highly recommend this movie! The acting is surely very good, photography is somewhat nice. The story itself is very dark and unappealing but that isn't the biggest problem with this movie, but the speed. The speed it is presented with is just painfully slow, directing and editing seem to have completely failed their job here and I find myself regretting wasting over 2 hours of my life watching this movie. Its almost like it wasn't enough to show a movie about a sad, miserably life and people living it without empathy and feelings, but they also wanted to very very slowly drag me down into their hell and nope I just don't appreciate their effort at all."

","I kept waiting for this film to draw me into the story, to make me feel something! Day-Lewis' interchange with the preacher during the final scene & to a lesser extent during his 'confession' of his sins in the church seemed to me like something out of a bad Monty Python sketch. The man who see's the worst in people and has a rage in him just simmering below the surface always threatening to overflow, lacked the physical presence in him or the cool articulate menace that he brought to his butcher character in G O NY to make me fear him or what he could do. I like to root for Daniel Day-Lewis and the characters he portrays in film, Last of the Moahicans & Crucible come to mind. This character was contemptible in every respect, except his uncompromising, unscrupulous lust for money & power. I guess that was the point, I dunno. From the early scenes he appeared to be a caring family man, I do not fully understand how he came to think so ill of the boy he was raising after the accident deprived him of his hearing. ""This picture is a very accurate depiction of the oil refining business of the time"" So What? I'm here to watch a film, to be entertained!, if I want to find out all about oil I'll watch a discovery channel special or hire a book at the local library!

","I'm glad to see that after the initial hype surrounding this movie died down, the reviews have become (somewhat) more reasonable. Initially I had such great hopes when entering the theater. None of them were met. I can't fathom why it sparked such raving reviews in its time, and why people allowed themselves to be led by them. I gather that the average movie-viewer is so starved for actual content that they willingly bought into the hype and mistook this to be a quality production of SUBSTANCE, no questions asked. Or maybe they just like to be led. Because frankly, when held up to the light, this movie just falls apart. There are plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon and the character development isn't handled well. I found it hard to dig out any empathy for these characters at all. And I did try. As for the story itself; it endeavours, I assume, to make a profound statement about the essence of greed and what it does to humanity. Suffice it to say; this topic has been handled much better in other movies<br/><br/>It isn't all bad. The production values aren't at fault. The movie certainly looks pretty. The cinematography is awesome. Daniel Day-Lewis can lift even the most mediocre of scripts into something worthwhile. The use of Arvo Pärt's ""Fratres"" accompanies one of the movie's few memorable scenes. Greenwood's soundtrack makes me want to kill kittens. <br/><br/>While the movie has its positive aspects, they don't outweigh the bad ones. The movie tries too hard to be profound, and subsequently it ends up being pretentious and melodramatic. It only scratches the surface of the themes it thinks it addresses; and it doesn't hold much substance at all. It's a shallow, superficial affair that attempts to bite off more than it can chew. <br/><br/>With the right team at the helm, this could have been a great movie. It isn't. Comparing the last scene to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (which I've seen some reviewers do) is plain sacrilege. It doesn't have anywhere near the same impact to that of Stanley Kubrick's brilliant satire. I partly chalk this up to Paul Dano's unconvincing performance as the cartoonish preacher Eli. <br/><br/>In summing, I'm not trying to discourage anybody from watching the movie. Watch it - but do so with an open mind, and try to make up your own conclusions. In essence, don't believe the hype."

Maybe there is only so much you can tell when you forgo explanation, when every motive is ambiguous, when events unfold with the unpredictability and unknowability of life itself. Maybe there is a limit to what you can show without telling. Or maybe, ""There Will Be Blood"" just failed at showing what it needed to tell.<br/><br/>The first part of the film shows a tough, bitter oil man seeking his fortune in an isolated backwater town. It is suggested that he exploits his son and the community in his quest for oil, but we also see him care for his son and the community appears to prosper.<br/><br/>Prone to drink and a violent temper, he commits a few atrocious acts and then the movie jumps forward a number of years to show that he has become a monster. Then the film ends.<br/><br/>In between there is really no tension or dramatic conflict. While the main character is played evocatively, I couldn't tell you what his significance is, either historically, as a moral example, or for the surrounding cast. He is presented as a force of nature, without comment or context.<br/><br/>Which makes this film like watching plate tectonics.

A buildup of hatred towards the self made millionaire leads nowhere. There is absolutely no payoff for the audience, and after enduring the overlong film, there is a severe letdown with the ending. Those who tout the Oscar performance and fine photography are deluding themselves into thinking there is more here than there actually is.

His intricate and perfect blend of psychosis, love for his craft and ultimate moral demise elegantly played out like a symphonic masterpiece. Other supporting characters are also very well played, Paul Dano in my opinion brings an annoying and prepubescent demeanor to the character that makes him as despicable as Plainview, you would expect from a con man to hide under a sheath of ignorance and simplicity just as he does in this role. The intermingling and corruption of money and religion has a very meaningful undertone in our time. This film depicts money and power as a driving force for innovation and growth as well as moral turpitude and corruption in society's gamma of classes even in the religious class. The director made it clear that no one is free from struggle, vice and ambition. Some people are just more determined and perceptive at getting what they want. In our time this is incredibly relevant, so much so that the internal struggle you feel when you watch this makes you feel like the struggle to be powerful and be wealthy is a futile one."

","There Will Be Blood is a very unusual film, be it the first thirty minutes with not a word spoken, or the twisted corruption of an oil man. This movie is less a popcorn movie and more an artistic piece of work that seems to express much more than you had first braced yourself for. My friends and fellow critics, this is a work of art.<br/><br/>The beautiful cinematography is just one of the many feats this film has. Others include the amazing acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano (Paul is absolutely frightening) to the intensity and language the script brings to the characters.<br/><br/>This isn't going to be an easy film to sit through. This film is a journey into one man's soul, and watch it decay from the inside. Greed is the main subject for this film, and it expresses it with perfection.<br/><br/>The name is a bit of a misnomer. There isn't much blood in this film. As a matter of fact, the film is a PG rating in Canada, so don't expect to see a graphically violent film.<br/><br/>As I said before, the cinematography is beautiful. You'll hold your breath at the sight of 50 men running toward inflamed oil spurting out of the pump and into the air, making mid-day look like deep, moon-less night. This scene is just one of many.<br/><br/>This was a very good contender for Best Pic. Only the masterpiece that is No Country for Old Men could have beaten this brutal, and yet poetic film about Greed, Hate, and self-destruction.<br/><br/>Rating: **** (of 4)<br/><br/>Entertainment: ***** (of 5)"

","I really enjoyed this movie. It has a classical feel to it. If you need not stop action to keep your interest, I would not recommend it, but I would say the action level is comparable to an old western. Daniel Day Lewis is an amazing actor. He is a throughly convincing actor in every role I've seen in him. I think the movie leaves some room for the viewer to decide how evil Daniel really is. He does seem to be mostly working towards his own benefit, but he does help out the local community. It can be said though, that he is not a religious man and has one heck of temper.<br/><br/>The black gold mentality makes for an interesting movie. Everyone seems wise of the fortune to be had for those who can put in the work. It causes greed and anger in some of the least likely characters. The movie allows people to get a deep understanding of many of the characters, to the point where at the end, characters actions, are no longer surprising. This isn't to say that the plot is predictable, but that the characters are so well developed, that reactions to circumstances seem genuine."

","Wow fantastic movie and an amazing acting job by Daniel Day Lewis. I read many reviews about this movie after watching it that describes Daniel Plainsview as uncaring, or dark hearted. I would say more that he has poor people skills. that he doesn't feel comfortable around people, the lack of understanding he gets from his attempts at communication makes him say he dislikes people. But really he loves his son, and is proud of him. He gets along fine with his business partner, but when things don't go his way he strikes back viciously, as we see numerous times. always too far and too extreme for the circumstances but a result of the poor people skills not hatred.<br/><br/>Interesting soundtrack... according to one interview with the director he compared the movie to a horror movie... and if I'm not mistaken this seems to be the soundtrack or a very close approximation from the Shining.<br/><br/>Amazing movie one that will stick with me for a long time.

","I don't think I've ever seen a movie like ""There Will Be Blood"". It takes time for the greatness of this film to sink in and happens upon reflection, but it truly is a great film.<br/><br/>Directly after viewing the film, I felt it was overrated. But not anymore.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is pretty much a movie about a determined oil man who sets up a well in Little Boston, but others want him to share the wealth, and he gets greedy. And yes, there is blood.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime here, playing a generally nice man who is being driven insane by the greedy people around him, and his own greed and lust for success begins to overtake him. Paul Dano plays opposite him, an equally greedy religious boy who feels that he is a chosen vessel of the Lord, and feels that he deserves what he desires. And of course, he wants money for Daniel Plainview's success, and uses his religion as a vehicle for money and revenge. There aren't too many other important characters aside from H.W. Plainview, the son of Daniel, and Henry Plainview, the man who appears to Daniel eighty minutes into the movie and reveals to him that they are brothers (or are they?).<br/><br/>Every performance hits you like a bombshell. None of the characters, with the exception of H.W., are even remotely likable, and they don't have redeeming qualities. It's a bitter movie to take in because of all the selfish people involved, but its a classic one. Each actor does a very good job with the exception of Daniel Day Lewis, who does a great job.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie establishes Daniel Plainview's time in Little Boston, drilling oil, and focuses mainly on oil, until a terrible oil accident. The second half focuses on his transformation from a business-driven man to a man gone mad by greed, resulting in a climatic conclusion. The final scene, in my opinion, is one of the greatest put to screen. The actors, characters, and script all work together beautifully, like an elegant but gloomy dance.<br/><br/>The only thing that doesn't fit into the rest, is the music. It only goes with some of the parts, but the music is really wacky in some parts and sticks out like a sore thumb, degrading some of the scenes a little.<br/><br/>This might be a hard film to take in because of its somewhat slow-moving, oil-based first half, then dark and disturbing, quicker-paced second half. With the exception of the music, the movie is flawless. Every line is delivered with significance and conviction, and all in all, this film should leave you breathless. I really hope its remembered with the old classics, because it boasts of their impact. Don't miss this. It's a film that sometime in a life, everyone should see, and it should be remembered forever. 9.5/10."

","I got this movie for my birthday and finally got around to watching it (as it was 2 1/2 hours long), and I must say, Daniel Day Lewis gets my vote for damn fine actor. It was a little slow, and if you were expecting a big showdown or something you'll be disappointed. It really was well written, and I have to say all of the acting was spot-on. The actor who played Eli did a great job of portraying a very eccentric preacher. And the entire movie had me spell bound as I knew next to nothing about oil drilling except what I've seen in movies like Hellfighters. I had no idea what kind of dangers lie in such a business, and not to mention the madness that ensues from being an ""oil man."" Since I heard it was based on Oil! by Upton Sinclair I knew it was going to be a bit crazy- and after seeing this movie I immediately thought I should read that book. This film is not for the young or those who don't understand strange twisty plots, as at times it gets hard to follow, and although few and far between the violent scenes can get somewhat gruesome. Overall a great movie, but not like the usual stuff that seeps out of Hollywood."

","I feel bad that I wasn't able to see much of the great films of 07 in theaters because in the hindsight it was an extraordinary year for movie goers. Last year's Oscar race really was a battle of the giants and There Will be Blood was one of the masterpieces up for the gold that year. Like the eventual winner ""No Country for Old Men"" There Will be Blood is a tale dealing with the evil side of the soul but Daniel Plainview's evil is driven by his ambition, which really blinds us all.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is something else, every role he performs he excels with. I've been a great fan of his work for sometime and it's all ways a treat when we see him in a picture. He chooses his projects well and some say he only really excels at playing villains or twisted men, but to say this about Daniel Plainview is a wrong assessment. Daniel Plainview isn't evil in the ordinary way and Paul Thomas Anderson wrote him in a way that rings extremely true to his Sinclair origins. He is driven to madness by his pursuit of the black gold. We wonder if Plainview really does love his adopted son H.W or did he really believe for all those years that he was a ""bastard in the basket"". The answer is never clear but that adds to why this character is so engaging. There Will be Blood is a brilliant character study on greed, and it will inevitably be compared to the granddaddy of them all, Citizen Kane. The comparison may be a bit much but certainly both characters were men who cared more about having their name in the light rather than the lives around them. There may be some redeeming sides to Plainview, he opens his arms to an obvious conman claiming to be his brother played by Kevin J' O Conor. In a scene that is truly spell binding, Plainview lets out his heart and soul to this man and tells him what really drives him. O'Conor doesn't know what to think of it and is somewhat taken a ghast just like the audience but I was taken a ghast by the intelligent writing and the intelligent actor who poured his heart and soul into that monologue.<br/><br/>Anderson really deserves a great deal of credit for this picture. It is completely unlike any of his other works. The world of There Will be Blood is cold and distance from any glimpses of the real world. Anderson creates a great setting, he makes this Little Boston seem like a hell closing in on Plainview, and when we leave the town and enter the mansion it becomes a Xandau too big for one mans ambition.<br/><br/>Ambition doesn't only affect Plainview, it effects Eli Sunday who aspires to be an evangelical preacher. We know Sunday is very much like Plainview, I imagine he doesn't care much about spreading the word of the Lord but rather more so about having a congregation in front of him absorbing his every word. Sunday bothers Plainview for money to the point were the two make it their goal to undo the other, Plainview eventually wins in one of the most brutal scenes in film.<br/><br/>There Will be Blood is a must see"

The cinematography, writing, scripting, directing, scoring and acting blend the story of a lust for power into a cinematic masterpiece. Daniel Day Lewis has no rivals. He is the ultimate actor. The supporting cast proves they can hold the screen with DDL, even if he does steal every scene in which he appears. The beginning of the film offers such a different feel than most films shot today. It's quite refreshing. A film everyone should see, just to say they've seen it. Even if you end up hating it. (Seems the reviews are split on this one.)

Although it is over two and a half hours long, it is worth it. Unlike the disappointing No Country for old men, Blood is not extremely and excessively violent although there is one particularly graphic scene. Daniel Day-Lewis is enticing in his role as Daniel Plainview. In possibly the best performance of the 21st century, he makes you feel for, or hate passionately, Plainview. After watching Blood, It will make you think for a very long time, about the themes and choices. There will be Blood is such a powerful film, this does not give it justice.

I went straight home from what was, alas, the last screening of this film state-wide, and hit the 'Net.

Let's hope it makes its' way onto the definitive DVD.<br/><br/>The mystery of Daniel Plainview is what drives him. In the beginning, it is his raw determination to wrest first silver and then oil from the bowels of the earth. This completely absorbs him in his early life, as depicted on the screen. He has no human connections other than his fellow prospectors, with whom he shares only the work, and the lucre. Then one of them is killed, and Plainview takes charge of the man's orphaned son. This is the beginning of Plainview's only real emotional relationship. But it also the beginning of a new phase in his life, as he becomes an entrepreneur, a con-man who uses his own adopted son as a shill to steal land from ignorant peasants.<br/><br/>Even as he came to hate the earth he conquered, Plainview begins to despise the people he cons. It is all too easy for him, this triumph of the will, first over the naked earth, and then over humanity itself. At this point, only God stands between Daniel Plainview and the fulfillment of his destiny, the final raw surge of power that will wrench out the very guts of his reality. God help anyone or anything that stands between Plainview and his destiny, if only for a moment.<br/><br/>His next turning point severs his connection to humanity entirely, as his adopted son is deafened by the explosion of an oil well. It is the Earth striking back at Plainview, and he is not up to the battle. He loses his son by failing to care for him. For all this, he blames God, or his minions on Earth. And now, like Lucifer, he will take them on. Like Cain, a la Citizen Kane, he kills his own brother. To cover up and profit from the crime, he does a devilish deal with the local false prophet, and wins his last great battle with Man and Earth. He completes his oil pipeline to the sea, standing like a demonic, greed-driven Moses overlooking the Promised Land. But it is all as ashes in his mouth.<br/><br/>He beat the Earth, he beat all mankind, but he could not beat God, in whom he does not even believe, despite his pretenses for business purposes. God's minions have humiliated him and forced him to crawl to them for his ultimate success. So it becomes an ultimate failure of the will, and his whole empire comes to mean nothing to him. Now it must end like a classic tragedy, with a Biblical doom. The madness that has always driven him to beat everything and everyone turns in upon itself, and Plainview destroys all he has worked for. He strikes out at the earth, at humanity, and at God, killing the false prophet who first took away his only son, and then humiliated him in his final moment of triumph. And now Plainview must face God's justice, to which the film leaves him.<br/><br/>This is not just the story of a man, but of all mankind. Those who pay attention will notice certain parallels to current events. The choice of oil as the means to power, and the cause of downfall, should bear especial meaning for Americans, today. We are all Daniel Plainview."
"vovazhd","9","4","8","11 April 2008"," Beautiful masterpiece centered on a dark personality
","There Will Be Blood is a riveting drama film centering on Daniel Plainview: an ambitious and egocentric oil prospector who develops a wealthy business by manipulating his competitors, employees, friends, and family. Three phases of his life are chronicled: his first oil deposit discovery, his consolidation of power by transforming a ranching community to a drilling field, and his personal struggles later in his life.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is one of the most profoundly complex characters in film. There is ample truth in his character: selfishness, greediness, and ambition are traits that we are all familiar with. His character might be expected to be one dimensional from these traits, but this is not the case. Occasionally, we might sense remorse or sympathy from him (for example, when he holds the son from a killed worker), but it always turns out to be based on a selfish goal. The essence of his beliefs is summarized in an enticing dialog midway through the film, where he states that ""I see the worst in people"". Despite his unrelenting flaws, it is impossible not to pity him. Daniel Day-Lewis does a phenomenal performance as Plainview, which will certainly be remembered as one of his career highlights.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are also well acted (although they don't stand out as much as Day-Lewis). Paul Dano does an interesting take as the preacher Eli, who serves as one of Plainview's opponents. Plainview and Eli parallel an industry versus religion struggle, which adds an important element to the film's main theme.<br/><br/>Another strong point of the film was the music. There is no powerful theme or melody. Instead, it consists of disjointed and convoluted sounds. Occasionally, the tone of a melody may be heard, but its rather unconventional. I liked this type of music and felt that matched perfectly with the film's atmosphere. The music and visuals (primarily of the desert environment) were adhesive complements. An example of this is a scene where the drilling tower catches fire. The contrast of dark and bright colors with the thumping music in the background creates a vibrant sensation.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is now my favorite movie of the year (with a close, but discernible second of No Country for Old Men). The direction was beautiful, the acting was incredible, and the plot was engrossing. The themes were important and it left a strong aftertaste. If those are the things you look for in a film, then you can't go wrong with There Will Be Blood."

","WARNING - MINOR SPOILERS - WARNING <br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson, like his idol Altman, is known for his epic movies with huge ensembles of character actors, stories set in the modern world about desperate people hooked on addictions caused by unsolved traumas like Magnolia or Boogie Nights. By contrast, this Oscar-nominated period piece seems a departure, and I've read many comments complaining that it's a more conventional turn from the Anderson man. Nothing could be more far from the truth. There's absolutely not a second of this incredible movie that can be called conventional. From its overbearing and unusual soundtrack made by Johnny Greenwod from Radiohead to the crowded shot composition to its surprising, brilliant ending, this movie is far more daring and inventive than it seems - like an experimental version of Giant.<br/><br/>Most of the time the screen is occupied by Daniel Plainview, a character who enters the movie almost breaking his back looking for silver and ends it living in a palace bought by oil, an outcast of the world, hating everything, everyone and himself above all things. The movie is the chronicle of Daniel's misantrophy, but that's not a trait he acquires due to any dramatic turn of the movie. It's who he always was inside. For Daniel, people are always means to get to something, usually money and power. His kindness is a tool. Early on, when he adopts an orphan (then always introduced by him as ""my partner and son H.W.""), it's the only noble, primal act he does in the entire movie and he even blows that afterwards. We're led to believe that Daniel loves the kid, yet his unfriendly, bitter side gets the better of him after a tragic accident changes their relationship completely. Daniel Day-Lewis shows Plainview like a hunching, smiling bulk of a man who rarely shows his emotions. When he does, it's usually in a bout of rage and he ends up punching somebody. He's ""an oil man"", and he's nothing more, desperate to become powerful for power's sake. He sleeps a lot and is hard to wake up, like a man who's not eager to see the real world. He likes inventive pranks and is an expert intimidator and spokesman.<br/><br/>While it's a performance worthy of all the praise and the Oscar it got, another one that doesn't stay far behind is given by Paul Dano. He has two characters, twin brothers. One of them, Paul, gives Daniel the information about where to search for oil. The other brother, Eli, living in the land that Daniel wants to drill, becomes his lifelong antagonist. He's a priest in a strange fanatical church where he screams like a madman and heals evil with his hands. Plainview hates everyone by his own admission, but he hates this man more than any other. It might be because they're so alike. Like Plainview, Eli is a manipulative, disgusting, baby-faced con artist. Daniel can smell the rat because he does the same. The beginning of their war is a funny moment where Eli makes Daniel promise that he will allow him to bless the drill before they start looking for oil, and at the next day waits in the first line of the crowd, ready to do some preaching. Daniel completely ignores him and the blessing. In a way, while Plainview is the obvious protagonist, the movie is the portrait of the hatred between these men with no soul.<br/><br/>This is a long movie, over three hours, and an extremely slow one. Shots linger on, and there must be surprisingly few of them if you decided to count 'em. During conversations, there are very few cuts. Either the shot shows all of the characters or it focuses on one for longer than it's customary, having the other one say his lines off camera. Sometimes characters walk great distances on screen and there are frequent soaring, impressive landscape takes. Anderson has said the movie is inspired, apart from the Sinclair novel, by Huston's Treasure of Sierra Madre. While that's true about the theme of greed, I see a lot of John Ford in the style. There's even a shot that resembles the famous closing image of The Searchers."

","If fantastic acting, cinematography and direction made a great movie then this is a great movie. In fact, this movie in perfect in every respect... except the storyline. The story really plods. It's 158 minutes of slow, and not very interesting, storytelling.<br/><br/>But, boy, the acting really is something. Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant but so is the rest of the cast. DDL's performance is so good that it commands your attention and conceals the movie's great weakness. You're so mesmerised by him that it's easy to overlook the fact that the storyline is uninteresting. In fact, there isn't a storyline as such. It's just a chronological sequence of events showing how this ""oil man"" makes his fortune and uses people along the way. There's no depth (to the story), no great insights.<br/><br/>EDIT: Watched it on TV last night and liked it much more. This movie is maybe deeper than it first appears.

","This film grips you like an engineer on a drunk looking for a fight. Day-Lewis - henceforce referred to as DL is a force unlike anything cinema has ever encountered. His raw unsettling role in this movie has such a threat of unresolved anger through it that you can barely tear your eyes from his. Remember Joe Pesci in Good fellas - well Plainview is all that and more yet he communicates it all with a twitch of the face or the raise of an eyebrow. Although the story is compelling it can drag in places but the wonderful Dl carries the entire film on his shoulders and hurls it back at the audience. A great companion piece to no Country for Old Men - two great modern westerns for the 21st century .Lets hope DL doesn't wait before he finds another skin to inhabit."
"Mr_Here","9","4","8","28 January 2008"," One of the greatest performances of all time
","Daniel Day Lewis cannot be denied. He goes beyond what most actors are even capable of doing. This truly is his masterstroke, and to give the academy award to another actor would be an insult to the institution of acting. What Day Lewis achieves with this performance embodies the very definition of acting, and it will be remembered as one of the most powerful and most influential performances in history.<br/><br/>The film itself is terrifying, and intensified only by Johnny Greenwood’s amazing musical score. It is a history piece, and in a very sadistic way it is a comedy. But above all it is a horror film about the atrocities of a quintessential anti-hero, and one that the audience is forced to reconcile with. But there is a much deeper message, and at its core is the confrontation between Plainview and Eli Sunday. Sunday, pious and very naive, is the exact opposite of Plainview, and by pitting these characters together we see manifested before our eyes one of the most fundamental dilemmas of human nature. The great mistake would be to assume this film is anti-religion, or anti-capitalist for that matter. Anderson simply picked the worst parts from either side and set them loose on each other. The result is a brutal and universal battle that you cannot turn away from.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only element of the film which is less than perfect is the span of time that it attempts to cover. There is a scene that requires a massive leap in time in which Plainview's son, now grown up and married, confronts his father. Up until that point, the film has risen to a climax so expertly only to be suddenly jarred by a very large leap ahead (10 years or so) in order to fit in this subplot. The scene has no cathartic element for Plainview, who remains as unwavering as ever, and seems superfluous in the grand scheme of things, which is unfortunate because it is a powerful scene and very well acted. It is clear from start to finish that the plot of the film is not about Plainview verses himself as much as it is Plainview verses Sunday, and this scene only serves to draw attention away from the major conflict, hardly worth interrupting the atmosphere that the film has already built up.<br/><br/>But then again, there would have been no bowling for priests..."
"gscheyd","8","4","8","27 January 2008"," haunting images, haunting score
","There Will Be Blood is a strong movie in virtually every area, but what impressed me most of all was Jonny Greenwood's score. As in Jaws, and perhaps even more so in this case, the music creates an atmosphere of suspense that no combination of writing, acting, scenery, costume, makeup, etc. could come close to achieving in its absence. Greenwood's (usually) minimalist post-modern orchestral score sets such a tone from the opening seconds of the film, as we see the early struggles of our antihero, Daniel Day-Lewis's Daniel Plainview. We watch a man driven by an unquenchable greed and hear a swell of strings foreshadowing the decades of suffering that his greed will impose (on himself and on anyone in whom he sees an opportunity for advantage).<br/><br/>The character of Plainview is not a depiction of a pure psychopath, in the way that Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh was in No Country for Old Men. He is a bit more nuanced, but the glimpses we are given into the fact that Plainview does in fact possess a capability for regret, sadness, and empathy make him that much less likable for his repeatedly ignoring such feelings in the quest to fill his pockets. Here is a man not to be crossed, and one whose protean unpredictability leaves all but his essential business associates ever at risk of crossing him should they happen to encounter him on the wrong day.<br/><br/>The use of religion by the oil man and of the oil man by religion makes for one of the most interesting elements in the story line. Apparently the two were even stranger bedfellows in the days before Newt Gingrich's neocon revolution. One wonders what Upton Sinclair (socialist author of the source work) would have made of the current U.S. administration, or rather, one hardly needs to wonder. Naturally, at the time of its writing the source work (Oil) was a criticism of the big business syndicates of Sinclair's day, but you know, the less things change the more they stay the same; and if I were to attempt an exegesis on There Will Be Blood it would be to make a case that Paul Thomas Anderson intended explicitly (though not exclusively) for the film to remind us of some of the less honorable practices of the current administration. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but this is certainly the impression that I got.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the manifest content of the film -- I awoke the day after having watched There Will Be Blood with a handful of very vivid images left over in my mind, scenes of destruction and ruin, not bothered by them so much as impressed with the movie's ability to occupy my thoughts in so vivid a manner. Anderson, Day-Lewis, and Greenwood each deserve a round of applause for what they've done here. By their efforts, they have given us a movie that will be well-remembered decades hence."
"thealtmangoodbye","10","4","8","16 January 2008"," Horrifying, hilarious, brutal and beautiful- a masterpiece.
","There Will Be Blood is an absurdist black comedy from Hell. It's a deranged, unhinged masterpiece the likes of which we've never, ever witnessed before. Forget all the Kubrick comparisons- the only thing Kubrickian is the score, and even that is only because of the obvious Penderecki comparisons. Kubrick never got this close, this dirty. Paul Thomas Anderson does not separate himself from these characters; he became these characters in writing it, namely Daniel Plainview, portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis in what has very quickly become my favorite screen performance of all time. This is Robert De Niro in Raging Bull quality we're talking about, and personally, I think he one ups De Niro with this film. I know, I know, heresy...but that's how much I responded to his performance. It seems that Anderson somehow found a ""brother...from another mother.."" in DDL, judging by recent appearances where they all but cuddle in front of the interviewer, and together they have crafted one of the most indelible screen characters of recent years. Daniel Plainview is a monster, no buts about it, but he's a recognizable monster. He's not some abstraction. In Plainview, we can see ourselves, and it frightens us, and that's part of this films brilliance. Plainview acts out upon feelings that we don't even like to admit that we are capable of. He's malicious and deviant, and yet charming and likable. It's scary stuff, and DDL's performance will be studied for years to come for the sheer dedication he gives to the characterization. Forgive me if my thoughts seem rambling, I've seen the film three times now and I'm still trying to process it. It's such an experience. I can't even begin to go on about Paul Dano as the equally despicable Eli Sunday. I'd love to talk about the scenes that play out like high comedy ran through oil and grit. There's a baptism scene that could have come out of a brilliant comedy, and many scenes go into bizarre, unexpected territory that you wouldn't see coming in a million years (an uncomfortably funny encounter in a restaurant comes to mind) The film is at moments heart-wrenching, horrifying, hilarious, brutal, poetic, over the top and brilliantly mad. PTA isn't afraid to let the audience decide how to feel; he's not going to hold your hand, and I think that's the problem a lot of people have with the ending. It's definitely the litmus test for the film- if you dislike the ending, then you obviously haven't been paying attention to the character of Daniel Plainview. If you enjoy the ending, then clearly you've followed the entire ride. My advice to people that hate the ending is the same thing I'd say to the people who hate No Country for Old Men's ending- watch it again, think about the ending throughout the entire film. It's the ONLY way the film can end. I think Roger Ebert put it best in his review ""Only madness can supply a termination for this story."" So, with that, I end my random, barely coherent thoughts on the one true masterpiece of 2007, and really of the last decade. It's already in my top 5 EVER, and you should take my word seriously...because I'm a genius. This is most DEFINITELY not a film for everyone- most I've talked to have either loved it or despised it with a fiery passion equally, and it's most certainly a one of a kind experience, but if you are willing, then you most certainly won't be disappointed. I'm finished."

""cough"" Saw ""cough"" <br/><br/>Best Actor and Movie my butt!

"OddBallin","10","6","14","9 February 2008"," Avarice, ho
","This film supersedes categorization. It overrides the fact that epics have been dead for the past 30 years or so (a fact which I continually lamented). Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime as Daniel Plainview in this, Paul Thomas Anderson's claustrophobic masterpiece. Paul Dano capitalizes on the opportunity to show his raw talent as Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview is a vicious oil magnate who won't hesitate to slit your throat if you bat an eyelash in a way he feels is offensive. Eli Sunday is an eager, deluded evangelical minister. These two titans will clash repeatedly on the screen until the bloody end, in which it feels as though they are playing a drawn out game of Russian roulette in which each is attempting to go in opposite directions yet they are on a furious collision course.<br/><br/>Enough with the metaphors and analogies. When and if you go see this don't expect gallons of blood to flood the theater, as PTA uses what blood there is scrupulously, and to great effect. It is a great indictment of capitalism and evangelism and doesn't strain to show what they are as most films do. I won't vindicate you by going as far to rant about this being the best film ever as it is not a time-tested wonder like Lawrence of Arabia or Citizen Kane (not to say those are my favorite films, these just have appealed to the conventional sense of epics and are therefore comparable). I'm just saying this is an overall worthwhile and satisfying film, which can be very hard to find these days among the mindless soulless morass that is Hollywood film which never fails to produce a plethora of slashers, bad parody films and video game reminiscent action and almost always fails to deliver films like this, that may feel like a kick in the teeth (which can be a very good thing).<br/><br/>The cinematography is damn near intoxicating, just a wondrously shot film, which might very well have brought a tear to my eyes if they hadn't been wide open for the duration of the film. The spectacle is as aesthetically pleasing as it is terrifying for the psyche.<br/><br/>The soundtrack (kudos to Johnny Greenwood) is as close as it gets to overpowering without annoying me. Also I'd like to thank PTA for using Brahms' Violin Concerto (last movement I believe) at the end, wonderful selection.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I pondered it was how PTA adapted this from Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"" as the two stories are so divergent that if I hadn't heard so previous to seeing the film I would have wondered if I had walked into the right theater. But thank you PTA, however much I loved the book, for changing so much about it as there was plenty making a straight book- to-film production of ""Oil!"" couldn't convey."
"dbborroughs","6","6","14","28 January 2008"," Final section of the film damages what is other wise a great film
","Story of Daniel Plainview a silver miner who switches to oil. The film charts the course of Plainview's life over 30 years as his fortunes rise and he descends into madness.<br/><br/>Going into the film I was carrying a great deal of baggage. The promise of a truly great film is tough thing to have to live up to. Hailed by many as a classic film on par with many of the cinema's greatest offerings I'm left to wonder if its all hyperbole since the film has barely been on view to the public for roughly a months time and true classics are created in the long term not the short. It will be for time to tell us if the film that has been fashioned here is the masterpiece or an also ran.<br/><br/>For me the film is very good, but I found it considerably less than the ""one of the greatest films"" that the film has been handed by some critics. To be certain the film is excellent on almost every level technically. It is sterling achievement of the film maker's art. The problem for me is that the film falls apart in the final stretch and collapses into simplicity in the final scene. Its rather hard to discuss this with out going into detail, something that may or may not ruin things if you haven't seen the film. Since I don't want to spoil anything I'm going to choose not to discuss things other then to say the denouncement did not work for me and in a way renders most of what happens prior less than it seemed.<br/><br/>I do think that the film is worth seeing. I just think it's not the be all and end all or recent American cinema.<br/><br/>8.5 to 1927, considerably less after that. 6.5 over all"
"ekmadsen","5","5","11","30 November 2009"," I alternated between frustration and anticipation as I watched
","I think There Will Be Blood is a well made film. The cinematography is beautiful. The score is a bold choice. I thought it was brilliant to use spooky music. The score suggests a horror film- which, along with the title, serves to ratchet up the suspense and build a sense of foreboding. Something bad- very bad- is going to happen.<br/><br/>And that's where the film disappointed me. I have no problem with slow, plodding development. Though I did say out loud ""Get on with it!"" during the silent opening sequence, I did think it was well done. It established how terribly hard life was back then. In fact, I remember being chilled at one point- it might have been a little later in the film, when Daniel finally arrives at the Sunday ranch and asks if he can camp on their land. Anyhow, I remember being chilled and getting up to crank up the heat in my townhouse. The endless shots of desolate gray skies and a chill wind must have had a psychological effect on me. I said ""well done"" as a nod to the director as I realized the stark difference between my easy comfort and the pioneers hard work and misery.<br/><br/>But this slow, meandering plot, with all the requisite slow, lingering shots has got to lead somewhere. I alternated between frustration and anticipation as I watched. The peak of my attention in the film was the scene where Daniel is sitting on his porch with his brother- or the man who has presented himself as his brother- and confesses he is terribly competitive and wants every other man to fail. Then he adds, ""I look at people and I can't see anything in them to like."" He asks his brother if he feels the same way and his brother says no, with all his trying and failing he doesn't see it like that- he just doesn't care any more. Daniel remarks, ""Well, if it's in me then it's in you."" Whoa! That line stood out. That's foreshadowing if I've ever seen it. That really piqued my interest and I thought OK, we may find out this brother is not the quiet, broken man we think he is. We are going to find out that neither man can escape their father's blood and an intense rivalry will develop.<br/><br/>Only it doesn't. A few scenes later Daniel's brother is unmasked as an impostor and impassively excised from the script. And for what? To make a point that traditional conflict-climax-resolution story arcs are passé? Daniel's son is handled in an even more careless manner. The director inserts a shot of the son, now an adult, marrying the Sunday girl only so he can set up the very next scene. With no exposition of a juvenile son's deteriorating relationship with his father, no backstory that carries beyond an eight year old kid, the director expects the audience suddenly to become emotionally invested in the confrontation between adult son and miserable, contemptuous father. When Daniel reveals to his son that he's an orphan (""lower than a bastard"") adopted for the sole purpose of having a cute face present when swindling homesteaders out of their oil-rich land, I cried foul. Yes, the director inserted a few cues along the way- the most telling of which was Daniel refusing to answer his brother's question about the whereabouts of the boy's mother. Still, I thought it was cheap and hypocritical. How is the audience supposed to feel indignant when it's revealed that Daniel Plainview does not love his son, he merely feigned love in order to enrich himself financially? The director didn't tend to the boy's character either. He merely inserted him into the story in order to set up a nasty verbal denouement, hastily arranged and devoid of any lasting impact.<br/><br/>I had lost interest by the time we get to Eli Sunday's triumphant return as a well-dressed, successful holy man, visiting ""such an old friend"" Daniel, at Daniel's beautiful California mansion. A tradition story arc suggests Daniel will take vengeance for Eli having forced him to confess his sins in public. But the film has shown an interest in bucking trends. So will a drunk, declining Daniel summon up the will and strength to confront the ascendant Eli? Will blood be spilled as the film's title suggests? Oh wait, Eli is not successful. He's lost a fortune in the market. Will Daniel suddenly show some compassion? Do I care about these sudden revelations? Oh wait, it is traditional after all. A beat-down and the credits role.<br/><br/>A good attempt but ultimately disappointing in my opinion. If a film insists on departing from the traditional path, it must do so for a reason. I can't see what was accomplished by this film's journey."
"MarlonBrandoPocahontas","6","5","11","18 April 2008"," Daniel Day Lewis overacting and too long
","Interesting to read the division of opinion on the message board. I cant say I hated it but I was very disappointed with it particularly as I would rate PT Andersons Magnolia as one of my favourite films and I also liked both Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love a lot. The main problem for me is Daniel Day Lewis's over acting and screen dominance, it is just too much and he becomes unbelievable as a character and almost comic, I had exactly the same problem with him in Gangs of New York. It reminds me of Jack Nicholsons performance in The Shining a great book and a great film but JN has the audience rolling with laughter when it simply isn't supposed to be funny. My other criticisms are the length of the movie, the 'brother' part could have been done and dusted in about 10 minutes saving a good half hour and the ending which for me was quite ridiculous as the crippled and drunk old man, just woken up from a passed out state manages to corner a man 30 years or so his junior by throwing Tenpin bowling pins at him. There will be Blood is a beautifully shot film and is a great subject as a story, I also liked the score very much, but ultimately I came away unconvinced."

","Surely Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is outstanding. He's the real artist among professionals. I think there is no other actor like him around now for such roles. So let's give the movie 5 points. But where is the rest of the film? Direction is good, soundtrack interesting, but the plot? Let's be honest, the plot does not work. Because you have only the oilman on the screen, and all the rest is very thin--too thin. I'd have to say ""underdeveloped"". The problem is the screenplay. There are many ideas that might have worked very well, i.e. playing the opposition between the sly man of oil and the crooked man of faith. But nothing. It's left there.

A lot of people liked it for some reason and these will remain reasons I won't understand, no matter how much praise this production gets. There were so many other great, dark films released this year that embraced each other simultaneously and pulled it off. I get the point of this movie. Evil beats good and money is more powerful than religion. Is that supposed to be a metaphor for the current situation in the U.S.? If so, I get that point.

Give me Chinatown or The Godfather or Scarface, but don't try to tell me that Daniel Day-Lewis with a Sean Connery affect is anywhere near as good an embodiment of evil as Orson Wells as a drunken corrupt cop in a broiling border town. I would have rather spent my time re-watching Once Upon a Time in the West to get my strange music and wide open silent spaces punctuated by violent outbursts. Give me Gregory Peck as Ahab--at least I can appreciate what drove him to his madness. I wish I could put my finger on what really bothers me so much here. I haven't seen No Country for Old Men yet but I recently read the novel (before I knew it was being produced) and found it fascinatingly brilliant.

Perhaps the lack of emotion shown by any characters except for DDL and his nemesis is the point, but for me it was impossible to be sympathetic to any character in the movie. Once again, another over-hyped movie that didn't resonate. All I kept thinking was, ""when this is over, I will go home and eat lasagna."" For me the ending was pointless, and contrary to DDL's character. While the acting was great, DDL's subtleties and mannerisms are fantastic to watch.

","While this film is based on the novel by Upton Sinclair, it is a unique cinematic experience all unto itself. This film came out during a time when faster cuts and flashy Hollywood novelties were at a peak. It's refreshing to say the least. Long takes can be boring but the compositions are meticulously composed and Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel-Day Lewis, will steal your attention. There's natural effects on the Oil Rigs throughout the film and the story is frightening as it progresses through the life of an oil tycoon being built by a man who singularly seeks wealth. He will stop for nothing. The plot is simple but the poise and determination of a perfect performance and vision by directed Paul Thomas Anderson made this film an instant classic. Whether you follow the historical connotations of the American Dream or the religious warnings, there is something to learn here. I will watch it again, as a cautionary tale, or as an inspiration in storytelling."
"TheNabOwnzz","9","2","3","5 October 2018"," Unconventional brilliance
","Paul Thomas Anderson is undoubtedly the greatest director of his generation, and There Will Be Blood once more shows his versatility as a director. Anderson's direction seems like a bit of a mix between Kubrick & Scorsese, and whereas a lot of earlier PT Anderson films seemed to lean more towards Scorsese ( Boogie Nights, Hard Eight ), There Will Be Blood leans more towards Kubrick, and feels unlike anything he has ever directed before.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is kind of unconventional in its technical expertise. It uses a lot of angles one would never expect during certain scenes. An example of this is when Daniel Plainview ( Daniel-Day Lewis ) meets his half brother, in which most of the time the camera is behind Lewis, instead of using the more conventional shot/reverse shot method. Another example is when he reunites with his son H.W. after some time. Normally these scenes would feature mid/close up range to capture a more personal feel towards this event, but in There Will Be Blood this is changed into an obscure wideshot which is not satisfying at all while showing the pipeline in the foreground, like Anderson is visually telling the audience about what's more important to Plainview. These kind of techniques give this film a unique look and an odd kind of originality that is rarely found in films. It's pacing is reminiscent of Kubrick, but everything else seems to spring right from Anderson's artistic mind.<br/><br/>There is no actual dialogue in the first fourteen minutes, and yet we learn so much about Plainview as a character. He is forced to crawl out of a well injured and alone for a single silver find which shows us visually just how destitute he is. His character arc is undoubtedly one of the greatest in cinematic history, as he evolves from this to the complete opposite while still maintaining a large degree of logic and sense. This is, in the end, a fantastic example of a brilliant study about the descent into madness due to greed and corruption.<br/><br/>There are really no words that properly honor Daniel-Day Lewis's performance in this movie. He is absolutely superb. From his incredible imitation of a turn of the century voice to his charming speeches or facial expressions bursting with internal struggles, this is one of the finest protagonist performances ever to grace the big screen. Paul Dano ofcourse also shines in his two-way role of Paul & Eli Sunday, perfectly capturing the religious fanatic's personality. ( The time for him to shine is truly when he has to say he is a false prophet in the final scene, in which you can truly see the genuine struggle he is having by just looking at his expressions ). There are not many films out there that equal the quality of There Will Be Blood's acting due to this, and these powerhouse performances really transcend this already excellent film even further.<br/><br/>It has a fantastic screenplay with a lot of exceptional dialogue. The final scene is a stand-out. That scene is absolute cinematic perfection in the intellect and sub text of its dialogue. The simple 'I'm finished' quote is still being debated to this day, as its meaning stretches far beyond what most can see. Some events like the arrival of Plainview's 'half brother' seem somewhat out of place and quite sudden, but we have to remember that this is Plainview's story and this sub plot works incredibly well as another pure elevator to hell for the sanity of his character.<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant, with many beautiful images capturing that desolate and bleak look of the film perfectly. The drill fire sequence during night time is a perfect example of this, as the color of the fire lighting up the screen is contrasted beautifully by the silhouettes in the foreground. Most of the shots in the film are either slowly zooming in or zooming out, to capture that impending doom that always seems to be around every corner. Every frame, every shot, it all connects beautifully as it all has its own purpose. Not a single shot is wasted. The visual storytelling is very strong in There Will Be Blood, and it relies on the viewer's intelligence to understand this, as the respect P.T. Anderson shows here for his audience is very high. There are a lot of things one will need to figure out for themselves, because Anderson doesn't make his characters say blatant obvious things. However, this does not mean it is abstract or incoherent, because the visual story is still there for all to see.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is titanically acted, intelligently written and most of all superbly directed by a master filmmaker. It is a haunting descent into madness, but it is in the unusual and unconventional way this is filmed that this really stands out as such a masterpiece."
"Raven-1969","10","2","3","6 December 2017"," Drilling in Human Hearts and Oil Fields
","Oil derricks in flames, ruthless and vicious human beings and spilled blood combine in the California oil fields of a hundred years ago. Daniel Plainfield, a self-made and hard-driving oil baron, and Eli Sunday, an unscrupulous and manipulative preacher, confront and antagonize each other over the course of decades. Both are unstable and hollow souls who expect and bring out the worst in others. Greed and avarice causes them to drill into human hearts as much as the vast oil fields in which they toil. Plainfield and Sunday clash in surprising and brutal ways until one of them discovers the limits to how deep a drill can go.<br/><br/>Upton Sinclair, the author of the story on which this film is based, is likely turning in his grave in the realization that things have gone downhill since his time. 100 years ago when someone was accidentally clocked by a drill rig, Plainfield could dump the body in a tar pit and be done with them. These days Plainfield could strike again and not even need the cover of night to get rid of the body, just a Twitter account.<br/><br/>The film is exquisite, impressive and ornate on many levels, especially the acting and cinematography. It racked up two Oscar wins for Daniel Day-Lewis' acting and for the cinematography, and it was nominated for six more. Daniel Day-Lewis is at his wicked best in portraying Plainfield. The cinematography is amazing for its startling beauty, composition and colors, oil derricks bursting into flames in the night for example, as well as the intriguing way it frames the characters. The photography tells an enthralling story beyond words and sound. The period clothing and elaborate sets are fascinating to behold. Such attention to detail makes even scenes of business negotiations appear alluring. The film is long, but because it is so good you don't notice the passage of time. An eerie yet intriguing soundtrack goes hand in hand with the disturbing characters, heartless actions and frequent severe beatings."

","Paul Thomas Anderson began his career as a young filmmaker in the early 90's. He proceeded to make several energetic, ambitious movies which were guided by an upbeat soundtrack. Stylistically, he borrowed from Altman, Mamet and Scorsese but still, his films fit nicely with all of the other fun, stylized Hollywood films made in the 90's along the likes of Tarantino and Kevin Smith. <br/><br/>Flash forward to 2005, Anderson has matured quite a bit since his feature length debut in '96. He has more experience under his belt and he has become a father. He's taken a few years off from his last feature, starring Adam Sandler. At this point, Anderson is ready to make something he's never attempted. He jumps into uncharted waters and begins writing a film titled ""There Will Be Blood."" <br/><br/>It seems that Anderson was ready to up his game and strived for a picture that was more grand, more metaphysical, similar to his own heroes, Stanley Kubrick and Sidney Lumet. Of course, to make a project as sublime as Anderson had envisioned, he had to team up with some very talented people. The iconic Day Lewis in the lead, underrated Paul Dano in the supporting role, minor characters who look as if they've been pulled from a 1920's black and white photo, a great cinematographer, talented set designers, Jonny Greenwood and an interesting germ of an idea from a novel by Upton Sinclair. When all of these ingredients came together it culminated into one of the greatest films of the 2000's.<br/><br/>PTA is the kind of director who admits he isn't always sure what he's ""looking for"" and he hopes the thematic aspects will fall into place as he goes along. Though ""Blood"" is a very ambitious film, PTA handles it with confidence and possibly a willingness to break the mold of what kind of director critics had previously defined him as. Tarantino has recently tried to do the same after making three Los Angeles based films that helped put him on the map, problem is his latest films have become more ""popcorn"" movies that combine Quentin's favorite genres.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterful film in nearly every facet. Everyone has acknowledged the acting is great. Daniel Day Lewis is riveting, even in the scenes he doesn't speak. The soundtrack is memorable, the cinematography is special and PTA gets the most out of authentic Texas locations used throughout. And then there's the ending, which feels like it was ghost-directed by the spirit of Kubrick himself. ""Blood"" seems to get better and better the more you watch it.<br/><br/>10/10. To make a film in the caliber of this, the planets have to line up. This involves of course the auteur, whose film should reflect their personal growth. Some great directors have made a ""shift"" into the greatest years of their filmography. It seems with this film that PTA has started his recent journey."

","I think so - he said, answering his own question. <br/><br/>This seems to be one of the most polemic review sections I've encountered. I just had to drop in...<br/><br/>Apparently that's because we expect different things from a film, like:<br/><br/>How should the characters be constructed? What propels them and to what end? <br/><br/>When do we pick up the main characters and where should we leave them? <br/><br/>How is time suggested in each scene, each shot. Why does this even matter to the ""filmic experience""?<br/><br/>What is the function of the soundtrack and the relevance of the ""extra diegetic"" sound? <br/><br/>Etc,etc...<br/><br/>I don't expect us to agree on ""what is cinema"" and ""what cinema is"" (and it's purpouse) nor would I like to go the academic road here, but some of these reviews seem to be frivolously addressed to the shallowest of depths... and it saddens me to read how easily people praise or dismiss films, purely on actor performance, character motivation, good/bad-world... above all, it seems to not make justice to the wholeness I believe was achieved with this particular work.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is a solid unity of cinematic form and content, strongly binded by some ""creative choices"" that, being far from industry standard (hence most of the visceral reactions, from both sides), are used here for more than just wow or wtf factors. <br/><br/>These choices, when successfully combined, are the magical glue that converts mere entertainment items (technically ""perfect"" by all dogmas)... into something else, that goes both deeper and beyond. <br/><br/>Bottom line? I truly believe this to be a very bold film (a rare Hollywood bastard) that will surely continue to be a powerful transforming experience for cinephiles of decades to come."
"nesfilmreviews","9","2","3","31 July 2013"," Simply unforgettable.
","The closing sequence delivers on the promise of the movie's title in a manner that keeps viewers discussing it long after the picture ends. ""There Will Be Blood"" is not a movie that disappears quietly. Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece ""There will be Blood"" is a steadfast reflection of the very essence of capitalism in America, where domination, not gain, is the ultimate objective, and by any means necessary. <br/><br/>When we first meet Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1898, he's mining for gold in a shaft he has dug into the ground of his Texas property. He finds what he's looking for, and perhaps more. Several years later, he has shifted his focus from gold to oil and he has been able to hire some hands. When an accident results in a death, Daniel finds himself with an infant orphan to care for. He raises the child, known as H.W., to be his own. By 1912, Daniel has become a well-known oilman, and he his looking to expand his empire. Accompanied by his partner, Fletcher (Ciarán Hinds), and his son (Dillon Freasier), he travels to California to follow a promising lead. What he finds there astonishes him. He seeks to buy large parcels of property, but he is impeded in his goal by the evangelist preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who wants Daniel to donate $10,000 to the local church before he sells. After the contract is signed, however, Daniel reneges on the deal. Shortly thereafter, once the first drill has become operational, there is an accident that results in an explosion that fuels a major oil fire and costs H.W. his hearing.<br/><br/>For most of the film, Daniel is a fascinating character. He's a mass of contradictions: charismatic, ugly, easygoing, ruthless, silver-tongued, plain-spoken, gentle, violent. He's smart and understands how to manipulate every situation to his advantage. He understands the business of oil and transforms himself from a poor miner into a wealthy businessman. Unfortunately, the more power Daniel amasses, the more corrupt and dissolute he becomes. Anderson chronicles Daniel's personality decay intelligently. He establishes the character as an admirable individual, but eventually his morality slowly erodes. The lives of these two, Daniel and Eli, are self-centered, cunning, and ruthless men who collide and lead us into the dark, unpaved path of madness of self-destruction driven by their unrelenting greed. <br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is a rich character study of a fascinating individual who is by turns likable, loathsome, admirable, monstrous, and driven. What Day-Lewis brings to the characterization is more exquisite and complex than anything even Anderson might have imagined at the outset. His Plainview is the most gripping film performance of the year, and as his religious foil, Dano also reveals unsuspected depths. Long, but so well crafted with terrific cinematography, and beautifully written/directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Daniel Day-Lewis and Robert Elswit both earned Academy Awards."
"maggeboiii","10","2","3","6 July 2013"," Without doubt the greatest film of the mid-2000's
","After amazing films such as ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""The Master"", PT Anderson is probably the greatest living director today, this masterpiece of a movie justifies that title.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a prospector, named Daniel Plainview (Day- Lewis) which is looking to make a fortune out of oil in the early twentieth century. No spoilers, he finds an oil-ore and becomes a very wealthy man. The only obstacle to ensure an even bigger paycheck is a small Californian town which welcomes him with open arms when he promises daily bread on their tables, new roads and a school. In order for Daniel to fulfill their needs, he wants unlimited access to their undiscovered petroleum-resources. Very early on we get to see Daniel's greed, deceit and lies slowly distorting the man's moral compass, which also affects his adopted son H.W during the story. <br/><br/>This is undoubtedly the greatest acting ever on screen, it's surreal to see Day-Lewis being Plainview. The last 45 minutes is pure acting-gold. I was shocked and scared during the ""I drink your milkshake""-scene at the end, such a sinister performance. Paul Dano does also a remarkable and underrated performance as the overly religious twins Paul, and Daniel's nemesis Eli Sunday. The church-scenes are mesmerizing and full of energy, great actor! Honorable mention is Dylan Frasier as H.W, a talented young actor I'm certain we'll see more of in the future.<br/><br/>Robert Elswit won a very well-deserved Oscar for his cinematography. It's stunningly beautiful, which is quite ironic for a movie which is so evil and sinister. This combined with Anderson's amazing direction and subliminal messages just hits home-run. <br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is an unique film. It shows how greed can affect a person and the people closest to them. Anderson knows his craft, and clearly shows it. Day-Lewis is a monster of an actor and offers his best role to date, no, I'll go as far as saying this is the best acting displayed in any movie to date next to Heath Ledger's Joker. See this film, it's a must-see for people who loves the art of cinema. Hurry up with ""Inherent Vice"", Anderson..<br/><br/>-MB"

","A film that hits you like a fever, ""There Will Be Blood"" is not the kind of movie that someone will have the pleasure of watching or reviewing. It is a portrait of several layers of everything that comes with the desire for power, will leave the audience feeling exhausted and with a bitter taste in the mouth.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film is submitted safely and confidently. Anderson proves to be one of the best director of all time, a fact that is evident here. Packed with shots and scenes of breathtaking intensity of boiling, the film makes no apologies about his tendency toward grandiosity inherent in telling an epic story that spans decades.<br/><br/>Perhaps the first thing that will strike viewers will use the images as dark and gloomy, almost impossible to see. We watched the movie as we were covered in oil. Batway, oil is simply the central theme of the film.<br/><br/>The story begins with the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, he is a very intelligent man and cruel that does whatever it takes to achieve your goals. He works hard, but he also takes advantage of the people around at your expense, if necessary. His business partner is his son H.W, that he actually ""acquired"" when the H.W biological father, who worked on one of the platforms of Daniel, was killed in an accident at work. Daniel is deeply protective of H.W, but only for that H.W brings to the society, a serene and innocent face. When both know Eli Sunday saying the land of his father has oil everywhere, making an offer to Daniel to buy the property from his father. Eli is the local preacher and a healer ""self-proclaimed"" wants the money from the sale of the property to finance his own church.<br/><br/>The lives of both characters change completely when Daniel decides to buy all the land outside the property of the father of Eli and tries to acquire all the land around, at bargain basement prices to be able to build an oil industry. And always with H.W at your side to strengthen the business.<br/><br/>The setting of the film can be impressive, every minute that passes we see it bigger and bigger. And with it the ominous and annoying soundtrack that fits in every scene, leaving them more disturbing. When music raises the pitch dark, pessimistic and emotionally draining film, without ever taking center stage away from the performances, with characters that prove to be the soul of the story.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis proves to be one of the best actors of this generation, this film, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Daniel Plainview (Lewis) can be cruel, sinister and pessimistic at every passing second, but at the same time can show a little ray of goodness in his evil look; Paul Dano in a fantastic and disturbing performance, Eli Sunday (Dano) is the Movie's religion, amidst all the disturbance and sinister he is the sort of God to want to expel the devil, the devil being Daniel, out of paradise. But throughout the film it all fits.<br/><br/>The film is a character study of a man who usually do not want to know and you will not be able to forget after all is said and done. After watching it you will not want to reveal it soon, but it will be for all the right reasons, Paul Thomas does all this perturbation on purpose. ""There Will be Blood"" is a powerful and emotionally draining experience, the experience of one of the best MASTERPIECES ever made!"
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","9","2","3","10 April 2013"," Not a spiritually uplifting film
","There have been a lot of extremely negative opinions posted on IMDb about this film, so, if like me, you've watched the film, or intend to watch it for the very first time and are still a little bemused by the amount of poor reviews on the first 1-10 pages on IMDb, perhaps a little explanation is required.<br/><br/>The critics loved this film, followed by heaps of praise and over-exaggerated hype on its initial release. By delving deeper, I discovered that most of the negative opinions were posted during the immediate aftermath of the film's release, mostly by very bored and disappointed movie goers who expected a lot more entertainment; a faster moving movie with an obvious plot and lots of action and BLOOD. This film doesn't quite adhere to these conditions. It's slow-paced, cinematic, sinister and brooding. After adjusting my IMDb search parameters and looking at the most recent reviews, five or more years after its initial release, I noticed a much more balanced critical opinion. People seem less disappointed and more appreciative of the film from a neutral perspective, perhaps like me.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is rather long at two-and-a-half hours in total, but after it was over I felt a little disgruntled at it ending so abruptly. OK, that might just be me, but I wanted more. It's not an epic tale along the lines of The Godfather, how could it be? The plot is far less complex, the depth of acting isn't on the same level and the deeply planned long-term maliciousness of Michael Corleone is absent, but that doesn't stop the film from being a dark, sinister, negative story about a man hell-bent on getting exactly what he wants at the expense of love, family, friends and peer companionship. He's probably the most unbearable man who's ever lived, so it might be difficult for many people to relate to or sympathise with a man like that, a person so forcefully driven to do whatever he wants at the expense of everything else. How can a man achieve so much success and wield so much power and yet be so contemptuous of life? He believes in nothing except his own will.<br/><br/>I found the film invigorating throughout, never once getting bored or questioning any particular aspects, but neither did it make me feel good about myself, others or mankind. It did a fantastic job of reminding me that there are a lot of people out there who don't care about me or my concerns. I'm certainly not going to let this jolt of realisation provoke me into giving this film a knee-jerk 1 or 2 star review."
"museumofdave","9","2","3","22 March 2013"," The Promise of Early California: Unimaginable Riches For Those WIthout Constraints
","It seems to me that many critics of this film want it to be High Noon or My Darling Clementine, a traditional western with a linear plot where the good guy wins, want it to be something other than what it is. The title signals a good deal: There Will Be Blood: a certain tip-off to the tone and direction of the plot, a cruel and brutal study of the acquisitive personality.<br/><br/>In the stark, rock-strewn hills of Central California at the turn of the last century, a man, not unlike his financial business counterparts in the early 21st, tries to find meaning in ownership, in denuding the earth of it's riches and turning them into individual wealth--it's an age-old story of the choice between love of family and human consideration and the amassing of great wealth. In the pursuit of power, in this in-depth study of human greed, discriminating viewers will experience a scathing indictment of an individual's detachment from all we like to think of as humane.<br/><br/>The Daniel Day Lewis character, not unlike the more recent financial barons thieves on 21st Century Wall Street, aims to amass millions and keep them. His story, filmed brilliantly against the stark simplicity of once unspoiled land, and underscored by a sensitive, though unconventional musical score, is laid out persuasively: it's likely that another will have a difficult time laying siege to this human engine of destruction.<br/><br/>Performances are unilaterally brilliant in this dark, somber meditation on American history, and while not particularly cheery, such information has no need to be--it is enough that the film can be a motivating and powerful experience."
"paul2001sw-1","9","2","3","22 March 2013"," Theatrical but nonetheless impressive
","Paul Thomas Anderson is a masterful film-maker, and 'There Will be Blood' is a gripping movie, with a superb, always surprising score. The tale of a Californian oilman (apparently with groundings in a real life story), it makes history compelling; and compelling is certainly a good word to describe Daniel Day Lewis's performance as a charismatic, charming but fundamentally ruthless figure, whose need to win ultimately drives away all those close to him (and that's the best fate that any of them get). The film isn't perfect: the dialogue never feels natural, and Lewis's acting is stage-y, though in a mostly good way: powerful and intimate, but not completely emotionally engaging; and the story of his final descent seems a little decoupled from the bulk of the movie. This doesn't mean that two hours don't pass very quickly when watching this film."

","This is what movie-making is all about. A good movie will tell the most difficult, hard-to-believe story in the most simplest form by infusing some great drama with equally great theatrics and there... you have a winner! Cinema is nothing but a fancy form of story-telling. This movie exemplifies that notion just right!!! <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis' performance is exemplary, no adjective can perfectly connote what his performance as Daniel Plainview actually meant. It was phenomenal, It was something more than just an act, more than a theatrical. That was a transcendence, an inspired portrayal, insanely motivated and powered and almost superhuman! This is what differentiates great men from the mediocre, clarity from clutter! Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most gratifying, awe-inspiring, refreshing and utterly masterful performances in the last 10 years. He is a man who'll scare you, terrify you and still leave you jaw-dropped with his power and ruthlessness. You might as well feel inspired by this mortifying man. This is the greatest performance on screen in the last 10 years. No Doubt! I can go on singing praises for this movie and this is the way I feel even 5 years after watching it for the first time and a countless more since then. That's how much it's effect has been imprinted on me! <br/><br/>Now, no matter how genius the action, the music, the editing and other technicalities be, a movie is not a great one if the story isn't in right place. Marvelous execution of the story by Paul Thomas Anderson, kudos to him for achieving what he did with this film. The technique, his direction, his mental scope to carry out those dramatic scenes with such poise and his mature viewpoint to narrate this twisted piece of cinema is a tremendous achievement in it's own right. This film walks through the dangerous terrain of universal hatred, greed, religion, regret, obsession infused madness and plays around those notions drawing parallels with the world we live in today. Paul Thomas Anderson is a bold man for he has crisply described the nuances of such complications with a refreshingly different form of story-telling. Daniel Day Lewis is a legend. With this film, these two have created an effect that will not leave once imprinted upon its viewer. It's not an easy watch, but aren't all ghostly-fear laden-truths of life difficult to gulp down with ease? It is a relentless tale, a gripping narrative, and overall a majestic film. Kudos to Daniel Day Lewis. Kudos To Paul Thomas Anderson for producing this gem. Absolute Respect For Them!"

Maybe they go back further, to Billy Sunday or some other preacher, but the words are identical. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is phenomenal, as usual. Just as Meryl Streep is almost without question, the best female actor of our time, Day-Lewis holds that honor for the other side. Imagine a movie with both of them. It would be memorable.

Quite An Unique and terrifying character showing us about how the oil dealers really were and what greed of money and power can do to a Human Being.<br/><br/>Well I Really Don't Know what I have to say of Day-Lewis's performance here. He is just quite extraordinary in his role of Daniel Plainview, which is an extremely complicated and difficult character to portray, but he has done an excellent job in perfecting the role of this character, and his acting is just top class throughout the movie, at times it really overshadows the other things in the movie, and this really has to be one of the best performances of the decade and one of the most powerful I Have Seen In My Life. Paul Dano is also extremely good in his character of Paul Sunday who is a priest, and his character is just the opposite of Plainview's character, and their chemistry is just sparkling. Dano has done his character justice by giving a really great performance. The Other actors in the movie(specially the child of Plainview) have also done a really good job in making this movie an extremely well acted and portrayed film.<br/><br/>Absolutely Sublime Work from Paul Thomas Anderson in this movie, and this was also his debut work, and he has done an amazing job in showing the life and rise of Daniel Plainview perfectly, so well that at times I was thinking i was in the characters time and not in the 21st century! He really has done the movie justice by perfecting the direction, helping the inexperienced actors specially Dano give excellent performances, helping the staff in their work, and he really is a excellent director and needs to be appreciated. Top Marks to him for making such an excellent film.<br/><br/>The Story Written by Upton Sinclair is quite excellent and unique,and he has done a great job in describing how Greed,Money and Power can do things to a Human Being(here being Daniel Plainview) and how he can do such terrible and dirty things to achieve what he really wants. Paul Thomas Anderson has done an extremely good job in the screen writing of the movie, and he really is multi-talented! The Cinematography in the movie is just sublime! The Cinematographer has done an amazing job in showing the times of Plainview and I was practically blown away by some of the breathtaking scenes in the movie! Top Marks to him! The Music throughout the movie is excellent and keeps the atmosphere in the movie in check, and top marks to John Greenwood in giving an excellent background score to the movie,specially the music in the ending credits.<br/><br/>Well I Really cant understand why This was only appreciated for its acting and cinematography, this is really a near perfect film and Paul Thomas Anderson needed to get more accolades for this, but anyways in my books this will remain an extremely powerful film and superb bio-pic based on a extremely complicated and shrewd character, and I recommend it to every good movie lover."

","There Will Be Blood is a movie for anyone who enjoys amazing cinematography, and can relate to a man who dislikes everyone's company. I mean this is in the best possible way of course. Paul Thomas Anderson created a masterpiece of a film set in California in the early 1800s. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. The wonderful California background and breathtaking scenes (like an oil rig being in flames right at sunset) make this film project images you will never forget.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays his part perfectly. He is an oil man  who worked hard his whole life trying to become rich. One day he is mining alone in the middle of nowhere and his ladder breaks leaving him crippled and alone. This didn't stop him from grabbing some silver he was lucky enough to find and crawling probably miles for help. He will do whatever it takes to make enough money so he can get away from people. That's his goal in life, to become alone. This dark man isn't the normal hero you find in a movie and it makes it very different and hard to recommend to most people. For those who can appreciate a good film, this is a must see. If you are a practicing Christian and sensitive about anti-religion films, then you might be better off passing this one by.  As for me, I am an atheist who loves different and wonderfully made films and this is the best one I have ever seen."

","There Will be Blood is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>It is intellectually charged however, and it's normal that people who have no interest in psychology and philosophy will fail to appreciate it.<br/><br/>The climatic ending between Paul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis is unparalleled in dramatic intensity (""I'm the third revelation!"").<br/><br/>It brings forth the deepest existential questions that have taken hold of man-kind and their ultimate resolution, in blood:<br/><br/>""I am finished.""<br/><br/>It is mature, serious, perfectly mastered and powerfully acted drama. It is accompanied by a contemporary music orchestral score which imitates the 1960s style of Ligeti, Xenakis and Penderecki pretty well.<br/><br/>Generally well composed, tonal music also comes at the appropriate moment in the movie.<br/><br/>Just do not expect another action western movie, this is way above the rest."

This is not to imply that he doesn't use him when it suites his needs But to paint him as a heartless villain is to oversimplify a complex portrait.<br/><br/>The film is a fabulous cinematographic art piece of one of those technologically transformative eras of American history.

Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema.

"suvopyne49","9","2","3","9 March 2011"," There will be a great actor
","Credit goes to P.T Anderson for creating one of the most intense drama and also one of the greatest anti-hero on screen. ""There Will be Blood"" is one of those movies where you will just love to ""hate"" the main protagonist. Saying that, I would also like to add that a lot of people won't like it and it will remain a great Cult movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a businessman who has a oil-drilling company, and over the years he have become very successful. He has a son, who is actually one of his fellow worker's who have died during drilling. The movie is about, as it's tag line suggests, ""where faith meets ambition"". Plainview is one of the darkest character in movie history, and the movie portrays that. When he tries to buy a farm which had great prospects regarding oil, he meets Eli Sunday( Paul Dano) , who is a pastor at the local church, and the movie rolls on showing the differences between Eli and Plainview.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis. The man does it again. He shows every emotion that characterize Plainview in a wonderful way. The scenes at the climax, or where he is baptized, or talking about his ambition, those are absolute treat to watch. Though I am an ardent Johnny Depp fan and was fairly disappointed after he didn't win Oscar for ""Sweenny Todd"", but now after watching Day Lewis in this movie, I can hardly complain, and that's saying a lot. A little overshadowed, but equally good is the performance of Paul Dano's too.<br/><br/>The music of Jonny Greenwood has a haunting aspect in it.<br/><br/>Though the movie is a little slow paced and sometimes one will find themselves a little bored, but it's the acting of Daniel Day Lewis which compensate for all of those."
"fred-houpt","9","2","3","26 May 2010"," Outstanding, creepy exposition of the darkest ambitions to power
","There are a number of very good and perceptive reviews of this film. Just a few comments from me then. I have seen Daniel Day-Lewis in only two films, much to my chagrin (now). The Last of the Mohicans was the first and now TWBB. In this film Lewis displays his refined method actors chops and for me it was a frightening embodiment of a really creepy man whose lust for power and wealth ran amok, twisting and subverting his sensibilities much like I imagine a drug addicts mind succumbs to the chemical demons flowing in his veins.<br/><br/>The era of the great oil men at the outset of the oil industry is well covered in novels and movies and this is a very fitting depiction of one of the most Dickensian avenues of American history. When we see pursuit of ambition it is riven with hellish violence that lingers in the memory long after the curtain rises. While I have not read the Upton Sinclair novel ""Oil"", I think that the film stands on its own. Its despair goes a fair stretch deeper than Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" or ""East of Eden"". Funny that I think about it, but the pain in this film much reminds me of the same found in a book I am half way through now, ""The March"", written about General W. T. Sherman's blood soaked march of death and destruction through the deep south in the middle of the US Civil War.<br/><br/>Several themes stand out. The young child that Plainview raises as his own is shown a degree of respect and tenderness until that fateful day when he is nearly killed by a well head explosion. Now suddenly a distraction to the endless hunt for more oil, he is cast aside in a heartless manner; something that will come back to haunt Plainview throughout the story. Second is the powerful tension of contrasts set up between Plainview and Eli Sunday. The mutual loathing and hate these men had for each other grows like a sickly moss until it overcomes them both.<br/><br/>The surface layer themes are all moral and should remind us of the era, still with us, of Bernie Maddoff and ""Gordon Gecko"". Should we cringe when we watch this type of drama? I should say so. Does it not well describe our current ultra consumerist mentality? While we are not all directly involved in the dark deeds, do we not indirectly contribute to questionable acts of environmental degradation and support of highly suspect third world labour pools, all for our own creature comforts? Should we not think on this when we do all the cringing? I don't know where Day-Lewis found that voice of Plainview but it seemingly embodies a man possessed of urges that would make us hide the children and have us slam the door shut. His hypnotic self assured expression of will makes his descent into madness even more unsettling. He richly deserved the Oscar. An excellent and powerful film. (I found the soundtrack very nerve wracking. It felt like someone was running their fingernails down the chalk board, many times over....all to spine tingling effect. The visual special effects were wonderful to watch...)"

"manthatkragokid","10","2","3","28 April 2010"," Blood Runs Thick As Oil: Success Versus Family
","In the first scene of Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood (TWBB), the audience sees protagonist Daniel Plainview break his leg in a gold mining accident. Without respite, he drags himself miles across a desolate valley to exchange his gold for dollars. With this determination Daniel has the ability to achieve his personal goals in spite of their otherwise bewildering difficulty. Yet by expending all of his effort and energy into his profession, he begins to lose hold of his humanity. He yearns for someone who is the same as him; someone strong in a world full of weakness and incompetency. Conflicted between his longing for family and his ambition, Daniel portrays a man who is morally torn and suffers from the same entity that gave him so much wealth; greed. Later on in the first scene Daniel has moved on from mining and has begun oil drilling. After one of his fellow workers dies in an accident, he takes in his child. There is no dialogue so that the viewer can see every nuance of Daniels emotion. Since Daniel took in this man's son on his own accord, it shows at this time in his life he is still has compassion albeit strained continually by those around him. Throughout the film you get a sense that Daniel often has to suffer a fool in his line of business, wearing a smile that always seems to lack sincerity. The films other two main characters, H.W. Plainview and Eli Sunday, are both people who have a thirst for success and power. Although they both do not have nearly the same amount of mental fortitude that Daniel has, they also don't have the same distain for people as he does. Eli constantly surrounds himself with people, and through his congregation he gains power. H.W. has Daniel and Mary, two people who care for him and both raise him to be the person that the audience sees at the end of the movie. Of these three characters only H.W. succeeds and achieves happiness, as he has the cunning and knowledge of his father's trade and the love of his future wife Mary. Eli parishes because he tried to beat Daniel at his own game, and lost everything as a result. Towards the end of the film, H.W. wants to create his own company and break away from his father. Daniel, in his senility and bitterness tells him the truth about his origin and exclaims that ""You have none of me in you"" and claims he doesn't really know who he is. H.W. takes this in stride and even though he feels hurt knows that his father isn't same person that he once was. After this scene the audience sees flashbacks of Daniel and H.W., and that there was a strong bond between them. What remains of Daniel afterwards is only a shell; all of the good that was in him had melted away and only his deplorable qualities remained. The lively Daniel that H.W. grew up contrasts with the reclusive old man that he speaks to.<br/><br/>What pushed Daniel to lose his humility was both the oil accident and his sordid relationship with Henry. Daniel opened up to this imposter, and eventually made him his confident. By having knowing someone who is the same as he is Daniel feels whole again. When Henry's demeanor shows significant weakness, Daniel becomes suspicious; knowing that someone who is blood related to him could not be so feeble. Catching the imposter in his own lies he kills him in a fit of rage and finds himself once again alone. After murdering the imposter, the scene progresses to him looking at a photo of his real brother and breaking into tears. This kind of grief from a man like Daniel tells the audience just how deeply he feels about family. Acclaimed critic Roger Ebert in his review of the film concludes that Daniel has many congruencies between him and Kane from the epic American film Citizen Kane. Ebert believes Daniel as more villainous than Kane since he has no ""Rosebud"", or a saving grace. I disagree with these comparisons, as I feel that Daniel has the makings of a good man. Ebert claims that Daniel despises all men. While this could be argued as true, it must be noted that Daniel does not despise children, since they are not contaminated by the vices of their parents. Amidst conversation with Henry the audience are shown that Daniel wanted children even as he was growing up. TWBB shows that, while oil is the source of Daniel's success it also serves as his undoing. When talking to the representatives of Standard Oil, Daniel is offered one million dollars; an enormous amount given the times. In response, he says with a hint of sadness in his voice ""What will I do with myself?"" He had worked his entire life to become wealthy and to simply lie down and take the easy way out definitely did not sit well with him. Moreover, he becomes infuriated when he told if he takes the offer he could take care of his son. Daniel lost a lot of his humility when H.W. lost his hearing, and when his ""brother"" turns out to be an imposter there was no hope for him. As if all of this was not enough, everything he cared about slipped away from him; with only meaningless wealth remaining. There Will Be Blood is in many respects a tragedy. A man who in the material sense has so much can really have very little when he lives without a purpose. Anderson takes Daniel Day Lewis's acting to the pinnacle of his ability, and through their interpretation of Plainview portrays the greed that encompassed early 20th century America. Success and wealth will not suit a man without family and love. Prosperity requires all of these things; otherwise we will become as empty and unhappy as Daniel Plainview."
"crossrad","9","2","3","25 April 2010"," After watching this, if you ever think about the early days of drilling for oil, you will remember this film
","In this film you will see oil drilling at the turn of the twentieth century with an authenticity, detail and vividness which is breathtaking. The craftsmanship in the making of this film achieves an incredible realism in the oil derricks and equipment so that you are not left feeling that you can see the joins and feeling cheated. The DVD I have has a 15-minute extra which relates clips from the film with actual photographs taken during the period, so you can see the degree of accuracy achieved.<br/><br/>But the film is strong on many layers, not just the documentary but also the presentation of real characters you can identify with so that you experience, not just see, the hardship, danger and brutality of the time and place. The characters are real and multi-faceted, with the plot being driven by logic rather than the political goals of the film makers.<br/><br/>The film does have a few flaws, one of which is having Paul Dano playing both Paul Sunday and his brother Eli. Paul Sunday is instrumental in tipping off Danial about the new oil field on his family's land, and I kept waiting for him to reappear. However the actor is now playing Eli and everyone's forgotten about Paul's existence. And there are a few gaps - how did Danial get to the Assayer's office with a broken leg? But the bottom line is that this is a film I won't forget. Before seeing it, if I thought of early oil drilling I would remember ""Boom Town"" (1940) but from now on I will think of ""There will Be Blood""."
"pgsev-1","10","2","3","1 April 2010"," Best Movie of the Decade
","I know, I know, many will disagree with me on my title, but I stand by it. In my humble opinion there was not a better made, acted, written, or scored movie from 00' to 09'. I was stunned when No Country for Old Men beat this movie as best picture. The movie is slow, but the story requires a pace of that nature. If Paul Thomas Anderson did not show the viewers the paintstakingly, slow, struggles it took for an independent oil man making his way in the blossoming world of ""big oil"" than this movie would have never worked. That, coupled with quite possibly one of the best acting performances of all-time by Daniel Day Lewis, and you have, again, the best movie of the decade. Lewis scored with this film not only because he nailed the determined, driven, and often-times, nasty character of Daniel Plainview, but in the scenes where there was no dialouge, his expressions, gestures, and physical acting took over. The score, by Jonny Greenwood (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination because of ridiculous Academy rules), works on every level in every scene. Without it, this movie may not have had half the emotion it did. P.T. Anderson is the best American director out there, I have LOVED every film of his, and may be biased as a result of my appreciation of his style. But regardless, if you have not seen this movie, give it a try, and definitely wait through the slow moving first hour or so, as it picks up pace, and eventually ends with knock-out punch that I did not anticipate."
"Greatornot","10","2","3","11 September 2009"," Can you say AWESOME
","This was a genius film. Much better movie than NO COUNTRY. This should have won best picture. Ironically filmed in same parts of Texas as NO COUNTRY. Daniel Day Lewis gave an awesome performance as Mr. Daniel Plainview.. Early 1900s oilman. His interaction with Paul Dano who played identical twins was spectacular. Basically Mr. Plainview met his match in unassuming but sanctimonious Reverend Eli Sunday. Mr. Plainview did whatever he could , used whomever he could to get ahead. Murder, mayhem, he was a ruthless oilman, a conman to be sure. This movie was a chess match between the 2.Mr. Sunday was not exactly as pure as he portrayed himself to his congregation. One scene in particular that took place in the church is perhaps one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The closest character that came to mind to compare to Mr. Plainview was Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko . Both , ironically , won academy awards , well deserved for their roles. This movie comes to an unexpected last scene that just adds to this fantastic entertainment. Rarely do I see movies that are about 2 and half hrs that you do not want to end. This movie is one of those . You have to be at optimum alertness at all times. This is a pure intellectual film that is well written, well scripted and well acted by all. Do not miss a second of this film that will have one twist after another."
"darkteam_manu","10","2","3","23 July 2009"," There's more than just blood..
","Daniel Day-Lewis delivers an emotionally-draining performance as Daniel Plainview, a California oil tycoon whose greed and visceral need for vengeance allow us to view what is arguably one of the most bone-chilling and emotionally corrupt characters in movie history.<br/><br/>This movie was revolutionary in my eyes because of the introduction of a new style of character, and a deviation from the standard movie plot. The film revolves around the life of this character Daniel Plainview and it is an exploration of character above all. It is not the type of movie that will please the majority of movie-goers, and this movie was released around the time of a similarly deviant movie in No Country For Old Men, and most of the plaudits go to the latter.<br/><br/>This movie is profound and compelling, it explores a number of themes and it is definitely a movie with a mature aspect to it. I highly recommend seeing a film like this, because although its relative calmness, it is a unique plot, and coming across such a powerful acting performance such as Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal in this movie will be difficult. It is my personal favorite movie of all time."

"schell-7","9","2","3","23 March 2009"," Renews hope that film can hold its own with a great Faulkner novel.
","The acting, the settings, the cinematography, the uncompromising editing (rejecting the familiar shot/reverse shot relay in favor of long takes), the spectacular scene of a fiery oil strike (recalling the air strike in ""Apocalypse Now""), the nuanced richness of the film score, the Olympian performance of Day-Lewis (perhaps only Orson Welles' Kane compares) require that anyone who is the least bit serious about film make this experience a top priority.<br/><br/>But the end of this disturbing spectacle doesn't produce the catharsis of either a ""Citizen Kane"" (whose protagonist has at least an intimation of the truth, i.e. Rosebud) or an ""Oedipus Rex"" (whose protagonist not only eventually acquires self-knowledge but acts on it), and for that reason I'm withholding a star. Films that are ultimately the most powerful and enduring are those that put the verisimilitude of ""everyday life"" first and foremost, leaving the deeper allegorical implications to those who choose to pursue them.<br/><br/>At the half-way point, the film takes a surrealistic turn, and more than likely many spectators who have begun this lengthy film (with Lewis dominating every shot and scene save one) will tune out. It's even more likely that most casual spectators will, at the end of this seemingly out-of-control scenario, simply breathe a sigh of relief that it's over and dismiss the whole business as wild and wacky, crazy stuff.<br/><br/>But now that I've seen the film, it's become rooted in consciousness much like a Faulkner novel, in which a single character (named Compson or Sutpen) comes to represent an entire culture, from its idealistic, heroic and noble beginnings to its delusional and narcissistic, pathetic and decadent end (Faulkner's thunderous ""Absalom! Absalom!"" is the modern prototype). You will see no blood in this film. That would require a character capable of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, of being not merely the sole god of his universe (who abandons his son, after denying that he's even begotten him) but the lamb, willing to sacrifice himself for others and able to function as a member of a human family whose bonds are not merely the artificial ones based on greed, radical individualism, and unrelenting competitiveness. Instead, we are left with the certainty that the ambition and arrogance we have witnessed can only beget more needless destruction of human life. In that sense, there indeed will be blood.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is especially relevant to our present political-economic situation (toward the end of the film a character makes reference to a bad ""economy""--and the year is 1927, 2 years before 1929--or, if you prefer, 2009). But it hits even deeper and closer to home than the culture surrounding us. It doesn't require a lot of soul-searching to see the protagonist as a symbol, or magnified reflection, of one's own selfish journey in life. The discovery is more than a little disturbing, exposing the wounds of ethnic pride, family insularity and, above all, the constant denial and prideful isolation practiced by the willful self. Nonetheless, the film ultimately fails to achieve the delicate balance between ""pity and fear"" that Aristotle required of great tragedy. Daniel Day-Lewis's character is obviously fatally flawed if not hubris personified (the other part of the Aristotelian definition), and that's a pity of immense proportions--but no more.<br/><br/>Later: This is a film that continues to play out long after the final scene. If there's a hint of redemptive blood in the story, it's not in the protagonist but his son. The early shots of him as a baby are sufficient proof to this viewer that Daniel Plainview is (despite his final disclaimer that he took the child merely to promote sales) the boy's father and that the son is not a mere innocent claimed by the father as a sales gimmick. The spectator's ""reward"" occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the ""deaf-mute"" son respond to his father's voice. That moment tells us that the son has deliberately chosen an indirect, defensive route of communicating with a non-communicative father, wisely (as it turns out) hedging his bets should the father prove adamant and unyielding in his bloodless inhumanity. The son, not the father, has seen to the completion of the ""Abraham-Isaac"" story, an archetypal drama that offers hope for a future in which the son, rather than repeat the sins of the father, acquires an identity of his own."
"freemantle_uk","10","2","3","20 March 2009"," Fantastic Moral Drama
","This is my first Paul Thomas Anderson film that I have seen, but I am aware that he is a critically acclaimed director. After see There Will Be Blood I see why he is the darling of the Art-House scene.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on the Upton Sinclair novel Oil. The film focuses on Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). He is a silver miner in 1898 who finds land that has gold and silver. He buys the claims and discovers oil. He quickly moves into the oil drilling business and becomes successful, and goes around California buying oil claims. One day a worker dies and Daniel takes care of the child, raising him as his own. One day a young man Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) tells Daniel of a possible claim in a town called Little Boston. Little Boston is poor community in a dry landscape. Daniel buys the land for a cheap price, and a part of the deal is he gives $5,000 to Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, again) for his church. Daniel offers to invest in the community and build up the church, a school and farming. However, Daniel and Eli come into conflict. Eli offers to give the derrick a blessing. Daniel seems to agree, but snubs Eli in public, blessing the well himself. After that event one of Daniel workers die in an accident. Daniel goes to Eli's church for the funeral arrangements and discovers he is a faith healer. Eli blames Daniel for the accident because Eli didn't get to do the blessing. Another accident happens at the derrick and Daniel's son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) becomes deaf. Eli is unable to heal the child and he picks the worst time to ask for his money. Daniel struggles to deal with H.W.'s new disability. He ends up sending his son to San Francisco by himself. Daniel focuses all his efforts on his business, trying to make as much money as possible and signing a lucrative deal with Union Oil to make a pipeline to the ocean. As well both Daniel and Eli try to humiliate each other and brings the other one down.<br/><br/>The main theme of the film is the corrupting effects, and Daniel looses all his sense of morality and would destroy anyone who gets in his way. Other elements of the story is the efforts of religion as a uniting force and the father/son relationship. There Will Be Blood also similar to a western, there American spirit to look for land and wealth, but takes it from an new angle. It could be possible also to think of the film as a criticism of the oil industry and American government, only showing interest in areas and communities if the offer something in return. They is also the willingness of businessmen to bride local communities to get their own way and make sure they give people the worst possible deal.<br/><br/>They is a strong script. Paul Thomas Anderson is a skilled director, showing some look shots of the harsh area, but makes you feel a part of the action with little tricks like the splash of oil on the camera. He tackled the issues really well and you care for the character, especially unlikeable characters. PTA also gets the details of period just right. I will be looking out for more PTA films. The acting is excellent. Paul Dano was good as Eli who played him as a zeal but very weak character. Daniel Day Lewis deserved his Oscar and he played his role with real relish. You could actually be interested in him and what he does.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood reminded me of the HBO programme Deadwood, especially because Daniel Plainview seemed like Al Swearengen if Swearengen was a legitimate businessman. The other element being that both There Will Be Blood and Deadwood are historical drama and revisionist westerns. There Will Be Blood also reminded me of Citizen Kane because they look at a similar theme, the moral destruction of the character.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a fantastic film."

In order to fully appreciate this motion picture you must like art. It is imperative that you enjoy art. It is imperative that you enjoy acting. It is imperative that you do not look to explosions and special effects for entertainment. If you enjoyed No Country for old men and Ammadeus you may well very much enjoy this picture.<br/><br/>This film does not 'entertain'. It is a long walk on a journey of the mind. It's hard to describe it and since others have no doubt done a better job I won't try.<br/><br/>Daniel Fairview is an 'oil man' with a grande strategy for making his work come to fruition whilst reaping large financial benefits. That's about as much as you really need to know, that and throughout the film all you are really aware of is his greed, anger, hatred and quiet benign of everything and everyone in the world around him. That's about as much as you really need to know, the rest follows swiftly behind.<br/><br/>It's very hard to grade this film because as much as I enjoyed it and come close to giving it a 9 or a ten, it's very difficult because I don't think I would watch it again.<br/><br/>*spoiler* It is worth the entire duration of the film to view the final act.

Way too long, with a soundtrack that has to tell you every minute how important the movie is, poor character development, especially in motivation understanding. All four of us came out of the theater, looked at each other and said ""Well that sucked"". Anderson seems way too impressed with himself to spend any time with the real work of directing. The contrast between this movie and ""No Country For Old Men"" is stark, and ""There Will Be Blood"" suffers greatly in comparison. I'll really be upset if TWBB wins Best Movie and Best Director this year."
"damorton","10","8","21","14 December 2007"," One of the Best Films of the Year
","With new TV missing in action, the cinema has provided some excellent jewels to turn to during the coming holiday season. With two of my personal favorites already in wider release, ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" I can add one more title to the short list of must-see films: P.T. Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood."" Having been quite the admirer of Mr. Anderson's work, even through the admirable misfire of ""Magnolia,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" marks the director's strongest work yet.<br/><br/>An adaptation of Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" traces the capitalist ambition of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an up and coming oil prospector. While he begins the film with a certain humility, personally digging oil wells himself and taking on the orphan (Dillon Freasier) of a fallen colleague as his own son, Daniel gradually falls into a state of absolute greed. However, unlike the typical rags to riches story whose fallen heroes often find self-destruction through material goods, Daniel is not driven by money or women. As he venomously discloses to his brother, ""I have a competition in me; I want no one else to succeed. I hate most peopleÂ…I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone. I can't keep doing this on my own, with these...people."" This contempt, like the oil in Plainview's well, slowly begins to bubble to the surface, coming to a full eruption when confronted with Pastor Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). Plainview, attempting to acquire the land in which Eli's family lives, is confronted with the young man's informed business sense is and forced to fund a church for the town. Plainview quickly comes to the realization that like himself, Eli is a charlatan, misleading the town people while attempting to drain the town in his own way. Ultimately, this contempt forces Plainview to sinister means in his continued attempt for absolute success, drawing Sinclair and Anderson's critique of rugged individualist greed to crescendo.<br/><br/>Much has been written about Anderson's cinematic style and his continual citation of Martin Scorsese and, perhaps more frequently, Robert Altman, to whom Anderson served as an assistant and has dedicated the film to. While traces of Altman's ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" highlight Anderson's gritty and, ultimately existentially hopeless, view of the West, the film is perhaps more in debt to the work of Stanley Kubrick. One can sense within ""There Will Be Blood"" a similar treatment of gradual social alienation that propels ""The Shining."" While the beautiful cinematography of Robert Elswit re-enforces this reading, perhaps the largest marker of Anderson's homage to Kubrick comes from his use of music, specifically string cues (composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood). Through the clashing echo of strings, Anderson raises Plainview's mental disintegration to a visceral level, pushing the viewer towards the anxiety shared by the protagonist.<br/><br/>Of course, much of Plainview's mental state relies on the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. Finding himself in a similar role to the sociopathic Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting in Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York,"" Day-Lewis's seething performance stands as one of the year's best. From the slow progression from teeth-gritting resentment to the drooling hatred of a junkyard dog, Day-Lewis hits all of his marks perfectly without overplaying the material penned by Anderson. Day-Lewis meets his match with the strong performance of Paul Dano. Casting aside the mute persona he established in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" Dano brings a tremendous amount of energy to the malicious role of Eli. Through the work of Day-Lewis, Dano, and a strong supporting cast (including Ciaran Hinds), Anderson has yet again proved himself as an actor's director.<br/><br/>Unlike his work in ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia,"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" Anderson brings a great deal of restraint to ""There Will Be Blood."" While the film has some of his trademark long-takes, the film, much like David Fincher's work on ""Zodiac"" earlier this year, contains little style for style's sake. Instead, bringing himself back towards the aesthetic of his superb ""Hard Eight,"" Anderson lets his gift for writing and direction of actors guide the film. Through this intense and rewarding collaboration, Anderson has struck his own reservoir of Texas tea. Let's just hope the success doesn't push him to the same lengths as Plainview's."
"MarinaKadir","10","1","1","28 June 2020"," Absolute best movie of 2007
","My opinion from technical aspect is the amazing score composed by Johnny Greenwood. Music was used in this film to heighten the emotion. Example, in the burning oil derrick, the score consist of string instrumental that evokes anxiety. Another brilliant way for Anderson to use music, he uses it to foreshadow for future consequence. Like when Daniel Plainview and his imposter step-brother en route to Bandy's ranch, the scene has neutral atmosphere yet the background music is anxiety-inducing, panic sort of. Then, the lighting setup in this looks very naturalistic despite in behind the scene, they are using tons of spotlight during production. The amount of efforts they put to make the shot worked should be appreciated. Personally, I was surprised to know this film's budget is the same amount from his older work, Punch-Drunk Love because of how ambitious and precise it look in this film more than Punch-Drunk Love. Great performance from Daniel Day Lewis too, who's giving this sort of over-the-top acting.
On surface level, this film is great for character study and the plot. Its interesting event what makes mainstream audience who's unfamiliar with cinema, could enjoy. Also for people who are into films they could observe on deeper level like Plainview's psychology, subtleties performance and still enjoy it. This is another amazing movie by Paul Thomas Anderson, which he wrote his character as a normal human being with complexity instead of objectifying it into a caricature. We as the viewer might dislike Plainview, but we still could empathize with his tragedy from his childhood, things he went through building his own oil empire. Personally, in first act I was impressed by its subtlety with less dialogue, second act by the production design and characters development while on third act by its high emotional impact. I also think this is that intelligent type of film, with repeated watching you could pick up new detail everytime."

"isaaacso","10","1","1","13 May 2020"," Search for Transcendence
","Why do we do what we do? What is the ulterior meaning of our acts? These kinds of questions constantly haunt my head, and it was in one of those thoughts that I found what underlies Daniel Plainview's character: life is only worth it when you have a reason.<br/><br/>It is no wonder that the American ethos has been built on an ambivalence: religion, the worship of the god of Christianity; and capitalism, the cult of ""self-made"" man. Max Weber (in 1905, the year that surrounds the setting of the film) originally established the relationship between the evangelical creed and its influence on the prevailing economic system today through the religious value of work and discipline. One of the interesting places of Weber's analysis is his prophetic spirit with respect to the capitalist essence: in modernity, human beings would be engaged in their work, in technique, but devoid of any sense of transcendence (that Protestantism allowed with life after death). Modern man would be thrown into consumption for the simple fact of consuming, work and survival as ends in themselves, without any further meaning. Modern man would be Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>We are, mainly, before the man in search of meaning; a radical modern Charles Foster Kane. The film is a faithful reflection of the human condition; that, we could say, that underlies every human being: wandering aimlessly through life, without a sense of transcendence, subject only to our instincts (the desire for distinction and protection, mainly).<br/><br/>Faced with this apocalyptic scenario, it is essential to direct efforts in the search for a meaning that consoles existence. Our protagonist finds that consolation in the family, and that is the only possibility of escaping from the existential abyss in which he finds himself.<br/><br/>Returning to Max Weber, the figure of Eli Sunday would represent precisely American society. Protestantism has become a simple servant of the capitalist spirit, the sense of transcendence with which it once ingratiated its faithful has been replaced by mere instrumentality. Eli Sunday is one more representation of the disease that afflicts modern society: his efforts are exclusively focused on the search for power and distinction. And it is from the inherent competitiveness of the society in which this dispute between Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano is forged. Plainview sees in Eli Sunday a representation of himself ... and Daniel Plainview detests himself.<br/><br/>Needless to say, in terms of execution the film has no errors. I mention some of its virtues:
<ul><li>The maturation of the well-known sequence shots of Paul Thomas Anderson towards multiple frames (where the most characteristic is the Paul Sunday scene); and the masterful elaboration of the scene with which the film opens.</li><li>The photograph of Robert Elswit who conceived one of my favorite scenes: the fire of the drilling rig.</li><li>The best soundtrack that Jonny Greenwood has composed to date, where I highlight ""Open Spaces"", ""Oil"" and ""Proven Lands""; obviously impressive is the extract from Brahms that appears when they open the oil derrick and with which the film closes.</li><li>The inclusion of amateur actors gives the film an enviable naturalness, the church congregation and the oil workers are more than correct. It is enough to appreciate a simple detail: the position that HW (Dillon Freasier) takes when firing the shotgun.</li><li>And Daniel Day-Lewis, who is simply spectacular. You can blame him for whatever you want but there is a detail in his performance that forces me to classify it as my favorite male performance: his eyes; how is such a level of independence of the eyes possible!</li></ul>"
"a-65018","8","1","1","12 May 2020"," The truth hurts
","The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past..."

","His is a film directed by the acclaimed auteur, Paul Thomas Anderson, and it is based on the titular novel by Upton Sinclair. There Will Be Blood is an exceptional character study, a commentary on the nature of human, and more specifically American, ambition, and a great piece of historical fiction. The film casts Daniel Day-Lewis in the role of Daniel Plainview, an oilman by his own admission and one of the first Americans who initiated the oil drilling industry that would later conquer the whole world. Day-Lewis creates a fascinating character who dominates the screen from the beginning until the end of the movie's runtime with his peculiar accent, quirky expression, and commanding persona. Daniel's antagonist in the movie is Eli, a Christian pastor who cuts a deal with Plainview to start the drilling in his family's land. The two characters will clash in the course of the movie and they will have an unforgettable showdown sequence in the end. Oil serves as a symbol of blood in the movie's universe, hence the title.<br/><br/>Daniel cannot trust other people and he has trouble connecting with them. He says: ""There are times when I look at people and see nothing worth liking"". He also admits that he hates seeing other people succeeding in their business. Daniel Plainview is pure American ambition plain and simple. He knows how to manipulate others and take advantage of them. When an unknown individual claiming to be his lost brother appears, Daniel's inherent mistrust becomes all the more evident. Paul Thomas Anderson focuses on the relationship between Daniel and his adopted son H. W. Plainview. In the beginning, the director implies that Daniel uses H. W. to easier convince other people to buy their land. It is always better to appear as a family man who cares for his 10-year-old son and wants only the best for him. It is all about appearances and the initials H. W. perhaps stand for ""Human Worker"". Nevertheless, as the story unfolds we watch Daniel expressing something that resembles true emotion for his adopted son and the audience begins to question the true nature of their relationship. When an accident occurs in the drilling site and H. W. loses his hearing, Daniel's true feelings come forward.<br/><br/>The tension between Daniel and Eli is palpable from their first meeting and escalates as the plot unravels. Eli is the son of Abel, the landowner, and twin brother of the young man who initially notified Daniel about the existence of oil in their family land. Eli is not an especially likable character as he seems to be equally cunning and manipulative as Daniel is. In his sermons, he claims to be the personification of the Spirit and a healer of any kind of physical or psychological pain. Daniel instantly feels aversion to Eli as he has no faith in God as well as anything or anyone above himself. In the monumental ending scene, he will force Eli to recite those words: ""I am a false prophet and God is nothing but a superstition"".<br/><br/>The battle for power between those two great characters is the main plot device that advances the story. It is essentially a battle for America's soul: God vs. Money. Nevertheless, the main character is Daniel and there is hardly a single shot in the film where he is not present. The editing of There Will Be Blood is truly exceptional with relatively lengthy shots and close-ups to the protagonists' faces where the audience can read the strife for power in their eyes and facial expressions. Except for Daniel Day-Lewis, all the members of the cast deliver memorable performances such as Paul Dano's who plays both Paul and Eli Sunday. This is a film that many will find boring as the story picks up speed after the 3/4ds of the movie's runtime. The audience should be patient and observe every single detail on the screen to be able to assess this movie as a whole. The film offers some valuable insights into human nature, family relationships, and the nature of wealth as well as its effect on the people."
"amanmsp","10","1","1","11 April 2020"," An in-depth character study of a man driven by his unending desire for control
","The movie deals with the competitive and manipulative nature of men and the desire for total control. Daniel Day Lewis, in his Oscar winning role, gives one of the best performances in cinema history as he plays Daniel Plainview, an oilman who is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate any possible competition against him, in-order to attain total control. He employs whatever means necessary, regardless of how vicious it may be, for achieving his goal. He is disgusted by the idea of someone else attaining a similar status as his. He even goes as far as denying the existence of God, inorder to cement his position at the top. Eventhough it results in him being an extremely successful businessman, his deeds eventually destroys him emotionally and psychologically. Day Lewis once again proved that he is one of the most versatile actors ever as he completely disappears in the role, giving us one of the most memorable movie villains ever.<br/><br/>Another remarkable performance was from Paul Dano who plays a priest named Eli Cash. Dano manages to shine bright, despite sharing screen with a legend like Day Lewis. Despite being very different individuals, Daniel and Eli are essentially two sides of the same coin since their ultimate goals are the same. Eli as a priest, manipulates the people of his town using their superstitious religious beliefs, in-order to establish himself as a commanding figure.<br/><br/>Written and Directed exceptionally by Paul Thomas Anderson, the movie hooks you and keeps you engrossed throughout its whole runtime without a single dull moment. The cinematography by Robert Elswit, which won a well deserved Oscar, was genuinely mindblowing. Another praiseworthy aspect was its incredible production design which manages to successfully recreate the time period of the early 1900s. The score by Johnny Greenwood was also fantastic. All these aspects combined with the magnificent performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano helped the movie to cement its position as one of the greatest movies ever made."

Daniel Day-Lewis was phenomenal-in fact all of the cast was superb.
I just didn't understand the motivation for Plainview to be so horrid. I guess I was let down because it's hard for us as humans to admit that the bad guy does often win.
Then, again, Eli wasn't such a good guy.
I just was confused by what I was supposed to feel at the end. When the movie ended after the bowling alley scene, I literally said ""wtf?"" 2 1/2 hours and that's how it ends?
I love period pieces though, and I adored the grit and grime, but I always need the question ""why"" answered for me.

","21 January 2008. Warning: Spoilers. It's rare that a technically flawed movie can survive to be an excellent movie. Because of a great story and strong acting, this movie even with its problems it is able to overcome them. The very beginning the problems with this movie are apparent with the music that is more associated with horror and science fiction. There is a point in the movie where strains of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem to flow over the musical tones. There is another section of the movie where industrial, early nineteenth century mechanical sounds become apparent and last too long into the scene drowning out the natural landscape sounds. The music was intrusive and inconsistent. Also at the beginning, there is a fascinating look at isolated, primitive prospecting. Yet, when the accidents keep coming, they seem more for script convenience then anything else. How many times would a prospector understand how heavy his tools are and be unable to use a single pulley to lift them out of his small shaft? How careful would a prospector learn to be of his makeshift ladder? A more convincing injured person's crawl can be found in the wonderful Touching the Void (2004) about an injured mountain climber. It is confusing about who the characters are in the beginning and if they are the same person and the transition from mining ore to oil occurs. There's not enough spent on the ore transaction as likely the entrance into the oil business. Does Daniel Plainview really have all these other oil rigs or is he lying about them? He doesn't seem to be directly involved with any of the other rigs at all, ever as he seems to imply in his speeches. His first attempt at a speech is focused almost entirely on him even though as important is the interaction between Mr. Plainview as his rather hostile audience that we can only catch glimpses of. The relationship between Mr. Plainview and his boy becomes more and more ambiguous as well as the boy's own antisocial behavior midway into the movie. There is a inordinate lapse between the boy's accident and his rehabilitation. There is the use of a flashback regarding the accidental death of a worker that seemed to serve no purpose. As a character study, Mr. Plainview isn't of course plain at all and unfortunately the audience is left with many unanswered questions and for all the focus and great acting by Daniel Day-Lewis, Mr. Plainview's character still remains a mysterious, so much so that the audience is left wondering whether to pity him or hate him. Mr. Plainview's outbursts as with what happens to Eli Sunday through out the movie, seems to have a possible source, but again such outbursts appear sometimes more apt to come from a crazed individual. His Daniel Day-Lewis's character actually crazed. For all these problems, the movie is compelling and captivating for its various themes and emotional performances. The man of God versus the businessman (a businessman who seems to be a serious version of The Music Man (1962) about a con man as a traveling salesman. We never understand what makes Mr. Plainview tick, but his behavior on screen is so gripping and intense that we can forget the reasons and experience the tragedy itself. A likely candidate for best actor and best supporting actor nominations are in order. An even though, There Will Be Blood deserves a Best Picture nomination, its imperfections should deny it the Best Picture Award, at least technically speaking. Nine out of Ten Stars."

This strangely gripping if bladder-fillingly long saga has a beautiful flair for visual storytelling compounded by a fantastic though heavy-lifting score, that's as ominous as the piece's prophetic title, and a one-of-a-kind powerhouse performance that sneaks up on you to end with one of the scariest character-driven scenes of recent years. There are stretches which stretch the pace, of course, and its apparent lack of narrative may be frustrating if you're not willing to reflect retroactively on its themes, ideas and, most importantly, character arcs. While the journey each individual takes may seem subtle on the surface, it is really within the expertly-written characters that the picture finds its purpose, an exploration of the people who don't always say what they are thinking but are thankfully clearly thinking something, and its a real treat to dissect every single moment that a simple side-ways glance or overt outburst of furious anger gives us a glimpse behind the eyes of some of the best characters in recent memory. 8/10"

The problem with this film is that nothing happens at all. There really isn't much of a plot to it and the ""twists and turns"" are hackneyed and can be seen a mile away.

","Miramax proves they don't need the Weinsteins to market over-hyped, critic's darlings. We're talking about the studio that stole best picture Oscars in 1996 from Fargo and 1998 from Saving Private Ryan, and got nominations from movies that were okay but not great like Chocolat. I even think there were far better movies in 1999 than the Oscar winner, American Beauty, but you be the judge of that. This movie, if marketed normally, would've tanked in the box office. Here's how they do it: Show it to a handful of critics by year's end, who'll start the buzz and put it in top-ten lists. Premiere it in one or two art houses in New York and L.A., who are obviously going to be sold out because people wanting to see what all the fuzz is about. The thing goes in crecendo, the movie wins some nominations, premiere it in more theaters. Wins some Oscars, do a wide release. By then, the film is bad-word-of-mouth proof. As in ""Gangs of New York"" Daniel Day Lewis' performance overpowers the film and turns it into a one-man show. Only his scenes with Paul Dano have some balance and are in fact the film's most entertaining exchanges. Not a bad film at all, just a bit overrated."

"ggb1788","8","5","12","16 February 2008"," Flawed Gem -- Spoiler
","I really enjoyed this movie, which I thought was virtually flawless for the first two thirds: realistic, authentic, original. Starting with the scene in which the son tells his father he wants to leave to start his own drilling company, though, I found the acting became stylized, as opposed to naturalistic, a real shift in tone. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of Nicholson in ""The Shining."" Even the last line, after the murder, seems like a joke, perhaps the only funny line in the entire very somber film. Why the shift? What was the director trying to accomplish by changing from realism (which works well for this film of Naturalistic themes) to stylization. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Folks have commented on the ""Citizen Kane"" quotes, which I think are done in really interesting ways. For example, if Kane is famous for deep focus, here we see Kane-like scenes in incredibly shallow focus. The music's fantastic, drawing attention to itself in ways that break the rules of traditional film-making, really adding dimension to the narrative and characterizations."
"mrethanboy","10","5","12","22 January 2008"," A distinctly American masterpiece
","Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" or Modest Mouse's ""The Lonesome Crowded West"", ""There Will Be Blood"" is a distinctly American masterpiece. Its overriding themes of religion, greed, family and loneliness converge to evoke a desperation that could only have come from the oil rush gripping our country in the early 1900's. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a sprawling epic nourished through the umbilical of oil barons, railroads and the vast, desolate West.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"", ""Punch-Drunk Love""), the film is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"" However, only the film's atmosphere and landscape are informed by Sinclair's portrayal of the oil business. The actual plot of ""Blood"" is wholly different, an intricate story of fictional oil entrepreneur Daniel Plainview and his battle with the disordered world that surrounds him.<br/><br/>Plainview is a misanthropist who paradoxically seeks companionship even as he loathes mankind in general. His investment in oil is motivated entirely by his desire to earn enough money to escape civilization altogether. He loathes religion, dismissing it as a superstition, and entertains human interaction only when he calculates that it is crucial to his oil mining. Daniel Day-Lewis' (""Gangs of New York"", ""My Left Foot"") gripping portrayal of Plainview cannot be over-estimated. His willful stage presence lends the film a searing intensity that both counteracts and complements the film's measured pacing.<br/><br/>Yet while the story is certainly rich with detail and subtlety, There Will Be Blood is hardly a film of words. At times fifteen full minutes will pass without any dialogue at all. The space that fills these stretches of silence greatly enhances the film's sense of space and desolation. Even when characters do speak, nobody says more than necessary. Words are carefully chosen and tersely delivered, and there is much to be read between the lines.<br/><br/>Instead of leaning on dialogue, much of the film's force comes from its gorgeous cinematography. Meticulously detailed and breathtakingly beautiful, There Will Be Blood is visually arresting from the film's beginning to its conclusion. Similarly, the score (composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood) greatly accentuates the film's most dramatic moments. Yet while the music itself is impeccable, the way that Anderson employs it is even more impressive. Violins and sparse percussion rise and fall at unexpected moments, carefully cultivating a sense of unease while still managing to feel natural and well considered.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most incredible thing about ""There Will Be Blood"" is its minimalism. In spite of its long runtime (which approaches three hours), the film never feels indulgent or overly complex. Anderson slows down the pacing of the film to a deliberate lurch. This might frustrate impatient viewers, but the approach is ultimately makes the film's several climaxes more rewarding and its emotional peaks more stunning.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is both visceral and cerebral, the rare film that combines the raw emotion of our most human instincts with smart, well-conceived film-making techniques. Well worth the hype and capable of meeting even your wildest expectations, Anderson's latest is truly a masterpiece of American cinema."

","This movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis as the breakout actor of this decade. Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.<br/><br/>Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.<br/><br/>The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.<br/><br/>The break-out acting by Daniel Day-Lewis peaks by the end, in which all subtlety is abandoned in a closing scene bound to be a Hollywood classic. Maybe in the future, alongside the likes of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" or ""Stella!"", will be a most memorable movie line, ""I. DRINK. YOUR. MILKSHAKE!!!!!! I DRINK IT UP!!!"""

","PTA really needs to get over himself. He is far from a great filmmaker. Although I quite enjoyed the movie and am glad I saw it, I think there are many flaws in the sketchy (as in lightly sketched vs deep) storytelling of There Will Be Blood. Where is the character depth, the motivations, the background and the context to these events and this man's tale? <br/><br/>I did enjoy the tipping see-saw balance of power between Plainview and the Preacher. I do not, however, share everyone's accolades for Paul Dano. He did his best, but he was ill-suited for this role as a morally ambiguous preacher.<br/><br/>Also -- SPOILER -- the part when Plainview rubs mud in the preacher's mouth came out of nowhere! Huh?<br/><br/>-- end spoiler-- <br/><br/>The only thing that maintained my interest in this movie was the intensity and ferocity of the magnificent performance by Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>Although I have to begrudgingly admit that the director was, in part, responsible for eliciting such a stunningly fierce and chilling performance, I doubt very much that even a crappy director would be left with a crappy performance from Day Lewis. I just don't think he's capable of giving less than his all. He is truly one of the greatest actors of our generation. <br/><br/>Also the film's score is a complete joke and the fault largely resides with the choices of this oftentimes pretentious and perverse director. The score is far too attention seeking and emotionally inconsistent. Although I applaud a director that takes a risk with an atypical score for a Hollywood movie, this one misfires too often to be considered successful.<br/><br/>Still, There Will Be Blood is definitely worth seeing, for Daniel Day Lewis, for a decent yet bare-bones story and for seeing what not to do when you are at the helm of a big Hollywood movie with a large budget."

However, the storyline and the cinematography carry this movie well. In fact, I was planning on giving this movie a 9 until the last 20 minutes.

"pc95","6","4","9","8 March 2008"," Slow Paced Bizarre tale of Greed...loses narrative pull
","There Will Be Blood immediately rips off musical theming from The Shining. No shame in doing so I guess. As a period piece it is quite competent...dialog, settings, costumes all very well done and seemed believable for an early 20th century western frontier. Dialog is somewhat sparse, but camera-work fills in for it. However, the movie's narrative base is more or less a tale of greed/competition and how it drives and perverts the main character Daniel Plainview (Oscar won for by Daniel Day Lewis here) in his relationships with those around him - particularly between his adopted son and a young split-personality preacher. As a self-proclaimed oil-man Daniel is a slightly paranoid incredulous pessimist who is predatory on all those who stand in the way of his greed. There is also an apparent mockery of religion which is built mostly on a vendetta developed throughout the story between the preacher and Oil-man who prays on the trust of the religious. The movie is slow-paced but not necessarily dull. The main character however never grows or seems to learn - so there's a sad repetition in his behavior of insecurity and lashing out. This begins to wear thin - there's no other dynamic. Unfortunately, the last 20 min of the movie are kind of absurd as the director and screenplay writer decided to go off on a tangent and leave the settings and support characters abruptly that had worked earlier on to build up...and then jolt us with a mean-spirited charade of gratuitous violence - becoming a pretentious gimmick. As it is the movie loses its pull and unfortunately cant recover off the epilogue scenes. Perhaps worth a viewing for good acting and production points."

But not for this."
"christian94","8","4","9","14 February 2008"," Oscar Favorite Has Plenty Going For It
","The Academy has been keeping on eye on writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA)'s work as a modern voice of cinema. It has been ten years since Boogie Nights (1997) was nominated for Best Screenplay as well as two supporting role acting nods. Later, Magnolia (1999) also received a Best Screenplay nomination (PTA) and Best Supporting Actor (Cruise) as PTA took a talented cast and pushed film's boundaries with an excruciating pace and an ending that strangely remained sober in its farfetchedness. Punch-Drunk Love (2002) did not get any Oscar nomination and is perhaps not as accomplished as his two previous, yet it did win him Best Director at Cannes no less! It proved that he was an engaging director that could translate his familiarity with his work and characters to allow his actors (yes, even Adam Sandler) to give meaningful and memorable performances. It also ascertained his down-to-earth slow-paced style, even if the actual movie was 95 mins compared to his previous drawn out 150mins+ endeavors.<br/><br/>In this context, PTA is back with a vengeance and gets 8 nominations for this film, including (again) Best Adapted Screenplay, but also Best Picture and Best Actor (this time in a Leading Role.) This one is back to the long narrative at over 2h30 and starts very slowly with a dialog-less beginning reminiscent of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)'s overture. When the dialog begins, we get a glimpse of the great sound and picture editing that is to come and permeate the film throughout. The score consists of almost isolated notes that create and release the tension. It is quite suited to the piece as, like the story that it tells, there is nothing too melodious about it. Not surprinsingly, PTA chooses to tell the story slowly but surely. There is many long takes with beautiful cinematography and plenty of moments without dialog. When there is dialog however, it is potent and to the point. The story unravels as the many twists and turns come to past and everything is connected somehow. The real complexity is however revealed in the third and final act (note that the church is named the third revelation) where everything comes into question and stirs conflict while the dialog and acting turn from boiling to iron-hot. This strong ending is born out of the earlier scenes. It captivates and cumulates all the way to the last line: ""I'm finished.'<br/><br/>As for the acting, Daniel Day-Lewis gives a riveting performance as charismatic and enigmatic Daniel Plainview, topping even his remarkable Oscar-winning take on debilitated Christy Brown in My Left Foot (1989) and getting better and better as the story progresses. Paul Dano, from Little Miss Sunshine (2006) fame, gives a calculated counterpart performance as the town's eminent young religious figure. He gives some especially strong scenes and something can also be said for young Dillon Freasier's portrayal of Daniel's son.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is a fine film with a hard look at America's and human's ambition and greed. It deals with themes of family, community, religion and entrepreneurship in an interesting and interwoven way. A great addition not only to PTA's catalog, but to the art of cinema in general."
"tnrcooper","10","4","9","8 February 2008"," Fantastically ambitious and ultimately successful depiction of greed in America
","Having read a lot of reviews of this movie from other users, it seems to me they are missing the whole point of the film. Many decry the movie as not grabbing their attention via the characters, they find the music distracting, they find that nothing happens. I really don't know what movie these people are watching. This is certainly an ambitious movie and sometimes people react against films which they perceive are overly pretentious or ambitious and that is fine if the film does not make a strong case for the truth of its arguments. However I do not understand the questions of many of the critics of the film here-well, anymore than I understand why so many people like so many terrible movies. <br/><br/>I found the film excellent. Paul Thomas Anderson (of the fantastic Boogie Nights, the very underrated Punch Drunk Love, and the excellent Magnolia) has adapted the novel ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair to compose a film about the effect of corrosive greed and religious hucksterism on the development of the West and how, while they may prove temporarily beneficial to their promoters, the ultimate effect of such self-interest may take its greatest toll on the very people who are the prime movers of such self-interested schemes. <br/><br/>The story turns on the egotism of two key characters-Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis, quite possibly the best actor working regularly in the movies these days) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano perhaps not coincidentally mnemonically-related to one of the most influential evangelists of the 20th century and in a performance which offers a significant counterpoint to Day-Lewis' large shadow, not an easy accomplishment). These two men in the developing West see the interrelated utility of each other's interest, and also, I believe, recognize intuitively, the pre-eminent motivator of their rival/ally as self-interest, setting the stage for the ""blood"" of the title. They recognize that the other man's interest can be employed in their interests, but that at some point, a clash between the two interests is almost inevitable, so strong is each man's greed. <br/><br/>The film ranges across the dry, open west and some foreshadowing for the eventual confrontation is delineated by the filmmaker. A plot of land heavy in oil is identified for Plainview's purposes by Eli Sunday's brother Paul who extracts a fee for the right to look for oil on the Sundays' property. Plainview duplicitously investigates the land and confirms Paul's tip. In confirming the correctness of Eli Sunday's brother's geological information, foreshadowing of Paul Sunday's wisdom is made. Along the way, Plainview has acquired a child. His parenting methods are unchallenged by associates or the authorities, owing to the wide-openness of the West, and hints about the unethicality of his child-rearing methods are suggested, via the choices Plainview uses to feed his son HW (who is cynically employed by Daniel to convey his trustworthiness to towns whose oil he wishes to get) However, in this unregulated environment, Henry's treatment of his son, which might be considered simply ill-informed given the free-wheeling, unregulated environment of the wild West, veers unquestionably into the unethical. Numerous ethical questions go by the wayside by both Plainview and Sunday. However, the manner in which such issues are overlooked by both men are not done in such a callous manner as to raise the alarms of the community in which they live. Additionally, they are considered leaders and so their behavior might be ignored simply on those grounds. But perhaps more ominously, it is obvious that both men are willfully attempting to obscure such unethical behavior and that these actions will catch up to them at some point in the future.<br/><br/>Anderson deserves his Oscar nomination for direction because the tone of the film is such that it could quite easily veer into sneering self-righteousness or unintentional comedy. More impressively, Anderson, from Sinclair's book, has created two strong and very bad characters whose influence and sway during a period of great change in the American west will have ripple effects down through the years and he allows these characters to shape the direction which the film will go. When a director has such bracing characters, one need simply allow these characters to develop along their natural arcs. <br/><br/>The use of music in the film is unnerving and compelling. Anderson has gotten a fantastic soundtrack from Johnny Greenwood of the band Radiohead. The dissonant, relentless tone foreshadows some of the horrors which one might vaguely expect but whose exact nature is unknown. <br/><br/>As stated, Anderson resists the temptation of becoming overly preachy or allowing his film to become an unintentional parody of the greed and divisive religious beliefs which the key characters of the film promote. The acting, most specifically from Dano and Day-Lewis is electrifying and it is their work, along with a visionary screenplay and capable direction, which makes this a valid nominee for a best picture Oscar in 2008."
"VelvetRevolverOcelot","10","4","9","7 February 2008"," A Burning Descent Into Madness
","The film is simply perfect in every way, every scene, every note and every facet of all the actors performances are spot on. Day-Lewis presents a character in Daniel Plainview of unrelenting maliciousness, not quite as sadistic as Bardem's Anton Chirurgh but every bit a villain through and through. What makes Daniel Plainview more horrifying than any other villain I've come across is just how much of myself I saw in his character. This film made me want to be a better person not through guilting me into loving my fellow man, but by simply showing the life of a man who never changed and alienated all who loved him. Here is a man that never evolves and experiences no epiphany, he stays the same miserable bastard that he's always been and its just so refreshing to see that in a character. Too much these days we as film goers are forced to sit through contrived character changes or realizations that come out of nowhere and only serve to insult the audience. People don't change and here is a film thats not afraid to express that in the most brutal way possible.<br/><br/>Plainview hates people and wants success in business only so he can make enough money to escape them. Making money it turns out, is very easy for him, he has a way of speaking and carrying himself that is hypnotic and convincing even when you know you're being lied too. He's an oil man but he just as easily could've made his fortune in silver or gold or the blood of children, his ruthlessness would not have stopped him. And what is oil if not the blood of the earth.<br/><br/>He finds his fortune somewhere in Texas where he runs afoul of a small-town church whose preacher represents all Plainview hates about the humanity he wishes to escape from. The young Paul Dano gives the best supporting performance of the year as Eli Sunday, the preacher and faith healer of the church and the symbol of Plainview hatred for years. Throughout the film the two characters run afoul several times with Plainview only building up his hatred over time, for Eli, and for everyone around him.<br/><br/>There has been much uproar over the film's ending, many call it 'over-the-top' or unreal. Yes, the ending is insane, maddening and gruesome, and it is perfect. No other ending could possibly due given this character and his personality and all the decisions he has made in his life up to that crucial point in time (and given the title). The conclusion to the film is unsettling but its exactly what has been building and building the entirety of Daniel's life and its the only ending that could have done this story justice.<br/><br/>The film works like a slow burning fire beneath the surface. The tension and the intensity just builds up until the climax where all is settled and there is no turning back. Our hero has become the man he was destined to be and there is no one left to help him. Plainview passes that threshold after which its too late to go back and right the wrongs you have committed to yourself and to those who loved you. His slow descent into madness is hard to watch, but whoever said a great film had to be fun to watch. Great art is not always pretty and great characters are not always likable. Those are not proper critiques of this film. There Will Be Blood creates an image of a man who is not perfect, but the image is perfectly created."

Of the four movies I have now seen him in; There Will Be Blood is by far his best one.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview. His character starts out as an ordinary man in the late 1800s that is in search of oil. The first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is very interesting for it has no dialog. Rather the film is expressed through the thunderous score by John Greenwood and the actions of a group of men including Daniel who dig deeply into the earth to find oil. With an accidental drop of a heavy metal object, they find their price.<br/><br/>The film then swiftly turns to the turn of the twentieth century. Daniel Plainview has become quite a businessman as an entrepreneur of oil. He gets a tip about an earthquake oil in the middle of nowhere. He checks it out and discovers that he has located a new place to expand his oil empire. Persuading the towns' people with the promise of money, he gets them to leave from their land. He then meets his contender; a young man named Ely (Paul Dano) who claims to be a prophet. <br/><br/>Ely grabs a hold of the towns' people to follow his church while Plainview digs his wells. Ely then soon learns that Plainview is not going to keep his promise of giving the people their money, but to keep it all for himself. Ultimately, it turns into a game between these two men as Ely turns the people against him and Plainview tries to stabilize his power, wells, and reputation. Daniel's dream of finding oil slowly turns against him as he realizes that he can't get enough of the oil and the wealth it can make him. He slowly passes into madness and becomes a cold-blooded murderer against those who stand in his way, hence the title There Will Be Blood. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is simply brilliant and nothing short of Oscar worthy. He plays a very frightening character as someone who seeks for riches, but then transforms into someone that anyone would not want to be. He would do anything to get his way, even using his own son H.W. Plainview as a prop to get some sympathy as a ""family man"". He speaks with a dry monotone, but his eyes hold a cold disdain towards others. As he says straightforwardly to one of the main characters in the film, ""I look at people and see nothing worth likingI don't want anyone else to succeed."" <br/><br/>Paul Dano plays two roles in the film. Although neither character is in a scene together, he does an excellent job. He is almost the comic relief as Ely, particularly when gives his sermons that are so corny that make me want to roll over with laughter. I'm surprised Paul kept a straight face in some of his scenes he performed in the film. <br/><br/>To me, most movie that are over two and half hours are very long. Well, this movie does not drag one bit; I was engrossed by it from start to finish. Director Paul Thomas Anderson captures the film wonderfully from the distant landscape shots to the intense facial up-closes of the thespians. The works of cinematography, art direction, film and sound editing were all marvelously and worth the Oscars nominations each are given. But the one thing I did not like about this movie was the music. I often felt it drowned the film, particularly in the beginning when Daniel raises his hand up covered with oil. The music was so loud that it reminded me of a tornado alarm going off. Perhaps this was caused by the surround sound in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I was very impressed with this film. I give this a 10/10. This is the best movie I have seen for 2007. <br/><br/>-This movie has been nominated for eight academy awards including Best Picture."
"jaieinmiami","10","4","9","22 January 2008"," Turn of the Century
","""Turn-of-the-century"" is not a phrase you hear any more; that's because, 10 or 15 or 20 years ago, people were still using it to refer to the period of the late 1800s and early 1900s, a quaint period where things like long-distance radio, women competing in the Olympics and the internal combustion engine (the main component of new novelties like the automobile and the airplane) were just dipping a toe in the ocean of their impact on human society.<br/><br/>But now in 2008, nobody's using that phrase anymore  because of course, the century has turned once again, and the bemused wisdom of hindsight that ""turn-of-the-century"" once implied has become uncomfortable  because we are now in a future we are too busy and stressed out to appreciate or absorb. What new inventions, just being introduced, might radically change our lives and world in the years to come? Please  we're still trying to deal with 5 minutes ago.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is set in this period of yestercentury, opening in 1898. The film tracks for almost the next 30 years, a visionary oilman who lives the before, during and after of the tipping point when petroleum took over coal's mantle as the primary source of energy the world depended upon. This is a bracing film, buoyed by a mad, intense star performance by the great Irish actor Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, the oilman.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood experiments with picture and sound in exhilarating ways. The first 16 minutes of the film contain not one word of dialogue, a rare way to start an American movie. The compositions and edits don't telegraph what we're supposed to be absorbing  the details exist quietly, in the larger mis-en-scene, and the pictures magnetize our concentration. Here's a film that asks us to pursue it, rather than vice-versa. For a film that largely takes place in 1911, it feels very much like film-making more sophisticated than what we are used to in 2008. Lighting is frequently dark. Characters sit at opposite ends of the frame, with vast, empty (yet pungent) expanses between them in the center of the shot. The art direction, costumes and cinematography capture the grime and quiet we are used to seeing in photos of the period, so effectively it's spooky.<br/><br/>The narrative pounds forward. Plainview experiments with early drilling techniques and uses trial, error and his own unstoppable gumption to get petroleum out from below the ground and into the hands of the big refining companies, racing against seemingly only himself in the insistence upon increasing the profit margin. A pivotal moment comes when Plainview is propositioned by a strange boy, Paul Sunday, who sells out the simple California family he abandoned for only $500. Sick over the freight costs he must pay the railways to ship his oil to the California refineries, Plainview heads west to exploit those whom the young Sunday has promised do not know. A musical score such as we've never heard before in the movies, written by a composer who has never before scored a fiction feature (Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood), keeps us on edge  fast-moving dissonant trills punctuated by foreboding, low-lying percussion.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, while expenses go down (the rural Californians of the fictional Little Boston ignorantly sell their land to Plainview on the cheap) the overhead only increases. Plainview has no family, but by his side is a 10-year-old boy he tells everyone (including the boy) is his son  but more importantly, his ""business partner"". (The boy, whom he calls H.W., actually belonged to a fellow miner who died in a tragic accident in one of Plainview's earlier mining experiments, whose wife had died in childbirth, and Plainview grabbed the opportunity to effectively impersonate the child's father.) H.W. becomes a victim in another mining accident, suffering a major handicap  and Plainview loses his ""business partner"". (The boy's sweet, serious face was a major bonus in sucking signatures out of goat farmers and their wives.) Paul Sunday's younger brother Eli surfaces  and is the first individual that can rival Plainview in his drive and fever to conquer his fellow man (although Eli's vehicle of choice is radical evangelism, not capitalism)  and Plainview must invest in destroying him. The bloodthirsty immortality mounts  and the pendulum inevitability swings back, as impersonation (in a different form) and humiliation come home to roost.<br/><br/>What's happening to our world? There Will Be Blood is one the year's most brilliant films; it is completely about right now, and the teeming world on the brink of technological changes that will change our lives as we hurl forward into the future. Will we learn compassion and grace, check our growing greed and egos against a moral compass? There Will Be Blood has the audacity to flat out state that we won't. It's chilling  and claustrophobic. It invokes a fight-or-flight instinct  but the end of the film, where we are confined with our hero in a small room that mirrors the small dark mine in which we started this journey 29 years and 155 minutes earlier, we realize that there's no where to run to in this society  and that we will need nothing less than a superwoman to save us. Now."

"FairlyAnonymous","7","3","6","16 March 2015"," A film that desperately tries to be a masterpiece, but forgets what that means
","""There Will Be Blood"" tries everything within its power to be a modern masterpiece. This is one of those films that one can tell was specifically designed to be loved by critics and to receive attention. However, in spite of all of its great strengths and great moments, it muddles down into a rather pointless film that leaves no real lasting connection.<br/><br/>I will not lie and say that ""There Will Be Blood"" was not beautifully shot and doesn't have great characters. It does! The camera shots in this film are down right brilliant, and very close to that of Stanley Kubrick's style... almost too close. The soundtrack is also VERY good, because it sets the mood perfectly. From the very beginning of the movie in its 2001: Space Odyssey atmosphere, you can tell that things are going wrong and that tension is building. I would say that the first 20 minutes of the movie are ingenious. Everything about it is brilliant. <br/><br/>The movie follows the life of a man named Daniel who starts as a humble silver miner, until he ends up discovering oil. At this point he starts earning more cash. When one of his workers dies on the job, he adopts the man's son. The majority of the movie follows Daniel and his attempt to get oil from a small-town. However, many difficulties arise, and Daniel becomes exceedingly desperate to get access to the last part of the land so that he can make a pipe through the land.<br/><br/>What makes the film's plot good is its actors and the characters they play. You get a real sense of Daniel's decent into madness and rage. Over the course of the film you start to realize that he was actually always a psychopath, its just he becomes so rich that he stops caring if he shows it. This makes for a very interesting and well-written character. <br/><br/>However, the movie still has one major glaring issue: Not only does it not amount to anything, but it doesn't really lead anywhere... or do anything. I am all for a movie that messes with the viewer's expectations, but the last 30 minutes of this movie really screw it over... and not in a good way. The movie uses all of the classic ""Oscar movie"" clichés: Let's see the main character years later as they grow old from wealth, let's see them go mad, let's have the climax of the film be an argument from one character to the next so as to reveal their true personalities, and the list goes on... if you've ever watched a drama like this before, you've seen this ending before.<br/><br/>The main issue with the ending in this movie (and pretty much all of this movie) is that a lot of the movie's themes and content never lead to anything. Yes, they might be tied together with a plot, but almost every scene (except for the beginning) solely exists to make you feel like something much larger is happening. Since this movie builds so much tension, you think it would get somewhere... but it doesn't.<br/><br/>Now, that isn't to say that there aren't obvious metaphors and that the scene's don't correlate with the characters. The very finishing scene of the movie seems to be showing years of Daniel's hatred towards humanity being released at once to a point where he is satisfied... however it also makes him a complete and utter psychopath.<br/><br/>This is the other issue with the movie: the character named Eli. Eli is a preacher who is a minor rival to Daniel, but he sees Daniel as a brother, regardless if Daniel humiliates him constantly. The issue with Eli is... he is a 100% stereotypical cliché Christian nut-job. I don't understand why directors think that having an ""insane Christian preacher"" is original or thought provoking. Literally EVERYONE has done that, and it comes across as... well... simple- minded. Not saying that there aren't insane Christian preachers (there definitely are, and I have certainly met some), but there are also plenty who weren't, and basically everything Eli preaches in the movie is actually incorrect based off of biblical teachings.<br/><br/>Now, you could say that this was intentional so as to show that Eli really was a clueless false-prophet who didn't know anything (which he seemed to be) but the movie doesn't seem to know that... the movie seems to just be saying ""He is an over-the-top clueless Christian"". This cliché is just so overdone that it is sad to see good directors think that it is clever. <br/><br/>All in all, There Will Be Blood has some great acting, but it has some major issues as far as its ending goes, its rival, and what it is trying to say. Nothing in the film truly adds up to anything significant. It is a really well made movie, but that doesn't make it a great movie."

"derekdiercksmeier","10","3","6","16 September 2012"," Arguably The Greatest Film Ever Made
","Paul Thomas Anderson's film ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterpiece. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is truly incredible. The opening scene is truly astounding. The music, which was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, is absolutely breathtaking. Daniel Plainview is one of the great characters in cinema history. The performance of Paul Dano is understated and wonderfully nuanced. The screenplay, adapted from the Upton Sinclair novel ""Oil!"", is absolutely brilliant. Paul Thomas Anderson is undoubtedly the single greatest filmmaker of his generation. The story make take place in the early 1900s, but the themes of religion, business, and capitalism have a remarkable relevance in present-day society. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The gusher scene is especially striking. It will be remembered as one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is the strongest that I have seen since Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". The ending is brilliant and satisfying, despite receiving much criticism. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a true masterpiece of American cinema and arguably the greatest film in the history of cinema."

","Boring. This film is a hype. I agree with critics talking about sheep like behaviour of people who tell us they like the film. One critic talked about the emperor's new cloths; again I agree. Very quickly I lost my interest. The makers of the film gave me the feeling they were far more busy trying to create art than create a good film. The film for me was one of those products you would see in one of those obscure film houses where a small group of wannabe artists and critics convince themselves of the value of the film. Having seen Day-Lewis in a number of films now, I must admit I wonder why people admire him and his performances. Every time I had the feeling DDL was focused on trying to be somewhere in between Jack Nicholson, Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. But I never felt in any film he was trying to play the character in the film."

","After viewing this film, I was truly breathless. The wind had been knocked out of me by the performances, the music, the cinematography. Everything about this movie is flawless. Daniel Day-Lewis has truly outdone himself. He had, at that point, already secured his spot as one of the greatest actors (if not THE greatest) today, with films like In the Name of the Father and My Left Foot, but this is by far his best performance. Although cliché, I could truly watch this man recite the dictionary; no, I could watch him READ the dictionary, as the first 20 minutes of TWBB proved to me. If you haven't seen this magnificent film, go watch it right now. If you have seen it, go watch it again."
"Perception_de_Ambiguity","10","3","6","3 March 2009"," The first 10/10 I gave out in almost 4 years
","This isn't exactly cover story news, but that is FOUR years, mind you. And I've seen over 1,000 movies for the first time since then. There just never had been a film since then that fully captivated me and which at the same time I deemed competently made and complex enough.<br/><br/>Now this glorious movie was a rewatch and I had it rated 9/10 after I saw it the first time at the theater early in 2008. It's a film that can't complain about a lack of praise, neither from film critics, nor from IMDbers. The film in question is, of course, There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>It gripped me from the first minute and didn't loosen its grip until the end. Much of it can be contributed to the score, that gives the scenes an odour of urgency. The pacing, the tone, the composition of the film is just so right, it never hits a wrong note. There's not a scene that makes you think: ""What was that good for?"" or ""That seemed kinda off.""<br/><br/>It is the source of one of cinemas great characters and much of D.P.'s lines are so memorable that I could quote them after my first viewing. Unlike most films it never seemed to be in a hurry. You won't find something like a hasty camera sway to capture something unexpected or to catch up with an actor. There isn't a moment that feels like some random idea that the director came up with an hour before and that he thought would sort of fit at that place in the movie.<br/><br/>Now the visuals... What else could be said about the images other than that they are beautiful to look at? Well, just take this shot, for example. - http://i593.photobucket.com/albums/tt13/PedeAmb/ThereWillBeBlood.jpg - The sequence starts with the camera zoomed in on Daniel Plainview's back. The camera slowly pans out to reveal the huge, burning oil fountain. Daniel raises his arms to signal somebody. Now from both sides men pulling carriages filled with dynamite enter the frame. As all necessary components are inside the frame the camera stops panning out (see picture). The men park the carriages in the flame, and the dynamite blows up five seconds later, while the men get away from the fountain and out of the picture as fast as they can. The flame expires right on time. And all of this happens to be set in front of an awe-inspiring bright blue sky filled with majestic clouds. How much planning and testing must have went into that?<br/><br/>One reason why it is very relevant for a film to be one piece made out of many different well-conducted pieces (from cinematography to set decoration to acting...) is that it let's you lose yourself in the movie, which enhances the emotional impact. There is another reason why the whole package is important, and why just one individual aspect that holds your interest in a film isn't quite enough. If you feel like everything is done right, you will feel like you are in good hands. It's when you feel that you are in good hands that you have complete confidence in the filmmaker and his vision. You roll with the movie all the way, no matter how outlandish or puzzling the movie might become. You are there, because you have the confidence that the guy who brought it to be knew what he did. As I watched There Will Be Blood I was confident that Paul Thomas Anderson knew what he did."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","3","6","14 February 2009"," He drinks it up, as we the viewers also digest this picture.
","There Will Be Blood is adapted by Paul Thomas Anderson from the novel ""Oil"", written by Upton Sinclair. It charts the rise to power of Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector without one seemingly redemptive characteristic, this is a man who takes and uses an adoptive son purely as a front for luring sympathy from prospective sellers, the facade of a caring family man never more so ruthlessly exploited as it is by Plainview. Upon learning {at a price} that there is oil abundant land in California going cheap, Plainview and H.W. {his ahem, son}, set off there and begin manipulating the land owners to meet Plainview's means. But although the operation there is thriving, Plainview meets resistance per se, in the form of local preacher Eli Sunday, greed and religion appearing to define both mens destinies.<br/><br/>So many writings and analytical dissections have been formed about this mighty epic from 2007, and really it's not my want to even begin agreeing or disagreeing about the various translations of the piece. For what it's worth, I don't see anything more than a fable about isolation thru greed, and the blending of capitalism with religious fervour. What I do know is that watching There Will Be Blood feels like a reason to love cinema, regardless of Paul Thomas Anderson's motives that bubble beneath the surface, it's a film of extraordinary greatness. It's leading man, Daniel Day Lewis, turns in one of his customary brilliant performances, enticing audience confusion as to if Plainview is a genius or a sociopath bastard? Either way you call it, Day Lewis has given us one of the modern cinema's truest scary monsters. Paul Dano as Eli gives the film its other central performance, and in view of D D Lewis's barn storming performance, it's with much credit that Dano leaves an indelible mark come the final credits.<br/><br/>Tho nominated for eight academy awards, the only other win outside of Day Lewis's for best actor {really it was a given that he would win}, went to Robert Elswit for his stunning cinematography, sparse dusty lands are perfectly framed with truncation excellently arriving in the form of oil drills and fire laden towers. There Will Be Blood is a film that demands you return to it for further viewings, each subsequent visit bringing about a little more than a fabulous leading man performance. It's just like many prescription pain killers, if you give it time then it most definitely works, and to me as a lover of cinema, this picture is part of being the best medicine of recent times. 10/10"

","I wanted to like this movie. But I can honestly say that I just wasn't impressed by this film. The acting by Daniel Day Lewis was fine, the locations were splendid (even if the sound track was irritating and intrusive), but there just isn't anything in Daniel Plainview's character to make him the least bit sympathetic. I have to agree with other reviewers who stated that all the other characters served only to be the recipients of Plainview's tirades. Maybe if we had been given some hint as to why Daniel was so angry and bitter we could have had an understanding, and maybe a bit of empathy. I felt no more for this character at the end of the movie than I had at the beginning. There was certainly enough time for the story to be told in full and characters to have been filled out. It had so much potential, but just didn't deliver."
"piksplanet","10","3","6","1 January 2009"," a masterpiece.
","There Will Be Blood is visionary director Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel Oil!. Set in the early 1900's, it tells the story of a man's ruthless quest for power and wealth during Southern California's oil boom. It was nominated for eight, and won two Academy Awards.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is, simply put, a powerhouse lasting two and a half hours. By the time it ends, one cannot help but be awed at what has gone on on-screen. Daniel Day Lewis, known for churning out the greatest performances by any present day actor, is at his vicious best. After roles like that of Christy Brown in My Left Foot, and Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting in Gangs of New York, he is back, and with more to offer. It is a treat simply watching him on screen. He is credited for being the most selective actor around, and for good reason.<br/><br/>Expect P.T.Anderson's best work till date as well. Topping masterpieces such as Magnolia and Boogie Nights is not an easy job. So we would think. There Will Be Blood is a whole new arena to what Anderson can do as a screenplay writer. Certain sequences in this gem of a film stand out as particularly magnificent. The background score played during the derrick fire sequence is beyond description. It is a few minutes of perfection. Haunting. Expect to go wide-eyed. The cinematography top notch. The rhythm and motion, in perfect harmony.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a story about ambition. Greed. Hatred. About a man who is so self absorbed that he cannot imagine anything apart from what he wants. And he does everything he possibly can to get it. The shock of what the film shows is stays for a while after one has seen it. Not merely because of the actions it shows us, more because of the ways and the circumstances in which the actions have been performed. From greed. From whim. From madness. Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview is such a man. And his performance puts forward to us as much of him as it possibly can. It is simply shocking.<br/><br/>The character of Eli, portrayed by Paul Dano, deserves special mention. Especially for the way it all comes out in the last 20minutes of the film. Another brilliant sequence there. Paul Dano does marvellously to keep up with Lewis in this particular sequence in the film. It is hard to believe that anyone of his age can stand up to Lewis in so powerful a sequence. The last 20minutes of the film will leave you speechless. It is a lesson in acting and cinematography, in editing and sound mixing. It is a film in itself. There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece that deserves a lot more respect and credit than it has received.<br/><br/>And I quote Daniel Plainview from the scrumptious final sequence : Did you think your song and dance and your superstition would help you, Eli? I am the Third Revelation! I am who the Lord has chosen!<br/><br/>There Will Be Greed. There Will Be Vengeance. There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>Flat-out masterpiece."
"pcwiz1199","9","3","6","7 December 2008"," There Will Be Blood
","""There Will Be Blood"", directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is perhaps one of the greatest films of our time and can immediately be considered a classic. Its entire structure, composition of actors, story, and cinematography all help to create a film that, although three hours in length, seams to fly through leaving you dying for more.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview, played wonderfully by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a determined oil man at the turn of the 20th century who promises land holders wealth and prosperity at the prospect of his oil endeavors. Daniel Day-Lewis is convincing in the simplest of terms. The audience can watch his performance and not even realize that a character is being acted. One may sit and forget they aren't watching a dramatic documentary filmed in the early 1900's.<br/><br/>After promising to build up a town's wellbeing by drilling for oil, Daniel Plainview is cursed by tragedy after tragedy at his oil wells. The bipolar reverend at the local church, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) claims Daniel's misfortune is his reluctance to having his projects blessed by his church. As the film plays out, religion begins to take a prominent role, as the townspeople desire for Daniel to become active in their church in return for the ability to use their land to drill for oil.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, Daniel becomes dependant on alcohol to drown his sorrows; His injured son, the mishaps at the oil wells, his dealings with big oil companies. In the end when his quest was successful and Daniel is living in a large home, he is obviously using his wealth on grown man's play things and alcohol. He is a drunk, living homeless in his own home. His loneliness is unbearable, but his old ""friend"" the reverend will not give up on him and comes to visit him one last time.<br/><br/>Director of Photography Robert Elswit contributes a great deal to this project. The vast emptiness of the west is captured well in both a physical and emotional sense. Each scene and location seems to have its own personality through the lighting and composition of a shot. Johnny Greenwood's music is at first strange and unexpected, but its eccentric and abnormal qualities help to give the film a different feel, the newness of drilling for oil to the community and to the United States at the time deserves an unfamiliar score. The soundtrack assists in speeding up scenes that may otherwise seem to move slowly."
"pdlaker34","10","3","6","1 December 2008"," Please people dig, you'll find out that there's gold
","I have watched this film two times. First time I hated it, but that was because I was with someone who hated, I was easy to manipulate, and I did have a grasp on film in general. But I recently saw it again, seven months later. Then I was just starting to become obsessed with film and didn't have a lot of knowledge on classic film and film in general. Now I have an identity in what I like and what I want to do as a director and I know what I like and what I don't like in pacing, staging, scenery, acting, & directing in general. If you just watch this film you might see something in an only evil mood or a beautiful and powerful movie, but not know exactly why. A lot of people I know criticize the film for lacking humanity, but that is just not the case. Some people who love the film compare it to Citizen Kane and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, two of my favorites, but that's not the case either. Those films are easier and fun, they engulf you in their grandness in cinema but not in emotional baggage. The film is true to Upton Sinclair in that it shows the worst of Oil and also the worst of religion. But unlike Upton Sinclair, the film is not boring.<br/><br/>Paul Dano has gotten some flack for his performance in the film, but the only problem is that he is a little too young, but you really dislike him and Plainview at the same time. Actually, in the beginning of the film I did not hate Plainview, even the second time I watched knowing how the character develops, I didn't hate him. That proved to me that Plainview was an unhealthy and sick man and even had a lot of hate in his heart, but he was not completely evil like I thought he was the first time I saw the film. The thing that makes the film interesting are questions: How does a man become a recluse and have a pure hatred towards common people? Does this man love his son? How can he love his son and leave him on a train at the same time? Yes Daniel Plainview may be one of the worst people living in the world in There Will Be Blood, but what makes it deep is that he shows humanity. People interpret the end with his son wrong a lot of the time and take that as the truth, which is not the case. This man is a very sick man, mentally. He did love his son, he loved his business more, but he did love his son. He is one of those men who can really only focus on one thing fully and everything else will fall in place, or not. Plainview is a recluse and it could be the cause of something from his past or he can just be a naturally troubled man. He truly does hate most people he meets, but he does have love for his son, but because of his sickness it has to be convenient for him or else he will just run away from you, like when he leaves his son on the train. When Michael Corroleone's first wife dies in The Godfather he becomes a very cold and empty man, only their for competition. The same thing happens to Plainview. He snaps into pure coldness and hatred when he finds out the truth about the one man he trusted after his son could not hear anymore.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis in my opinion is the best actor alive. De Niro, Pacino, and Nicholoson are not the same anymore and the only guy who is close right now is probably Sean Penn. Just look at his career as a whole. His performances are so varied whether it be the truly maniacal Butcher, Christy Brown, Hawkeye, Archer, Gerry Conlan, and then masterful Plainview. He really reminds me of an Olivier or Brando. The only criticism I have of Lewis is that I haven't seen him do anything great that was a small film. The Boxer was OK, Ballad of Jack and Rose was OK, but there not merely as good performances as the ones I mentioned earlier which are all very grand films in one way or the other. I guess what I am trying to say is that I would love to see him do something as himself like how Brando did Last Tango In Paris.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson is truly the most bold and talented young filmmaker in Hollywood and my favorite young filmmaker. He has not been afraid to go into different material. He has not been afraid to do a character study like Blood, an ensemble piece like Magnolia and Boogie Nights, and a strange, quirky, Kubrick like romantic comedy like Punch-Drunk Love. Blood is a period piece that examines the worst of Oil and Religion and studies the power and sickness of a man. The thing that gives the film humanity at the end is the boy grown up and happy and the ending. The ending has been criticized by some but I think it fits completely because It shows how pathetic and miserable Plainview and Sunday are. The viewer feels like this fight and cruelness is ridiculous and it is, and it is ended in a ridiculous song."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the 1890s, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sees the profit to come from oil and becomes set on his journey to becoming a ruthless tycoon who will step over anything and anyone to get the bottom dollar. He manipulates a deeply religious family into selling him their land, most significantly the son Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) whose religious convictions are deeply held and without question. Over the years, Daniel continues to deny him and his family the money he owes them and drifts apart from his adopted son, whose deafness resulted from his greed and who he only uses to project a caring family man image, until he turns on him and Plainview descends into madness.<br/><br/>The trick to succeeding in business, it's safe to say, is to market essentials, things people can't live without. Phillip Green has made millions from his Marks & Spencer clothes empire (aside from living on the continent for large parts of the week to avoid tax) and John Leslie picked himself back up from falling out the limelight by becoming a property developer. But nothing seems to bring in the bucks like oil, the substance needed to fuel the machines that get us around. After the war, Iraq stands to get itself right back up on it's feet due to the large oil reserves buried beneath it and think of all the Texan oil tycoons who've done well for themselves off the back of it. TWBB delves into the psyche of a trailblazing entrepreneur who first saw the potential to exploit this service for all it's worth and how determination and ruthless desire drive him to go right over the edge, even to murder.<br/><br/>It's guided along, of course, by an amazing performance from Lewis, who captures the accent and spirit of Plainview perfectly. He has good support, too, from Dano as the young son of the preacher, driven by his beliefs and values who ends up selling out like everyone else. The film isn't driven by talky moments so much as long periods of silence and moodiness (including a dialogue free first thirty minutes) in which Paul Thomas Anderson, who writes and directs, creates an eerie and enthralling atmosphere of impending doom and madness. Every shot and every scene has it's own unique touch that creates just the right impression very subtly.<br/><br/>It requires persistence and it might not strike you the first time, but there is no doubt this is a modern classic we have on our hands here, an enthralling and chilling tale of how money corrupts. *****"

","In the early 20th century, an ambitious man by the name of Daniel Plainview (Oscar-Winner:Daniel Day-Lewis) discovered Oil in the desert of Texas. Soon enough, he find himself to be an modest rich man. After the death of an worker on the job. Daniel decides to raise the man's son to be as his own. Years has passed... Daniel has truly become successful at finding Oil and his adapted son grown up & his name is H.W. Plainview (Dillion Freasier). When an mysterious young man by the name of Paul Sunday (Paul Dano). He goes to Daniel to tell him, there's Oil in his father's farm. He tells him, he could make millions on his father's land. Daniel, H.W. and his assistant Fletcher (Ciaran Hinds) goes to Sunday's farm to find Oil. Which they do sooner enough but Daniel meets his match, when Paul's twin brother named Eli (Also played by Dano). Who's just as ambitious as Daniel but for different reasons. Eli wants to build an Church and he thinks, he's great preacher. But Daniel's life slowly changed... when his adapted son turns deaf, Eli becomes greedy by asking Daniel money and Daniel's mysterious half-brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor) shows up. Daniel's life turns darker and darker and oh yes, there will be blood.<br/><br/>Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Hard Eight, Magnolia) made an absorbing drama that manages to have an dark sense of comedy at times. Day-Lewis is excellent as the smart Oil dealer tycoon, who may be way over his head at times but he's an deeply flawed man. Which Day-Lewis own an Oscar for his memorable performance. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially young Freasier and Dano. But some viewers might be turned-off by Dano's tole as a young, slightly crazed preacher. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (Return of the Living Dead Part 2, Tomorrow Never Dies, Punch-Drunk Love) won an Oscar for his beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>The two-disc Collector's Set of ""There Will Be Blood"" is somewhat disappointing. No audio commentary by the writer/director:P.T. Anderson (Although there's rumour, he stopped doing audio commentaries after his enjoyable infamous comments on ""Boogie Nights"" or no behind the scenes footage. But the bonus disc on the special features are decent enough. DVD has an featurette made sometime in the 1920's titled ""The Story of Petroleum"" with music by the film's composer Jonny Greenwood (Member of the band ""Radiohead'). DVD also includes moments that inspires the film by using old photographs of the 1920's with photos of Anderson's movie, deleted scene titled ""Fishing"", dailies outtakes and trailers. Deleted Scene ""Fishing"" is a good scene but it is easy why Director Anderson deleted it, because there's no place in the picture. Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is certainly one of the best movies of 2007. It may be not for everyone, some viewers might find it too slow. But i think, Anderson's film is fast-paced and fascinating. I wasn't sure what to make out of it at first but i did liked it. But after watching it in the second viewing, i loved it even more. At times, it seems that writer/director Anderson was paying tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick and the late Robert Altman & especially the music that sounds eerily enough to Kubrick's picture ""The Shining"". If you haven't seen this, don't miss it. Panavision. (**** 1/2 out of *****)."

","I'm not prone to reviewing movies, as I do not consider myself in any way a movie buff. However as a someone who humbly believes he possesses a modicum of intelligence, I felt compelled to indicate my absolute indifference as to this particular film, especially in light of the hype it has received.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood seems to fall into that category of ""a movie that makes you think."" But what about? One feels little sympathy for any of the characters, save perhaps for the little boy (whose role never manages to take the brave leap into being meaningful); there's certainly no moral message (all evangelicals are fakes?); and the obvious political message (money makes people greedy and corrupt) is not exactly new nor convincingly displayed. Plainview is not a sympathetic character from the beginning, and although he becomes more overtly malicious as the movie progresses (killing people as opposed to beating them), there's no real sense of him changing as a person.<br/><br/>I've watched about half of IMDb's top 250 list, and for the most part I've been quite happy with the community picks. This movie's success simply bewilders me.<br/><br/>4/10 - Like movie theater popcorn: somewhat palatable while you're eating, and wholly unsatisfying afterward.<br/><br/>(Finally, for those who were wondering, the noisy violin playing is from the third movement of Brahms' Violin Concerto - it's a wonderful piece of music, used entirely out of character and out of place in TWBB, and with poorly engineered sound to boot)"
"cwarne_uk","4","3","6","2 August 2008"," Hollow
","Daniel Day-Lewis's performance gets most of the attention here, which is just as well because the performance is the movie, whatever other characters appear being merely cyphers. Like the movie it superficially looks like art, on closer inspection it dissolves into facial and vocal mannerisms devoid of life. Long at two and a half hours, but feeling much longer, this is an arid and joyless experience - possibly the most po-faced film since the widescreen epics of the late 1950's. The film has no clear message, if as it appears to be that greed corrosive to the soul it simply doesn't work because Plainview is corroded from the start. As it goes on the film manages to get more and more ludicrous, the final scenes being hilarious in ways not envisaged by the makers. The hysterical response to this melodrama is a timely reminder of the gullibility of critics and that certain kind of viewer who (X-Files like) wants to believe that cinema is better now than ever before."

","I know I will be in the large minority here but I feel like I wasted my day watching this movie. From a cinematic view I guess it might be very well done but from there being no speaking for the first fifteen minutes to lack of any real action I was just waiting for more. There are a few twists but really nothing that changed the movie or how I felt while watching it. I do believe the soundtrack was intense and kept me waiting for something to happen but it just never seemed to happen. I am not sure if this was made from a book or not but if it was I believe that reading this story would be much better than seeing the movie."
"brad_and_ethan","9","3","6","7 July 2008"," Blows ""No Country"" Out of the Water!
","I finally saw 'No Country for Old Men' on DVD, after it won Best Film at the Oscars. I was outraged at how shallow and idiotic this film was. Then, I was curious to see the other contenders. I just saw 'There Will Be Blood' last night on DVD. This has to be one of the best Hollywood dramas in the last 5-10 years. It makes 'Old Men' look like crap! There's much more going on in ONE SCENE in 'Blood' than the entire 'Old Men' film! The main dramatic conflict in the film was Plainview vs. Sunday. I thought that this would be developed to the Nth degree, but for some reason they put Sunday on a train to some mission. I think they should have had them locking horns throughout the entire story. However, their conflict generates some important themes that the film is wrestling with. I can't wait to see this film again, and again, and again... Shame on the Coen Brothers! Let's take that Oscar back from them!"
"Mik_Cal","3","3","6","6 July 2008"," Painfully pretentious: a director out of control of his material
","A few months back, I was reading all these reviews of TWBB and I was thinking: Wow, this movie really divides the (commenting) public. Upon reading the comments I was thinking that I tended to believe the more critical comments more than the highly positive gushing (excuse the pun) that appeared on this board. I was enjoying following the controversy but was thinking that spending $10 to see the movie was maybe a waste of money.<br/><br/>Finally, I decided to rent the movie through Comcast's On-Demand and contribute my voice to the debate. I was further reassured that I wouldn't be wasting my money because the 8.4 rating it received from IMDb reviewers indicates that the positives outweigh the negatives by maybe 6 to 1.<br/><br/>Well, IMDb reviewers, at least those for TWBB, are a lot more gullible, superficial bunch than I thought. This movie is a wretched mess...Paul Thomas Anderson has lost a lot of my respect with this effort. Where to begin... First I'll start with the positive: Pluses: Daniel Day Lewis was good but a little bit of a self-caricature as Plainview. He was believable but also too much like a version of Bill the Butcher. Another plus was the cinematography, in particular the shots of the landscape and also some of the interior shooting and the mining scenes were well done. It was a pretty picture despite the subject matter. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars because of these positives.<br/><br/>Minuses: The biggest minus is that the film seems to graze over its subject matter in a superficial way: Anderson seems not to fully grasp and understand the nuances of the history and human interactions which he is filming. The characters just sort of appear there as if they are figments of his imagination which he then tries to, puppet=like, make dramatic interactions between without a deep context or narrative momentum which actually compels the characters to act in the way they do. It is though the characters are arbitrarily deciding to ""make drama"" for our consumption. All this despite the sumptuous scenery and the jabs at historical accuracy that seem in parts quite plausible.<br/><br/>If Anderson is trying to make it a ""Brechtian"" drama with alienation effects and all, the embarrassment deepens because of the lack of a real social message in the film. There is not really a conflict of ideas in this movie...people on this board are reading into it their own ideas, but they just aren't there in the film. What for instance does Plainview represent? Is it unbridled greed? Why doesn't Standard Oil represent that? Plainview represents a psychotic version of greed (in the end) but what is universal about that? Not all capitalists or oil men are paranoid and have anti-social personalities.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Paul Dano character is equally non-universal and just odd. He seems to have little deep religious conviction but simply spouts the words. Yet we don't have a sense at all why he has latched onto religion to further a personal agenda of greed? power? lust? It's just there and not given any context. On the other hand, the content and type of religion he is espousing bears a very tenuous relationship to anything I recognize as the main conflicts in American Christianity. His boyishness has no meaning in the context of any bigger ideas, nor his own power hunger. So, this character just doesn't say much beyond it being a very confused collaboration between a director, a screenwriter and an actor. Furthermore his acting is just excruciatingly bad. It was quite awful.<br/><br/>A further sign of Anderson's lack of control of his material is the way the music added almost nothing to the movie. It was like ""What's up Tigerlily""...a music track was grafted onto the film almost randomly. The music inspired tension at odd times...I could sit you down and explain how almost invariably the music, while not unlistenable at times, was out of synch with what was happening on screen or created a false manipulation that ruined a potentially more subtle moment.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing, then, about this movie are 1) that Paul Thomas Anderson could make such a mess and not have anybody in his team or studio tell him that he was full of crap and 2) that so many IMDb readers/commenters are taken in by the TWBB package enough to project onto it their own thinking about this subject. My take on it is that people see the beautiful package and also the subject matter and how it MIGHT have been handled and write their own little script to it.<br/><br/>Should Anderson be credited with inspiring all this enthusiasm and creative interpretation? I don't think so. I believe if he listens only to this adulation that his next movie will really fall apart in a way that even these folk will no longer be able to overlook the flaws. As is, I'm hoping TWBB gets pulled down from its perch at #73 on IMDb's list to a less elevated position as more people discover what a substandard piece it is."

I was anticipating a well-acted, plot-driven film with an historical angle and the timeless notion of the greed that drives many people.<br/><br/>The movie started out well, albeit a little slow paced. The character development was good and the plot points were relevant. Once the Day-Lewis character achieved a level of stature, the plot started to become incoherent. It meandering along, explaining little in the way of motivation. It lost direction and never found its way. At the end, I just couldn't wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>I think Day-Lewis turned in an Oscar-worthy performance, but the entropy of the plot made for a very big disappointment."

","I have to say that even though I don't agree with all of the hype surrounding this movie, I do feel as though ""There Will Be Blood"" should get some kind of Oscar nod - for Best Acting in the most Mind-Numbing movie of 2007. I watched this movie on DVD, after listening to the raves of critics, and the opinion of my movie-buff baby brother. What was I thinking? This movie was excruciatingly painful to watch. It was SOOOOOO SLOOOOW, I was missing ""crucial"" parts of the movie and had to rewind often. (This was because I would periodically space out due to boredom.) In fact, characters would engage, scenes would change, and terrifying music would play with no rhyme or reason as to why. Often, I would reverse and replay thinking, ""I had to have missed something."" But alas, the only this I missed was 2+ extra hours of sleep. And speaking of music, whose idea was it to use a hurricane/earthquake/nuclear bomb siren as background noise? I actually paused the video and turned to the news channel during the opening scene because I thought I needed to take cover from a tornado. Worse, they used this irritating music throughout the movie. I think the person responsible felt it was best in order to wake the audience up every so often. My poor mother and sister showed up and caught the last half of the movie, yet we were all equally as bored and confused. Fortunately, our boredom gave way to anger once we got to the very end of the movie. The ending was so random and ridiculous, that I thought I was watching a different movie altogether. I gave it a 4 out of 10 only because of the beautiful camera shots and the flawless acting of Daniel Day Lewis. <br/><br/>In the end, I asked my brother why on earth did he ever say TWBB was a good movie? He stated ""Because Daniel Day Lewis was in it."" ""Just because Daniel Day Lewis is in this, does not make this a good movie,"" I replied.<br/><br/>He said, ""If you're a true fan of Daniel Day Lewis, you like all of his movies."" <br/><br/>Sorry, Daniel. I'm not as much of a fan as I thought."

"brando647","8","3","6","13 April 2008"," One of my favorite movies of 2007
","This movie was my first exposure to the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and I now completely understand the hype surrounding his work. Despite it's apparent simplicity, I really enjoyed this movie. The movie focuses on Daniel Plainview, an oilman from the early years of the 20th century, and his rise to success. Along the way, he sets up shop in a small town called Little Boston and finds himself at odds with the town's preacher, Eli Sunday. On the surface, that appears to be all there is to this film. I found myself drawn in after the first 15 minutes of watching and I was immersed until it ended.<br/><br/>The film moves slowly, but you never really notice it. It's got a longer running time than most films (roughly 2 hours, 40 minutes) but I never found myself looking at the time, waiting for it to end. All-in-all, the movie didn't really lose it's pace with the exception of a section in the second act involving the a surprise arrival into Daniel's life. Seeing as how this movie is primarily a character piece, its the performances that really drive the film. Having finally seen the film, I can honestly say that Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely deserved the Academy Award he won for his portrayal of Plainview. This is a man we see slowly becoming obsessed with his business and absorbed into his success until the final act. Day-Lewis is so charasimatic an actor, that despite some of the cruel things we see Plainview pull off in this movie, I still found myself pushing for the character. Paul Dano also contributes a great performance in his role of Eli, the evangelical preacher and thorn in Plainview's side. My favorite moments in this film are the interactions between Plainview and Sunday, particularly in the final act. These two men worked fantastically together and you could always feel the underlying tension and hostility when they conversed.<br/><br/>One final note, I have to mention the great production value in this movie. If you had the benefit of purchasing the collector's edition DVD, be sure to take a look at the special features. It includes a 15-minute feature consisting of comparisons between pictures of the oil industry from that era and scenes from the movie. The production crew did an amazing job recreating early 20th century California. Everything from the wardrobe to the oil derricks, everything looks and feels authentic.<br/><br/>If this movie is the kind of quality Paul Thomas Anderson puts into his movies, then I've missed out on way too much and I know I'll be going back to check out his previous works."

","There will be Blood The new trend has emerged. Some good movies when released instantly become so highly rated that they break into the top league of IMDb top rated movies. I find that formula very strange that it does not discount the recentness of movie craze wave. This movie is at number 30 in top movies list of all times! Is not it amazing? Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), an obsessive hard working miner learns and rises to become shrewd oil extracting businessperson  when he is approached by a poor Sunday family with a prospect of selling their oil-filled Texas rural hinterland to him. Daniel presents himself as a social family man by projecting a boy HW (Dillon Freasier) - he has adopted from a dying miner  as his own son. There is Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), an aspiring boy wanting to become a prophet  who wants his vested interest of building a church fulfilled by the richness of Daniel who is using their land. Daniel despises Paul's religiousity. In an accident HW looses his hearing and that presents suttle changes in Daniel's personality of father and businessman. At the end of the movie, Daniel is shown as a grudgy filthy rich old man hating everyone around him. And movie ends up with a climax that is minorly representative of its title  BLOOD.<br/><br/>This epic saga is loosely adopted from Upton Sinclair's novel OIL. The young talented director Paul Thomas Anderson, rides big on the mega opus venture and fortunately on the strong and reliable shoulders of Daniel Day Lewis who agreed to do the role with this upcoming director.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is a story about several characters  Daniel Day Lewis captures each and every frame of the movie. He brings life to one of the most interesting characters. The physicality that Daniel Day Lewis provides to this role is so enormous that he is like a Demi-God in the art of learning good acting. His eyes, his movements are spell binding.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the character show-case a varied range of emotions  white, gray and dark, and it is so interesting to watch the circumstances that bring out different sorts of characters. But in last 20 minutes, the character becomes totally dark  though good, that becomes one dimensional and not as much appealing as the entire story.<br/><br/>The music composed by Jonny Greenwodd is starchy and starkling. Many people have found it mis-placed and out of sync with the movie. I did not find that way. I found the music's presence to be quite conscious and intended.<br/><br/>The title of the movie is mis-leading to many movie goers who expect quite a bit of blood, gory and violence in the movie, and what one finds is a trying absorbing (to them slow) narrative on the beautiful terrain of Texas deserts.<br/><br/>Overall, a wonderful movie to watch.<br/><br/>(Stars 8 out of 10)"
"mtali42","8","3","6","9 March 2008"," Daniel Day Lewis is a special actor
","I seen this movie before the Oscars and I just knew Daniel Day-Lewis would win Best Actor. Although the movie was shot really well and the music was good, there really wasn't much going on with the story. It certainly wasn't something that I haven't seen before, it was just set in a different context. To sum the whole movie up in just a few words would be to say. It involves a lot of oil found under a small town of poor, Christian believers. Where there is oil there is money, and where there is money there is greed. It also involves the relationship between a man and his son after a catastrophic event occurs. It certainly gives us an idea on how the oil business was ran in the early 1900's. This movie is sort of an analogy on how the world is being maintained today. Oil is a high commodity, and banks and oil companies are taking advantage of the situation. Although there were some slow spots, Daniels' great, unforgettable performance keeps it very entertaining."
"Philby-3","8","3","6","24 February 2008"," An oilman's story well if slowly told
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson, ""inspired"" by Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel ""Oil"" and the career of Californian wildcatter Ed Doheny, has combined with the fine British actor Daniel Day Lewis to produce a truly remarkable character, Daniel Plainview, oil wildcatter and horrible human being. While Sinclair, a lifelong socialist, attacked capitalism overtly, Anderson is more subtle; he concentrates on the effect that the unbridled lust for wealth has on one man.<br/><br/>We are told little about Daniel Plainview's background. He came to the West from Fond du Lac,Wisconsin (as did Doheny), probably off a small farm, spent some time working for the US Geological Survey, where he picked up some expertise in mineral location, and by the time the film opens (1898) he is mining for silver in New Mexico. Mining was and is a hard, dangerous business, and when one of his employees is killed in an accident Daniel takes custody of the man's infant son. Daniel strikes oil and by 1913 has several producing wells. His big break comes when Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), a farm boy from Southern California estranged from his dirt-poor evangelical family, tells him about oil seeping from the ground. Daniel swoops down on the family, buys their miserable property, starts drilling and hits a gusher. But this wealth is not without its costs.<br/><br/>Daniel, who admits to his erstwhile ""brother"" that he dislikes most people, is a driven man who will do anything including murder to achieve his goals, and he makes John D. Rockefeller Senior, the ruthless founder of Standard Oil, look like a gentleman. Starting out as a small time wildcatter he eventually aligns himself with the big boys, Union Oil of California, having been exquisitely rude to their opposition, Standard Oil. But wealth does not buy him happiness; by 1927 he has come to resemble Charles Foster Kane, alone in his huge mansion (in fact the one Doheny built for his son), alcoholic, rejecting his son, and in despair.<br/><br/>This saga is told in a leisurely fashion and some viewers will find the pace (stately) and length (2 hours 40 minutes) daunting. Daniel Day Lewis creates an enormously forceful character though we are left to work out for ourselves how he got that way. His Daniel is not religious though he pays lip service to the evangelicals along the way. His ""spiritual"" opponent, the Sunday's other son Eli (also played by Paul Dano), a Pentecostal preacher, turns out to be two-faced and the film ends in a final confrontation between the two.<br/><br/>I'm not sure who the villain is meant to be - atheists and believers can both be ruthless capitalists  it's up to the rest of us to make sure they do not get out of hand. Even so, the film is an impressive achievement from a director previously known for small, quirky movies like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"". The cinematography is wonderful  you can also smell the oil - and the musical score atmospheric. Above all, the film captures the mood of the times. Now, of course we have to stop burning the stuff."

","For several decades at the turn of the twentieth century, oil was the life-blood of the United States of America. Ordinary men became millionaires practically overnight, and thriving towns sprung up wherever an ocean of oil was discovered underground. Then again, many men failed in all attempts to achieve wealth through oil drilling, and countless lost their lives in the feverish pursuit of ""black gold."" Though the period, in the decades before the Great Depression would bring an entire world to its knees, proved a particularly prosperous time for America, it is also marked by significant incidents of corruption, bribery and betrayal. My first film from director Paul Thomas Anderson {who has previously achieved success with 'Boogie Nights (1997),' 'Magnolia (1999)' and 'Punch-Drunk Love (2002)'} is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, ""Oil!"" An exceptional epic, a grand and sweeping saga of the early years of the oil business, 'There Will Be Blood (2007)' traces the fortunes of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an charismatic prospector who achieves enormous wealth despite (or perhaps thanks to) his disdain for the human race.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, an actor whose dedication to his roles has become legendary, is absolutely superb in the starring role, bringing an incredible intensity to Plainview that simply demands your complete and utter attention. The audience hangs onto his every word with an awed hush; when Daniel Plainview is speaking, you know that he means what he says. Throughout his harsh life, he has always expressed unbridled contempt for the people around him; when we first meet Plainview, he is mining alone for silver, his distrust of others even then driving him towards solitude. When necessity forces him to hire additional workers, a horrific drilling accident leaves an infant orphaned, and so Plainview decides to adopt young H.W. (Dillon Freasier, Russell Harvard as an adult) as his own. At first, we consider this to be an uncharacteristic act of kindness, perhaps evidence of a streak of humanity that lurks far within. However, time soon reveals Plainview's scheme, and the unfortunate H.W. finds himself to be little more than a prop, a fresh young family face to be used to underline his father's business propositions.<br/><br/>Another prevalent theme of the film is the hypocrisy of religion. Paul Dano is excellent as Eli Sunday, a local faith-healer for the Church of the Third Revelation. Throughout the film, we are influenced into regarded Eli and Plainview as two opposing entities  namely, as Good versus Evil. However, by the end of the film, the former is shown to be as corrupt and dishonest as any other man. Plainview has long disregarded all religion as superstition, but agrees to participate in a humiliating initiation ceremony in order to secure the leasing rights to an old man's (Hans Howes) tract of land. This demonstration first highlights Eli's underlying streak of depravity, but all is exposed in the Wall Street stock-market crash of 1929, when Plainview sadistically taunts Eli into denouncing himself as a ""false prophet"" and his God as ""a superstition."" In a highly unorthodox but exceedingly fascinating conclusion, a drunken Plainview bludgeons Eli to death with a bowling pin, the faith-healer effectively, though inadvertently, martyring himself in order to punish the sins that have gone unpunished for so very long.<br/><br/>'There Will Be Blood' is brimming with astonishing set-pieces, most memorably the ""blow-out"" of oil from the Little Boston well, and the subsequent oil fire. We do, indeed, detect another momentary streak of paternal humanity in Plainview's frenzied scurry to rescue his permanently-deafened son, both covered from head-to-toe in black veins of oil, though this swiftly dissipates as he abandons his son to tend to the flaming well. P.T. Anderson is known for his bold and unique cinematic style, and his latest film won't appeal to all audiences {my three friends afterward described the film as, respectively, ""good,"" ""all right"" and ""terrible""}, but the expertise with which the film is produced is undeniable. At tomorrow's Academy Awards, I would not be surprised if 'There Will Be Blood' takes out the Best Picture honours, even if {having seen four of the five nominees} my fingers are crossed for a Coen brothers' win."

"xtopperx","7","13","43","21 December 2007"," There Will Be Salad Tossing
","About 7 Stars<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis DOES deserve a nomination. Though the flaws of the movie can't be dismissed. Dano's acting is utterly eclipsed by Day-Lewis,which works against the telling of the story. Also, over the 40 year course of the story there's zero age progression on DD-L or Dano, who always looks 14. Did Anderson think that was cute?<br/><br/>Little House On The Prairie meets A Clockwork Orange (but neutered to a virtual PG-13), with some vibes from the original Planet Of The Apes.<br/><br/>Cinematography, Tempo and Acting are fantastic. Ambition is the most critical element in this movie; and I give it to Anderson... that he makes the point that The Meek Are Blessed, even if terrorized by the ruthless.This movie though is a major criticism against Americans; you can't construct a universe where the greatest businessman and religious person are reckless without saying ""Hey, This is how the world is."" <br/><br/>It blurs the line between between ambition and corruption; like cheering for ignorance. I am not drawn into movies about nihilists. If you think christians and capitalists suck then this may be your movie. To be fair to Anderson, there are businessmen and christians in this flick that aren't nasty; they just have no ambition... so where's the socialist white knight, Anderson? Or should Americans just take a f-ing leap? This story works better as a story than it does as a movie: Movies are a visual medium; symmetry can't just break for the ending, then call it clever. For the better part of 2 and a half hours Anderson immerses us in sweeping vistas of the California wilderness... which leads to us spending the last 15 minutes in the main character's basement.(?) I don't understand how this made sense to Anderson while story-boarding.<br/><br/>When I think of PT I think of Magnolia, Boogie Nights and Hard Eight. When I think of Quenton Tarantino I think of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. For me this flick might be for PT what Kill Bill is for Tarantino."
"alansapp","1","10","31","16 February 2008"," Slow, uneventful, discordant score, no emotional connection with characters
","We spent a month at a movie last evening trying to get through this horrible blend of writing and score. I'm not certain that the composer actually saw the movie, the score seemed unrelated to any emotional theme in the movie and evoked an internal terror that the score would continue. I found peace during the few lulls that happened between the attempt at music (or the discordant noise which bore deeply into my brain). The movie was predictable and very slow with the ever-present pregnant pauses (which seem to indicate depth for Oscar nominated movies), however in this case, it looked more like the actors had forgotten their lines ! Of particular interest (read: unrealistic), was the notion that approximately 20 years had passed, yet the preacher didn't age. He maintained his acne, his adolescent voice and had no visible facial hair. We are avid movie buffs, and until this movie, have never left the theater before the end, however, this movie didn't inspire us stay for the finish. we think the title ""There will be Blood"" may refer to movie patrons threatening the ticket sellers."
"lkarabeg","1","6","16","7 May 2008"," Appallingly boring
","Appallingly boring, this tedious, insipid movie grinds on and on until yawns are upon the mouths of all but those who might see some kind of eccentric, impressionistic quality to it (and those who leave early, of whose escape I am envious). It seems that the previous reviewers can be divided into the crowd who cannot stop praising this movie, and the few who are shouting that the emperor of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no clothes. I am of the latter few.<br/><br/>This movie's elusive storyline contains no protagonist, no antagonist and absolutely no clear-cut ""goal"" whatsoever for the main character Daniel Plainview. The viewer follows the story of Daniel Plainview as he goes about his business of expanding his early 20th century oil company, through several banal setbacks. Characteristic of this movie are the long periods of silence accompanied by dramatic music, which culminate in what can only be called nothing. Not much more is offered in the way of acting or even filming, for that matter. Both are less than mediocre at best, and I'm loath to begin verbally butchering the individual performances. To be fair, I must emphasize that the kid playing Plainview's son (Dillon Freasier) and Daniel Day-Lewis himself, as well as the editor's cutting, were particularly dreadful.<br/><br/>In summary, the movie lacks content and quality, visually, intellectually and content-wise. If ever a movie deserved the one-star rating, this one does."
"maczones","1","6","16","12 April 2008"," There Won't Be Blood
","This film does not even deserve the 1 star it got...the only reason it got it was because IMDb does not offer no stars. If 1 star is ""Awful"" then 0 stars must mean it is downright a ""Disgrace"". For 2+ hours I watched this much anticipated film with only knowing that DDL won an Oscar for the performance of the year, Well if this is an indication of excellence in acting, then someone needs to revise the Method acting book and include a new chapter called ""A sucker is born every minute"". This film was absolutely pointless and like DDL's poor interpretation of a drunkard, I really needed, like him, a drink to try to put everything into sync. Too bad the liquor did not work for me. DDL's acting: Legend has it that DDL's acting techniques are legendary because he immerses himself into the role months before shooting begins and then takes months after shooting has stopped to get back to normal. Well I could swear if I closed my eyes and every time he opened his mouth to say something, I thought it was John Huston talking. Wow, this is great acting indeed, a ventriloquist interpreting John Huston....I will not go into details here like those folks that thought this movie was better than slice bread but I will say this, the movie was not a movie but really a bad dream and I'm glad I've awaken to find out it was only a bad dream....let's all hope there are no nightmares to come."
"TOMASBBloodhound","5","6","16","17 February 2008"," Lacking.
","Once again it seems that P.T. Anderson has fooled a great many people into believing he has made a great film. Though There Will Be Blood is miles ahead of Magnolia, Mr. Anderson has still to this day made only one great film. That would be Boogie Nights, in case you're wondering. There Will Be Blood is an obvious attempt at greatness, and for that reason alone all involved need to be given credit. Unfortunately, this film as a whole is a misfire with nuggets of greatness found here and there.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis deserves all of the accolades and awards he will likely win for his performance as Daniel Plainview, an obsessed oil baron from the early days of the twentieth century. There is a grand coldness that beams down from him on all those around him as he attempts to extract as much oil as possible from the California desert and eventually build a pipeline to the ocean so he can avoid shipping costs. He uses false promises and charm to buy out everyone standing in his way. His relentlessness will simply not allow him to be anything other than successful. His only companion for much of the film is an orphan boy he raises as his son. Eventually, an accident deafens the boy, and Plainview basically casts him aside. Other than a man claiming to be his long-lost half brother, Plainview never seems close to anyone else. Though he eventually achieves great success, he is really just a shell of a man on the inside.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is how it is written. Anderson makes the mistake of going for character development above anything else. The trouble with that is his main character cannot be developed. After the first twenty minutes of the film, we know all we're ever going to know about Daniel Plainview. The script should have focused more on Plainveiw the businessman, and how the oil business works. We don't really get much insight to just how Plainview backs up his claims about being able to deliver on his promises about drilling and extracting oil. We don't see many disputes involving Plainview and his competition, either. There are a couple of arguments he has with some rival oilmen, but these eventually break down into how Plainview is a bad father and whatnot. Again, going for character development when we should be looking at the business side of the man.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot, and filled with eerie music similar to that found in The Shining. That kind of music worked in The Shining. Here it is basically a distraction. The acting is uniformly excellent from the supporting cast. Paul Dano is wonderful as the boy preacher of a nearby community who becomes Plainview's rival on a spiritual level. Their rivalry almost gives this film an incredible final scene until Anderson jumps the shark in the final frames with an act of violence that left everyone in the theater scratching their heads. That scene was working spectacularly up until the very end.<br/><br/>Worse than anything else, this film was kind of boring. Now ""boring"" is not a word I like to use in describing another person's creative output. But this time... yes, I was a bit bored. There are long stretches of this film that drag on and on with no payoff to them. The film is rated R, yet there isn't much in the way of violence, sex, or profanity. Honestly it wouldn't even be a hard PG-13 in my book. This film has been nominated for all manner of awards and accolades. Frankly, if you hold this film up to No Country For Old Men, is pales drastically in comparison. That is a great film. There Will Be Blood just isn't. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","i bought this movie not knowing really what it was about, i saw the previews and it looked like a dark, violent movie with some beautiful cinematography with a thought provoking plot, much to the same level and scope of ""no country for old men"". the movie started out with an eerie shrill of a violin... awesome, this movie is off to a great start, i can tell it is going to be right up my alley. the scenery combined with the soundtrack in the first 15 minutes built up big expectations for me, but after 2.5 hours there was nothing to show for it. absolutely nothing. <br/><br/>getting into the specifics, ill start with the soundtrack. first of all, the soundtrack was entirely way too loud in every scene, but i could tolerate that, even welcomed it in some cases. like when the music started to get really suspenseful-- and really loud-- and eerie-- and you can feel that something is going to happen-- you can't sit still-- on the edge of your seat-- and-- and-- ........ nothing... nothing?! why was the soundtrack playing music for 3 solid minutes making me think someone is about to get killed? the music builds up for an epic scene for no apparent reason. this just does not happen once, but numerous times (id even argue every time). even the soundtrack for the non-suspense scenes were entirely out of place and did not match the mood being conveyed by the cinematography. the entire movie i waited for something thrilling to happen, something that would really just blow me away, but absoluetly nothing happens. i don't often judge movies by the title, but i was expecting a movie titled ""there will be blood"" to have a respectable amount of violence, but i didn't even see a major conflict in the entire plot. a few people die, but stretched out over a nearly 3 hour movie it was not enough. the lack of violence is completely overshadowed by the absence of a climax. about half way through, i was in disbelief that absolutely nothing had happened yet. i dragged through the final second half of it, because i absolutely convinced myself that something so awesome had to happen at the end that i would be speechless... but as you might guess NOTHING HAPPENED! for the last 20 minutes i was begging him to kill something, kill the dog! kill everyone in town! set the town on fire! LET THERE BE BLOOD, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO SOMETHING!!!! i nearly lost my sanity praying for a saving grace for this movie, but it absolutely disappointed me. nothing happened, there was no blood, it wasted 157 minutes of my life. <br/><br/>after torturing myself with this movie, i looked here (IMDb) to see its rating, and i was shocked to see such a high rating. death proof's high rating almost made me sign up to IMDb to warn people, but i could not in good conscious let people walk into this movie like i did with big expectations for this movie. save yourself some time, go see No Country For Old Men."

"mjjusa-1","7","5","13","10 January 2008"," Paul Thomas Anderson's Inferno
","The Promethean rise of a driven man in a young oil industry gives this movie moments that make it as good any movie seen in a long while. Rise and fall stories are a familiar trope in movies, especially American movies. There Will Be Blood takes a different and strange detour that is not really a fall, but a sudden sidestep into demented isolation.<br/><br/>Attached, and ruinous to the movie, is Paul Thomas Anderson's obvious self loathing and loathing for religion in general and Christianity in particular. His pen, used to bludgeon, hammers any joy out of a Chinatown fable about oil, in the service of what seems to be therapy for the Director's personal seventh circle of religious hell. His, a hell hectored to a captive movie audience, who are expected to be entertained by his very personal denial of faith in an otherwise interesting semi-historical story of how little oil became big oil.<br/><br/>What begins with a bit of religious weirdness a third of the way into the movie, becomes an ongoing relentless evisceration of all that faith or salvation represents to some people. It is all meat to the Director's abattoir of nihilistic expression of his personal loss of faith. Daniel Day Lewis, worth the price of admission to any movie, dominates every scene despite what many of the improbable scenes in There Will Be Blood require him to do. Filmed in sweating close up to excess, in shadow, or eerily in interrogation room quality bright light, he is alternately sublime and ridiculous. Allowed to be an oilman on the make, he is one of the remarkable movie characters of our time. Pulled this way and that by a tortured script that can't make up its narrative mind, with a father son subplot that makes the word 'excessive' seem inexpressive, he is left, at the end of the movie, as a drunken murderous reversed Torquemada.<br/><br/>The bludgeon bludgeons, no rhyme, no reason, against a religious jones that makes a crack cocaine addiction seem a taste for a third chocolate chip cookie in comparison.<br/><br/>In a country with declining church attendance, an increasingly secular country with the major sources of mass communication skeptical of all religious thought and practice, one wonders at the Director's angst. Maybe being named after two apostles is a heavier burden that can be imagined.<br/><br/>The final scenes of degradation and violence caused me to almost turn my head. Why, what for, what in the movie or in Daniel Day Lewis' character brought us to such an ending? What personal experience brought Paul Thomas Anderson to such a nihilistic world view? This movie lover sat silent at the end wondering at what he had been subjected to and for what purpose? In There Will Be Blood, there is little exposition as to character motivation, and one personality who dominates the movie from beginning to end. I wish it had bee Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview, not Paul Thomas Anderson's self-loathing."

","The real reason to see this movie is for Daniel Day-Lewis's incredible performance which reminded me of his performance in GANGS OF NEW YORK crossed with Jack Nicholson's in THE SHINING. <br/><br/>My biggest criticism of the movie is that it didn't follow through on the whole theme of the price of modernity. The price of modernity is even more of an issue today than it was in 1911, and on both an international and local scale. An outsider comes to town and suggests you compromise your way of life, and in return, society in general will prosper, but nowhere near as much as the stranger will prosper. And who's to say whether or not society really prospers? <br/><br/>All of this is fascinating, philosophically dense stuff, so it was a let down for me that the movie abandoned this theme and went for the mad psychopath plot crossed with the sad billionaire plot that we've seen before in countless other movies. I definitely recommend the movie, Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, but from a thematic point of view, the movie is much more thin than it ought to have been."

","This critically acclaimed film follows the life of fictional oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) from 1898 to 1927 as he first discovers oil, seeks to expand his business (along the way hearing about an oil rich farming area and striking it big), works to establish a pipeline to circumvent railroad shipping fees, and finally we see the state of his life when he's finally achieved his ambitions.<br/><br/>On the surface this may seem to be a good backdrop for a fascinating character study and period adventure. And perhaps it is. However, I for one walked away from the film very disappointed and empty.<br/><br/>Here is yet another example of what the ""critics"" seem to love in a movie these days. A movie is now a monumental achievement and great art if:<br/><br/>1). The production values are high 2). The running time is over 2 1/2 hours 3). The film gives the aura of being an introspective morality play 4). Christianity/Christians are shown to be stupid/eccentric/hateful/abusive, etc. 5). We see someone slowly descend into madness or evil 6). There is no clear-cut protagonist and no redeeming values presented<br/><br/>Now if this is your idea of a great movie, then by all means watch this one (and a million other hyped films with the same elements). However, I fail to see the point of watching a movie where we are drug down into a pit of darkness and made to waller in the filth up to and through the very end. That is all this film offers.<br/><br/>While Day-Lewis does a decent job in his role, it is one that is never makes sense to the viewer. For such a long film, the character development is poor, and it consistently sends a mixed message about greed, corruption, loyalty, family, religion, capitalism, etc. This film with it's dissonant score, dramatic cinematography, method acting and slow, slow pacing tries REALLY hard to convince the viewer that he is watching some very important events happen in the heart of our little oil tycoon. When a film has to try so hard, it's NOT a good sign. But then I guess it was good enough to fool the critics.<br/><br/>In the end, although there were good elements such as the whole scene in and around where the oil derrick catches fire (this was a wonderful technical achievement which blended well into the story in an unobtrusive way), and Day-Lewis' solid performance, it was not anywhere close to enough to carry the overlong non-sensical film that leads to nowhere.<br/><br/>It's not even worth watching once.

I had to shut the movie off and haven't watched it again, because it was agonizing.

It has the largest flower of all plants, but there is no biological explanation for its size, which could be many times smaller and still fulfil its function. The only explanation is that it's a product of luxury; a parasite doesn't have to economize."" - David Attenborough<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"", based on Upton Sinclair's satirical ""Oil!"", stars Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector whom we first see trudging through a Californian desert. He's alone, presumably searching for oil.<br/><br/>Whilst Anderson's earlier films owned a large debt to Altman and Scorsese, ""Blood's"" opening scenes strongly recall Kubrick (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Shining"") and Herzog, specifically Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"" (Anderson borrows several haunting musical cues from Herzog, along with creepy, silent shots of oil workers and oil wells).<br/><br/>But ""Blood"" quickly breaks away from these influences and becomes something else entirely. Anderson's film is preoccupied with elaborate con games, virtually every scene revolving around confidence tricksters, fraudsters and hucksters, be they of a religious, familial or corporate/capitalist nature. In short, this is a film exclusively about seeing and hearing, about knowing who to trust and who not to trust and about the absolute truth never residing in plain view.<br/><br/>Savvy to such hucksters, because he is himself one, Plainview is a misanthropic, giant of a man. He isolates himself from mankind and seems disgusted by human beings; he sees through them. This hatred then fuels his budding empire, which he builds with lies and a callous disregard of others. Later he adopts a boy and uses the child to seduce villagers, advertising himself as a family man and trustworthy baron.<br/><br/>""If I SAY I AM,"" Plainview yells early in the film, ""YOU WILL AGREE."" It is clear he has a god complex. The name ""Daniel"" itself means ""God's Judgement"". Indeed, Plainview doesn't explain himself to anyone. He sees himself as the final word over all things. Elsewhere he says that he wishes ""to rule and never explain himself"", likens his own body to the ""Church of the Third Revelation"" and threatens to slit the throats of all those who challenge him. ""Don't tell me how to raise my family!"" he later yells. And when other oil barons mock him, he growls ""I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO DO IT."" Earlier, when told by a preacher to allow him to bless a new oil well, Plainview deliberately does the opposite, asserting his will over others.<br/><br/>In short, nobody tells Daniel Plainview what to do. To harbour the will of mere men, he believes, is to deny his own greatness. Plainview even has the power to end the film. ""It is finished,"" he says, the screen fading to black under his almighty spell. It is this ego-mania, that itself fuels his oil empire, his desire to extract, expand and crush the will of others.<br/><br/>In a preacher called Eli Sunday, Planview eventually encounters some resistance. Eli, himself a confidence trickster, seeks to set up a church. While Plainview styles himself as a family man and benevolent oil baron, Eli styles himself as a faith healer, prophet and miracle worker. Of course both men are self serving con artists. The film then develops into a battle between capitalism (profit) and religion (prophet), or rather, one in which capitalism replaces the ""holy scripture"" as the new religion, Plainview (""I have competition in me!"") the triumphant, psychotic face of capital.<br/><br/>Late in the film, Plainview's adopted son loses his hearing. Instead of using his voice, Plainview must now speak to his son through actions. But throughout the film Plainview's ""words"" and ""actions"" have been at odds. Now unable to raise his son in his image, Plainview thus sends the boy away. ""My blood does not run through him"", he says, dismissing the boy, cutting all genetic links.<br/><br/>Hilariously, when others chastise Plainview for sending the boy away, Plainview promptly brings the kid back and pretends to be a good father. This is not love. This is simply Plainview putting on yet another show in order to prove them wrong. He's feeding his own bruised ego.<br/><br/>It eventually becomes clear that Plainview both hates mankind, wishing to remain aloof and above ""it"", and secretly wishes to ""belong"". As such, he seeks ""blood"" and ""family"" to curb his loneliness (he only allows what he perceives to be the ""superior blood of family"" to enter his circle, a kind of genetic monopoly akin to the way he runs his business). And so when another confidence trickster approaches Plainview, claiming to be his long lost brother, Plainview quickly welcomes the man into his circle. But though he initially lets his defences down and accepts this man, the truth gradually becomes apparent to Plainview. This man is a con artist and has taken advantage of him! ""Do I really have a brother?"" Plainview asks, before shooting the man in the head.<br/><br/>Plainview then seeks brotherhood in religion, but such hopes break down when Eli forces Plainview to confess in church. Here Eli wants to expose Plainview, but Plainview, of course, does not like being exposed. He is a snake who thrives on a certain invisibility. But now here he is, laid bare. This confessional scene is reversed toward ""Blood's"" climax, where Plainview forces Eli to confess that he is a sham and a liar. This confession is not enough, though, and Plainview bludgeons the man to death with a bowling pin. The game ends and Plainview wipes out the last vestiges of competition.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Though it lacks the scope of Sinclair's novel, ""Blood"" is a strong tale about pitchmen, be they carriers of Bibles or business cards. See ""Elmer Gantry""."

","A bowling pin.<br/><br/>A bowling pin is used as a murder weapon at the end of THERE WILL BE BLOOD. It proves to be a perfectly effective means of committing a killing, but you have to ask ""Why a bowling pin?"" At it's center, THERE WILL BE BLOOD is about a confrontation between the rewards of capitalism and the glories of religion -- the material versus the spiritual -- so of all the possible symbolic weapons that filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson could have selected for the killing -- a crucifix, a golden trophy, a mining tool -- why would he end his film using such a mundane thing as a bowling pin as a weapon? Maybe it is not that important, but it is strange that a film that carefully builds in mesmerizing power in the first half, only to see its sense of grandeur slowly dissipate in the second, would ultimately end in a scene so grim, yet unintentionally comic. What could have been and should have been one of the most powerful scenes in the film ends up being just curiously odd, with the horror of the action sapped by the lack of irony in the selection of the death tool.<br/><br/>The film deals with Daniel Plainview, who rises from being a turn-of-the-century, dirt-poor prospector to being an oil tycoon. From prospecting for silver to striking oil to building an empire and helping a city rise out of the desert, the film reflects the building of America during an era when the Duponts and the Gettys and the Rockefellers grew into titans, slowly dragging the rest of the country up the ladder of prosperity with them. Director-writer Anderson generates both a sense of awe and giddy exhilaration as he charts Daniel's wheelings and dealings and manipulations, going beyond wealth to raw power. It is the American Dream in all of it's thrilling glory. The first half of THERE WILL BE BLOOD is masterfully told.<br/><br/>But, as is the way with most visions of capitalism in Hollywood, the dream (or the dreamer) must be destroyed in the second half. That is to be expected; but as skillfully as Anderson shapes Daniel's rise, his means of destroying the dream is clumsy and lacking irony. Like a balloon that doesn't pop, but merely deflates, the second half of the film just shrinks to nothing. Daniel goes mad, but for reasons that are neither clear nor well articulated. The big gusher that secures Daniel's mega-wealth coincides with an accident that causes his adopted twelve-year-old son to go deaf. Despite his love for his son being unquestioned to this point, Daniel abruptly rejects the damaged child and embarks on a series of random plot twists. Nothing in the second half really flows logically, other than the assumption that success has driven Daniel insane. When he is shamed into reclaiming his son and manipulated by greed into receiving baptism, two things that might redeem him, they instead drive him further into madness. The film suggests that if religion is an opium to the masses, it is sheer poison to Daniel. That glib explanation isn't enough.<br/><br/>But as poorly plotted as the film becomes, the biggest weakness in BLOOD is in the handling of the religious theme. Daniel's adversary throughout is Eli Sunday, a teenage preacher in the small Texas town that Daniel buys up and takes over. Though played well enough by Paul Dano, Eli is a weak character, not just morally but dramatically. The rivalry between the two is one-sided and no matter what Eli does, we never feel he will get the best of Daniel. I think Anderson sees the concept of religion as being just as corrupting as greed. He wants us to know right off the bat that Eli is, if not evil, at least fraudulent. He wants us to dislike him immediately and that is what Dano does with little subtlety, playing the boy evangelist as arrogant and devoid of charm, grace or sincerity. If we lose sympathy for Daniel, we never feel it at all for Eli, even when we should.<br/><br/>Thus, the final confrontation falls flat. Going in we know that Eli is a false prophet, so when Daniel humiliates him and crushes him, there is no surprise and no sense of justice or victory on Daniel's part. Had Eli been established as a seemingly strong and noble character, and then Daniel succeeded in bullying him into denouncing God, that would have been a devastating climax. Or if the apparently weak-willed Eli had unexpectedly stood up to Daniel and confirmed that his belief in the power of God is stronger, that could have crushed Daniel and that would have been a powerful climax. But, as is, Anderson gives us a surprisingly violent ending where one evil character destroys another character of lesser evil, thus proving nothing about either greed or religion.<br/><br/>Even with Anderson's craftsmanship behind the camera, the film is almost a one-man show, with Daniel Day-Lewis as Plainview propelling the story through even the sluggish second half almost totally on the strength of his dynamic performance. That alone guarantees that the film is never dull. Yet, for all of this forcefulness, I don't think Daniel Plainview ever becomes a three dimensional character. The film suffers from a dearth of interesting supporting characters for Day-Lewis to interact with, but more to the point, in showing how isolated Plainview is from others, the film never lets the character reveal himself to the viewer either. It is a big, glorious performance of a character who remains surprisingly small and empty.<br/><br/>Anderson clearly wants THERE WILL BE BLOOD to be an epic just as much as Plainview wants to amass wealth. But just as Plainview finds that wealth without purpose is meaningless, Anderson shows us that the same is true about style without insight."

","I have to agree that this film is a tad overrated. As a piece of art, this film is technically a masterpiece. The cinematography, soundtrack and acting are flawless and quite reminiscent of Kubrick. The issue I have is that it is a difficult film to connect with emotionally and it's pacing is off, often meandering and losing it's punch. I consider myself a bit of a film snob, but at the end of the day, a ""best picture"" should not only have artistic merit, it should be consistently entertaining. There Will Be Blood is worth seeing but is not re-watchable. No Country is a much better example of an art film that entertains and connects with the audience."

"thetruth45","7","4","10","17 February 2008"," Ehhhhh,,,
","Okay, I'm not going to say this was the worst movie I've ever seen. However, the movie did have some problems which people are ignoring. I think movies that are ""suppose to be good to the movie elites"" and are low budget will get bombarded by compliments simply because people think they are suppose to worship it.<br/><br/>Let me start with Daniel Day Lewis's acting ability. Sure, it was technically GREAT acting, some of the best i've ever seen. But, it was cold and emotionless. I didn't feel ANYTHING for him. Isn't that the goal of acting? It's an actor's duty to take the audience on a journey and reward them. Although Lewis was totally believable, creepy, and captured this old time character wonderfully, he didn't take me on a worthwhile journey. I didn't feel sadness for him, I didn't feel pain in him. I think I would prefer a worse acting job if the actor actually made me feel something for the character.<br/><br/>Moreover, I think this is the problem I had with the entire movie. It was cold. How is a movie almost 3 hours, and you wind up feeling left wanting something to hold onto. We spend a long while developing relationships with characters to see them trashed in the end by an emotionless daniel day. I feel let down by the director, the actor, and the writer. Furthermore, if you want to have such a cold ending, why build it up for 3 hours? This movie could have had an hour trimmed off of it if they were going to have daniel day run around with a bowling pin murdering a preacher and telling his son that he's an orphan. Why build up all the subtleties and then thrown them in the garbage can? Besides that, the movie was pretty good. It was somewhat interesting to see well drilling in the early 1900's. The acting was overall pretty good. I just don't think this movie is nearly the 9 rating that everyone wants to think it is."
"bill_b4","5","4","10","9 February 2008"," Generally OK, But Flawed And Over-Hyped
","OK, I get it. Greed, especially for demonized oil will ruin your soul. But there were pretty big plot holes that didn't make this movie the top 250 gem for me that a lot of you other voters made it. The movie depicted the main character's slide into insanity without really explaining it. Was it his adopted son's handicap? Was it truly his greed and ambition? Was it his success? Was it his tortured past? These are questions left unanswered for me and honestly one's I will not spend too much time trying to figure out. I could understand the turmoil the son experienced after his injury, but just couldn't relate to it's effect on the father. I did enjoy the starkness with which the movie was depicted, no overbearing soundtrack trying to tug on my heart strings, just an increasingly crazy character that increasingly left me puzzled.<br/><br/>Oh, and Hollywood LOVES to portray the crazy Christian preacher with his ignorant followers, but they STILL don't understand that the most twisted church leaders have enticing charisma, not creepy personalities and sermons. The character portrayed in this movie reminded me more of Malachi from Children of the Corn, definitely an overplayed character...not believable at all. Don't get me wrong, there are preachers out there like that, but NOT with followings that comprise a whole town. Large followings are led astray by likable, relatable personalities, not creepy ones. Creepy characters just creep those around them out...they don't get them to dance in church and drink poisoned kool-aid by the dozens.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is being compared with Hannibal Lecter...by the mentally handicapped. Don't get me wrong...Mr. Plainview is plainly crazy. But evil? No way. My vote for the most recent, willy-inducing character goes to Anton Chigurh of No Country For Old Men. And may everyone that dared place him on the level of this true baddie be tracked down and eliminated with his bolt pistol like the mindless herd they are.<br/><br/>Yeah, this movie has everything an Oscar voter will love...a crazy Christian over-acting preacher, soul-devouring oil, and commercial hype ... basically everything that the road to hell should consist of. This movie is being compared to true Hollywood classics such as The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre. There are far better movies to see this Oscar season...personally, my vote goes to Juno. For those considering checking this movie out for the morality play aspect, do yourself a favor and stick with the classics like The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre. You'll be better off for it."

","There Will Be Blood (2007) <br/><br/>Number 1 - 2007<br/><br/>Top 30 - All Time <br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's Bona Fide film, is one of the most breathtaking exercises in the art of film-making you are ever likely to see. This is the apex of cinematic mastery.<br/><br/>The film documents the life of a misanthropic, greedy oil-man, Daniel Plainview, played terrifyingly by the spectacular Daniel Day Lewis, who will go on to win his second Academy Award.<br/><br/>The story begins in 1898, where Plainview is just a silver prospector, who finds a small amount of precious mineral, sells it and slowly starts his own drilling company with a few workers. One day, one of his workers dies in an accident and Plainview fosters the young orphan as his son, HW who he will later use as an object to paint himself as a family man to trick poor farmers, pilgrims, ranchers into selling their oil rich land for pocket change. Plainview is led to his ocean of oil by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who sells Plainview an oil lead, located on his family's property in Little Boston. Plainview agrees to come to Little Boston and yes he does discover oil and he buys the land cheaply from the Sunday family, where Eli Sunday (also Paul Dano, either playing an identical twin, or is up to something we are never assured of this), an evangelical priest who agrees for $10,000, which includes some money towards renovating his church.<br/><br/>The story continues, where Plainview, buys off any surrounding farms to ensure a monopoly and he grows, with prospects of building a pipeline.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is, perhaps, above all, a riveting study, of man, particularly a misanthropic, greedy man whose increasing wealth only fuels his volatility and instability. We are shown how Plainview abandons his son twice: firstly when he loses his hearing in an oil accident and at the end, when an old Plainview, who has truly become menacing (very much resembling Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York), tells his son how he was a 'bastard in a basket' as he shouts it, in his big, ghostly mansion. We are shown how Plainview shoots a man in the head, who pretended to be his 'brother from another mother' and at the end, he manically and repeatedly smashes Eli's head with a bowling pin.<br/><br/>Some critics have criticised the 'third act' of the film, particularly the ending of being shallow and lacking some grandeur. While I can see their point, I disagree; this is an eccentric, a menacing, destructive film, that surprises and surprises again. 'There Will Be Blood' needs no Hollywood tricks to shock or amaze.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood, is also a film about the birth of capitalism, along with the birth of America, in its most primitive, preaching, desolate areas. The greedy, dishonest man who tricks the truly uneducated into handing their fortunes. Another great thing about this film comes through the portion of Eli Sunday; the evangelist, who exorcises a ghost through a lonely woman every week; who looks up to himself as a prophet of God. Some scenes are purely disturbing as we see the nature of many of the cults and sub-branches of the churches that still, very much exist in America today.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's achievement equals if not surpasses Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane', and yes this is his 'Kane'. The film, while being perfect in its cinematic nature, it is also technically superior; the cinematography by Robert Elswit, that pounding, miraculous score (or rather collection of music) from Johnny Greenwood along with the editing and the sound.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the best cinema of the year and probably the decade. There Will Be Blood stands close to the greatest cinematic events in history. A formidable achievement.<br/><br/>Absolutely breathtaking. Unmissable.<br/><br/>10/10"

"damienbell","Null","4","10","1 February 2008"," W Loved This Film
","It is a beautiful film to watch, and the musical score is fun. However, this is a political ""message"" film, and not everyone likes that sort of thing in an eight-dollar-per-ticket movie. When we consider recent events, and the degree to which petroleum defines our economy and US foreign policy, this film seems a bit too propagandistic. The ""targets"" in this film are too convenient. It is very easy to go after oil men and religious phonies. In this film, it's even more annoying, because the connection between those two ""evils"" is so contrived.<br/><br/>I would have respected this film more if the villains were not so over-the-top. Most businessmen are not Ken Lay (Enron). There are many hardworking, more-or-less decent people who have endeavoured to make big bucks through industrial means. Yet, many of those enterprises have contributed to a pretty crummy state of affairs in the long run (Oil, Automobiles, Aviation, etc.). Similar things could be said about ""religious"" people.<br/><br/>Human beings are stupid, short-sighted, superstitious, and generally pathetic, such is my opinion. I don't need some artsy film director ramming this down my throat. People are stupid. ""So what?"" Technology has created the crap-hole that we now inhabit, thanks to the genius minds that brought forth so many technological advances. It is often the lesser minds (people like Henry Ford, etc.) who capitalize upon the achievements of the true ""scary geniuses"". They only succeed, because there are vast quantities of stupid people to exploit and manipulate. This is theme of many stories.<br/><br/>I understand that motion pictures are constrained by time. Things must be simplified to tell the story. The villain in this film is probably a metaphor for a larger problem (Big Oil ""in bed"" with phony Jesus types, in some marriage of convenience...yet, in the long run, the religious people get the shaft...even if it's a hollow victory for evil Big Oil).<br/><br/>Here's a stretch: George Bush got elected by courting the Religious Right. Yet, his Big Oil cronies eventually get their way, and the religious fools who put him in office end up battered, bloody, and penniless...having been robbed and lied to for years and years.<br/><br/>Am I reading into this too much? Regardless, the characters in this film are just too much...too much color...too much message. Perhaps this reveals the ultimate inability of film to convey intricate and detailed concepts.<br/><br/>The series of weird events that brought us George W. Bush (100 years of Big Oil....phony Evangelical Christianity, etc), cannot be neatly packaged. There may be real-world parallels, but the story is still a stretch.<br/><br/>Also, I am no student of film, but when filmmaker reveals their influences so explicitly, it seems to distract from the material. The last 45 minutes of this film are absurd and very derivative of Stanley Kubrick. Others have noticed this.<br/><br/>Maybe Kubrick was just more adept at hiding his influences.<br/><br/>6 Stars: Beautiful Film to watch. The message is overt and the plot contrived. I wonder if the original short story was so contrived..."

I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I want to rule and never, ever explain myself. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people."" The film is a saga of just this, a man attempting to get away from it all. It is dark and bloody brilliant for it. I had my doubts early in the film when the sound appeared off from film rising to a finale that was not there. Actually, it was more foreboding than off, but it felt different. Nevertheless, it kept that throughout driving a deliberate pace, which built and built throughout making many expected and many non-expected turns and twists. I have never seen a Paul Thomas Anderson film until now, but this film is a great masterpiece to add to the films already out falling in line with No Country for Old Men and Zodiac for dark themes and moods.<br/><br/>The first and strongest aspect of the film is the central performer, Daniel Day Lewis who plays a charismatic ""oil"" man named Daniel Plainview. He speaks those words at the top in confidence to his brother, Henry. He believes his jealously and beliefs are ingrained in his whole family and, therefore, must reside in his brother as well. Well things in that respect are flawed, but it just goes further to prove Daniel's angry man complex. He can never truly be at peace. In addition, he finds a perfect enemy in the town ""minister"" Eli Sunday, played with fervor by Paul Dano, who is made of the same stuff. Into this mix is added the beloved ""son"" of Daniel, H W, who appears to be innocent, but cannot be truly, so with such a mentor/father as Daniel who will do whatever it takes to succeed to get away from everyone.<br/><br/>These are just the keys players, the films is further helped by a brilliant symphonic soundtrack constructed by Johnny Greenwood, which invokes classical pieces, as well as, more ""primitive"" sounds. I use primitive to refer to the native sound of it all, almost what could be called, a minimal sounding chorus at times with a single drum or strain carrying in the background. I think it helps to reach the savageness of the main characters and their ever growing jealously and anger.<br/><br/>It is hard to talk about the film without revealing twists, which help to add to the greatness of the film, but I will leave it at that to suffice to say that this is great addition to the strong group of masterpieces that I have watched this past year."

","There Will Be Blood is a masterful adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1926 novel, Oil!.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, of Magnolia and Boogie Nights. Through actor Daniel Day-Lewis's spot-on representation of the ambitious oil tycoon created by Sinclair, one grows a respect for Daniel Plainview's enterprise, but the corruptive power of oil deteriorates the man's nobility, and along with it one's admiration for him.<br/><br/>Witnessing blow by blow the destruction of Plainview's good intentions is contrasted by an off-kilter score composed by Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood. From the opening scene, harsh, droning violins seem to foreshadow the troubles to come. As an unfortunate result of every business success, Daniel's personal problems multiply.<br/><br/>When Daniel and his son, H.W., move to the barren town of Little Boston to exploit a sea of oil beneath it, he becomes acquainted with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a religious zealot who runs a popular church in town. Eli's presence is continually problematic for Daniel, as they are both overly ambitious in their own pursuits.<br/><br/>As business continues to grow, Daniel becomes increasingly angry and withdrawn from the few close to him. In an emotionally climactic final scene, There Will Be Blood encapsulates the humanity of greed, and the corruption of power.<br/><br/>In a land where the success of a movie is judged by how many times Adam Sandler can bring down the house by talking like a developmentally disabled 4-year-old, and accidentally sleeping with his grandmother, pet, boss, or self, There Will Be Blood will score no points. This is because There Will Be Blood is actually a phenomenally entertaining and intelligent film, showcasing two of the year's best acting performances. (Day-Lewis and Dano) If one thing is certain, it is that There Will Be Blood will be well noticed by people who actually appreciate good movies. So, when the Oscar goes to Daniel Day-Lewis for Best Actor, four people will know what movie host Jon Stewart is referring to. The rest of the award shows viewers will be left scratching their heads, asking themselves, There Will Be Blood? Is that the movie about the vampires in Alaska?"

It was impossible to eke any enjoyment out of this film with the constant cacophony of chaotic nonsense chattering along in the ""background"". I suppose this was a feeble Hollywood attempt to impart ""importance"" to this cartoonish muckraking tale from the early 20th century.

","Everybody seems to agree that Daniel Day-Lewis did a great acting job. There is a lot of disagreement about the story itself. Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed, and he probably should have let someone else work on the screenplay. As other reviewers have noted, parts are actually laughable. Anderson spent so much time introducing different plot possibilities in the first and second acts and detailing the quest for oil that he seems to have forgotten the third act entirely. The relationship between the oilman and his adopted son is never fully developed. We jump from the boy's childhood to his wedding. The relationship between the oilman and the minister bounces back and forth -- which one is the protagonist? Neither possesses qualities worth preserving or emulating. This can't be called the story of a tragic fall, since the oilman starts out bad and only gets worse. The abrupt ending, a murder during a drunken brawl, reflected no particular purpose or resolution and had some members of the audience laughing out loud. If you want to watch the disintegration of a man who is victim of his own greed, ""Citizen Kane"" got it right. This one is not even close."

But then, there is Eli Sunday(Paul Dano), a priest who goes about calling himself a prophet, stumbling into every single move the oil businessman tries to make,trying to throw his life out of balance every time it somewhat intends to come on track.Apart from the protagonist and the antagonist the movie has many a elements that separate it from the rest of the promising crowd of winner.The 12 year old son, that Daniel Plainview always moves around with, his step brother who seems to appear out of nowhere during the second half of the movie, the constant twists and turns that keep the story's protagonist to remain a normal human even in spite of his success, all promise to keep the viewers engrossed for the two and a half hour length of this movie.The second aspect that needs to be mentioned apart from the storyline is the engaging and soulful background score that has been used throughout the movie, such a score that it never lets the excitement of anticipation die out from the audience.Almost all of the background score consists of symphonies and music from highly reputed 18th and 19th century composers from across the Europe.<br/><br/>All these endeavors in this movie would have been in vain if the atmosphere that is created in this movie would have failed, but the producers have seemed to take care of this aspect the most. The scenes that are put up, drive hard the point that the movie tries to develop, the struggle that goes into oil mining during that period is certainly visually developed through the arid uncultivated terrains, dry lands and vintage machineries that the movie shows. The movie seems to develop slowly, delivering less and arousing the desire to know more about the characters. The excellence of the director is clearly achieved as he delivers more than his previously directed works. But the depiction is Daniel Plainview, a character that grows from a small time miner into a confident man and to a ambitious person later, who puts his only relation i.e.with his son at stake for his desires, is very judiciously done by Daniel Day-Lewis. Having won an Oscar previously and having an experience of old time-western movies (Gangs of New York) he seems to breath life into the character of Daniel Plainview perfectly. His counterpart, the priest who proclaims himself to be the third revelation, a messiah figure, and a constant hinder to his aims adds the needed flavors of hate, passion and struggle to the movie.Paul Dano,who previously impressed audiences with his side role as 'silent'brother in 'Little Miss Sunshine' carries out the role to the maximum possible shades it can portray.<br/><br/>The movie is more a journey, a learning curve that seasoned movie lovers would surely appreciate. But if you are someone who catches American movies occasionally, leave this movie for future times as this movie requires deep appreciation and understanding of the various complexities that this movie seems to develop upon. Following the likes of legendary classics like 'Scarface' and 'Godfather' this movie, ranked #20 at IMDb among top 250 all-time movies, this movie is sure to be a milestone in American cinema, and would be viewed with same awe even after decades.It has all the emotions that a human life can offer - excitement, ambition, passion, fear, hate, jealously, treachery, morality and realization.And as the movie ends - Oh,yes there will be blood."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Even as a kid, I never understood why God needed so much money. Business I understood. Religion was presented as the spiritual necessity of the cleansed and righteous soul ... yet tithing of less than 10% was considered selfish. On the other hand, business was upfront about the mission of profit. To me, there was only the finest of lines between the two. PT Anderson makes my point in a far more stylish manner than I could ever hope.<br/><br/>The extraordinary lord of acting, Daniel Day-Lewis is once again bigger than life on screen ... this time as Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed oilman and hater of people. Day-Lewis is so fascinating in that he is one of the few actors that just grab your eyes and hold on while he is on screen. Here, his subtle gestures and eye movements are more than enough to hold us at attention. He has the look and feel of an oilman at the turn of the century. We also know for certain that he is a tortured soul.<br/><br/>Mr. Plainview's nemesis is not just the dirt he drills in, but also the young prophet, Eli Sunday, played to spooky perfection by Paul Dano (so wonderful as the son/brother in ""Little Miss Sunshine""). In their few scenes together, it is like watching two expert fighters with opposite style go at each other. Plainview's prop is his cute, young son (played well by Dillon Freasier) and Eli's prop is the cross around his neck. Just a guilty pleasure watching these two spar.<br/><br/>Based on Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"", director PT Anderson (the underrated ""Magnolia"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"" and the overrated ""Boogie Nights"") provides a film that on the surface appears quiet, while ... like the oil ... just under the surface is simmering with emotion and action. The majestic performance of Day-Lewis brings it all together, but Anderson must receive credit for some stunning shots and tension filled scenes.<br/><br/>The film has a very unusual look and feel so to compliment it, we are given a score from Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead fame). The guitar is haunting and, at times startling. What prevents this one from pure greatness is the over-the-top final sequences between Plainview and Eli. If that scene had been handled differently, the last scene with Plainview and his son would have been even more powerful."

","Once in a very rare while (all too rarely, alas) I leave a film instantly convinced that I just experienced an enduring classic in real time, and that's how I felt after watching ""There Will Be Blood."" It is an amazing film with a performance at its center that defies description, and I haven't been as energized or excited over a new release since last year's ""Children of Men."" I've always liked Paul Thomas Anderson, even at his most over indulgent (""Magnolia""), but he's never seemed as mature a filmmaker as he does here. Where other Anderson films have sustained one long fevered pitch and burnt themselves out in exhaustion, this film is restrained and disciplined; it builds slowly and inexorably to a powerhouse conclusion. Like nearly every Anderson film, it's a love it or hate it movie. It's virtually impossible to have an indifferent reaction to it. And I imagine the ending will be one of the most divisive aspects of the film. I, for one, thought it ended perfectly, and suspect it will be a long time before I get the film's final image and line out of my head.<br/><br/>No review of this film is complete without mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis, who is nothing less than a force of nature at its center. His performance is so good it's scary; what he does in this film can't even be called acting. I've seen other performances this year that I greatly admired: Tommy Lee Jones in ""In the Valley of Elah,"" Ryan Gosling in ""Lars and the Real Girl,"" Viggo Mortensen in ""Eastern Promises."" But Day-Lewis seems to be working in a completely different stratosphere than these others. In Daniel Plainview, the oilman who's eaten from within by greed and a lust for power, he has created a villain that's one-dimensional yet extremely complex all at the same time. Plainview should be a boring character, because he's so single minded in purpose, yet Day-Lewis makes him endlessly fascinating. And was I the only person who actually liked him a little bit? In a world full of hypocrisy and men telling one another what they want to hear the better to take advantage, Plainview is refreshingly honest and straightforward, no matter how abominable he may be. He's like the American system of free enterprise taken to its monstrous extreme.<br/><br/>Though set in the past, the film is one of the most relevant I've seen this year. The battle over economic and religious domination is obviously one that rages today. Religious and corporate institutions differ only in their methods -- both are driven by a lust for power and control.<br/><br/>And to top it all off, Johnny Greenwood provides one of the most unique and sensational scores to grace a movie screen in a long time.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"jdesando","Null","6","18","14 December 2007"," In 2007 I have one certainty . . .
","""I hate most people. I want to earn enough money so I can get away from everyone."" Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) in There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>In 2007 I have one certainty: No one, but no one, can out act Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, plays a sociopath of such charisma that he evokes the ambivalence most audiences feel about Charles Foster Kane. From silver mining in 1898 to oil riches in the first quarter of the next century, Daniel tirelessly amasses fortune and loses loved ones, predictable for someone who sees people, even his own son, as a means to money, nothing else (see above quote).<br/><br/>Director Paul Thomas Andersen's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's Oil is too long by at least a half hour, during which even the estimable Day-Lewis gets old. But it is a biography of a great entrepreneur, as much an emblem of the wildly speculative country as it is of the independent, albeit ruthless, spirit of so many of America's self-made men of the early 20th century. In a way, I suppose, There Will Be Blood owes much of its spirit to Citizen Kane in its meticulous depiction of the rise and fall of a great man as well as shots of the lonely man in his castle later on in life.<br/><br/>And speaking of the film's shameless borrowing from movies, observe the uncanny imitation Day-Lewis does of John Huston's Noah Cross, from his peculiar voice to his careless treatment of those closest to him. Day-Lewis remains unique in his depiction of Plainview, yet his channeling of Huston is a joyful evocation of another artist and a remarkable film, Chinatown. Add to that allusion the similarity to father Walter Huston and the Treasure of the Sierra Madre and you can see how Andersen is an auteur to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>In a year when this film will be contending with No Country for Old Men for best picture, it is interesting to note that both were shot in Marfa, Texas, where Giant was also filmed. The connection among them, the lust for wealth through oil or drugs, underscores how both commodities have served well dramatists' need to show the wages of sin (there is a strong fundamentalist sub theme in Andersen's film), for which there will be blood."

","This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And the fact that this is portrayed as art is a sad testimony of what our society has become. There is absolutely nothing redeemable in this movie. Not the story, not the script, not the sound. and certainly not the characterization. The casting is also terrible. Paul Dano is completely miscast as a charismatic preacher. He comes off as weird and strange, not someone people would pay attention to and follow. And the portrayal of ignorant and backward religion is a complete cliche.
Who wants to watch a movie portraying completely degenerate characters. There is certainly nothing original in this movie. I kept waiting for something meaningful and significant to happen, to advance the story and characterization, but it never does. And the ending left me with the feeling of complete and utter disgust. Not interesting. Not thought provoking. Just utter disgust. I wasted valuable time watching this trash and after it was over, I felt like taking a shower to wash the filth of this movie off."

"newsview","2","3","7","17 August 2013"," There Will Be Blood: Is there Great Talent in Depicting Human Depravity?
","""There Will Be Blood"" offers the viewer a first-rate location, set, costuming, acting and cinematography but that's where the pleasure of this film ends. The soundtrack is repetitive in parts, at other times disjointed and distracting. What is supposed to be frenetic and suspense-building musical accompaniment is annoying, sounding as if it would better fit a scene set in the African bush — not the American West.<br/><br/>H.W., portrayed as Daniel Plainview's son, is too much the ""little man"" to be a believable character for his age — largely mute even before he suffers his accident. The majority of the film follows Plainview and H.W., who appear to remain the same age, only to jump abruptly into the future in which H.W. is a man. It feels as if the film editors suddenly realize they need cut an hour out of the film to make it ""feature length"", which leaves the viewer with a few sketchy transitional scenes over a smooth narrative segue.<br/><br/>Essentially the lead character is a greedy but lucky drunk. Writing human depravity is not among the greater literary talents — it's harder to make a character beloved than hated. Films and books that evoke the worst of human nature are a dime a dozen because it's easy to be gritty, cynical and dark. Try pulling off a convincing and compelling storyline that isn't cheesy and transparently sentimental — that's the greater challenge in screen writing, one that Hollywood attempts far too little these days.<br/><br/>In spite of critics' high praises, there is little to ""There Will Be Blood"" that doesn't drive home the same point in repetitive circles. Eli Sunday starts out as a mild-mannered kid who quickly becomes an over-played caricature of a country preacher and Plainview is a wretched soul who seeks no redemption. If the film succeeds, it succeeds in leaving one disgusted enough not to have any desire to watch it again.<br/><br/>Take a pass."

","After the first 20 minutes, I asked myself, where is this movie going? Unfortunately, I kept asking the same question for the next 2 hours -- where is this movie going? This is a portrait of a miserable man, whose only goal in life is to drill for oil and try to make as much money as possible. He never smiles. He doesn't enjoy life. He's not interested in women. He has no hobbies.<br/><br/>The story seems to violate the primary law of story-telling by featuring a character that evolves because of his experiences in life. For example, Scrooge becomes a nicer person in the end of A Christmas Carol, and Luke Skywalker becomes a man and discovers his powers in the Star Wars series. Even Darth Vader has a chance to redeem himself at the end. Here, the Daniel Day Lewis character is unchanged through the decades and we still don't know him at the end of the film.<br/><br/>As one reviewer pointed out, this is storytelling through minutiae -- we learn how people historically drilled for oil in the early days of the oil boom, and little more.<br/><br/>As another reviewer pointed out, the music is strange. My wife said it reminded her of the TV show Lost -- kind of spooky most of the time. The photography is beautiful, but there's not much of a story here. And I honestly can't tell you what the point of the movie was."

There is essentially no story.<br/><br/>The movie meanders on about the creation of an oil prospecting business and the colorless men who form it. We have Plainview, the Day-Lewis character. A focused but depraved drunkard who is a crackerjack wildcatter and businessman. There is nothing to like about Plainview, nor is he very interesting.<br/><br/>The young preacher, Eli, who apparently never ages past his teens, and is about as obnoxious as can be. A stranger who claims to be Plainview's lackluster brother turns out to be a fraud, as is the handicapped 'son', albeit a more tolerable soul.<br/><br/>The score or soundtrack seems truly inappropriate and overbearing at times, and some scenes are allowed to go on long past their relevance. The story, if it can be said to actually be a story, goes nowhere for hours, and then on to one of the most absurd endings seen in a major movie.<br/><br/>Disappointing!"
"LouE15","6","3","7","16 January 2009"," Black and cold at heart
","There are so many reviews here, it's unlikely this will get read. So I'll just talk about a few things about this film that I find interesting.<br/><br/>Great as Daniel Day Lewis' performance in this dark, soulless film certainly is, the criticisms come thick and fast now I've finally seen it, long after all the hype has died down.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder whether, in casting Day Lewis, the director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't, just slightly, come to regret his casting choice. He created, in every sense, a bit of a monster. There's just no room for any competition at all in a film with a character  and played by an actor  of this magnitude. He fills the screen, he is its black heart, his voice drowns out others, his desires, his wiles, his greed, his determination  so much so that any other actor appears literally lacking (which is very unfair to some of them). Paul Dano's character seems ineffective, insufficiently greedy and grasping. Ciaran Hinds is wastefully thrown away in a small part for which he appears to have been cast solely for his interesting face. His face is very interesting, but his voice is still more so. If it wasn't to be used, why cast him? Why didn't we get the chance to see more of what HW becomes, and (** spoiler alert **) how he defies his father? I now feel, having thought about it for a while, as though I was having another, tedious chapter in The Formation of Great America  ironically dark in tone of course, to suit our modern tastes  shoved down my throat. This chapter is noble enough to show the bad with the good. At its worst it's a dull historical lecture about greed and development cleverly disguised as art; beautiful to watch, masterfully constructed, but black and empty and as full of rhetoric as a failing politician's speeches.<br/><br/>I can't make it out: fashion will eventually pass and this film will surely be abandoned to time, and will no longer be acclaimed as the single best thing to come out of Hollywood sincePaul Thomas Anderson. I reserve my enthusiasms for more heartfelt, lowbrow stuff: the quality may be lower but the heart is at least still there, beating and feeling."

The one thing I found strange was that no lines were spoken for around 20 minutes of the beginning of the movie but the spoke a lot after that. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time and the only movie I liked more than this of the 2000s' was The Lord of The Rings trilogy and 1 or 2 other movies.

","This leisurely-paced drama recounts the life and times of a ruthless oil tycoon. There are fine performances from Day-Lewis (seemingly doing a John Huston impression) and Dano, but there is little to the plot to hold one's interest for nearly three hours. Anderson is the emperor with no clothes. As with ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia,"" he makes an overlong film out of mediocre material, believing that audiences will equate great length with great film (and apparently the masses have done just that).

","I read somewhere that in nearly every film the main character changes in a profound way and the story is about how and why that change occurs.<br/><br/>Well that doesn't happen in this film. <br/><br/>Daniel Plainview remains the same from when he prospects alone for silver to when he lives alone in the mansion paid for with the oil he has found.<br/><br/>He is unable to interact with others in any meaningful way and decides therefore to have as little to do with them as possible. What makes it sadder is that he is aware of this trait and would like it to be otherwise. Why else would he adopt a strangers child or open up his heart to someone claiming to be his long lost brother?<br/><br/>These attempts at human contact fail however and he always returns to what he is good at - business and making money and makes his most important decisions based on purely commercial grounds, for example sending his son away to deaf school.<br/><br/>However in the back of his mind he knows there is something missing in his life and starts to rely on drink to ease the pain. He shouts ""Bastard in a basket"" after his deaf son, who he knows cannot hear him. Obviously trying to convince himself that he has no love for the child. He seems to consider his son going into the same business, even at a small level as the ultimate betrayal.<br/><br/>Lewis' performance is outstanding. However I found the darkness of the story tough going."
"DAHLRUSSELL","4","3","7","26 March 2008"," Uneven, morally blank film with high production values.
","If this is your kind of film, is a film that is worth seeing in the theatre. If you remember the old film GIANT with Liz Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean, this film is similar in the huge vistas and visual scope that is so effective on the big screen. It also covers the span of twenty years or more. Like Giant, it also has some performance unevenness (but Giant was much better balanced than this). This is also the story of an oil man in late 1800s California, a real scrapper and wheeler-dealer, so it is very much one man's story.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis does his usual searing portrayal, but it is seriously marred by his vocal choice to imitate John Huston. It is very distracting, and I and many others found ourselves thinking ""whose voice is that"" throughout the film. It is such a specific voice to imitate. It's a big role, tempestuous and cranky and on the edge, and that takes it to the edge, and at least one friend found his performance ultimately too hammy. I thought it was pretty true to the character he and the director had created. But his is a bravura stage performance while everyone else is doing this modern blasé under-acting. (That is a directing problem of balancing performances.) Weaker, commercial actors in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Several actor friends and I agreed that this is definitely best picture worthy. As for Lewis, an Oscar worthy ROLE, but maybe not an Oscar worthy performance. (I JUST figured out why... his character doesn't change! We meet him fully formed and the same as the end.) An American actor doing this same performance would have been slammed by every critic  he gets an award.<br/><br/>The film is long, 2.5 hours, but it breezes by and never felt long to me. One friend thought it dragged, but she doesn't like to sit down. It actually feels as if it should have been a longer film that was cut down, because near the end, there seemed to be a few pieces missing. Perhaps it shouldn't have been cut, but, like GIANT, it needed an intermission?<br/><br/>What is great here is that while GIANT focused on the melodrama of the family and the emotional workings, this film is much grittier. With almost no dialogue in the first twenty minutes, we have a grimy, working man's view of the way these early oil men worked alone and in small teams in the holes, in the mud, in the oil. This is a working man's film, a man's film, and I recommended it to my father. There are almost no women in this film, and they are completely tangential. Pretty true to life for the 1800s. (That's Hollywood in 2007... the only significant female role is under 14 years old.)<br/><br/>The art direction and cinematography here are top level. The exacting detail of the working conditions, the lifestyle, the problems of the work, is what raises this film up as if it were a documentary of live history. It says volumes without words, and that is great film-making. This also has a really interesting score that grows and changes throughout. It incorporates ""noises"" in a musical way that is surprising but makes organic sense and I think that is part of why the film moves so well.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Upton Sinclair, and it is really surprising that this is not being made more of in the publicity. I guess they're afraid our national literacy is so low that people would just say ""upton who?"" Sinclair had a very dark world view, and it shows especially in the portrayal of religion. Unfortunately, I think the casting of the role of the young pastor is very weak. This actor doesn't seem to understand his role; no glimmer that spiritual refection and humility can come from a position of strength and passion. Again, no real growth in the portrayal of this character (and no age makeup at the end he still looks 16). This all throws the strength and focus of the film back to Lewis.<br/><br/>The middle of the story has some nice twists, and perhaps the strongest interactions. Not for everyone, it is a natural fit for the folks who liked 3:10 to Yuma, or classic westerns. If this is your kind of film, it is worth seeing on the big screen."
"siobhandenton","10","3","7","20 March 2008"," A True American Classic
","If you're looking for subtlety then you're not going to find it in P T Anderson's There Will Be Blood; from the grand scale locations to the larger than life characters, Anderson's film feels truly epic. Yet don't take this as a fault of the film, indeed it is the films epic quality that ensures its success. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil, There Will Be Blood tells the story of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis). After Plainview accidentally discovers oil (and its monetary gains), he becomes set on sourcing further oil and thus gaining more wealth. After a tip off in which Plainview is told of oil rich land in California, his greed ultimately leads to a battle of wills between Plainview and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, who also plays the small but pivotal role of Paul Sunday) the young minister of a church, culminating in the almost comic final scene of the film, as Plainview's greed ultimately consumes him. Day-Lewis deservedly won an Academy Award for his performance of a man entirely obsessed by greed, and indeed it is he on who the film rests upon. His performance is startling, utterly embodying the enigmatic character of Plainview. There is a distinct lack of character development, and whilst the audience is shown Plainview at the beginning of his ascent we never truly learn his motives and feelings. However, the lack of information that we have about the character ensures that the audience not only learns all they need to know, but they are kept at a distance from this ultimately lonely figure. In fact there is no dialogue for the first fifteen minutes of the film, in which we watch Plainview mining, working entirely by himself. The cinematography adds to the almost mystical quality of the film, reminiscent of Terence Malick's Days of Heaven, which was shot entirely during magic hour. Ultimately, this is an epic film showcasing the subversion of the American Dream, and deserves to be remembered as a true American Classic."
"EijnarAmadeus","10","3","7","19 March 2008"," Paul Thomas Anderson's gut-wrenching, raging bull with tour de force Daniel Day-Lewis
","'There Will Be Blood' appears with a atonal string note of unease, and with the first wordless 15 minutes it's the darkness of Daniel Day-Lewis, deep in a mine shaft, that creates this relentless intensity; people at the cinema were wincing, laughing and chit-chatting in the opening sequence, not managing to keep a straight face-to-face with such a gritty and greedy man. And by the time the movie's ended off you'll feel gut-punched, it's like you've been going one too many rounds in the ring - but the feeling isn't Anderson' failure of making this too long, but its exhaustion of such intensity and breathtaking cinema-making. The harsh power of the movie shows violence of the flesh and spirit of the American character - Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is the dark underside of the American success, a man with an enduring greed and brutality who looks at people and sees nothing worth liking. During his progress from being a sweaty, dirt-covered loner in the desert digging for silver to becoming a highly-regarded, successful oil tycoon of ruthlessness he rapes, pillages and murders and winds up so estranged from the normal human beings that he's forgotten that he is one on his own. Plainview encounters Eli Sunday, fantastically played by Paul Dano, a charismatic preacher who gets in immediate competitive force with Plainview. Sunday's shrieking preachment of the gospel offers an alternative offer of redemption through his powerful faith, rather than Plainview's promising of wealth - and Sunday's faith in God is unshakable, compellingly preached and with forceful power. The Clash between these two titanic egos is the heart of the film; Plainview doesn't have any sentimental side, but he has got H.W., a bastard-child who Plainview uses as an illusion of family values to buy land, fooling the owners for their ""oceans of oil"" under their feet. The connection between Day-Lewis and H.W.'s extraordinary Dillon Freasier is masterfully skillful, H.W. is the only peak hole we've got into Plainview's soul - and we don't get the answer though Plainview paints himself as a family as well as an oil man, even at the end to which Plainview sociopath-speech bristles with gruel and evil - does Plainview lack of human feelings? Or does he choose to ruthlessly deny them? And Anderson's painting of his nation's soul is dark - if Plainview and Eli Sunday represents the bigger forces of religion and capitalism and the role they've played throughout America's history, this bleak history lesson shows the behind-the-scenes and corrupted story of a land drenched in greed, violence and hypocrisy. And Anderson uses every tool at hand to drive his masterpiece-story home; the production design is breathtaking, proving that cinematography can be form of art when black smoke and an oil well sprouting with fire and flame is so visually astounding that it not only looks the movie, it speaks for it. And great photography is combined with a revolutionary soundtrack, created by Radiohead guitarist and composer Johnny Greenwood it shifts between its genius work of absence and shocking use of frightful and powerful arrangements. The harrowing climax is the finale of Plainview and Eli, the false prophet arrives to blackmail the viciousness in the greed-mansion built, you don't need to be a A-student to see that this won't become a pretty sight. A Bloody Hell will break loose. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is a landmark performance, he blows and bellows and triumphs in making us see ourselves in Plainview - no matter how much we want to look away 'cause of its discomfiting presence, its impossible to tear your eyes away from.

","Ambitiously executed There Will Be Blood is a very impressive film. The backdrop and arrangement of the film alone will evoke such films as Gone With The Wind and Citizen Kane. That may seem like a bold statement but the ambition that is on show here is driven with such force and pedigree that it seems only fitting that comparisons to those films should be made, as will be explained in due course. The film tells of man called Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), who discovers oil, refines his methods and steadily increases his wealth. One day a worker is killed and Plainview adopts his son and names him H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier), and by 1911 Daniel is one of the most successful men in California.<br/><br/>In keeping with the current Hollywood trend of echoing 1970s cinema the film has a slow burning plot and a lack of strong women. Furthermore, the lead character, Daniel Plainview is an archetypal anti-hero with a moral complexity and a classic rejection of traditional values. He is also a character with immense tenacity and an unrivalled drive for success. The first 15 minutes encapsulates all of these traits and lays down the foundations for his characters development. With no dialogue Plainview falls down a shaft and breaks his leg, but he manages to pull himself out and to the nearest town. The opening 15 minutes is monumental storytelling as without the tool of dialogue the director (Paul T Anderson) is able to establish a character with grit and determination; a strong, immovable man unwilling to let anything hinder his progress. Daniel Day Lewis's profound acting ability in There Will Be Blood, and Plainview's flaws and inability to be human, are very similar to those of another character and masterpiece of the same name, Citizen Kane, as Plainview is also a man that will stop at nothing to get everything.<br/><br/>As with the directors' previous works (Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love) the film carries a lot of religious imagery most of which are directly attributable to Christianity. In one scene a young man by the name of Paul Sunday visits Plainview to inform him of a place (his family's home) where oil seeps through the ground and that he can have the location of it for a small fee. In selling his family out to such a tyrant Paul becomes the Judas of the picture. Ultimately Plainview lies to the Sunday family about its worth and purchases the land at what can be only be regarded as pittance. In a beautifully metaphorical fashion Plainview ignores the advice of a preacher to bless his well and digs up the land, which intern results in disaster. He releases hell, flames shoot upwards, the sky turns black and his blackened demonic face emerges gleaming with excitement unable to hide his pleasure even after the near death experience of his son, H.W. Plainview. The scene is truly magnificent and had me harking back to Classical Hollywood epics (Gone With The Wind, Grapes of Wrath) the score that accompanies it is dauntless and the direction superb. It should also be noted that the sheer aesthetics of the film, from the intrepid soundtrack to the flawless cinematography, make it an immensely pleasurable experience.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I had issues with the various stereotypes the film employed. Primarily the film has strong homo-erotic undertones, that truly come to light upon the emergence of Daniel's alleged brother, Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor). During the film the two share quality time on a beach and quite clearly bond during an oil pipeline mapping expedition. Plainview is a man that exhibits the clichéd idiosyncrasies associated with homophobic tendencies. From his absent history with females, his statement at hating all men, his dislike of men and his outlandish dismay at the discovery of his Henry's betrayal. His reaction at Henrys lie confirms a sense of denial in Plainview, albeit an outrageous reaction, as he is clearly angry with himself for letting his emotions surface towards another man, thus adding prominence to his tears.<br/><br/>Further problems with the film lie with its story, it refuses to give away too much information and divulges key elements at irregular moments and weights them with too much emphasis or not enough. The scene in which Daniel and his son meet the other Sunday brother Eli (Paul Dano) for the first time is very well executed, as we the audience share with Daniel his bemusement at whether or not this is the same person he met earlier or if it's a twin. This scene is brilliant but it is left wide open and it is not really tied up, despite the fact that he attacks his father for allowing Paul to leave and divulge their location. His father is not allowed to retort, alluding to the fact that maybe Eli is suffering a character disorder; if this was the case it would be much more fitting. Additionally, at the end of the film, Daniel lies to Eli about how much he paid Paul for the information  confusing the matter further.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a film that some might believe is ostentatious, but in unravelling the films layers and various metaphors it is a true joy. It is a brilliant examination of politics, fascism, greed and religion and in doing so becomes (perhaps unwittingly) an allegory for contemporary American society and the issues surrounding big business and religion. Daniel Day Lewis is truly outstanding, perhaps the finest physical actor of our generation, his mere presence makes the film compelling, he is undoubtedly every directors dream.<br/><br/>In being concurrent with the first scene, the final reels of There Will Be Blood deliver one of the greatest performances by an actor ever committed to celluloid (the milkshake metaphor is brilliant) and one of the greatest final lines in cinema history ""I'm finished""."
"formidible-1","9","3","7","13 March 2008"," Brilliant but flawed
","I came to the screening of There Will Be Blood not knowing much about it except for Day-Lewis's reportedly searing performance. True, it's an epic both in scale and emotion. Wonderfully engaging from the start you know after a few minutes that you are in for something special. Day Lewis's performance is exhilarating as prospective oilman in turn-of-the-Century American west. I do think it's one of his finest performances (so far). The cinematography is at times breathtaking and gripping, as in the scenes of one of the oil mines going up in flames, which is brilliantly staged. The wonderfully intriguing score also serves to pull you in at just the right moments. Characterization is fine and performances by everyone concerned is not in any doubt. However what lets this film down ultimately is the screenplay. One cannot help thinking that the many themes of this film (greed, power, religion, loyalty, to name just four ), coupled with it's scope, eventually connive to render it short of a masterpiece. I left the cinema both emotionally drained but also angry that the final scenes had ultimately let it down. Until that point it was very close to being one of the finest American films I'd seen in a very long time. Day Lewis's performance is what one remembers most and it's a bittersweet experience. Instead of stepping back and allowing the scope and breath of what we had witnessed on film being given some space and general conclusion, we are instead smacked in the face by Lewis's character baring his soul by way of a frenzied and disparate attack on his adversary, both physically and verbally, in order to demonstrate his 'power' as some kind of 'king of the mountain'. Whatever ones views about this scene, and yes it does address important points, it nevertheless doesn't tidy up the story, and hence the film, sufficiently enough, and so instead of the three hour experience being a totally uplifting one, I for one left the cinema with a bitter taste in my mouth which took ages to shake off. If writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson intended as much, then he certainly succeeded."
"MyGuitarGentlyWeeps","10","3","7","9 March 2008"," One of the year's best films!
","I absolutely loved this film! There Will Be Blood is a story of the rise to power of a family man that gains control of many oil fields across the nation. Once he gains his power, greed takes and changes him from a loving father to a greedy killer. All of this is supported by a wonderful screenplay, great cinematography, phenomenal acting with Daniel Day-Lewis giving, hands down, the year's best performance and one of my favorite performances of all time, and with Paul Dano who does a superb job playing Paul Sunday, who, in the movie, is the pastor of the third revelation church whose life is also effected by greed. The perfect directing and the perfect music topped this movie off and made it one of the year's best films!"

"sinncross","10","3","7","9 March 2008"," Blood like oil...
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a silver prospector, unintentionally discovers that one of his silver claims is a host to unearthed oil. With this, he starts up a small drilling company and in a few years, becomes an efficient and successful oil extractor. He is approached by a young man, who offers to give Daniel information about a vast supply of oil on his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel, with his son H.W (Dillon Freasier) decides to survey the land and discovers not only a rich oil supply, but also a community obsessed with the preachings of faith healer, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a very relaxed adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair, and becomes more inspired by its source material than anything else. Yet the story is unique in its own way and works for the cinematographic medium. The immediate quarter hour which begins the story, while not exactly artistic in any manner, serves to set the tone for the remainder of the film perfectly. The film is ominous and tense throughout, spilling over from aptly suited scenes, to those that don't fall into the social convention of gloom, and this becomes one of the film's major strengths. The film has an unhurried pace, which is partly due to the story's ability to seemingly feel like it is going nowhere. Yet this creates a sense that the advancement of the story unfolds naturally, and it not constructed in a linear fashion, and continues even into the ending which is rather intangible, unexpected, and simply brilliant. In fact, by the time the credits begin there is a chance that you might need to recollect everything that has occurred, not because it's a confusing film, but because everything is not as it appears in what is arguably a straightforward story.<br/><br/>However the sheer emotional impact of the story cannot be felt in full force without the actors: Daniel Day Lewis is once again phenomenal as he leads a rather strong, albeit small cast. Lewis is menacing as the greedy Plainview, being able to express cruel anger, loving affection and best yet, the rare sarcastic remarks his character does provide, is done with lifelike aptitude. His counterpart, Dano, is spot-on with his performance as the creepy Eli, whose innocent demeanor is always questionable. The young Freasier should be noted as well; his presence is important and while his acting is not of a great standard, he is never terrible enough to judge accordingly. Another aspect that makes the acting one level better is the nonverbal cues each character exudes. All three cast members become more believable and the emotional aspect of the film really does prove overwhelming, especially in the later scenes. Considering the heavy emphasis on Daniel Plainview, and how well the main actors perform, the minor characters come and go without much notice and are not able to be of much impact. <br/><br/>On a cinematographic scale, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, outdoes himself. Every scene is calculated, and in doing so, every scene feels just as important as the rest, and this really allows the film to grow. Anderson uses a variety of techniques to keep viewing fresh, with one favorite being a one-shot pan focus on Daniel as he runs towards a flame induced oil deposit, helping the rest of his crew to cut the ropes that keep the structure secure. The many scenes help emphasize the themes with an array of symbols that helps keep the film intriguing and never superficial. This carries over to the script as well which is realistic, flowing and, at times, quite clever.<br/><br/>The musical score's composition was headed by Radiohead lead guitarist Johnny Greenwood, and comes across as an oddity within the film. The general feel of the music doesn't seem to fit in with the film, sounding a little lighthearted at times when it maybe shouldn't. But in regards to the film general atmosphere, the music really does come alive, propelling the exact ambiguity shared by the characters and story. <br/><br/>Considering the title, there is very little blood in the film, with the violence limited to a couple of mining accidents and an unexpected beating. Language is as well minimal, until an onslaught of verbal abuse in one scene; sex and nudity are nowhere to be found. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is, in short, masterly conceived. Be it the story, acting, music, cinematography, or multi-layered depth of the film in general, every department excels to the point where the film is virtually flawless. It does, however, suffer a little from the lesser casts presence, and the selection of music feels, on the rare occasion, inappropriate. Nonetheless these two elements do not spoil what is easily not only one of the best films ever created, but one of the rare few that will never be forgotten."

","I have read many reviews of 'There Will Be Blood'on the IMDb pages.Many have called the film one big bore while several have said that Daniel Day-Lewis overacts.I think that these people are wrong in a very big way as this is a film that will stand the test of time with a performance by Day-Lewis that will rank amongst the very best in years to come.<br/><br/>This is a long movie at around two and a half hours but it never seemed to drag at all.It can be argued that it is a story about greed versus the church,but I thought it was more of a character study of one man and his dreams,passion and drive.The direction by Paul Thomas Anderson is excellent throughout and he gets the best out of all of his actors.A special word must be said about the cinematography which is superb.As mentioned,the acting is pretty much first rate and Paul Dano does a fine job as Eli Sunday although at times he does seem a little young for the role.The story is very well paced and although not exactly action packed it is never boring despite what so many people say.I wasn't too sure about the soundtrack at times but gradually it did win me over and suited the mood of the movie.Now we come to the lead role and it may take me some time to write about this so please bear with me.I'll start a new paragraph as it is a performance that needs a section all of it's own.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing short of sensational here and it is the finest performance I have seen for years.He absolutely becomes Daniel Plainview to such an extent that you forget that your are watching an actor and feel that you are watching a real character.It truly is a fantastic performance and well worth the Oscar that he won.I know that a few reviewers have called his performance theatrical and over the top especially towards the end of the movie but believe me they are completely wrong.It is acting of the very highest order and Day-Lewis convinces in absolutely every scene that he is in.Towards the end of the movie we see a man who has aged and become very bitter with strong hints that he is verging on the brink of insanity.It is played beautifully.The character of Daniel Plainview is a complex one as at times he is tender,arrogant,frightening and desperate.Make no mistake here,Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance of such raw power that this role will be talked about in years to come as one of the very best in cinema,it is that good.Just watch the scene where he kneels for forgiveness in church and see him wince due to the pain in his leg.It is simple but brilliant.<br/><br/>'There Will Be Blood' is a very good film and the only reason that I haven't given it a 10 is because I think a movie needs more than one viewing before you can give it a maximum mark.When I watch it again it may well hit that 10 mark.I have seen 'No Country For Old Men' and consider TWBB to be by far the better film.It deserves to be in the top 30 and in time may very well approach the top 10.Don't listen to the negativity and watch this film with admiration and for a performance that just may be one of the best ever."

","When you love cinema because of what it is you enjoy movies in aspects not everyone will agree and There Will be Blood is such a fine example of it. A Masterpiece should I say that penetrates in the deep field of human emotion and brings to life characters of such dark feelings and perverse ways that you will feel like evil is getting in you veins and will make you want to take you eyes out of the screen but at the same time will nail you to you seat and never let go. Mr. Lewis is just great his takes this part and makes it his own is like he will have to go to shrink to become him again I have seen a lot of great acting but this is something else. P.T. Anderson on his hand delivers another great film and amazing cinematography along whit a soundtrack makes this one an instant classic a movie that will be talked about over the ages. It is amazing how you can put on a screen a mixture of emotions and feeling this only can be done by all the superb acting, Lewis, Dano etc.. and a Director like Anderson.<br/><br/>At the end of the film I was speechless, powerless, devastated, angry, I guess I was reflecting all the emotions i just ingested thru this one now I have to let it out."
"bababear","10","3","7","1 March 2008"," Tremendous
","I can't think of another movie I've seen in several years that had me in its grip so completely from beginning to end. We've heard about what great work Daniel Day Lewis does. He well deserves the Oscar. But when will there be an Oscar for casting? Every single person in every single scene with him rises to the occasion and matches Lewis pitch perfect note for pitch perfect note. Unlike historical dramas from other decades, the crowd scenes look as if Anderson took his camera back a hundred years. Someone coming upon stills from the film would think that they were just crowd photographs from the early 1900's.<br/><br/>The one thing I found very peculiar is that this is rated R. Huh? I'm a Southern Baptist who regularly votes Republican. But if I'd come upon this film cold without knowing the rating I'd have guessed G or maybe PG because there's the mildest of profanity (damn is used a few times), no sex, no nudity, and the violence is appropriately handled for the situation and very restrained. That this should have the same rating as HOSTEL or THE HILLS HAVE EYES is worse than ridiculous."

","At first I was a little disappointed, I came out of the theater after what felt like forever and I couldn't really make out what I had seen. The performances are as good as you are likely to see anywhere, visually it's stunning with moments of beauty(the fire), but for me the music is really what carried this movie, which opens sounding like ""2001"" and ends sounding like ""Clockwork Orange"", Kubrik seems like a driving influence here, and for the most part it works seamlessly and really propells the film through some of it's slower moments. However, he story does takes a bit too long to unfold, there could have been a cut or two here and there, but nothing major. That being said, it's one of those movies which I couldn't grasp the first time around, (""Babel was another of these, which I love now), but whose scenes end up playing themselves out over and over days later. It's a less technical and less sentimental Citizen Cane, which though technically set before that film, is much more topical, showing oil, ambition, and fundamentalist Christianity at a unique juncture in history that ends up, if not mirroring our own modern time, than definitely refracting it. Better than No Country For Old Men, in verisimilitude of performances, it's ability to mix humor and repulsion, and it's construction, which is less formulaic than No Country, and more satisfying. So yeah it's worthy of it's hype, if only for it's last ten minutes, which contain one of those instant ""classic"" scenes that comes around rarely. ""I drink YOUR MILKSHAKE! I drink it up!"""

The camera is not just there to capture the moment.<br/><br/>This diatribe is worse than the film and I think I know why. There were so many things that concerned me that I would almost have to sit a watch it again. Nooo Noooo.<br/><br/>Once you realize his method of dealing with issues(and it starts probably with the preacher and blessing the rig) then the movies just has to play itself out. There are no winners in this movie, just losers. Think about how he made sure every single person that made him the least bit angry got paid back in spades. Everyone that comes in contact with the lead character will lose apart of themselves by the end of the movie. I took it as a metaphor when he threatened to kill the man in his bedroom. The dining room was not his bedroom but it was in a way part of this oil mans ""home"" where Lewis makes him admit that he was wrong about the son. This is done in front of all the other bigwigs. Struck me as a type of throat cutting.<br/><br/>Even some folks who have written comments about this being the best movie ever have lost some perspective on what is really good and bad."
"DICK STEEL","8","3","7","16 February 2008"," A Nutshell Review: There Will Be Blood
","Money is the root of all evil. It's needed to fuel the economy, and it's needed to further various gains, be it personal, political, and even religious to a certain extent. Too much money and people will see green, wanting to know the secret formula to creating and hoarding wealth, because of the various forms of satisfying utility that comes with the spending of money. And precious commodity like oil which is in high demand, automatically equates to wads of cold hard cash.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Paul Thomas Andersen, There Will Be Blood brings us to the early 20th century, where it chronicles the exploits of a certain Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day- Lewis), who discovers oil deposits during silver mining, and hedges a bet on the right horse. Calling himself an oil man, he designs his persona as being a humble family man, with his adopted child H.W., so as to lower his level of threat as he goes around acquiring land which has the prospect on sitting upon oceans of oil buried deep down. It's a very shrewd move, and a card that he plays to perfection, hiding a cruel mean streak that he possesses deep within.<br/><br/>A teenager approaches him one day with leads that his family and the entire neighbourhood of simple rural folk, are sitting atop a potential gold mine. Without further ado, Daniel and son qualifies this lead, and hurriedly entice the folks to sell their estate to him. And here's where the compelling argument for the proposal take place, where even you'll be hard pressed not to agree with, of the boost in the local economy that the oil money will bring - better infrastructure, better crops for food, educational opportunities, jobs all round, and the likes. But Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) plays the hard game with Daniel, and requests for a church to be built for him, to further his ambition of being the defacto faith healer in the community.<br/><br/>And of course, such deal breakers are never in the good books of shrewd businessmen like Daniel, and the two of them set down the path of adversity, with the playing of games with each other, obvious snubbing, and total disgust. We see how the upper hand swings and shifts from one character to the other in their struggle for power over the community - one through the economy, the other through religion. And it is this battle which made me get interested and sit up.<br/><br/>There are some very acute observations about the abuse of religion in this movie, and the exploitation of it for ulterior motives, gains, and self-preservation, cannot be highlighted in terms more stark than those here. For money, one can sell the soul to the devil, or turn religious should support be able to be garnered from the support group. For money or power over the masses, false prophets inch their way to top positions so as to have absolute command and control over their followers. To save one's skin, one can deny their Lord whom they exalt in the loudest voice day in day out, although this is no big deal for false prophets since their faith is placed on the moolah instead.<br/><br/>I will count my chicken before it hatches, and say Daniel Day-Lewis will win that Best Actor Oscar this year, without a doubt. He will be robbed of that accolade should he not win it, as it was a really fascinating transformation to his character, and I still admire how Day-Lewis the person fades away into the character he portrays. His oil man is nothing but a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to fulfill his goals. His deep resonating voice is strangely hypnotic, and he presents a character that you will so love to hate, and probably be fearful of, along the way. Relative newcomer Paul Dano holds his own against the acclaimed veteran, and his Eli character exudes a sense of seediness that you can't help but cheer when he gets his just desserts. With the both of them having a chance to have a go at each other, I thought Dano really took up the opportunity to let it rip.<br/><br/>It's a pretty long movie, sad to say you can feel its length. It unveils itself very slowly, and the first 20 minutes are pretty much devoid of any speaking parts, as you follow the designing and building of land based oil rigs, as well as the process to bring out the black gold. But there are some brilliant scenes in the movie which are worth their weight in gold, coupled with the beautiful cinematography and art direction, transporting you back to the turn of the century. The last third of the movie seemed to pick up the pace but felt somewhat rushed, but the superb acting and ending more than make up for the shortcomings along the way."
"DukeEman","9","3","7","7 February 2008"," Lewis the legend.
","I watched this film with a friend who wondered what all the fuss was about, as well as what the hell this movie was trying to say. I couldn't help him because I was a little overwhelmed by what I just sat through and it took me a few days to put it all together and work out why. When a movie has that affect on you, then you know it achieved it's goal.<br/><br/>A movie with the main character as a greedy, power hungry human is pure box office poison. The protagonist has to have some empathy for the audience to share the journey with. But the character, Daniel Plainview (love the name), had none of those elements that were so obvious. For this film you had to look deep for those qualities in the protagonist, and when you did come across them in certain scenes, you wondered why you even bother caring for such a character. Then it dawned on me, I fell into the same trap when I watched Raging Bull. No matter how repulsive or brutal the main character was, they were fascinating, and this is all because of the performances. Daniel Day Lewis saved this film from a certain death.<br/><br/>What also saved it is the direction of Paul Thomas Anderson. I admired all his movies and still do after watching this. He was brave enough to contain his scenes within minimal shots and cuts. Some scenes played within the one shot. This enabled the viewer to concentrate on the amazing performances and not to be distracted by the editing process which can sometimes hide the flaws within a screenplay.<br/><br/>There was also plenty of references to today's political climate. I'm sure there is one there about the oil companies and religion working together to benefit each other. Maybe Daniel represents the oil companies who use religion to get what he wants and visa-versa, There is also the relationship with his son, someone he has brought up and educated about the workings of his business. Is this the same relationship as the USA had with Iraq until the powerful nation thought that the little guy got a bit too big for his boots so they booted him out. And how about when Daniel's so-called-brother shows up. Who does this long lost brother represent? Is it Afghanistan? The same ones that the USA had helped to fight the Russians? Maybe I'm getting a little carried away here, but I'm sure there are plenty of little connections and references we can make between today's current political turmoil and what the movie has to offer us.<br/><br/>Most of all, see this movie for it's breathtaking cinematography, the haunting music, the perfect production design, the brave direction and most of all, the performances of a lifetime from the modern acting master Â– Mr. Lewis."
"jaddison383","7","3","7","6 February 2008"," A Very Well-Made Film, but No Best Picture
","I don't quite understand why There Will be Blood is being given praise such as 'the greatest film ever' and 'best picture of the year'. This is certainly not the film I saw.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's epic tale of greed, pride, and selfishness is indeed a masterpiece in terms of technical achievement. While giving respect to classic film-making, Anderson's film feels very new. Large credit for this has to go to the groundbreaking original score by Johnny Greenwood of Radiohead. His score is unlike any orchestral composition you've ever heard, very eerie and almost tense. I know that one of the people I saw it with said they hated the score. I thought it served its purpose quite well. Besides that, the directing really is very well-done with eye-catching cinematography, great costumes, and good writing.<br/><br/>But let's get down to the real thing: Daniel Day-Lewis. There is no denying that his performance as oilman Daniel Plainview in this film is truly the best of the year, really of many years. He creates a character that is truly heartbreaking and disgusting in his utter disregard for anything but his own success. Even when he can feel the disappointment in himself, he can't bring himself to change his ways. He still serves only himself and can't stand to see anyone else succeed. Paul Dano also serves up a brave and somewhat disturbing performance of his own as the hellfire preacher who opposes Daniel.<br/><br/>The film however is far from perfect. Several subplots are hard to follow and one in particular is very confusing. I still can't quite make sense of it. Obviously some kind of symbolism was meant, but it didn't come through. And the film is very long, too long in fact. The first fifteen minutes are pure silence, a unique beginning that got old fast. While the story of Daniel is truly heartbreaking and intriguing to watch, many of the story lines are drawn out far too long. Some have called this ""character development""- I call it slow moving. It's high-time for the end when it gets there.<br/><br/>At heart, There Will be Blood is a character sketch of a really despicable man. The story is certainly worth watching, however unfortunately drawn out. Don't go in expecting a light and stimulating time at the movies- you won't get it. This film's a real downer, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But perhaps with this film you're just down too long. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","So many reviews, so little time. I read many of the reviews here, and there are many dumb comments such as nihilism. I love nihilistic films. I don't have a problem with them. I don't find them shocking or surprising. ""There Will Be Blood"" is being categorized as nihilistic, but how can that be? What was the movie about? Really, what was the story driving at? Were we supposed to think that Plainview was justified, mentally ill or scum? He worked hard to get what he wanted and was extremely competitive, but isn't that TRULY American? Is that the American WAY? What about Eli's character? Were we supposed to think religion is a hoax and that if you are religious you get what you deserve? Are any of these characters likable? What are you supposed to think and feel when the film is over? I think it's a cop-out for Anderson to leave it up to you to decide. Why make a movie if you don't have a clear vision or something you want to say? I agree with all other reviewers who noted the slow pace, long scenes, irritating/incongruent soundtrack noise and underdevelopment of characters and plot. It makes me want to read Upton Sinclair's book ""Oil!"" to see if the book is equally as bad. I liked ""The Jungle"" and find it hard to believe that ""Oil!"" is bad, but the book isn't on a long list of classic literature, so maybe the story was doomed from the start.<br/><br/>I disagree with the reviewers who felt Daniel Day-Lewis over-acted. I felt he embodied the character but both the script and Paul Thomas Anderson were not able to give his character a direction. Paul Dano, who I've seen in several films, has yet to prove himself as a strong actor. I agree that he seemed weak in this film and even stilted, but I see that he only had a week to prepare for the role which was a shame for him.<br/><br/>I don't care what anyone says, Paul Thomas Anderson's best works remain ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"". He does not surpass them with ""There Will Be Blood"". I can only estimate the high praise for ""There Will Be Blood"" is due to a poor year in film. 2007 had to be one of the worst years yet for film. I invite debate from fellow IMDb reviewers to argue what films were so great? I'm an avid film buff and there were far too few great films in 2007. ""Atonement""? Crap. ""Juno""? Garbage. ""There Will Be Blood""? Boring. ""Michael Clayton""? Okay. So maybe only ""No Country For Old Men"" should be in the best picture category.<br/><br/>I like Paul Thomas Anderson the way I like Stanley Kubrick--both directors have made amazing films, and both have made absolute junk--need I mention 1975's ""Barry Lyndon""?? Then again, I hope Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't become Robert Altman where his career is filled with a ton of average arty films punctuated by a handful of great films. Or maybe William Friedkin who blew his wad with ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" and hasn't even come close since. Or maybe Francis Ford Coppola who only managed ""The Godfather"", ""The Conversation"", ""The Godfather II"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" before withering away.<br/><br/>Some recent nihilistic films that worked extremely well for me in terms of plot and character development were ""Seven"", ""Heat"", ""American History X"", ""American Psycho"", ""The Departed"", ""The Prestige"", ""American Beauty"", ""The Road To Perdition"", and yes, even ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"". ""The Hours"" and what the heck, I'll even add ""High Tension"" and ""Wolf Creek"" for good nihilistic measure.<br/><br/>Next time, Anderson, next time we better get a more original story in which we can get into the characters, no matter how nihilistic or depraved."
"cultfilmfan","10","3","7","2 February 2008"," There Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood is based upon the novel Oil by author Upton Sinclair. The film takes place in the late 1800's and moves into the 1900's and is about a silver prospector named Daniel Plainview who discovers oil which leads him to great riches and gives him power when he starts his own oil drilling companies. Daniel is approached by a young man who takes him to his family's property and land where Daniel soon discovers that it has tons of oil under the ground, so he sets up a place to live and starts drilling for more profits. During the film we are also shown the relationship between Daniel and his young son H.W. and how the profits he is making soon start to turn him from an honest hard working man into someone that is soon unrecognizable and the film shows his descent into this character and how he his changed because of this. There Will Be Blood is more of a look at the character of Daniel and what makes him who he is and why he does what he does and he is brilliantly played by actor Daniel Day-Lewis and is written so perfectly that we really get an in depth look at the character and what is going on in his mind. The film's story is mostly a look at Daniel and the different people he interacts with, but mostly it is a look at him and the story is told in an epic way because of the dynamic presence and portrayal by Daniel Day-Lewis and the strong writing of Daniel's personality and dialogue. The film is also one of the best looking films I have seen in quite awhile with gorgeous cinematography and great sets, costumes and a wonderful musical score as well. In many ways There Will Be Blood is an epic film because it is a period piece movie and it is a little longer with it's running time, but in that time, so much stuff is going on and no scene feels wasted, or unnecessary because every moment we spend with Daniel drives us deeper and deeper into his character and because he is such a fascinating character from start to finish that he really makes the film a compelling watch and because he is such a layered character with so much going on in his mind that he becomes completely human and his descent into greed and power and perhaps even loneliness and remorse is all the more interesting because of the great script and acting performance that really propels this character onto the screen. The film didn't drag much with it's longer running time and there was so much to appreciate here with the gorgeous look and feel of the film to it's thought provoking and involving story and performances that really make this film a unique and all too hauntingly real portrayal of this sort of situation where one is driven by man made evils. One of the best looking films I have ever seen and one of the best character films as well. There Will Be Blood stands out because of it's excellent work in front of and behind the camera and makes for a truly compelling and interesting watch and is even more so because it is really unlike any film I have seen before and I mean that in the best way possible. One of last year's best achievements and best films."

","As a film connoisseur i enjoy films ranging from emotionally challenging to something you don't have to think about. Now I saw There will be Blood Twice, because i felt i missed certain things the first go around. I was correct, some of the shots are the most visually pleasing in years. The acting which is of the highest caliber, the highest,is also smart and engaging. What Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to show us here is that everyone is fundamentally a bastard and even his bible references were as amazing as they have ever been, Eli's father being named Able and the way it's played out is reminiscent of Cane and Abel from the bible, and having the number 612 on almost every train, which is a psalm in the bible about a wolf in sheep's clothing. The direction in this movie is near flawless, and the soundtrack done wonderfully by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is flawless. If people want to say Paul Thomas Anderson is a hack let them, but he's made a career out of great film, he's on the level of Scorsese and Wes Anderson and far surpasses Altman because i know people love Altman over Anderson. The fact is the man made the best movie of the year, and it's arguably the best movie of this decade so far, and before you judge it read the book, READ THE BOOK."

","I'm a fan of Daniel Day Lewis, and he did a good job acting. Unfortunately, there was no coherent plot or story. Any allegations of greed vs. religion are wholly false. The religious content represents Upton Sinclair's atheist perspective while the greed speaks to his Socialist/communist bent.<br/><br/>The score was abysmal, consisting of some the most annoying ""noise"" that absolutely overpowered the movie and was wholly distracting. I have never witnessed such a horrible, intrusive score. It wasn't simply grating, it was nearly insufferable. I muted the sound more than once to try and escape it.<br/><br/>I wish I had done more homework prior to watching or I wouldn't have bothered.

I can't say I fell asleep or didn't enjoy it but neither am I available for dancing in the street, to paraphrase Sandy Woollcott. It was well made, indubitably and well acted but it is just a movie, Ingrid.

Exhibit B: There is no character arc.<br/><br/>As brilliant and/or original as a filmmaker might be, he can't get around the need for those two things. TWBB has no story. Over the course of Plainview's life, a bunch of stuff happens. That's the best synopsis I could give you.<br/><br/>Also, people claim that this is a character study. Really?? How can a character study be interesting when the main character is completely stoical and one-dimensional? We never see any different sides of him. He's a callous, greedy young man at the beginning of the film, and a callous, greedy old man at the end. Wow, that's really fascinating, isn't it?<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor, but I disagree that this is a great performance, because it demands so little of him.

"charlesb-3","1","4","11","5 March 2010"," Bad film, worse acting
","First. Daniel Day-Lewis is a ham of the first order. This man has about as much acting ability as my goldfish. Many years ago, an English journalist called Michael Green wrote a great comedy series which included 'The Art of Coarse Acting', which described the ludicrously inept activities of amateur actors in local companies who mostly acted in church halls or tents. On the basis of this bit of grimacing and wholly unconvincing twaddle. Day-Lewis would be lucky to get the part of Fifth Attendant Lord in Henry VI Part III in the Acton Player. From a reasonable start in 'Last of the Mohicans', he has had a Tarantino like vertical descent from good to garbage. Someone should explain that gurning and mugging are not actually acting. Goggling at the camera and talking in an accent no human has ever had do not constitute 'great acting'. Great acting is what goes on at the National Theatre on London's South Bank when Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren or Derek Jacobi turn up. It's what goes on frequently at other London theatres or Stratford when Vanessa Redgrave, Tamsin Greig, Julian Bleach and dozens of others go on stage. Second, this film is so ludicrously full of itself that it is an almost Ibsenesque parody. It opens up with a long, dull, 'who cares' sequence when no-one speaks. You are totally certain that something untoward is about to happen that you simply speculate as to what it is, and then laugh when you get it right. Instead of building tension, developing a feeling of otherworldliness, it simple draws attention to the fact that the useless director is trying very hard (and very unsuccessfully) to 'make a point'. Unfortunately, no-one cares what the point might be, the device is as unconvincing as a Henry VIII codpiece and deservedly draws as much despising humour. After about 40 minutes of this drivel, I gave up and wrote this. The DVD cost me GBP3. That was about GBP5 too much."

Where is Sinclair's righteous indictment if the oil barons? Where is his loathing of Standard and Union Oil? Where is his detest of the Big Railroads and of the Southern Pacific in particular? It is clear that Anderson either didn't read or misunderstood one of Upton Sinclair's masterworks or simply wanted to create some sort of amoral morality tale and eviscerated a great work of literature to do it. If you really want to know about the greed, recklessness and amorality of the early oil industry forget this film and go read the book."

"thebirdman0914","10","4","11","20 February 2008"," A Timeless Classic
","Loosely adapted from the Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, Paul Thomas Anderson's epic, There Will Be Blood, is a vast and powerful masterpiece. There Will Be Blood tells the story of Daniel Plainview, a terrifying and magnificent Daniel Day-Lewis, an early 1900's oil prospector trying to strike it rich during California's oil boom. While attempting to extract an ocean of oil from underneath Little Boston, a small California town, Plainview is forced to deal with many complications.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is the story of two tormented men. On one side, there is Daniel Plainview, a heartless and greedy mongrel. He hates most people and is driven only by his quest for money. He is the perfect salesman and knows exactly what to say to make people do what he wants. Plainview is the ultimate embodiment of pure capitalism and, quite frankly, the man is terrifying and could very well be Anderson's idea of Satan on Earth. Yet, with all his faults, Plainview is a man we cannot take our eyes off of, we feel sympathy for him. On the other side is Eli Sunday, an eager young preacher who feels the call to serve the people of Little Boston. Although seemingly earnest to the people of Little Boston, Plainview sees right through Eli's veil and what he discovers is a man not unlike himself. The resulting mix creates an in-depth character study displaying the results of what happens when ambition meets faith. <br/><br/>Five years in the making, There Will Be Blood is the movie by which Paul Thomas Anderson's already stellar career will be defined. After his earlier films, Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson became known as a breath of fresh air in the Hollywood community. Although all of his films were critically successful, none of them were able to achieve an elite level of commercial achievement. Detractors of Anderson's work felt the auteur was too much flash and not enough substance, creating films that, at their cores, were simple and trite. There Will Be Blood marks a departure from Anderson's previous style and shows a marked maturing of the artist. He no longer relies on tricky camera-work to be the star of his show, instead using relatively simple shots to make ""less is more"" never seem truer. Anderson uses the sprawling wasteland of Marfa, Texas to symbolize the emptiness and loneliness Plainview feels and to show the land of America's infancy. The cinematography in the film is breathtaking, as I found myself wide-eyed and open-mouthed on more than one occasion. As if those elements weren't enough, the music in the film is marvelous as well. Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood's score is haunting and invigorating, perfectly matching the film step-for-step.<br/><br/>Anderson has always been considered and actor's director, inspiring his casts to some of their best work. Thus, the performances in There Will Be Blood are nothing short of spectacular. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the awe-inspiring performance of the not only his life, but the century. Appearing in every scene but one, Day-Lewis dominates the screen like a giant. He is the ultimate antihero. As one of the best actors of his generation, Day-Lewis has a reputation of being extremely picky with the films he chooses to act in, not acting in anything he does not consider worth his time. In other words, he will not be appearing in Ocean's 14 or the next Pirates of the Caribbean anytime soon. Rumor has it that Anderson was willing to cancel production of the film had Day-Lewis not agreed to star. It is obvious that Day-Lewis devoured this role and, like the acting titan he is, delivered a performance to its full potential. With 2007 being such a weak year for actors, it is almost an insult to give the Oscar to Day-Lewis; he deserves to win it against stiffer competition. Not to be forgotten, Paul Dano does his best to match talents with Day-Lewis. Although not standing out quite as much, Dano's performance is fantastic as well. He holds his own in the film, and the scenes featuring him and Day-Lewis are a sight to behold.<br/><br/>Nominated for eight Oscars, tied with No Country for Old Men as the most for any film this year, There Will Be Blood is a stunning and profound achievement in film-making. It marks the return of the true American classic. The movie will stand the test of time and forever be held with immortal films like The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Casablanca."
"hotlthr","3","4","11","15 February 2008"," Brilliant??? Chilling??? Masterpiece??? Nope none of the above
","I was (as were many others here) very disappointed after seeing THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Yes Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano give excellent performances, but the story goes nowhere, shows us nothing new or does so in a new way. As director I cannot fault Paul ANderson, however as writer he leave so much to be desired. Any movie based on Upton SInclair is bound to be a failure. He was a trite writer with a social agenda that paled in comparison with his British contemporaries. This is a story that goes nowhere. And even as a character play leaves motivations and reason in the dust of the California desert. Paul ANdersnn does little as a writer to overcome Sinclair'ss shortcomings. The film is overly long and filled with scenes that supposedly show character development or motivation that add nothing to what little plot there is.<br/><br/>In a year with so many good films TWBB does not deserve to be nominated as Best Picture."
"theaustin","6","4","11","2 February 2008"," I wanted to like this film...
","There Will Be Blood probably has to be the hardest movie I've ever reviewed. I saw it more than a week ago and yet I could not quite figure out if I liked it or not. It is a very great achievement from director Paul Thomas Anderson, but it's narrative structure just felt so weird. I felt like it was just a bunch of scenes thrown together, sparse in emotion and overly indulgent. I say overly indulgent because every so often, Anderson would thrown in some ridiculous scene that would completely take you out of the story. For example, Eli Sunday (played by Paul Dano) and Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis) are out for each other's blood. At one point, Sunday comes to ask Plainview something. Immediately, Plainview goes off on Sunday, throwing him on the ground and slapping him. He even starts to do a little ""stop hitting yourself! stop hitting yourself"" type of thing. While this scene is funny, it's completely ridiculous! It would never happen. Anderson didn't build up the feud between them enough to earn a scene like that. Before it, I had though they merely just held a civil dislike for one another. There was not enough story before it to make me think they would physically fight. There are a few more scenes similar to that one and they suffer from the same flaw. Now I've heard from a few people, mainly on movie podcasts, that P.T. Anderson does a lot of cocaine. Now while this is merely speculation, it would make sense for him to have been high when he made this. It has the potential to be such a great movie, but the writing is just everywhere. There Will Be Blood seems like a collection of scenes that don't connect to each other in any way. There's a good movie within it waiting to come out, but it never does. It's a Hollywood epic gone wrong. While I really wanted to like There Will Be Blood, I couldn't look past its obvious writing flaws. There are some great scenes wedged in between the non-existent narrative. Paul Dano and Daniel Day Lewis are good in the film, but I do feel that they both play their parts a little too over the top. Once again this may have just been Anderson's direction or script. I was greatly disappointed in this film, there is SOOO much potential, but Anderson didn't hone his great talent in the right ways to make a good film."
"dottrz","10","4","11","1 February 2008"," Agreed- A new American Classic
","I never saw ""My Own Left Foot,"" or whatever that movie was that made Daniel Day Lewis a household name, but in some of his roles since then, such as in ""Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Gangs of New York,"" and now ""There will be Blood"" he solidifies his standing among the BEST leading men, not just of our time, but of ALL time. He absorbs his roles rather than merely playing them. It's remarkable that someone else mentioned some of the classics in their review, because I told my wife that I put the movie on the same level with Citizen Kane. Just a great movie, very well acted, directed, and produced. It's even ready for TV! LOL... Day-Lewis interacts well with all the other characters; the relationship with his ""son,"" the dialog between him and Eli, even the way he seems oddly attracted to his supposed brother. All these on screen relationships flowed very well, and maintained a relevance to the story. When I saw the list of prospective nominees for Academy Awards, I watched Viggo Mortensen in ""Eastern Promises,"" and have tried without success to find ""In the Valley of Elah."" But that's no matter; if Day-Lewis does not get the nod for his performance in ""There Will be Blood,"" then there is something seriously wrong with the selection process. I can NOT believe that any other performances could hold a candle to Daniel Plainview!"
"gmastachef","4","4","11","28 January 2008"," Depends upon your taste?????????
","Well what do I say about this movie, depends upon if you watch movies to be amused by great story telling, strong plots filled with twists & turns, suspense & edgy spine tingling fear. Or if your just like artistic film & good not ""great"" acting because thats about all it has. Okay there is one good line about the milkshakes, but other than that even dialog is pretty weak. Remember one important thing though you can have great acting, but the movie can still blow its not the actors fault the story doesn't lead you anywhere.<br/><br/>Im not going to say it was awful, but Im definitely not going to buy it. As a matter of fact if you want to see Daniel Day Lewis perform well watch Gangs of New York ( Now thats more than 2 hours worth watching). DDL's performance was good at best in TWBB, but the lack of plot, development of characters that really lead nowhere and horrible ending that has no pay off just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>The only good thing for me was the artistic aspect of filming, using a lot of dark shots with slight draws of light not sure the word for it, styles used in a lot of Oliver Stones films. Great scenery not to mention a lot filmed in Texas, also I know people in the movie, yeah if you do decide to see TWBB my brother in laws girlfriend her dad is the bartender. Sights & sounds of the movie were astonishingly more pleasing than the movie itself.<br/><br/>A good screen writer will tell you a movie/film should do 3 key things 1 grab your attention 2 hold you 3 give you a pay off. TWBB grabs you, holds u about as much as a person with arthritis could and leaves you asking yourself what, I get it but thats all? So the grab is a mysterious score which I do say was probably the only thing that keeps the movie even remotely interesting and the fact that one man has such passion for his oil (or so we are lead to believe). Is he a good man is he bad thats what ticked me off the development of the main character was lack luster. We see he has a heart by taking on this child HW, but does he really care about him or is he just baggage that DDL uses to show he has some family value in order to obtain peoples land.<br/><br/>2nd the hold, I think the only thing that holds you is the question, this soundtrack is creepy what the hell is gonna happen? Then you keep waiting & waiting & waiting & then 2 hours 45 minutes have gone by & your like what the hell is this all about. I see the story about a money hungry greedy man that gets what he deserves by having no one at the end, but why? Why is religion introduced into the movie just to shoot it down? What is the purpose of trying to make a mockery of religion or is it just to show that there are some people out there that get a little to crazy with religion? Still a piece of the plot that never really took off.<br/><br/>I guess its worth seeing to just figure out your take on it, but assuredly not if you aren't an open minded individual. Really the whole thing is depressing and dreary, creepy & weird and just doesn't deliver with any sort of mental, emotional, moral or even spiritual satisfaction. Isn't that what movies are supposed to do??? Well good luck on your decision, mine is save your money till it comes out in the McDonalds 1$ rental & then sit down on a day you have nothing better to do, but watch a movie for almost 3 hours.<br/><br/>Good Luck."

","There Will Be Blood truly blew me away. After watching the Best Picture winner from the same year, No Country for Old Men, and being largely disappointed, I came into this ready to feel the same way again. But let me say, this film was far more deserving of Best Picture, and definitely should have won the award, as it is far and away the best film I have seen from 2007.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1898. Daniel Plainview is working in a silver mine. After finding silver ore, Plainview sells it and hires a crew and, after finding oil, becomes an oil man. When the father of an infant son dies in a drilling accident, Plainview takes the child as his own, eventually beginning to use him strategically to get a business advantage (claiming his is a ""family business""). The film picks up in 1911, where Plainview is now doing quite well for himself in the oil business, and is tipped off about a place where there is a large amount of oil. Plainview buys the land from a reluctant family that had been living there and begins drilling for oil.<br/><br/>The story of the film mostly follows Daniel Plainview as a character, rather than the events around him. Key moments surrounding this oil drilling process are used as focal points where we key in on Plainview as a person. It is overall a deep character study of this savvy, manipulative businessman. The farther we get through the film, the more we see his descent into madness. From the very beginning of the film, we can see that Plainview's moral compass is already quite skewed, but the more time we spend with him, the more we see just how awful he really can be. There are always things going on around Plainview, whether it be drilling accidents or his encounters with Eli Sunday, the prayer leader of the small community where Plainview is drilling, but at the center of it all is Plainview as he becomes more and more morally corrupt.<br/><br/>Now, there are many movies about mentally unstable people descending into complete madness, but I don't think I've ever seen any that are quite like this. This is one of the freshest, most original films I've seen in a while, even though it was made over 10 years ago. It's quite rare to find films like this, that are just completely new ideas on how to tell stories, so I think it's worth acknowledging the originality of this movie.<br/><br/>One thing I found very interesting about this film was the way they portrayed the character of Eli Sunday. At the beginning of the movie, he just appears to be the stereotypical ""good Christian boy"" that is trying to support his Church and his faith. However, as the film progresses, we see more and more of who he really is, to the point where it is implied that he is nearly as morally corrupt as Plainview. For a moment early on in the film, I got worried that it might start portraying religion as the savior of all things. Thankfully, I found it to be much more intelligent and thought-provoking than the ridiculous propaganda it could have become. This is a movie that seriously questions religion, but not in a direct way. Instead, we see little details sprinkled throughout that, when thoughtfully considered, seem to be depicting the greed and corruption that exists in the world of religion, just as in the business world. This is a very bold and gutsy decision that may offend many people, but that I have a good deal of appreciation for, because deep down, we all know this can be very real. This is a film that doesn't sugarcoat what the world is like, doesn't tell us what we want to hear. There are deep messages in this film about the greed and lust for power that exists in all of mankind, including in those leaders that we may personally look up to and admire. This raw, painfully real approach to portraying the nature of evil in the human race is one of the many things that make this an incredibly intriguing film.<br/><br/>Besides Eli and, of course, Plainview, there isn't much else noteworthy from the area of character development. Most of the other characters in the film are just there as means of illustrating how bad Plainview can be, or helping his character development move along. This is a very focused movie, and rarely does it shift its focus from the character of Daniel Plainview. I don't consider this a bad thing, as this was a story mainly about this one man, but some may not enjoy this decision. I instead found this to be a very smart move, as having too many characters being developed would have forced the film to wander into places it had no reason to go to. So, this was yet another smart filmmaking move.<br/><br/>Now, throughout this review, I have been pointing out some of the many great decisions made by director Paul Thomas Anderson. His masterful direction of this film is so important to the greatness of the final product. Like I mentioned before, his ability to focus in on one character, and one character alone, and tell a whole story that is both interesting and entertaining is unbelievable. He takes this one character and is able to tell a relevant story portraying the universal greed and corruption of all of mankind. The pace is perhaps a bit slow, but doesn't ever feel like it due to the way every scene has some sort of purpose or connection to the overall story that is being told. The film never wanders or feeds us useless information, instead always staying committed to what it's trying to do. Using all of these storytelling techniques and strategies, Anderson was able to create this incredibly powerful and effective film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest phenomenon surrounding this movie is how I never got bored. I watched a 158 minute, slow-moving film about a man drilling for oil in Texas, and it had my attention the entire way through. It certainly didn't feel anywhere near 2 hours and 40 minutes. I probably could've gone to three hours and beyond, but it was done so perfectly there was nothing left to add. It was, again, the direction of Paul Thomas Anderson that kept me interested in what was going on the whole way through. He built up this character of Daniel Plainview in a way that made it impossible to turn away. It is truly unbelievable how long this film was able to go, and I didn't lose interest the entire time.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film was also incredible. It won the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Cinematography, and it was well-deserved. The film captures the claustrophobic setting of being down in a mine in the first scene of the movie. We then have many beautiful landscape shots scattered throughout the film. The scene where the oil shoots into the air and catches on fire late at night is a mesmerizing sight. The lighting in certain scenes, as well as the camera angles used, also fit the mood of each scene very well, and capture all of the little details that add to the realism of it all. Director of photography Robert Elswit truly helped the film in a big way, and made it the beautifully shot movie that it was.<br/><br/>The score of this film was also a major contributor to the overall mood. It was a very unique, often quite strange score, with plenty of dark, unsettling music to match the tone of the movie. There were various unique sounds used throughout the film, and I certainly have never heard a score quite like this one. But, despite how odd it is, I think it perfectly fit the mood of the movie, and in doing so, enhanced the experience of watching it. If music can do that for a movie, then the composer has done their job well.<br/><br/>Now, everything else in this film was done incredibly well. But still, the driving force behind it was Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview. He is very well-deserving of the Oscar. His performance was absolutely stunning, and was a huge factor behind how interesting and enjoyable this movie was to watch. He was able to capture Plainview's madness and convey it in a believable and often frightening way. He was scary good in this role, especially in a few scenes in particular, which I will not spoil here. Everything else was great, but if Day-Lewis' performance fell flat, the movie would have suffered terribly. Instead, he went above and beyond, carrying this film to greatness.<br/><br/>Of course, the rest of the cast was overshadowed by Day-Lewis in the lead role, but I thought Paul Dano did a particularly good job as Eli Sunday. At first, his performance was a bit unconvincing for me, but he seemed to get better as the film progressed, to the point where he almost came close to matching Day-Lewis' intensity. Dano did an excellent job of conveying Eli's desperation in his performance, and complimented Day-Lewis quite well with his talent.<br/><br/>Overall, There Will Be Blood checks all of the boxes and ends up being a fascinating story illustrating the greed of mankind. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an absolutely stunning performance and director Paul Thomas Anderson masterfully crafts an intriguing and thought-provoking film. It is an excellent movie whether you are looking at the technical aspects, the deep messaging behind it, or the entertainment value. The subject matter may not be for everyone, but There Will Be Blood is, perhaps a bit surprisingly, a truly great film."
"tarikson1","10","2","4","8 December 2016"," It may have no point, but that doesn't make it pointless!
","There Will Be Blood is a difficult movie and one that managed to do something that only few movies are able to: it crawled into my head and made me think about it. At first I was trying to understand it before I realized that there was nothing to be understood, only observed. And that is exactly why people complain about it: they say this movie is pointless because it has no deeper meaning, no message and no unexpected twist. If you judge it from that point of view, you are right. However, There Will Be Blood should not be assessed that way. Paul Thomas Anderson is not trying to shove us down some kind of message that we ought to try to understand. He's just giving us the story of a man, who finds oil and consequently becomes wealthy. We, the audience, are supposed to observe and to make up our minds about this on our own. There is nothing subjective to the movie, it simply and merely documents a part of a man's life. By not being subjective or judge-mental, it makes people feel stupid because they think that they didn't get what it was all about even though there is nothing to be understood. And in that way, people are stupid as they believe that everything has to have some kind of message or moral subtext. It forces the audience to dwell on this movie and use their brains but apparently not many people are fond of thinking. There Will Be Blood is avoiding all of that which makes it a great piece of art since it accomplishes to remain compelling through the entire run-time even though there is not much happening and therefore I think people are right if they believe that this movie will be looked upon as a classic in a couple of decades."
"GeorgeRoots","9","2","4","14 August 2014"," Daniel Day Lewis Is Nothing Short Of Phenomenal.
","Paul Thomas Anderson has a unique talent for making genre films distinctly his. After a five year absence he comes back with ""There Will Be Blood"", loosely based on the 1927 novel ""Oil!"", and it's nothing short of spectacular. It also noticeably contains a multiple award winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis, that I feel was the best character of that decade who embodied sin, corruption, greed and so much raw emotion it will remain forever unique. It is all so expertly captured by Anderson in a 2 hour 30 minute epic, and rarely any form of cliché or gimmick manage to sneak in.<br/><br/>The setting mostly takes within place miles of desert, which pretty much suits Daniel Plainview's (Day Lewis) completely locked up character. From the beginning, we see him break his leg after a mine explosion exposes an ore, and drags himself what could easily be miles to the nearest town to record the claim. So begins a journey of one man forming a small drilling company, and blooming into a full blown empire. A few scenes of sparse locals and labourers bring us back to reality after watching some really brutal scenes, all of which culminates in a fantastic portrayal of one mans greed and utter destruction.<br/><br/>Many critics had placed it at the top of their ""best of"" lists, and to me there's an awfully big tie between this and the Coen Brothers ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007). For me personally, it definitely places somewhere in the top 3 of 2007's movies. Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood composes the soundtrack, and distinctly makes it atmospheric with added drone sounds that get used a little too often, but never condemns the overall production. What little of the supporting cast is used, all of them hold up well. I have to admit however, that as much I love Paul Dano and no matter how good a performer he is, he doesn't hold up well as an ""antagonist"" for Daniel Day Lewis (Who does?).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: A superb drama like wine, it gets better with age. 9/10."
"vanneero","10","2","4","11 March 2013"," One of the best films of the century
","There Will Be Blood is a challenging film. It's not hard to comprehend (meaning no much time jumps or stuff like that) but there's something about it that just keeps baffling. That ""something"" is probably the difficulty to realize how audacious this movie is. It's an uncompromising and ruthless image of an abominable man that doesn't embellish its subjects: capitalism, rapacity, greed, madness and revenge.<br/><br/>In 1898, miner-businessman Daniel Plainview labors alone in his silver mine. While climbing out of the pit, the ladder breaks down, Plainview falls, breaks his leg and goes unconscious. When he wakes up, he shouts ""No!"". But not for pain, but because it slows him down, and doesn't let even a broken leg to stop him from delivering the silver nuggets to be evaluated. Silver is followed by oil, but it could be anything else as well, because Plainview only cares about money and beating others in the competition. He later travels to the town of Little Boston to look for oil with his adoptee H.W. Plainview. They are, however, challenged by preacher Eli Sunday, who sees Plainview's true intentions but whose objectives are similar to his.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is unlike anything writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has done before. He became famous with his two films in the end of the 90's: Boogie Nights, a depiction of blue movie business in the 70's, and Magnolia, a drama about a quantity of people intersecting during two days. Where those films had large ensemble casts and enormous amount of characters, There Will Be Blood is a true one man's show. The movie is completely built upon the character of Daniel. He is the movie's absolute point of reference, first seen as a greedy, misanthropic bastard, a character impossible to sympathize with. But as the movie proceeds, new aspects of him are revealed. But that doesn't mean they'd be positive aspects. He is a discordant, colorful character.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't just a story about him. There Will Be Blood is a very powerful and profound thesis about American greed and capitalism that still ravage the country and the other world today. Anderson contrasts two hunters of power: Daniel tries to justify his actions through common wealth, Eli through religion. Anderson's view of their duel is merciless: either one of them isn't better than the other one, even though Daniel's unscrupulousness is quite hard to transcend. Both men treacherously use other people for their own benefit, lie and make vows of bright future to people, while their only goal is money and power, with only means and requisites being different.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a towering, ballsy, simply astounding and one of the best performances of the decade as Plainview. He embodies this travesty of a human being, becoming only more insane and crueler as the film proceeds. It's only in the end scene where he hops on the borders of overacting, and might even cross them, but it doesn't bother. Paul Dano is also superior as Eli, putting his babyish face and intensity in good use as this devious preacher. He's not as mind-boggling as Day- Lewis, but it's still a remarkable performance considering that he had only 4 days to prepare for the role. God knows how incredible he might have been if he had had more time. The technical section is also glorious: Robert Elswit's cinematography is flawless and very beautiful, and Jonny Greenwood's strong soundtrack creates a nightmarish and hypnotic atmosphere to the background.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a movie that requires multiple viewings to grow to its full measures, and once it does, it reveals to be a masterpiece. Like all of Anderson's previous work, the film requires concentration and patience but rewards the viewer massively. The film might be too heavy for some, since there's actually not a single happy moment, but to me, this is an unforgettable masterpiece that is going to stand the test of time and will be viewed over 50 from now. This Anderson's best film to date and an instant classic."

","Set in the 18-1900's of oil crazy America, this Paul Thomas Anderson thriller brings old Hollywood back to the modern day in an unforgettable fashion. The film stars Daniel Day Lewis as a money grabbing oil baron named Daniel Plainview, who wants one thing and one thing only...money, who clashes fascinatingly with the preaching third revelation fanatic Eli, who is played by Paul Dano and brings some interesting and effective acting techniques to the film which gives the film its own style.<br/><br/>There will be blood truly is a remarkable piece of cinema which will leave any fan of quality cinema crying with joy. Lewis offers a compelling and ruthless performance which makes him such an unpredictable and intriguing character, he portrays the old fashioned, well spoken slime-ball you would expect an oil baron to be superbly, and matches the conventions without making them predictable and cheesy. He talks as if he is better than everyone which is expressed in his voice clearly. He has no concern for any human being and will do anything to make money, his performance truly deserved and Oscar and when seen is one of the most memorable and iconic every portrayed in a motion picture.<br/><br/>Eli is another interesting but for some strange reason unlikeable character in the film. He is constantly trying to triumph over Plainview and gets under his skin multiple times throughout the movie. Even though we should not like the character of Plainview, we still want to because of his dark humour and his deceivingly charming persona, which makes Eli look weedy and minuscule in comparison, he is portrayed throughout the film as a constant niggle for Plainview which makes us dislike him even though he is, in a manner of speaking, a better person.<br/><br/>The Film itself has a linear structure but this at no point becomes a problem, the film is directed to flow smoothly and easily which makes it easy to watch and also links in with the performances so that they do not stray from the story. The cinematography and mise en scene contained within the There Will Be Blood is stunning and frustratingly captivating, you don't get any rest, there is constant beauty portrayed within the movie which brings me to the statement, Paul Thomas Anderson has created a truly brilliant and unforgettable motion picture which is unmatchable within its genre.<br/><br/>10/10"

","If I could resume this flick in one phrase it would be: ""This film is a flawless masterpiece about a ruthless entrepreneur who suffers from severe mental problems of an unspecified nature (he is, basically, a sociopath).""<br/><br/>The main character, Daniel Plainview, is the most powerful film character of the 21st century, given all the 21st century films that I have ever seem as of October 2012. He is aggressive, terrifying but at the same time, psychologically very weak: he has a very delicate mental balance as little things can really put him off balance and make him announce death threats to anyone in the room.<br/><br/>The film is not only about sociopathy, however, it is also about entrepreneurship, in both the oil and church sectors of ""the economy"". Daniel's archenemy in the film, Eli Sunday, is also another entrepreneur who is nearly as aggressive as our protagonist and he would be the most powerful character of any lesser film, but here, Eli is almost an ant next to Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>Overall, a film to those that like powerful dramas, but those weak of heart should stay away from this monstrous film."

","There will be Blood – CATCH IT (A) The buzz surrounding Paul Thomas Anderson's Scientology-esque Film ""The master"" is getting bigger and bigger. This led me to watch his previous Oscar nominated movie ""There will be Blood"" which I was somehow not able to watch (I don't like Daniel Day-Lewis, don't know the reason) over the years. There will be Blood is a hardcore look into the life of a oil man in 19th century played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Sitting through There will be Blood is one of the darkest experiences of my life. The Gothic background score and dark performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and creepy Paul Dano were more than I had ever anticipated. The direction, background score, screenplay and performances of the movie are simply outstanding. This is nothing like we see on regular basis. It takes lots of courage and heart to direct something so dark and bizarre that it makes you question everything around it. Daniel Day-Lewis well deserved Oscar winning performances is haunting and memorable. This man surely knows how to divulge into dark roles (Scratch NINE out of your head right now). Paul Dano is so good that you want to hate him from bottom of your heart. I have never hated a teen since that whinny little ***** boy from ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"". In the end, There will be Blood is a depressing and haunting story of family, greed, religion and most importantly oil. Highly Recommended!"
"grmcox","8","2","4","7 September 2012"," Artistic Triumph
","Daniel Day Lewis is a standout in this film about an early 20th century oil man who makes a name and fortune for himself in old Texas. The pacing of the film is excellent, in that the viewer is always on the edge of his seat wanting more. The film would be a masterpiece if not for the miscasting of the preacher character, Eli, who lacks charisma and is no match for the coolness and ruthlessness of Daniel Plainfield. Nor is the boy particularly well cast, as he comes off as unemotional and shallow. Also, the ending was strange, although I liked the fact that Plainfiled turns the tables on the preacher for the former having put Plainfield through humiliation earlier in the film, which Plainfield willingly submits to, because his mind is fixated on the prize of leasing land for his pipeline project. Many of the reviewers here misunderstood the character of Plainfield and his development, which Daniel Day Lewis plays masterfully. He is not completely a misanthrope, evidenced by the love he shows toward his adopted son and the daughter of the rancher and by his accepting (though suspicious) attitude toward his faux half-brother. It is after his son loses his hearing in a tragic accident that Plainfield begins to become callous, because the one person he cared about has been made mute and deaf to him. He also is pained in learning that his half-brother died from TB before ever meeting him. In the end, Plainfield becomes Scrooge-like, betraying hurtful information to his adopted son about his origin, after the son betrays his father by telling him he intends to leave for Mexico to establish his own company, which his father takes as representing competition to his own. Plainfield is as deep of a character as the oil wells he drills and it is worth a study of this intriguing man for his genius business acumen and his ruthless people skills."
"ayeo","8","2","4","28 August 2012"," Well executed!
","Acting:: In terms of acting, Daniel Day-Lewis has obviously performed above and over my expectations. His skills in mastering the accent needed for this movie is impressive. His ability to express emotions were also way up there. Paul Dano's acting was incredible as well. He should have won the Best Supporting Actor. The rest of the people did their roles well, no one stood out as a poor actor. This area deserves a 8.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Background music: Although the background music may be deemed as artistic but, in my opinion, they seem too loud and out of place in terms of the genre and the appropriateness. Personally, I think this is the weakest area of the movie and it may be the weak link that made it lose out to No Country For Old Me. This category deserves a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot was nothing fancy but, cleverly, executed. It is simple but the editing is so well done that the flow just keep you glued to the story line. The character formation for two main characters were built at the right pace. The characters, though, are quite disturbing; certainly not suitable for younger or sensitive viewers. I would rank the plot at 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Screenplay: The dialogs are well crafted and amazingly convincing. I've enjoyed it very much because they are raw and rather western."

I had no idea what this movie was about aside from drilling for oil, so I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with no dialog for over fourteen minutes and focuses on Daniel Plainview mining gold and then oil but when they strike oil a young father is killed in an accident and Plainview takes in his infant son.<br/><br/>The movie then flashes forward to a now moderately wealthy Plainview being told of oil in a small desert California area and he sets out to buy the land.<br/><br/>He then meets a young preacher boy who distrusts Plainview and wants money from him to start his own church, and the two form a lifelong dislike for one another.<br/><br/>As the oil fields begin to prosper Plainview begins to get more greedy and miserable and ends up pushing away everyone close to him<br/><br/>You'll have to watch the film yourself to see what else happens but I must say this film has some of the best acting I have ever seen in a movie, Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano completely blew me away and the movie is hard to look away from.<br/><br/>That being said however you do have to have patience while watching this movie and those who don't like talkative dramas probably won't like this movie, but I loved it and now consider it one of my favorite films and I do think it should have won best picture over No Country for Old Men."

I'm surprised this did not win best picture or at least best director for PTA.

"khanbaliq2","9","2","4","25 June 2010"," A film about an oil pioneer whose trailblazing spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition.
","There Will Be Blood is a creation myth for American capitalism, blazingly mounted against barren California landscapes. In 1898, prospector Danial Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) strikes silver. It marks the start of his rapidly growing empire and his move into the oil business. He and his young son H.W. (nominally his partner) visit a tract of land in California, said to be oil-rich. On striking oil, Plainview crosses swords with a young local preacher (Paul Dano) who disapproves of his voracious greed.<br/><br/>The film is a historical epic that has the power of timeless myth, a story with Biblical overtones about a man who became immensely rich and powerful but lost his humanity on that journey. Day-Lewis's portrayal of Plainview, a solitary misanthrope with an appalling, barely concealed fury, is an astonishing master-class in acting. Dano as the young preacher Eli - calm but smug and manipulative makes an effective foil. But it's writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's conception that carries the day; he has fashioned a story that surveys the well-spring of American business and entrepreneurialism and finds it morally wanting. This is an angry, roaring discordant film, and you emerge feeling genuinely jolted."
"sashank_kini-1","8","2","4","1 June 2010"," Daniel Day is devilishly dynamic!!
","Some people may not be inclined to watch this movie, or may be put off due to the slow pacing, as the film abstains from heavy dialogs, relying on subtle, haunting background score and actions to convey its complexities. For the first good time, there are just shots of Daniel digging for oil, obtaining it, falling into pit etc. Not a single sound made by the actor except for a groan. There are exquisitely simple shots of pump-jack used for extracting oil, and other such photography captured in the film such as the farmer's house, shot of windmill etc. Everything looks so authentic that I was instantly enamored.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives a larger-than-life portrayal of Daniel Plainview, a simpleton who wants to make it big in the oil industry. As the film progresses, the character's emotional and mental balance abates as he plunges into an abyss of lunacy. He leaves his son in the lurch, denigrates a holier-than-thou, fraudulent priest and ensures everything that yields him optimum gain and moreover, optimum dominance. He doesn't indulge in histrionics at all times, limiting it to the outburst scenes, and during the rest of the film, stealthily uses his facial contortions to get across. The best part is that he never gets out of his character, and seemingly maintains a perfect stability in his character. <br/><br/>It can be unequivocally said that he has put 100 per cent efforts in his work. Towards the latter half, I noticed one thing that he became immune to sexual deprivation. He had no love within him, no feelings, sexually or non-sexually towards anyone. When his ""brother"" asks money from him at a sleazy place, a couple behind is seen snogging. However, Daniel looks plainly uninterested. Even non-sexually, he seems to have an aversion to make friends with people, show any endearment. He doesn't spare his competitors, and doesn't show any forgiveness or redemption for the sins that he has committed. <br/><br/>This character works much better than Al Pacino's in Scarface due to the crisp and non-indulgent direction. There is no room for redundancies like the sequence in Scarface in which Al Pacino's sister confronts Pacino in a skimpy gown or the excessive use of F-words, sometimes used just for the sake of creating controversy. This movie doesn't conform to conventionalities, giving it a unique, humorous turn (the end sequence, for example). <br/><br/>The camera has been used effectively to convey emotions. For example, the final scene in which Daniel takes retribution for all the humiliations he had faced at the hands of the priest by scurrilously berating and belittling him, forcing him to cower in defeat and shame and in the end, in an amusingly disturbing sequence, mashes his head with a bowling pin.<br/><br/>In the entire course of the film, there aren't many interactions between Daniel Plainview and Eli, still the vendetta never relegated as both of them were equally self-righteous. There is a particularly intriguing and interesting sequence of Plainview being absolved from abandonment accusations in a baptism ceremony. Here, Eli extracts his revenge upon Plainview very furtively, by stating that the Devil had possessed him and in order to expunge the Devil from his body, slapped him and yanked his hair the same way Plainview did to him earlier. In this scene, Daniel Day shines like the sun before noon, not too dim, not too bright. <br/><br/>Paul Dano on the other hand gives a mediocre portrayal in a double role. Shia Labeouf could have fit the boots perfectly, I think, especially in the church scenes where he had to act ludicrously. I remember Labeouf in Indiana Jones, and he could have played this character to a tee. <br/><br/>Dillon Freasier did a pretty good job as the son who distances himself from his father as the latter plunges into a veritably dangerous game, involving detachment from everyone in a pursuit to success and autocracy. The abandonment scene is a sad plight of what people can do and really do in this world to ensure no setbacks. I could see the transformation in his character. In the first few scenes, he seemed to be very loyal to him, walking and talking the way he did and later, he seemed to distance himself from his father. Once he grows up and finds the ugly truth from Daniel, who disparagingly ridicules him, he takes the final decision.<br/><br/>The movie clocks in at about 2 and half hours, which is satisfying enough for a 00's film. The editing is fantastic, so is the cinematography. The movie gives a terrific outlook into the countryside, with vast, deserted landscapes looking solemnly spectacular. The sound editing is brilliant, with hair-raising background score.<br/><br/>I go with a 8 out of 10 for this great film, and a gem of a performance by Day Lewis."
"rmcd100","10","2","4","27 March 2010"," Best movie I've ever seen
","I viewed this movie upon its release in the cinema, and did not think much of it at all at the time. I have since watched it four times and find it the most fascinating movie I have ever seen. I think what fascinates me the most, is that how obvious it is that all humans share the traits of poor Daniel, its just that most of us are not self aware enough to know it or are just plain ignorant. I believe Daniel loved his son. His story that he used him for business is not true, he just said that to make him feel bad because he knew it would. He loved him. There relationship was blossoming up until the point when he lost his hearing. pre deafness he loved him even more. I also think there is a strong message relating to an unattached man or man without woman. the story screams out that alone we are unbalanced. Daniel had no wife to trust. No soul mate to take care of him and tell him when he's wrong.No one to do what's best for the boy or advise him. As a result Daniel drove himself mad, believing all he said and thought to be right, with no counter party to offer an objectionable opinion. Surrounded by yes men on the payroll he was doomed. I think any man with a son should watch this movie, any man who feels he does not need a wife to mind him should watch this movie and any man thats puts wealth above either of those thing should watch this movie, as the Daniel was indeed a truly unhappy man. As for the acting, Daniel Day Louis is the greatest of them all and this performance is just the most amazing thing I've ever seen, very scary, the more and more you watch it, the more and more you learn...............about yourself...........and about the hard facts that we are all only human and all have the weakness of greed, we all want more of the good thing, it's just that some have buried the desire better than others"

Well, on this recent Black Friday, I went out and bought There will be blood for only three dollars. I know it's cheap. I had wanted to see it for a while but I never could. So I bought it, expecting something great. I wasn't disappointed. It's a true madness story at it's best. <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis stars in his Oscar winning role as Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who is asked by Paul Sunday(Paul Dano) to help him out with oil in his town. So, Daniel and his son do it, and their lives are ruined. <br/><br/>Paul Dano stars as both Paul Sunday, a quiet man, and Eli Sunday. Dano doesn't really do much with Paul. But Eli is another story. Eli is a psycho minister who's religious sermons will be bound to creep you out. He's an A-hole too. Luckily, Mr. Sunday gets what he deserves. <br/><br/>The performances in this film are fantastic. Especially from Dano and Lewis. Of course, because they are the only really famous people in the film. The film is dramatic, serious, and at times, kind of scary. Dano creeps me out. Along with the music that they play throughout the film. That kind of scared me too. This film sure is long, but damn it's worth it. I feel stupid for not seeing No country for old men. I do. I feel stupid for seeing this film so late. Daniel Day Lewis deserved the Oscar. He was great. As is this film. There will we blood, to me, sounded like a Saw film. No it ain't a Saw film. Far from it. It's a story of true madness. It shows the true madness in people. And There will be blood is a film that you can never forget. It's just great.<br/><br/>There will be blood:****/****"
"RickHarvey","9","2","4","16 November 2009"," Let me start by saying
","This is defiantly the type of film you need to watch twice to fully appreciate it. On my second viewing , my opinion totally changed.. for one, I thought the soundtrack was brilliant. Just one of many things that makes the film stand out amongst the rest . Again, Daniel day Lewis puts in another tremendous performance. This guy, in my opinion is the best in the industry .<br/><br/>This is my first Paul T Anderson film I watched and most likely won't be the last . Many people complain about the pace of his films , how there to slow. Maybe some scenes in There will be blood are a little bit slow but why moan when you have the soundtrack, the track that tells the story by itself without needing the characters to say a word . Why moan when every scene looks fantastic and why moan when its DDL portraying Daniel Plainview. I could watch this man doing nothing but facial expressions all day. He doesn't even need to speak , his body movement and facial expressions tells the story alone.<br/><br/>The film also contains many scenes that makes it stand out. Scenes such as the oil tower being on fire, Daniel baptise and then there the ending scene in the bowling hall. The scene has been spoofed many times but even when taken seriously , you still have to laugh at Daniel insanity. I see this film as the modern days Citizen Kane and I will rank Daniel Plainview as the greatest movie character this decade and also in the top 100 of all time. For those who haven't watched it, I suggest you do, for those who watched it only once, I highly suggest you pull out an second viewing and for those who have watched it dozens of time , keep watching it.<br/><br/>Now let me end by ""I'm finished"""
"gavin6942","8","2","4","8 September 2009"," This Is What Oscar Looks Like
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a miner, strikes oil and quickly becomes a rich oilman. After finding out about a grand oil reservoir, Plainview cons an old man out of his land. But things aren't that easy... the man's son, an aspiring preacher, does everything in his power to get in Plainview's way. Oh, and Plainview's son goes deaf and becomes an introvert.<br/><br/>This film is a dramatic, edgy tour-de-force. Possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's best film (though ""Magnolia"" deserves some recognition) and an Oscar-winning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis (whose only better film, in my opinion, is ""Gangs of New York""). It just rocks.<br/><br/>I couldn't stop watching ""There Will Be Blood"" over and over again. I don't even know if I fully get it, as I was told there is a parallel between blood and oil in this movie, but I didn't really catch it. Sometimes I'm not as astute as others, but I was looking on purpose and still missed it. Oh, well."
"Gunn","8","2","4","20 April 2009"," Interesting!
","To me this is a good film, an interesting film, but not a great film. Its biggest asset is Daniel Day-Lewis' fantastic performance. He was deserving of both of his Oscars (My Left Foot also), that's for sure! The story is both confusing and fascinating. Watching a man evolve from hard worker to innovator to oil magnate and in the process watching his soul decay. Perhaps he was in a soul-less state from the start and we just find out as the story unfolds. Initially he appears to be a man with goals but also a loving and caring father, or foster father and a man who shares his wealth and progress with others but ultimately we see his ulterior motives. The production values are quite impressive and the supporting cast is fine. My question is: ""What's the moral of this story?"" I found myself very unsympathetic to the townsfolk, the so-called preacher Eli, the leach who posed as a brother to Daniel Plainview and even the some of the oil workers. I very often hear film critics saying: ""I couldn't relate to the characters in the film"" and then they pan it. Well, I didn't like most of the characters in this film save for H.W., Mary Sunday and Fletcher (Ciaran Hinds) who cared for the kid. Still, I liked the film. So what's with these film critics? They use the lamest reasons for panning a film."
"pininfrna","10","2","4","9 March 2009"," The real deal
","I saw this movie for the first time last night and was so surprised by its quality. For some reason, in my mind, I had always associated this film with No Country For Old Men, probably because they were released around the same time. Based on previews and some reviews I had read, I thought this was going to be the same hyper-violent artsy shock film. (I'm not trying to insult No Country, it was a great movie, but I stand by that evaluation.) I was so pleasantly surprised to see the unexpected- a completely beautiful, fascinating and honest movie. In fact, the lack of artsy pretension was what struck me most. The superb acting made it raw and believable. The characters avoid becoming caricatures, in spite of the intensity and extremes of their personas. So many aspects of the film were so obviously Kubrick-inspired that it did teeter on the verge of plagiarism at times, but the movie has enough of its own original merits that I wasn't overly put off by that. I'm not sure this movie got its fair shake. We heard so much hyperbole about films like American Beauty, Slumdog Millionaire, even Titanic (wow), and yet this one, in spite of winning some Academy Awards, seems at risk of slipping through the cracks in terms of its enduring legacy. I hope that doesn't happen, because it is truly great, and one for the ages."
"MLDinTN","7","2","4","28 February 2009"," very long, story could have been tightened up
","Sure Daniel Day Lewis was good in this, but his role in Gangs of New York was a lot better and he didn't win the Oscar for that. His character, Daniel Plainview, doesn't really do anything to stand out to me. And I thought his character was going to be a lot meaner than what he was.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an oilman. He buys up land in Texas to drill and teaches his young son how to run the family business. He becomes successful but often cheats families when buying land. He doesn't give them the real value of the land. His son is injured in an accident and loses his hearing. Before too long, Daniel ships him off to school in California. He also must deal with a preacher, Sunday, that he considers a fake. He has to say he is a sinner in church in order to buy this one man's land. You could tell he really resented the preacher for this humiliation. He gets him back in the very end.<br/><br/>While his son is away, a man turns up claiming to be his brother. With his son gone, Daniel starts to let this guy get involved with the business. But the guy slips up and Daniel knows he's an impostor and shows him what happens when you cross Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the movie, it skips forward in time by many years. Daniel is now an old, lonely drunk. He lives in a huge mansion and his son comes by. The son says he wants to move to Mexico to get a drilling business going there. Daniel calls him a competitor and disowns him. He is very mean to his son and reveals a shocking secret about his childhood.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a dark film about a man making a living drilling for oil in the early 1900s.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching. I just don't think it's Daniel Day Lewis's best nor one of the top films of the year."

"bandw","7","2","4","23 October 2008"," Greed is not good
","This is the story of Daniel Plainview, an oilman living at the beginning of the 20th century. We are asked to invest a lot of time in getting to know this rather unlikeable man and I am not sure it is a good investment. As Daniel slips deeper and deeper into the clutches of his greed I found myself caring less about him and about the movie. Daniel is not complex enough to hold your attention for over two and a half hours, he is defined by his greed and little else. The only appealing qualities he ever displays are some affection for his adopted son and a man who presents himself as a long-lost brother. He abandons the boy when he can no longer use him for his own interests and he kills the would-be brother when he discovers he is a pretender. Daniel ultimately reaps the consequences of his monomania, doomed to wander alone in his mansion with no friends and no real interests.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of how secular capitalists use religion when it suits them and how religious people use capitalists when it suits them is topical and casts a pall of cynicism over the proceedings. If such a theme appeals to you, then you will be delighted that the resolution between the capitalist and the minister is mutual destruction. On a less abstract level, we are left with stereotypes for greedy oilmen and fake evangelical ministers.<br/><br/>Undoubdedly Day-Lewis gives a strong performance. For me his performance is undermined by that of Paul Dano as the faith-healing Eli Sunday. I suppose Eli was modeled after Billy Sunday, the Billy Graham of the time, but Dano is remarkably unconvincing in this role. No matter what your religious persuasion the successful faith-healers and revivalists can really get you going-- they are masters of mob psychology. Dano has neither the voice nor the demeanor to pull this off, his acting skills in this department pale in comparison to the people in real life. He is embarrassingly weak in the final scene.<br/><br/>The period details of early 20th century life seem authentic and provide the film with much of its interest. In particular, capturing the details of working on an oil drilling rig at the beginning of the oil industry in the United States is done most impressively. There are some incredible scenes like the one showing how explosive gas fires were extinguished. Clearly a lot of effort and research went into the filming.<br/><br/>Music plays a big part. The original score by Jonny Greenwood works well, creating subtle premonitory feelings. This is particularly effective in the beginning fifteen minutes where Daniel's first mining experiences are set forth, and not a word is spoken. Indeed after the first fifteen minutes I was anticipating something very special. The use of Arvo Pärt's ""Fratres"" establishes an appropriate mood and melds seamlessly with Greenwood's score, but the use of the Brahms violin concerto is so out of place as to seem positively bizarre.<br/><br/>This started strong and finished weak."

","I bought the DVD last night and thought what a lousy box! But Hey,the film by contrast was impeccable.<br/><br/>I know this film has had rave reviews and I saw No Country for Old Men before this. There Will Be Blood is such a complete and tragic film. Despite it's long running time, the film appeared to me to flow so well and its elements seem to create the almost 'Complete film' as did Dr Zchivago or Schindler's List.<br/><br/>I truly respect Day Lewis's performance being compared to De Niro's Jake La Motta. He was just absorbing, I was in awe with every word, particularly in the Bar Scene when he confronted that Oil guy who he had threatened to cut his throat, you truly saw a demented demon breaking out. He took centre stage and practically took 99% of the film's running time. His performance deserves to be in the top 10 of all time.<br/><br/>As for the script it really brought out the period of the time and the film was epic in scale. Beautifully constructed and Best film of the year. Good solid direction and lets not forget Paul Dano's performance. An excellent supporting role, where at least was his Oscar Nomination!!!! Hey, I know Javiar Bardem and was the right choice for the Oscar in that category, but Dano deserved at least a nomination for his over exaggerated (not overacted there's a difference trust me I am employed in this field to train actors).<br/><br/>A final note almost a Complete film!"

","I'm always left wondering whether these types of films are marvellous pieces of art or not. Films as films should be. Films where no stone is unturned, every aspect of the film has been run through with a fine tooth comb to achieve cinematic perfection. One can't deny the clinical precision with which they are made, the sheer immersion of the actors within the roles, the thought that has gone into them, the sheer beauty of some of the sequences.<br/><br/>Or are they the work of men striving to outdo the last man, looking for brownie points and winks and glances from peers rather than the primary function of films which is to entertain the audience.<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>Luckily, in the case of ""There Will Be Blood"" we get everything from the first paragraph but we also get Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano. As a result, any thoughts of the directors real intentions are banished from memory and we can just soak ourselves in two incredible performances.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a little too long perhaps, but Daniel Plainview is a very interesting character indeed with Day Lewis once again being the difference between a poor film and a good film, and in this case the difference between a good film and a very good film.<br/><br/>I gave it 8/10, with a little more focus on entertainment value this had the potential to be perfect"
"michaeljharvey","9","2","4","26 July 2008"," Atmospheric and thought provoking
","From the opening scenes, this film draws you in with its beautiful cinematography and haunting score. You can almost feel the dirt and heat of the desert. The still ""Wild"" West of early 1900's America comes alive. This movie works well as a historical drama, yet has something much deeper (and bleak) to say about American culture.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis shines as Daniel Plainview, an oil-man obsessed with making a fortune at any cost. He's heartless, greedy and increasingly insane. In many ways he represents the unbridled greed of capitalism. Exploitation, back-stabbing and even death are all simply part of doing business. Dollar bills carry more weight than human lives.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a fairly nihilistic story. Whether it's through unchecked big business or false religion, people are exploited. In the end, you're left wondering what the point of it all was. In my opinion, this ambiguity is quite intentional. The film's very essence is about people traveling down self-destructive paths that lead to nowhere.<br/><br/>This is a gorgeous, epic film about American capitalist culture and the dark side of human nature."

","***This review maybe contains a slight spoiler or two***<br/><br/>Many films come, mark a certain era of one's life and become a nice memory. Some films come and enter inside a mind, become a milestones of life, you think about them, they provide you with some unknown insights. And then, there are a couple of film's in your life that come, blow you apart and change your life from it's root in a way that great art and everyday experiences can only provide. This is one such film. One such experience.<br/><br/>On the most basic level, you will contemplate this movie on its artistic merit; its direction, its music (aaaaarghhhh, its gorgeous music!), its acting. Daniel Day Lewis, my god, what have you managed to achieve?! Although I hate to think in such terms, but his rendition of Daniel Plainview is the best acting ever captured on celluloid. Period. <br/><br/>Many people will start there and remain on that point in their love or hate for this film. Although it is hard even to imagine, but many a viewer have found this film to fail even in those parameters.<br/><br/>But, that is only a gateway into THIS. I don't know how else to call it. I have later described the impact film had on me as ""a religious experience"". What did I mean by that? Well, it's hard to describe, but it can be somewhat explained by this question; did you find the character of Daniel Plainview as ""good"" or ""bad""? When you reach the answer and it is negative, I can just say: WTF?! You're entitled to the opinion but we wan't be going for an afternoon coffee any time soon.<br/><br/>But if you find him to be ""good"", if you realize his consuming love for his son, his pain after the ""incident"", his rock-hard morals, his uncompromising mind and his burning intellect, I can just say: welcome! It is now time for one more viewing, and now prepare for the hand of god (whatever it may be) to blow your mind away."
"bertseymour7","10","2","4","21 July 2008"," Masterpiece
","This was a film that I loved but could never fully recommend to other people, because it is such a personal experience. Either you are on-board with Plainview or you aren't. I am a huge Daniel Day Lewis fan, but was actually almost hesitant to see this film because I felt this character would likely have many similarities to his previous character Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York. I was way off, Day Lewis pulls off another masterful and fully distinct portrayal.<br/><br/>This is a dark film, and a long one, but I never once noticed the running time because the movie just flows beautifully.<br/><br/>The basic plot is Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is an oil man who gets word that there might be tons of oil in a town called Little Boston. When he gets there he finds it, and finds success along with rivalry with the town's wild preacher. But that is only the plot on the superficial level, there are deeper themes of greed and overwhelming anger. Plainview descends into madness, but we can't quite tell at what moment this happens."

"dfle3","8","2","4","4 July 2008"," A good, old fashioned Hollywood character study
","To me, this movie seems a throwback to movies of yore-character studies, usually with a famous Hollywood male or female lead to bring in the punter. It's title is perhaps designed to bring in the stoner who will at some point leave the theatre feeling totally ripped off that this isn't a horror/slasher movie.<br/><br/>You will probably need to have a quite clear idea of what kind of movie this isn't before you can enjoy it. It isn't a horror/slasher movie. It's not a cowboy movie. It isn't a gore-fest. It is costume drama of sorts...it's set in turn of the last century America. That is one of the strengths of this movie-it's brilliant sense of place...barren American wasteland, drawing people there for one reason only...the promise of fortunes to be made, through finding gold or other precious metals. The landscape is befitting of the two protagonists of this film...uncompromising and unforgiving.<br/><br/>Enter Daniel Day-Lewis, as Daniel Plainview. He is a gold prospector. He doesn't find much to rejoice at...until he finds oil. The early scenes go along way to defining the strengths and weaknesses of his character. The sheer toil of oil work is brilliantly evoked, along with the horrific work conditions...where death is one mishap away.<br/><br/>One of the pleasures of this film is the relationship Daniel has with his son, H.W. Especially pleasurable is one scene he has with his baby son on a train...entrancing. The trajectory of that relationship, over the 30 year span of this movie is also fascinating, from a character study point of view.<br/><br/>Another pleasing scene is where Daniel is at the altar of Eli's church. There is some wonderful byplay there. I don't think the byplay is of the story, but the actors seem to be having a ball and it shows. It's not of the movie, but it works well in any case. Um, I'm trying to say that I think the camera captured the actors having fun at the time and decided to leave the scene in there because it works.<br/><br/>The other character of note is Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. Along with Day-Lewis, I think, Dano deserved to get nominated for some kind of acting award...supporting actor, say. Any criticism of Dano is ill-founded...he embodies all the qualities of Sunday perfectly. Perfect casting, in my view, as a preacher man on the make. Day-Lewis himself shows great diversity of emotional shading.<br/><br/>For those who look to these things, you can interpret this movie, as was intended, I think, to view this as sort of a parable of the dance between religion and business in the US. This part of the movie is rewarding and you can interpret the movie in many ways-as being cynical about religion and preachers, or as demonstrating that God is. For instance, there is a scene where an oil platform catches fire. In a way, this scene is crucial. But, I suppose, the question you might want to ask yourself is: Is God here? I have my own opinions-to me the preacher man is parasitic on power, seeking it to elevate his own power and influence. Of course, you could see God in this picture and argue the reverse. The way Daniel must court religious influence for pragmatic reasons is also telling.<br/><br/>Perhaps my favourite scene is where Eli tells Daniel of his business fortunes, near the end of the movie. As with the dates which flash up, time is important.<br/><br/>Lastly, I can't say whether Daniel Day-Lewis does a bad American accent or not...he has a touch of the Sean Connery's with it. But that is easily rationalised, I suppose, due to the history of immigration to the US.<br/><br/>It was my intention to give this movie 7/10, but the ending was brilliant-it really got to the heart of what this movie was about, I think.<br/><br/>8/10"
"sc8031","9","2","4","23 June 2008"," There Will Be Money
","What a crazy, creepy, memorable film experience! Daniel Day-Lewis, building on the role he played in ""Gangs of New York"", is the scariest dude this side of the corporate machine! I don't know if this film is even giving a scathing criticism of oil or capitalism. Maybe it's just providing a super-exaggerated (or ultra-concentrated) archetype of the insane colonial-capitalist quest for power and wealth (in this case symbolized by oil). 'Coz what better symbolizes greed than the story of a hell-bent oil-man? Nuttin' else, that's what.<br/><br/>Music is pretty good, by one of the dudes from Radiohead. So all you hipsters should be wetting your pants at the thought of the soundtrack. The music is pretty caustic and frenetic all throughout, very intense and consuming. Additionally, the font used on the film's box and poster art is totally metal, so all you metalheads should find something attractive as well! Very nice aesthetic choices all around.<br/><br/>This film is like, 2.5 hours or something, but it never lets up. It is non-stop, smooth-flowing horror the whole way through. Not horror in the blatant, gory way. Horror as in, you are absolutely captivated in the built-up fear that the characters revel in. And there's hardly a likable one among them.

The score was also excellent, very creepy.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoyed the most about it was that it didn't use all those crazy camera moves that so many other films do. It just worked hard to tell a good story.<br/><br/>In the end, I guess they did make the movie a bit long.

He exquisitely portrays a man's descent into madness and irrationality at the hands of the ludicrous oil business of the time period. Day Lewis makes you believe his anger, his frustration, his anguish at his son's disability. By the end, his performance is a consummate work of art.<br/><br/>But he is not the only reason that this movie is excellent. Paul Dano, who plays the role of Eli Sunday, the passionate but corrupt pastor of the local church, surprises us all with the energy of his acting.<br/><br/>The bi-play when both of these actors are on screen simultaneously is gripping. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen during the conflict over what Plainview owes Sunday for the church.<br/><br/>The final, and most important reason this film should be seen by all is the gravity of the issues it tackles. Corruption, anger, greed, and the wasteland that humanity is when confronted with limitless financial possibilities. Anderson conveys his message with resounding effectiveness.<br/><br/>Overall, yeah, this movie received a lot of hype and fanfare, maybe more than it deserved. But for this day and age, this movie is a masterpiece by comparison to the depravity found in ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" and others of the like."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","4","30 May 2008"," The corruption of the American dream (spoilers)
","If you had to list America's two main obsessions you'd probably whittle it down to money and religion. Both seem to consume the American soul  the pursuit of monetary gain and the need for spiritual enlightenment. But if there were to be a battle between the two for America's heart, which would win? The battle between Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) could be viewed as America's internal struggle between commerce and religion. Sure in modern America both co-exist, but despite that there's still a conflict. In the darkest corners rampant greed and fundamentalism still want to take hold.<br/><br/>Of course Daniel represents the commercial side of America  the one that wants to possess its body, who wants to own everything. Eli on the other hand represents the form of evangelism that wants to possess everyone's minds, who wants people to look upon him as god on Earth. Needless to say, with these two conflicting personalities sharing the same space there's going to be fireworks.<br/><br/>A wonderful scene early on in the film is when Eli turns up at Daniel's office and tells him that he's going to bless the well. He doesn't even ask, he merely dictates everything he's going to say and do, most of it incredibly self-important. Daniel sits there and politely agrees, but when it comes to the blessing, he completely ignores Eli and does it himself. It's a monumental slap in the face, but one which is done with a velvet glove  only Daniel and Eli are aware of what was supposed to happen; as far as everyone else in concerned, the ceremony went off without a hitch.<br/><br/>But then to illustrate the way that the conflict ebbs and flows, later on Daniel has to come crawling to Eli so that he can say a few words at a funeral  one of his men, who attended Eli's church, dies while working. You can see the sheer contempt Daniel has for Eli as the preacher rants and raves, and when they talk Daniel makes it clear that the church needs him. Without Plainview and his men, the well won't produce and 'blow gold all over the place'. In other words, the church better know what side their bread is buttered on.<br/><br/>However, even though at one point Daniel slaps Eli around and drags him through oilfields for being a fraud who can't cure his son's deafness, Eli Sunday still won't be put in his place. He seizes on the opportunity to make Daniel bow before him  Daniel needs to use some land and the owner of the land make it a condition that Daniel be blessed by the church. Eli returns Daniel's violence by slapping him and casting evil spirits out of him. But worse than that he gets Daniel to scream that he abandoned his child. This is the one thing that really annoys him. But it's notable that even though Daniel has had to humiliate himself, once the ordeal is done he can't help but smile. He has the land and he can now finish making a pipeline that will ensure his wealth. He cares more about money than he does his child  it's a grimly comic moment.<br/><br/>The final scene between Daniel and Eli sees a kind of role reversal. The money from his church squandered, Eli comes to Daniel begging for help. Daniel agrees to help him, but only if Sunday stands up and declares himself to be a false prophet and that god is a superstition. He makes Eli say it over and over again and louder and louder, until he finally admits that he can't help Eli, that the land Eli wants Daniel to buy has already been drained dry. We then have the infamous milkshake scene and Daniel clubs Eli to death with a bowling pin. It's quite a comic scene, and one that threatens to become ridiculous  Dano overacts, Day-Lewis shouts 'drainage' at the top of his lungs and Plainview dances and waves his straw around  but it ends up being a suitably silly ending to a rather silly conflict. The pull of soulless greed and soulless fundamentalism should strike anyone as childish  both are concerned with an overwhelming simplicity of thought. Therefore it's quite apt that these people should meet their end while chasing each other around a bowling alley.<br/><br/>But despite this, if there's a winner in this conflict, it's Daniel. Therefore the film kind of suggests that as far as America goes, commerce will triumph over religion. And it makes sense, as religion is often dependant on the generosity of businessmen. Religion needs commerce more than commerce needs religion.<br/><br/>The most telling moment in the film is when the well is on fire. Daniel celebrates because there is an ocean of oil under his feet. But when someone asks whether his son is okay  he gets knocked on his head by the gusher  he casually says he's not. Nothing is going to get in the way of Plainview making a fortune. This is all that he cares about. This is all he's focused on. Everything else is window dressing. His son, his clothes and his plain words present an acceptable image for the outside world; one that masks the soul-destroying greed. And it's an image that America still presents to the outside world. As a country it says that it cares, but like Plainview it ends up taking more than it gives back. Therefore the initially jarring music at the beginning is entirely appropriate. This is almost a horror film. A marvellous ode to avarice and the corruption of the American dream."
"amateur100","Null","2","4","27 May 2008"," Daniel Day Lewis made my year
","I recently saw a ""pay-per-view"" of ""There Will Be Blood"" and I was stunned. Not blown away, not taken aback, not shocked, not horrified, but stunned. Going into the film I knew that Daniel Day Lewis' character Daniel Plainview would be (or end up being for that matter) a man with no empathy, but only his lust for wealth. I saw Lewis in Gangs of New York, but failed to recognize his supremacy as an actor, for I was young. In this film he may have given the best performance I have ever seen. Throughout the film Plainview is, in one aspect, simple (or ""plain""). Never does he give the appearance of deception, which is I'm sure is his goal as an entrepreneur. He knows what he wants and he knows what he doesn't want (an example would be when he walks away from a prospective oil project in the early moments of the film due to the chaos among the townspeople). Plainview works patiently and smoothly until he gets what he wants. This is obvious in his actions of building the oil rigs and even in the way that he speaks. But when needed to achieve his ultimate goal, he takes violent and even deadly measures. Daniel Day Lewis acts the Plainview character to perfection, even down to his display of impatience for people when he bites his cheeks and moves his mouth about in frustration when in a conversation. I can not even really begin to describe why Daniel Day Lewis was the most believable as I have seen an actor unless you have seen the film, which I suggest any readers who haven't already do right away. As a film, there was no cohesive plot, there was no ongoing score (a trend, along with ""No Country For Old Men,"" that I am thrilled to see, as it accentuates the performances), there was no twist or surprise ending. There was only the deterioration of the humanity of a man and its effects on his family and others. That is why I was stunned as the credits rolled; I knew what was going to happen, but was still captivated nonetheless. In the last scene, all of Plainviews choices made throughout the film are shown to truly make him the man he becomes- evil and unremorseful."
"xwxwxw","Null","2","4","5 February 2008"," All the elements of a Great Film the ending was disturbing.
","I just wanna know, wasn't Eli and Paul the same person ? That wasn't confusing if you like ambiguity however, to me, it left you on the fence, so-to-speak. Never was Paul and Eli shown together, and I'm sure they were the same person. The fight with his Dad, Able, confirmed it. Oh, what a story, so much metaphor. Probably the best I've seen in awhile. This movie had no special effects, no fancy dialog, and nothing philosophical, however the way the Story was so powerful, and the timeline in which the story was told confirms the hardships of the main character. I have to put this on my number one slot for now, until something bumps it off. I doubt Speed Racer will do that. This movie is awesome, profound and meaningful. If you're a religious person, this is the movie to watch. Why ? Cause it will give you insight into what religion is or isn't to you or your church going friends. It's a good movie, and it doesn't mock religion, but gives it a truth rarely seen in today's movie's or in reality."

","There will be blood is widely regarded as an all time classic and in my humble opinion it is. It's a story about greed, faith, family(or lack of),love,religion, loneliness, capitalism and its devastating effects. The movie sort of acts as a critique on capitalism and the means men will go in order to make money.<br/><br/>The story is mostly about two men, Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis) and Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) and the hatred filled relationship between them. They are two sides of the same coin and both of them know it. Daniel is an oil man who is extremely greedy and has lust for power and money and is prepared to go to any lengths to fulfill his wants and all of this is established in one of the greatest openings of all time with barely a word spoken. He adopts the small son of his worker that had recently died in an oil drilling accident. The scene between the baby and Daniel is also a wonderful scene and one of my favorite shots as the baby, white as snow dressed in white as well is cast by the shadow of Daniel, dressed in black and covered with oil and blood. Later Daniel mixes alcohol in the child's drink signifying the mixing of impurity in the innocent child. He adopts not of pity but because he believes people will trust him more if he has a family. He is an extremely charismatic individual who uses his power of speech to win over people. But he is also an atheist and as he says in the film, finds flaws in every person he meets. He later meets his apparent brother who has come looking for him and immediately trusts him and opens his emotional side that we had not seen previously. He he trusts him because of the blood relation or as he puts it ""There is a little of me in you"". That scene between the two of them is a wonderful insight into Daniel's inner soul and the cause of the greed.<br/><br/>On the other hand there is Eli who is a preacher of the church and he does money using religion and basically by swindling others. Daniel hates this. Here is man who is openly swindling the people with bull**** but they believe him. Eli is an opposite of Daniel in that he doesn't work hard at all. This infuriates Daniel. There is always the animosity between them that is the driving force of the movie. They both are the products of capitalism, the earn money at any cost attitude. Daniel considers him his competition and he tries to break him in any ways that he can finally ending in the wonderful finale. Another thing that I loves was the parallels in the baptisms of Daniel and later Eli. You should watch out for it. Also the scenes where Daniel discovers oil is so well directed that when he digs on and on it seems he is piercing Mother Earth and blood is gushing out, indicating another parallel between the two as both are using something beautiful and good to their own selfish needs.
This is about the themes of the movie without giving away the spoilers. Coming to the technical aspects, the movie is gorgeously shot and every frame is a painting. The screenplay is one of the best ever and the music by Greenwood sets the mood of the movie throughout. The biggest positive is the performances of the entire cast especially Daniel Day Lewis who brings to life one of the greatest characters ever written and makes it to one of the greatest performances of all time. Paul Dano is also excellent as both Paul and Eli Sunday. PTA is excellent as usual. The long takes were really brilliant as the editing was top notch and increased the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>My final advice is try to see the movie at least twice as the characters are too deep and complex. The first time I watched it I was underwhelmed as the themes went over my head and more importantly I couldn't understand the two main characters. But after watching it 3 times, I have come around to appreciate it more and now it sits firmly on top of my favorite movies of this century so far. A must watch!!"

","There Will Be Blood (2007) :
Brief Review -<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is the only preservation for this slow paced madness and secretive ride. There are people who completely hated this film and there are people who loved it totally, that's scarce. We don't see such films often which are either fully hater or totally loved but There Will Be Blood could be an exception because of the destructive yet mesmerising content it has. The film is about a silver prospector and his variational life focusing on his madness, greed, sins and religious hatred or belief (whatever you prefer after watching the film). There is not much wrong in the overall script but still the film is hated because it is slow paced and doesn't provide much screen space to the main content. On the other side, in a very short period of precisely 12 to 15 minutes in the climax it takes the film on high level and many people loved that part. I am somewhere in the middle now as i liked the way it ended and justified the overall context but i hated slow pacing too. Daniel Day Lewis is without any doubt the best thing happened to There Will Be Blood. Second and Third best things are Cinematography and Direction respectively. May be it could have been trimmed better especially in the first half which took too much time just to introduce and link all the characters of the film. Lot of mistakes were solved and covered in the second half and then Top Notch climax finished the job for the film. This is certainly a watchable film even in most negative talk because who knows one might find it subtle and profound which others couldn't find. You have power-packed performance of Daniel Day Lewis as a preservative already, so give it a watch to decide which side you are on. This is more a critic friendly film than being audience friendly hence you need to make a choice before giving it a chance. You can't expect an entertaining and light film so better be aware.<br/><br/>RATING - 7/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

","""There Will be Blood"" is dripping with Innovative ideas, an amazing character study and visually excellence. A devastating and unsentimental portrayal of a man with initial hatred towards humanity, whose endless greed eventually destroys him from within. An extremely heartbreaking story of a mans social life ruined by his own stupidity and evil. Despite not really knowing what motivates him and why he is who he is, Paul Thomas Anderson's, with some clever tricks, creates a tremendous depth in the protagonist and his destructive actions. Thus frames an epic and grand, not flawless but impressive, modern masterpiece of a movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Planview is a very interesting and nuanced character, primarily thanks to Daniel Days Lewis's legendary role interpretation which may be the foremost of the whole story. Each meaning and gesture is totally unique and skillfully crafted. Paul Dano also makes a brilliant performance as the town priest, by balancing insanity and faith in an unbelievable way."
"gbill-74877","8","0","0","26 June 2020"," Greed and fundamentalism
","A story which shows us a couple of the pillars America was founded on, unabashed greed and religious fundamentalism. Paul Thomas Anderson really transports us to the oil fields of the late 19th century, and the performance from Daniel Day Lewis is stellar, leading a very strong cast. The film reminded me of 'Citizen Kane' in its scope of an ambitious man's life, from the early days of finding his fortune to fighting and clawing his way to riches, and 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' in how greed perverts his soul. Its epic feel and high production quality certainly make it worthy of being discussed among such great old films.<br/><br/>I found the relationship between the misanthropic oilman (Lewis) and a faith healer (Paul Dano) fascinating; both seem like flim flam men who manipulate the crowds around them, and their gamesmanship shows itself in a need to dominate and humiliate the other. The oilman is the apex predator in his world, but looming are the bigger fish of Standard Oil and the robber barons who threaten to snap him up. I'm not sure the story is quite as good or as well told as the beautiful cinematography and excellent acting, but the film was interesting for all of its 158 minutes. In the end, where does all of the battling and wealth accumulation lead in a man's life? And can one be successful in the capitalist world and remain a humanist? This film gives answers that are as dark as that pool of oil spewing out of the earth."

"adeckofcards","10","0","0","17 June 2020"," Blood and ambition
","Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best contemporary directors, a fact that he strongly confirms in 'There will be blood'. A film that tells the story of an ambitious man in search of oil wells, who will do everything to achieve his goal.
Under such a simple premise, Anderson shows us its great quality. An extremely detailed care is appreciated at the staging level, with long shots that are absolutely stunning and attention to detail. Although his true achievement turns out to be the way in which he manages to show on the screen the total decline of a man in such a direct way. Evil, religion, ambition and family are the column that sustains the story, and not only the story, but also the main character, who is brought to life in a monstrous way by Daniel Day Lewis in one of his better roles.
Paul Thomas Anderson should be applauded for daring to portray ambition and capitalism against faith and God Himself so vividly and directly, where the fluidity of the narrative sacrifices itself in order to explore the interior of the characters through of a direction without equal."

The oil mine owner played by Daniel in the film is lonely and free, living with a strong intuition, cruel, aggressive and never forgiving. The lens performance is also straightforward without modification. So rough life, so rough life. Human nature is sharpened in the meantime, becoming harder and darker, unable to see the original appearance. It's rare to have two or three soft spots in the film, which are embedded in the dark darkness of the whole piece, making people linger."

I was so wrong. But be warned the film is not exactly a happy viewing. There will be blood is about the fictional Oil prospector Daniel Plainview played to absolute perfection by Daniel Day-Lewis in my personal favorite performance by him. He is truly incredible in this film. There Will Be Blood delves deep into Daniel's psyche as greed and power overcome him throughout the course of the film as he try's to take control of his surroundings as well as those around him as he battles the preacher Eli who is also played to perfection by Paul Dano. Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of his craft creating an intense, gripping and brutal story out of something so mundane as Oil. His direction is magnificent, with a particular moment when things at the oil well go wrong, truly showing the audience his skill as a film maker.

","Anderson creates another masterful drama and does Upton Sinclair's novel, ""Oil"" justice. This film has excellent direction, score, cinematography, screenplay, editing and acting. The entire cast deliver superb performances. Day-Lewis and Dano are sensational. The plot revolves around a former silver miner, Daniel Plainview turned ruthless oil baron. Plainview adopts a son H.W. to project a family man image but more importantly to help him in the conning of local landowners who don't realize the value of the property they own. When a local preacher Eli Sunday becomes suspicious of the oil man, a life long battle ensues which threatens each man's life. Day-Lewis creates one of the most cunning, vicious and hateful villains ever on film. The film does an outstanding job examining the affects of greed and power. Is wealth the key to a fulfilled life or is it the key to a self absorbed life and insanity? The film also scrutinizes family dynamics within the Plainviews. The plot is dark, clever, psychological, unique, violent, insightful, harrowing and has a brutally duplicitous ending. This is one of Anderson's top three films and is an ingenious film in it's genre."

The script is quite good, except, at places, it tumbles e.g: The lost journey of how Daniel turns an alcoholic, what happens to the town and the promises that Daniel made and of course, the abrupt ending.

We just watch at a man in a mine, searching for the great find. The following scene we get an introduction of himself.<br/><br/>Both scenes together build the base for the remaining 130 minutes, in which countless of topics get processed. Some of them are the pursuit of happiness, believing into the american dream as well as the meaning of god, greed and hate, furthermore the relationship between father and son, trust and strokes of fate and so on...<br/><br/>So this is the point: ""There Will Be Blood"" is not about an oilman who gets erode by his greed and his son, who suffers from an accident. This would surely still be a great movie. But this film is soo much more. It's a life learning lesson in all its beauty in force and harshness.<br/><br/>No annoying hollywood happy end crab, brainless action and a plot for idiots. No, just some characters in a simple story, showing some depth and do not get overrun by the story, but by life.<br/><br/>In addition it is a unbelievable performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, he is probably the best character actor, but also excellent played by Paul Dano and Dilon Freasier.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>DD Lewis owned this character. One of a cold-hearted and hyper-driven oil prospector. He became this character who lets nothing stand in the way of his next deal or progress towards wealth. His performance was accentuated by outstanding editing, camera movement and punctuated by an evocative music score. The film follows from what I assume was his first oil discovery in 1898 through his successes including life hurdles that he just kicks down rather than overcome. The crux of the film is watching how his character is paralleled by a youthful preacher whom he encounters through a land deal. Both characters have their flaws, which are exposed through a similar lens and highlighted many times as their paths often cross. It is intriguing to see how they both gain notoriety and attain notable levels of success despite their flaws and to see their lives follow a similar trajectory. Deep down it becomes unnerving to see what humans will do for their personal competitive victories. The end seemed to need a bit more meat to paint the picture that attempted to do. Overall, a stellar achievement on all cinematic fronts."

","There Will Be Blood is an absolute amazing and intense film with a great performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as anti-hero Daniel Plainview. This is a gripping story with family, religion, greed, and milkshakes.<br/><br/>Many people say that Daniel Day-Lewis gives the only good performance in the film, but Paul Dani also gives a great performance as Eli Sunday.<br/><br/>The movie is about an oil prospector named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). He dosen't care about ANYONE except himself. When one of his workers die he adopts his son H.W, and uses him as a prop to make him feel like he's a nice family man, when he's actually a ruthless monster. And that's all I'll say about it, because I don't want to spoil it, because if you haven't seen this movie, see it.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar for best actor, and he deserved it because his performance is so convincing and amazing, that it's scary. He's the only actor ever to win 3 oscars.<br/><br/>This film seems heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick, due to the music at the end, the atmosphere, the hidden and mysterious messages that go over your head, and Plainview beats Eli Sunday the exact same way the apes beat up the skeleton with the bone in 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think the reason why is because the director Paul Thomas Anderson actually met Stanley Kubrick. And he was nice Paul Thomas Anderson when he found out he directed Boogie Nights, but he was much nicer to him when he learned he wrote it.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece and really wonder what Paul Thomas Anderson does next."

","The film crawls open with Johnny Greenwood's ominous score , and then never lets up. ""There Will Be Blood,"" brutally exposes the hypocrisies of business and religion, and how their goals are not much different. The film follows Daniel Plainview and his interactions in Southern California that lead to him drilling oil in a small town. The most interesting elements of the film are the interplay between Dano and Day Lewis, and Plainview's relationship with his son. On one hand, we have a ruthless, misanthropic, oil tycoon who wants to drink the town's ""milkshake."" On the other we have a young, charismatic, aspiring evangelist who wants to take advantage of his town's guest, extorting him for money to build a new church. The oil tycoon wants nothing to do with anyone in the town, he just wants the oil. The priest just wants glory. Their conflict resolution is unexpected, but gratifying. <br/><br/>The character study of Daniel Plainview shows a man who gains power and influence, while simultaneously losing all patience for anyone else who he perceives as a threat or competitor. Plainview's character arc literally starts with him rescuing a baby, and ends with him....well..<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is the 2nd best film that I have ever seen. The musical score, the acting from Daniel Day Lewis, the screenwriting and honesty from PTA, and cinematography make this film more than just a good character study, it's an instant classic."

However, as the movie reaches its later stages, you begin to see the layers of Plainview's personality, and his true, single-minded desire for success and money at the expense of all others. Religion and Plainview's manipulation of Paul Dano's character was excellent, and I thought both the script and performances in the final two scenes with Dano and with Plainview's son were exceptional.

Daniel Day-Lewis is so perfect as Daniel Plainview SO PERFECT (what a surprise lol) that I hung up on every word and every silence of his, we saw him get the success and the solitude he craved for then saw him pay the price by losing his humanity and PT Anderson did such an outstanding job directing this movie that I couldn't lift my eyes from the screen during two and a half hours and it stuck with me with its poignant dark themes perfectly and subitly dilevered such as American ambition, family, religion, and Materialism.

","There is a fine line between what makes a good movie and what makes a great movie. Was it the vocally mute 20-minute intro sequence (a la 2001: A Space Odyssey) which ended up being just as enthralling and encapsulating as the last climatic 20 minutes? Was it the stunning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano? Was it the perfectionist-level detail that put the plaque on their teeth and the grime underneath their fingernails? Was it the soul-crushing script on the corruption of wealth, the fool's errand which is salvation, and the abuse of the poor? Who can tell but God (if he's not a superstition), but somewhere amidst the 2.5 hour runtime, There Will Be Blood succeeds at becoming a sure contender at several best-of lists. I suppose a good way to find a more definitive answer would be to imagine if this script were handed to any lesser director and cast and see how their product would compare to P.T. Anderson's masterpiece here. Oh, the religious symbolism is too strong, that child performance wasn't quite convincing enough, this is just old-time Breaking Bad. But in the correct hands, the oil wells stand tall, domineering, and admonishing like crosses, Dillon Freasier's performance was on par with the adults, and having seen this movie now, I think Breaking Bad is just a modern There Will Be Blood. All the gears were well oiled and cranking together and it just so happened to come together so perfectly. The cinematography lent itself to some beautiful shots, symbolic framing, and a personification of the environment almost as if it were a character too. The powerfully and torquey filmmaking kept this film chugging on tracks faster and faster and it stayed interesting over the ballsy length. It found refreshing ways for people to be despicable to one another, which is always nice, and the take on the classic King Midas touch folktale was interesting as well. And it seems to be as relevant today too more than a decade after its release with conglomerate corporations and megachurches running amok. I don't know how to leave it; I can't find any critiques, no matter how minor. This is certainly a film to go down in history and I think its flawless character certainly justifies that. What more is there to say?"

"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","23 November 2017"," Sit on down & drink your milkshake! 'There will be blood' is a film worth watching!
","2007's 'There will be Blood' is truly the 'Citizen Kane' for the modern age. While, both movies are similar in many ways when it comes to, the negative dealing of capitalism and its inherent trouble of greed. 'There will be Blood' takes the concept into a darker shade of black with its main character, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), loosely based on historic oil tycoon, Edward L. Doheny, on his ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Without spoiling the film, too much, all I'm going to say, is Plainview does nearly everything horrible to gain success, throughout the movie; yet, surprising, there is something that about Plainview, audiences and critics find him, sympatric. Much of that, comes from the fact, that he is hard-working, determine, and down-right charisma. Because of that, while, most people don't condone his brutal misanthropic action, we still admired his ambition of the American Dream, even if it's bit morally dirty. Another reason, why people tend to like, Plainview, is the fact, that Daniel Day Lewis's acting is astonishing good, with his use of his tone and body language. He impresses us a lot, on how well, Plainview is, in being a master debonair con artist, when it comes to portraying himself as a family man, when it's outright not true. Also, while, the movie doesn't have much of the offbeat humor that Anderson's previous movies, is know for; the way, Plainview coolly lay down brutal mean-spirited insults and threats to weaker, secondary characters was bit humorous, even if it's technically, highly considered as highly offensive bullying. Sometimes, we just happen to like the villain, because in a way, deep inside us. We, too, have a dark side, wanting a bit of power over others. As a result, we, the audience end up having conflicting feelings towards Lewis's character, rather than hating Plainview, downright. No wonder, why he won the Oscar that year. Regardless, I have nothing, against people who think Plainview is just too unlikeable to watch. Like I said before, he does nearly everything sinister on his rags to riches story. Nevertheless, it's still weird that the film was inspired by author, Upton Sinclair's 1926's novel, 'Oil!' Yet, the novel has nothing really to do with the self-made millionaire. Instead, the book focus on the only son of that man. While, most of the changes were, for the greater good. I still wonder, what if, they kept all the socialists provoke arguments throughout the story. The movie might had been a little bit better. Nevertheless, that wasn't the problem with this movie directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The delinquent about this historical drama is the pacing. It's a very slow built. Certain scenes seem to drag on, a little too long for my taste, such as the chat with his, 'supposedly' brother, Henry (Kevin J. O' Connor). Honestly, the director could had cut it, and we would still end up, with the same results. The scene wasn't really needed, but I guess, they really wanted to do the Cain Vs Abel comparison. Don't get me wrong, those sequences weren't bad. It just that the baptizing and confession scenes between biblical-like holy spiritualism vs devilish materialism conflict between Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) and David Plainview sermons was a little bit, better. I like, how both men are fighting for the rights for the town and each other's souls using their industrial and religious powers as tools. It's cool to see that Daniel's business was his religion, and Eli's religion was his business. While, some of their monologue can be, a bit wordy. Most of the dialogue & speeches, they perform, adds to already otherwise meaningful story. The baptizing and confession scenes are perfect examples. Even, the speech at the bowling alley, toward the end was powerful. Kel O'Neill, the original actor for Eli, left halfway through production due to being intimidated by Daniel Day-Lewis during the original filming of the bowling alley scene. Hearing that, proves that those scenes weren't a gutter. It was an authoritative strike. Another great thing, about this film is the camera work. The cinematography that, Paul Thomas Anderson & Robert Elswit did with their crew, was amazing. The film use of bleak desaturated colors was also profound. It made the film's gritty historic account of the time period, seem a little more real. It was dirty looking, but not too ugly. It had the right balance. Even the film score that went along with the visuals from composer Jonny Greenwood, work for the most part. It gave off, an astonishing eerily, creepy vibe that mirror, what's happening on screen. I just wish, he didn't use so much of his own recycled music, from a previous score from the 2003's 'Bodysong' documentary. It made the film, less unique & more generic. It's music, you likely to hear, in hundreds of old-school Gothic horror movies. Nevertheless, some of the recycled music that Greenwood, use, wasn't that bad; such as the case of classical cues. This film gave new life to composer Johannes Brahms's 'Violin Concerto' music. It was epic composition to end an epic film. Overall: All of this, parts was indeed a risky move for Anderson, as 'There will be Blood' was a dramatic shift in both tone and visual style from his previous works such as 1997's 'Boogie Nights' & 1999's 'Magnolia'. Away was the bright vibrant colors with catching uplifting tunes. Now, it was astonishing down to earth ground with a hellish tone that is also deep. For the most part, it kinda work. While, 2007's Coen Brothers crime masterpiece, 'No Country for Old Men' won Best Picture that year at the Academy Award. 'There will be Blood' proves that it was a fighting contender, and that Oil is indeed thinner than water. It's a must watch for anybody that loves movies."
"tyson-hunsaker","9","0","0","28 August 2017"," An outstanding and tragic masterpiece of greed, deception, and ambition.
","Paul Thomas Anderson has created a standard to filmmaking that's difficult to match in ambition, scope, and emotional impact. To be frank from the beginning, There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece of superior storytelling not to be forgotten. This was a joy to watch having never seen it when it was released and barely hearing hints of it's content. Walking in with completely fresh eyes was definitely the right decision because I finished this film quite speechless. <br/><br/>One of the film's strongest areas is without a doubt, Daniel Day Lewis that leads the cast. His performance was absolutely breathtaking from start to finish with moments of ""he can't be an actor he feels so real."" This could arguably be his best performance and definitely is unforgettable. Hopefully Lewis's performance doesn't overshadow the rest of the cast's wonderful performance especially Paul Dano's equally egotistical and deceptive performance. <br/><br/>Anyone looking to study cinematography look no further because it's impossible to take your eyes off every frame in this perfectly crafted picture. Every shot captures the feeling of the story from sweeping wide shots of the dusty desert of the west to uncomfortable close ups of characters capturing resonate emotion from each line of dialogue. P.T. Anderson manages to expertly craft this film through technical perfection to immerse the audience into the story and the character's deep and dark spiral into selfishness, greed, and hatred.<br/><br/>The story is a new great modern tragedy that feels so applicable in a world where ""success"" can drive a man to become something less than human. As we see this gradual but visible change in Daniel, we take the journey with him through hell. <br/><br/>While I believe There Will Be Blood is phenomenal, I do believe some plot elements could've been explored in greater detail to further some more themes that were apparently trying to say to the audience. Given the over 2 and a half hour run time of the picture however, it makes sense nothing more was added. The pacing did feel quite natural (minus some inconsistencies in the first act that made things slow), and while not every character arcs were necessarily completed, the main two contrasting characters arcs left for a deeply emotional ride with satisfying conclusions. I dare say they share one of the best endings (and ending lines) to a film I've ever seen. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood deserves to be seen and directed as much as the mind will allow. There's unmatchable depth and layers to this phenomenal film and is highly recommended."
"ThomasDrufke","9","0","0","8 April 2014"," Legendary Day-Lewis Performance
","There are few actors who can repeatedly make a repellent character still engaging and do it effortlessly. I would say only DiCaprio and De Niro can do it as good as Daniel Day-Lewis. The man is a legend in film history, and his portrayal as Daniel Plainview will easily go down as one of the greatest performances of all time. While I believe his 'Butcher' character in Gangs of New York is more entertaining and re-watchable, it's this haunting performance that may outlive any of his other characters, including his recent portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>Right from the opening sequence the music engages you into this tale of a man full of hatred and greed. Even in the first 15 minutes which feature very little dialogue, you get a sense of the tone and the overwhelming theme of madness that goes along with Daniel. The movie is most definitely filled with memorable performances, and it is a memorable film. I wouldn't even say the movie is too long, which is what most people complain about. Day-Lewis captures you with every scene, and makes you feel as though these actors were actually living in this era. I was also shocked at it's few moments of violence, especially towards the end. Because the movie is just detailed as a Drama, the violence comes as a complete surprise. Paul Dano shows us his young talent and his ability to perform with the greats, and not even be overshadowed by the great Daniel Day-Lewis. I also found his son to be quite thrilling in his tragic role.<br/><br/>Minor complaints include the sometimes bombastic score. There were times it overshadowed the dialogue, which for this type of movie is bothersome. When you have a character piece, I want the music to compliment and not overpower the actors.<br/><br/>I cant say I will ever remove the final scene from my head, and I can't say I will ever want to watch this movie again because of how disturbing it can be. There Will Be Blood is truly one of the most memorable movies of the past decade and a true work of art. It deserves a place as a great cinematic achievement.<br/><br/>9.0/10"

Lewis' performance caused him to not only replace my number one actor, but the top two or three because I think this performance is unparalleled. The acting, cinematography, and score combine to make for a great film experience, however the plot had a major flaw that bothered me: Daniel struggles to communicate with the deaf H.W., but why would that be so? Based on how he cared for H.W. throughout the movie, a man of his means would have educated his ""son"" to read and write, so why didn't he just write to communicate with the deaf child?"

","There Will Be Blood is said to be Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece by many but I think of it as just a good film done by a great director. The film may grow on me in time, as it did in my second viewing, but my review will be based after my second viewing. This is like Apocalypse Now where as I watched it over and over it started to become better and better.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson is director as well as a writer. His writing here is good but not great. The plot of this film is a miner, Daniel Plainview, who struck oil and became a rich man out of it, he then made it his business to drill and harvest the oil around America. His jackpot was this area in Little Boston, which had an ""ocean full"" of oil, and wanted to create a pipeline to the sea. There is also conflict and competition between Daniel and the preacher Eli Sunday. The film is like a rise and fall story of Daniel Plainview, at first we like him as he is just a poor man with nothing trying to scrape silver to gain some money and then as his ambition and empire grew, he became a horrible man obsessed with greed and power. The story is interesting and at times I think Daniel Plainview is similar to Barry Lyndon. For the most part it was interesting and entertaining but there are small moments where I felt the film just misfired, and that is the scenes with his brother. It is an important plot point as it shows a side Plainview we have never seen but I felt it wasn't executed well. The competition between Eli and Daniel was the best part of the film, to see whether who's ambition would win over the other. Both compete for the community's support either through Eli's faith and sermons or through Daniel's oil that could allow there city to flourish and gain wealth. The climax is a moment that is driven through just dialog but it was done really well that waiting 2 hours for it is worth it.<br/><br/>This is my first Paul Thomas Anderson film and I did have the bar set up high for this film. It didn't meet my expectations but it was good enough for me to watch his other films, in particular The Master. I like the fact Anderson took the time to explore many areas in Plainview's life like his relationship with his son, his past, his struggles at the start. Anderson wanted this film to be slow and patient in order to flesh out the character enough and give us an impression that this man is not what he used to be.<br/><br/>Robert Elswit, the film's director of photography, has brought his style from Michael Clayton in this film. It takes it's time with shots allowing for performances to stand out more. The film also doesn't try to be flashy or pretty but rather just appropriate in the time period they are trying to create. I think the best moments that was captured on this film was the burning derrick scene. It was done beautifully and gives us an indicator that what lies ahead is not going to be good.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see that Jonny Greenwood did the score for this film. I've only really known him as the guitarist in Radiohead but he really made take notice in this film. The music is eerie and dark, and sometimes quite simple. I like the fact that the film did not take a grand orchestra kind of feel and decided to keep it light but impactful.<br/><br/>The acting was one of the highlights of this film. I have never seen a film by Daniel Day Lewis before watching this and he played this tortured man well. The finest moment in the film for Lewis is the climax where he and Paul Dano (Eli) is driven by regret, anger and betrayal. Dano was great in the film, especially in his sermons where lets it all out. The supporting cast were also good but the focus is really on the main two, and also Plainview's son (H.W. Plainview played by Dillon Freasier).<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a film that needs repeated viewings and requires patience in order to appreciate it. It contains strong performances and good cinematography and also an excellent score from Greenwood. Anderson's screenplay may have moments that I personally do not like but has enough gems in there to keep me entertained.

","There's no doubt the DDL thrives on epic roles and the part of Daniel Plainview is no exception. He spent a year preparing for the role and used oral histories to perfect the delivery of the character of a turn of the century prospector who ultimately makes it big. However, while the film contains brilliant performances from the star and supporting cast, the script, loosely based on real life events, proves strangely unsatisfying and peters out with an ending that somehow hovers between Howard Hughes and a Clockwork Orange. If the final 20 minutes of the movie had lived up to the promise of the first part it would have got a 10, as it is, an ultimately unfulfilling film."

","Based upon the novel by Upton Sinclair, Oil is the story of a ruthless man, Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis in his John Huston mimicking role). Daniel discovers an oil field in 1902, the early days of the boom which enriched a few men, like John D. Rockefeller, and others. One of Plainview's workers is killed in an accident and he is adopted by the ambitious prospector, named H.W., and made his partner. <br/><br/>Plainview buys land from Paul and Eli Sunday, for its' oil reserves. Eli is a preacher who wants to use the money to build a church. They find oil and an explosion occurs, which deafens H.W. A man shows up, claiming to be Daniel's half-brother. He asks for a job, and H.W. sets his bed on fire, trying to kill him. His father sends him to a boarding school in San Francisco. Standard Oil makes an offer on Daniel's interests, but he makes a deal with Union to build a pipeline to California. Meanwhile, Henry admits that he is pretending to be related, and that his real half-brother died. Danny boy kills him and buries the body. He later joins a church of holy rollers to further a land deal.<br/><br/>Years later, H.W. has married, and his father has become very wealthy, but reclusive, living alone in a huge mansion. His son asks him to release his partnership, so that he can have a company of his own. Daniel refuses, and this results in a tragic confrontation. Day-Lewis is great, but at over two and a half hours, I was exhausted by the time it finished."

","OK, I'm likely to be in the minority here, but I just came home from a screening tonight, and I really disliked this movie. The main reason is Daniel Day Lewis's completely unspontaneous performance - every look, every gesture, every over-enunciated word maddened me. It is the complete opposite of what good acting should be. Sometimes an over-the-top performance can be appropriate, but Mr. Day Lewis's acting style here was pitifully ill-conceived. And what kind of accent was he trying for? It was not an American accent I've ever heard before, most particularly not for a character that was supposed to be from Wisconsin.<br/><br/>And the music score!! Completely inappropriate for the time and place of the story. The lead performance and the annoying music score made me almost want to run out of the theatre screaming, but I will admit that there were some redeeming qualities; the cinematography, production design, and costumes were excellent."
"Chris Knipp","10","6","21","27 December 2007"," Paul Thomas Anderson's stunning epic of ego and greed
","Using as a starting point Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil!' but deriving his hero also from Von Stroheim's silent classic, 'Greed,' based on Frank Norris' novel, 'McTeague,' Anderson has made an epic set in the first quarter of the twentieth century about one overweaning and titanically determined individual whose life is dominated, whether he chooses or not, by America's two great obsessions: money and religion.<br/><br/>The scarily intense actor Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a self-made millionaire who gets rich as an oilman so he can put distance between himself and people, the majority of whom he hates with a ferocity equaling his ambition. His enemy/doppelganger/nemesis is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) a young healer/preacher who draws his congregation from the inhabitants of Plainview's oil drilling land. Mysteriously, Sunday's identical brother Paul (also Dano) is the one who shows up early on and persuades Plainview to pay him a tidy sum to know where his family's land is, because there is a lot of oil boiling up on it. This leads to the series of claims and land-grabs that occupy the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Plainview has no clear origins. The ultimate self-made man, he emerges from the soil like some primordial creature. We first see him digging for silver, going down into the bowels of the earth and eating dinner crouched like a primate in the opening segment of Kubrick's 2001, which Anderson's haunting prologue, with its wonderful use of the music by Jonny Greenwood that flows through, unmistakably evokes. The film will suggest and draw on many other sources, Stevens' 'Giant,' shot like this near Marfa, Texas, Welles' 'Citizen Kane,' John Huston and his classic film of B. Traven's 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre;' and many more.. An electrical tone dominates the air as if the whole landscape were alive with some terrible unknown power--the power to be exploited, dominated, but a power that can backfire and destroy its exploiters. Plainview's relation is with the land, to take its riches and make himself rich. People are to be dealt with and told whatever story convinces them to do what he needs. He is a character so cold and inhuman and intense in his relationship with money that he is ready for one of the deepest bolgias of Dante's Inferno, and sometimes he already seems to be there. Early on, the hero crawls out of the hole he's dug badly injured, sliding along the ground like the damaged mountain climber in the documentary, 'Touching the Void.' It's as if he's been into Hell and come out for a spell, to strut and walk upon P.T. Anderson's stage. As enigmatic as Welle's Charles Foster Kane, we watch him with fear of what he may do next.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis seems to simultaneously declaim and chew his words, as if he wants to spew them out but then bites them back, and thus Day-Lewis draws attention to his every utterance but also gives consistency to a character who otherwise isn't predictable. Strangest of all, for somebody who's such a hostile egomaniac, you wouldn't expect him so often to speak polite, cajoling words. ""I don't like to explain myself"" however is the truest thing he says.<br/><br/>The movie's epic battle is, in a sense, a false one: it's not between God and Mamon, but between Mamon and a tainted, ersatz God, because Eli Sunday is a charlatan, a mountebank. Dano's church scenes are theatrical and absurd but convincing. Anderson is ""great with actors,"" which means letting them open up to their fullest potential and taking risks with them. Dano is a risk, and himself takes risks. Day-Lewis chews up the landscape, mouthing and intoning his every line in what seems an evocation of Huston as Noah Cross in Polanski's Chinatown. He is extreme, but his conviction is so great that he convinces. Even if he didn't, he would be fun to watch from first to last. Life in the old West is life on another, alternate planet where people could and did make their own rules; Anderson's actors make theirs. Strangely, as much as Plainview hates people, he allows himself to be humiliated, when it is necessary to serve his aims. And this is where Eli Sunday comes in.<br/><br/>Though the mood of mystery and potentially of 'There Will Be Blood' is long sustained, Anderson has some history of having trouble with endings and has sometimes resorted to desperate measures to conclude with drama, most notably the plague of frogs in 'Magnolia.' That is a biblical tale, and the Bible is another source: Daniel Plainview is like some Old Testament prophet raining down destruction and reaping gold. In the finale of this film, Anderson relies heavily on Dano, a young and relatively inexperienced actor. Dano is strange and powerful, but somehow as an adversary he seems inadequate, as does the final confrontation between the two men. There is nothing like the magisterial ominousness of the movie's introduction, but that is such a remarkable achievement that it resonates long in the mind. No other movie this year so grips you and holds you riveted in its spell as this one.<br/><br/>And all the way through there are wonderful scenes, mostly out of doors and around oil wells. There are Plainview's tense, teeming meetings with people whose land he wants or cooperation he needs to stake out new claims. The burning geyser is most notable, a sequence whose exact composition and flowing camera movement doesn't keep it from having singular urgency. The man goes around with an innocent-faced boy called H.W. (Dillon Freasier) he has raised from a baby, lacing his bottle with whiskey. H.W. stands silently by in Plainfield's public appearances to make him look like a family man; but there is no wife. Later there is a mysterious man ((Kevin J. O'Connor) who appears saying he's the oilman's half brother. When both these relationships deteriorate, horribly, Plainview is finally alone with his adversaries."
"crculver","6","4","12","18 April 2017"," While I admire P.T. Anderson's attempt at an epic story in this vast canvas of early oil drilling and one man's greed, the film fails to entirely convince
","Released in 2007, THERE WILL BE BLOOD is Paul Thomas Anderson's vision of an oilman driven by greed. The film opens with a long introduction without spoken dialog: in 1898 prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is digging somewhere in the California desert. An accident kills one of Daniel's fellows, and he adopts the dead man's orphaned son. Ten years later, Plainview has a number of successful oil wells going, bringing in thousands of dollars a week, and he generally wins new rights to drill by presenting himself as a decent, family man. ""I work with my son here,"" he says, gesturing at the now older boy (played by Dillon Freasier) who has been named H.W.<br/><br/>As the film settles into its plot, Daniel and H.W. get the rights to drill one huge new oil field by flattering and tricking the people who own the land over it. Daniel is opposed, however, by the young charismatic preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who insists that the oil drilling is unwelcome unless it brings donations and new members to his church. Gradually we see Daniel's greed, attempting to satisfy this rural congregation but really just obsessed with extending his rights over the land.<br/><br/>So greedy is Daniel that family life really means nothing to him: after H.W. is caught near an oil well explosion and becomes deaf, Daniel essentially abandons him, sending him off to a school in San Francisco. Eventually this greed both exalts Daniel to massive wealth and ruins him. Though loosely adapted from Upton Sinclar's novel OIL!, it is hard to see this film as a general critique of capitalist excess when Plainview is the only clearly warped person here. The viewer meets several other people involved in the oil industry in the film, and they seem to be ordinary, decent people. Instead of vaster social themes, P.T. Anderson is content to explore one man's psyche.<br/><br/>THERE WILL BE BLOOD drew critical acclaim, but I was left with mixed feelings. Definitely, English actor Daniel Day-Lewis presents one of the great method-acting performances of all time, utterly convincing as an obsessed California prospector of over a century ago. The production values are excellent and really recreate the world of early oil drilling with its primitive technology (and proneness to accidents). I also admire Anderson's attempt to tell an epic story, and I appreciate that this director doesn't mind letting the running time extend as far as he needs to tell the story.<br/><br/>However, the film is easier to admire than to love. Its feels to me flawed in many ways. The last scene, one of great theatricality and violence, doesn't seem adequately set up by the preceding moments. Secondly, Jonny Greenwood's soundtrack, which draws on avant-garde classical music, is too showy. I'm not bothered by modernism, and indeed I regularly listen to composers to whom Greenwood is often compared and called more audience-friendly. But I found that the soundtrack draws excessive attention to itself instead of smoothly matching the action.<br/><br/>Thus, I would still recommend THERE WOULD BE BLOOD, but I don't think it is an undeniable classic, and its featuring on multiple ""Best of the 2000s"" lists just baffles me."

I can't believe people are giving it a good rating (is it because of the acting? - which was good but nothing spectacular).<br/><br/>Usually the egghead types can get away by saying they love a bad film because it's artsy. However, there is absolutely no deep message, or redeeming value in this movie... so what's there excuse? I read one review that stated that those giving this movie a bad review just can't appreciate good character development. What character development? The main character started out as a selfish asshole, continued to be a selfish asshole throughout the movie, and ended as one - so how did he develop? Yes, a good movie should have it's characters develop, but focusing on the main character without a plot is a snooze-fest. I can't believe I stayed awake throughout this entire movie just for that horrible ending.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of is the politically correct message of bashing Christianity (America's favorite pastime these days).

Then again, there's little development of his character. I find it hard to believe that his performance was worthy of an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Sadly, none of the other characters are properly developed as well. For example, how and, for that matter, why did the preacher go into the ministry?<br/><br/>As social commentary, this movie didn't say anything new and it didn't say it very well.<br/><br/>The musical score, such as it is, is dull and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie if one doesn't want to be bored. I would put it in the same league as ""No Country For Old Men""--dull, lifeless, and over-promoted. Sadly TWBB and NCFOM are symptomatic of the fact that Hollywood no longer knows how to tell stories, let alone make movies.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie about the oil industry and its development over the years, I can recommend ""Giant"" with James Dean's character of Jet Rink being the counterpart to Daniel Day-Lewis's."

And movies don't have to be short. One of my favorite films is Dogville which is over 3 hours long and cannot be called entertaining unless you're a sociopath. But that movie gave me something, made me think, feel, cry, provided anger, redemption, a dark meditation on human condition and much much more...<br/><br/>This movie however, just... What does it give me? If this is about Daniel Plainview, why is it we never understand where this guy is coming from? Is he evil, crazy, alcoholic, competitive... Frankly we don't care.<br/><br/>What little dialogue there is is insipid. Characters are flat, plot is completely missing from the picture for lengthy periods. Was this even edited at all?<br/><br/>If this is a commentary on greed and power and the interplay of big money and religion and whatnot, then it's a very very poor attempt at that too. Those points could have been made with this script and basic elements but TWBB fails in this regard too.<br/><br/>Now everyone gushing about the acting. There were moments, yes. I loved the scene where DP drunkenly yells ""JJJJJJJJ Yes!"" for example. But much of it was staring at stuff and tobacco- related activities that do not develop the character one bit. As for the Eli character, in another movie, the over the top teenage looking crazed pastor could have given a dark, neurotic and bizarre tone to the movie but it just seemed ""off"". Was Dano miscast? Probably but that's not all. It's just that the movie failed to gel in so many ways that I doubt anything could have been done..<br/><br/>The score was interesting but out of sync with the narrative (or lack thereof) for most of the movie. <br/><br/>What a failure of a movie... I cannot recommend this movie to anyone and fail to understand why people are rating this so positively. I can only guess it's a case of the emperor's new clothes.<br/><br/>There is one thing I do like about this movie: That Paul Thomas Anderson has made a better movie with Adam Sandler as the lead actor than with Daniel Day Lewis...

So many directors today over use the camera and editing process in todays approach to film making to the point of interfering with the story that they are trying to tell.The mark of a great director is to tell the story without getting in the way of the story and to take a back sit to it. <br/><br/>Every great film should have the effect of not being made or directed. It should seem as if the film has always been there and that you can not in vision it being created. Classic films as ""The Godfather"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""Citizen Kane"" are examples of films that have that magical sense of not being made or that create there own reality. To me ""There Will Be Blood"" falls into this category of great films. Each one of these films that were mentioned above were all controversial when they were first released due to their extreme originality, and daringness. <br/><br/>I believe that because of the total original way that Paul Thomas Anderson decided to tell his story is one of the reasons that the film is getting such an extreme like and dislike reaction. Any time that a director believes in his vision and is willing to take a chance from the norm of story telling, the reaction is going to be varied and extreme. The fact that ""There Will Be Blood"" is getting such critical acclaim is no surprise to me. The beauty of the film is it's strange, awkward, fresh sense of originality. The genius of the film to me is it's ambiguousness. This factor is what pushes the film to it's greatness. It is not an easy skill to pull off. To write in such a way as to give multiple meaning to the story you are telling and still retain the essence of the story is equivalent to a master magician thrilling an audience. <br/><br/>I am not going to attempt to add my analysis to what the story means to me. That would be like trying to explain a Jackson Pollack painting. That is the beauty of this film to me, is that it can mean so many different things to so many different people.

","It has been quite a while since I saw a film in theaters that I can truly and honestly say, struck me very profoundly in its impact and epic scope. 'There Will Be Blood' completely blew me away when I first saw it and along with 'No Country for Old Men', can arguably be considered as one of the masterpieces of film-making produced this past year. It has the essential elements of a great film in the making and I see that in the future, this movie will be considered as one of Paul Thomas Anderson's greatest achievements.<br/><br/>'There Will Be Blood' is essentially a character-driven film telling the story of Daniel Plainview, a prospector turned wealthy oilman in the early 1900's, and the life-changing events that occur during a 30-year period of his life. It traces the rise and eventual fall from grace of Plainview through the story of his success as an oilman and of the multitude of characters around him such as his son, HW Plainview (Dillon Freasier) and the preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). The movie explores a variety of themes that are as relevant today as they were during the time of Daniel Plainview's rise to fame and fortune at the turn of the 20th century. Greed, ambition, affection, religion, American capitalism, family tradition, trust and other themes dominate the movie in its attempt to unearth how each of these things drive a man in his existence and how it affects his view and perception of life, whether for good or for worse. This is a very ambitious undertaking for a film-maker, since a film of great scope and intention demands a very high level of creativity and artistic vision to fully be realized. In this aspect the movie is very nearly a masterpiece, it gets its strengths from its great ambitions as a motion picture; though it can also be said that this deep ""well"" may very well be the same thing that betrays its weaknesses. Nevertheless, Paul Thomas Anderson still manages to pull it off with grace and great impact. His movie influences can be seen throughout the film and Anderson effectively uses these to remarkable effect as transformed and merged into his own style.<br/><br/>While the writing, art direction and editing are all top notch, several aspects of the film deserve to be singled out for their masterful execution. The cinematography of the movie (by Robert Elswit) is probably the best I've seen this year. The way landscapes and big sceneries are photographed completely capture the essence and feel of the times while the lighting of the actors and their particular scenes enhance the emotional impact and weight of the movie. The musical score is, I must say, very effective, original in its approach and the best use of music in recent memory in a dramatic film to evoke emotion and stir the audience. Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead) has produced a very rich and emotion-laden score which the audiences will find captivating and essential to the whole viewing experience of the movie.<br/><br/>But above all these, the dominating factor in the presentation of the movie is the remarkable performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as the progressively becoming obsessed, paranoid and deranged Daniel Plainview. I have never seen a stronger performance and/or a more realized character as brought out in the screen as Lewis' take on Plainview. The movie has become all the more striking because of Lewis' credible and amazing performance. Even if you're not a fan of these kinds of movies, see 'There Will Be Blood' for Lewis' performance and I'm sure that his haunting portrayal of Plainview will stay with you for days, if not weeks, after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, 'There Will Be Blood' is a remarkable film having the elements of a great cinematic achievement.

"stensson","7","3","8","2 March 2008"," There we go once more
","This movie already has a grand reputation for being epic, including a slight capitalism critic. But the plot is rather average and the epic thing about it is maybe the main character, although he doesn't develop much from the different confrontations he gets into.<br/><br/>That's not Daniel Day-Lewis' fault. He can surely make the ""Gangs of New York""-trip once more and comes out of it with honor. Day-Lewis finds the depths when they're there and doesn't pretend to make anything more out of the character than there is in the script. Or in life.<br/><br/>The great performance however comes from Kevin O'Connor in a rather small but important part. Anyway this movie wouldn't get the seven points it gets from me, without the last scene, which is quite nerve-breaking, but also a great struggle between bad and bad, there you can't foresee the outcome. If the rest of the movie was like that, it might have been a masterpiece."

","There will be Blood is hilariously weird. Daniel Plainview has a screw loose and drags his son to work every day. He gets a red hot tip about where to find lashings of oil.

The pastor of the church is the twin of pre-mentioned tipster who is as big a fruit-loop as Daniel.<br/><br/>Daniel descends into mentalness, until the end scene. This scene is like something out of a pantomime. I loved it, others didn't, the music was by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. His orgasmic crescendos reminiscent of Thom Yorkes yodel-lay-ing at its most depressing.<br/><br/>I could drone on about the cinematography and Daniel Day Lewis's intensity but I'll let others do that."
"DonFishies","7","3","8","3 February 2008"," Beautifully captured, but plagued by length and tone issues
","Going in, I was not exactly sure what to expect of There Will Be Blood. I was never too interested in the film leading up to awards season, but slowly warmed up to the idea of seeing it (if only because of the buzz around Daniel Day-Lewis and the film's eventual Oscar nominations). Yet even a day after seeing it, I am still a bit perplexed about it.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a little hard to describe. At once, it is a frenzy of good and evil themes, centred on a gold miner turned oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). He travels through the southern United States with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), buying up properties and making money off the oil on the land. On a chance tip, he ends up in California on the Sunday ranch, a rich potential source of oil. And here he meets up with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a preacher and prophet in a local church, whose religion is not Plainview's forte.<br/><br/>The film follows from here, as people know, with Plainview's gradual change of heart from a good natured oil man, to a greedy and self-absorbed money maker. It follows a few subplots here and there, but the main focus is on Plainview.<br/><br/>And I think that is where some of the film's problems lie. At 158 minutes, the film has that grand epic aura about it, but the story stalls far too often for it to truly be legendary. I found it only worked in small strands, frequently jumping from time flying right by, to it dragging its heels through the oil. I got bored a few times watching, and for a movie that has more than its share of exciting moments, it truly says a lot. It is bogged down with too much filler for its own good. I realize it had to stay with the whole epic tone, but it just does not stay consistent at all. The subplots, as few as they are, never seem to truly feel resolved or even worthwhile. I really liked the material between Plainview and his son, but the relationship between him and Eli Sunday is never truly explored as well as it should be. For such a strong force in the film, Dano is not given nearly enough to do (even with two roles). When they clash on screen, it is pure magic. But there is not nearly enough of it. And all of the useless moments with Plainview's brother are just that. And for such a coldly serious film (with a rather oddly bizarre score), there were way too many ""funny"" scenes. If the only way to silence the audience is for a character to be brutally murdered, I think there is a problem.<br/><br/>What I did find most interesting about the film was its unique use of action. It takes almost twenty minutes for any cast member to speak (other than a few grunts from Day-Lewis), and all the entirety of the introduction to both Plainview and H.W. is done through movement and sound. It was not something I was used to, especially with a modern American film in 2008, but it brought a certain sense of beauty and majesty to the film. It allows for a lot less to be said about some of these characters, but it also makes for a greater amount of depth to be absorbed. Paul Thomas Anderson could have easily used an immense amount of dialogue (or voice-over like in No Country for Old Men), but the uncommon method works brilliantly for this film. As it goes on, it uses more dialogue, but it still has many focal points built upon speak-free scenes, and almost all of them work more than the last. <br/><br/>The film's art and set direction and cinematography are simply breathtaking. There is a massive amount of detail in every scene, and the massive amount of work bringing to life is awe-inspiring. The one long take involved a flaming oil well is frightening and beautifully captured at the same time. The bright visuals, contrasting with the ever darkening material are just one of the film's strong suits. Anderson has always been a very visual storyteller, and he does not change his ways here. In fact, he matures even further, and gives a great idea of what we should continue to expect from him (and obviously his amazingly talented crew).<br/><br/>Day-Lewis, for all of his acclaim, is really good. Not Gangs of New York good, but good nonetheless. His work here is still miles ahead of the competition, but I think I was just expecting too much. He commands every scene he is in, and he's ridiculously over the top as he seems to pride himself on being (especially in the popular ""milkshake"" scene), but his effortless look throughout the movie looked to me like he just was not enjoying himself at all. His richly layered character is brought to the screen magnificently, but what is the point if you do not get any fun doing it? I was consistently thinking of Bill 'The Butcher' throughout the entirety of the film, and only a handful of times did he ever come close to matching the sharpness and complexity of that character.<br/><br/>I was actually much more impressed by Dano. After Little Miss Sunshine last year, and There Will Be Blood this year, he is truly beginning to make a name for himself. His powerful performance holds its own against Day-Lewis, and he shines exquisitely when it is just him on-screen, or just having Plainview sitting and viewing in the background. I only wish he got more recognition.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a brilliantly captured film that has more than a few problems with its story and tone. It packs some great performances, but just do not go in thinking it will be the best of the year.<br/><br/>7/10."
"3xHCCH","6","3","8","3 February 2008"," Overcooked Masterpiece
","This movie is almost a one-man show. And that one man is Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>At first I thought I was watching a silent movie. The background story of Daniel Plainsview's humble beginning as a silver miner who got lucky hitting an oil deposit and how he adopted the infant son of a worker who got killed in the mine (whom he named HW), was all told in images and music, no dialogue. You knew you were in for a different type of movie. The first words were said only thirty minutes or so into the movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those epic (2 hrs. and 40 minutes, but it certainly felt longer than that) movies about oil. ""Giant"" with James Dean immediately comes to mind, but this movie did not have the gentility of Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. This movie is as dirty and grimy, and ruthless as it gets.<br/><br/>Essentially it depicted how Daniel (with HW in tow) sweet-talks his way with the simple backward folk in order to cheaply get their oil-blessed property. Then, problems arose when Daniel did not want his oil well blessed by the young preacher Eli. From there, misfortunes started to happen, worst of which was when HW suffered total deafness because of an oil rig explosion. Daniel's life was never the same after that. Towards the end, he was a broken drunk rich man, with plenty of unresolved conflict within him, that results in tragic consequences.<br/><br/>I have liked DDL ever since he played the genteel Cecil in ""A Room With A View"". Now, more than 20 years later, DDL is really in an acting tour-de-force in ""There Will Be Blood"". However, I must say that this acting was also flawed in a way. It started out really well, DDL was really very good in those early scenes as an oil speculator. But when religion came into the picture, I felt his acting went over the top, as if it was for a stage play. There was a scene when he had to submit himself to joining the church of Eli, subjecting himself to a ""throwing out the demons"" ceremony in order to get access to a piece of land. And then there was that scene in the end where he used milkshakes as a metaphor for how he had been able to get oil was a case of too much self-conscious acting. The over-acting in these scenes, not only by DDL, but also Paul Dano (who played preacher Eli), was almost humorous in its excess.<br/><br/>I liked this one better than ""No Country For Old Men"" as it had more substance and structure by its writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (of ""Magnolia"" fame). The cinematography was very impressive. The camera work and editing of that big scene of the fateful oil rig explosion that made HW deaf was also very good. The musical score was something else. There was no sweeping music as you would expect from epics like that of ""Dances With Wolves"". Instead there were these seemingly unrelated pieces of music, that do not seem to be appropriate to the scene. It felt experimental in a way. It was interesting though. This movie was clearly trying to be a cinematic masterpiece, but I think its efforts are too obvious and obtrusive. Not bad by any measure, but I think it went a little overboard."

Not for unseemly visuals or underhanded doings (there are plenty, though), but because it is nothing more than a long, hateful picture about a man unworthy of being in EVERY SINGLE shot in a movie as he is in this snoozer. And it is stupid, unfair, and absolutely DULL to put an audience through the ordeal of staring this b@stard down. Not since Scarface have I been so disgusted...and, again, not by the content but rather by the hubris and self-reverence of the director. I mean, at least we knew WHY Pacino was who he was. Not here.

"lhagge","7","3","8","28 January 2008"," I actually think DD-L was not right for this part
","Though I'll probably get flamed for saying this, I don't think Daniel Day-Lewis was right for this part. I should preface my remarks by saying that I see around 30 independent films a year, consider myself a film buff, have studied American Naturalism (of which Sinclair's book Oil! is a part), and unlike many here, actually liked Magnolia. I also have nothing against Daniel Day-Lewis. But I think he was too florid in this role, operatic almost to the point of silliness. Watching the great Ciarin Hinds playing Daniel Plainview's right hand man, you could almost see Hinds saying to himself, ""For God's sake tone it down there, Dan."" I realize PTA was trying to say something about how Daniel Plainview is larger than life, etc., and I also realize that many of the main characters in naturalistic novels come off this way on the page (i.e, McTeague), and that playing naturalistic characters in this over-the-top way has a Hollywood history (Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry), but in this movie I think it was very important for Daniel Plainview to be a bit more subtle. We have to see him not as some obsessed monster who eventually loses all his humanity, but as a human being we can all identify with who goes off the rails. I don't think Day-Lewis accomplishes this. Though we do believe he actually loves HW and Mary Sunday, Day-Lewis plays Plainview as damaged goods from the beginning. He is creepy, and I think it's a little unbelievable that he would be able to snow people so easily with his spiel about leasing or acquiring their land. Though I agree with most here that this movie has many excellent qualities, upon reflection I think I would rather have seen a more subtle actor like Russell Crowe or Christian Bale play this part--I think either one would have made the character more human."
"Craig_McPherson","10","3","8","26 January 2008"," A rich, complex ode to the blackness of the human heart
","In There Will Be Blood, Director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) lays out an expansive ode to greed, avarice, and the darkness of the human heart.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis further cements his credentials as arguably the pre-eminent actor of this generation with his performance as the complexly evil oil baron Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>In typical auteur fashion, Anderson has crafted a movie that opens the door wide to rampant speculation and discussion about character motives and interpretations. As a critic it left me practically wishing I had a discussion group to adjourn to after the screening so I could banter about some of the ideas and impressions it left with me.<br/><br/>In epic, sweeping fashion, the movie charts Plainview's progression from early silver prospector to up-and-coming oil tycoon to full-blown petroleum magnate, and the accompanying shedding of all that is human in Plainview's soul Â– if ever there was any good hidden in there to begin with.<br/><br/>Photographed in breathtaking panoramas and intimate close-ups, Anderson proves he can deftly tell a story with either sharply penned dialog, or long complex scenes where no word is uttered.<br/><br/>The crucible of the story begins to unfold when the emerging oil baron is approached by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who, for a price, offers Plainview a tip regarding the untapped oil on his family's homestead. Plainview follows up and ends up brokering a deal for the Sunday farm with Paul's ""brother"" Eli, himself a tinderbox of egotistical avarice who is enticed by the lure of oil money as a way to lay the foundation for his own warped and twisted religious church-building ambitions. In a move that I found ripe for debate, Anderson leaves open the possibility that Paul and Eli, both played by Dano, may in fact be one person beset by a split personality disorder; something which, if true, would only lend to the dark complexity of the film. I found this aspect most intriguing and worthy, in and of itself, of repeat viewing.<br/><br/>Being a man who openly professes to seeing no good in anyone, Plainview immediately sees Eli as an obstacle on his path to riches, with each becoming the other's nemesis.<br/><br/>In fact, the only person to whom Plainview shows any trust, love or compassion, is his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) whom he at times relies upon as a prop to affirm himself as a good old-fashioned family man when negotiating with homesteaders to swindle them out of their land. But even this aspect of Plainview's personality is layered with rich complexity. Throughout much of the movie Plainview appears to show unquestionable affection for his son, yet when an accident robs the child of his hearing, which in turn elicits emotionally traumatic behavior from the boy, Plainview finds himself incapable or unwilling to deal with the child and has him sent away.<br/><br/>Such are the richness of details in Anderson's screenplay, itself based loosely upon Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel ""Oil"". Plainview's distrust and compulsive adversarial relationship with all who cross his path culminate in a cacophony of madness during two final encounters in his twilight years with his adult son, and the re-emergent Eli Sunday, during which Anderson draws a parallel between Plainview and the Antichrist, culminating with Plainview's dark, Christ-like final line ""I'm finished"".<br/><br/>Such is the fate of the human soul when all that is good is sublimated and sacrificed like so much lamb's blood at the altar of greed and avarice."
"hjyguy","7","3","8","24 January 2008"," There was..... only Daniel Day Lewis's charisma
","Maybe I have gotten so used to Hollywood action blockbusters that I have just lost any sense to appreciate a very fine, sophisticated movie. Or, maybe There Will Be Blood simply failed to deliver the message it sought. I don't know.<br/><br/>Or, maybe I am just annoyed that after spending more than two hours of my time, I didn't get a good, satisfying, and titillating climax. To make a bad analogy, after watching the movie I felt like last summer when I invested a whole month's time and a good deal of money on some lady I was attracted to at first sight, only to find out in the end that there can be less than meets the eye.<br/><br/>I concede that the two hours went by without bore or snore. That is because I was thinking I was gonna get something if I persevered. But in the end, all I got was the only thing they couldn't fail to deliver, Daniel Day Lewis's mesmerizing acting and charismatic voice, although, I admit I would gladly trade two hours of mine for any kind of role DDL plays.<br/><br/>I now think my biggest disappointment is that I wished dearly to like Daniel Plainview. I wanted him to be a hero, doing something extraordinary or maybe become betrayed and get a deeply satisfying revenge. Or at least be a decent love story. But no no, there are no heroes in this movie. Its all about reality and how sick it can be, especially when the main character in the movie doesn't have convincing depth of character. To me, the movie failed to either make me like or hate the characters. It was all too remote, too detached, and too fragmented. Good acting can go a long ways, especially in the Academy Awards, but it alone does not win the heart of the viewers; it needs a good plot to begin with. <br/><br/>Will someone do Daniel Day Lewis justice and give him the role of his career, which I wish is yet to come, given his skill and talent?"

","A familiar subject of great films (Stroheim's ""Greed""; Welles' ""Citizen Kane"") the result of capitalism (in extremis) drains the humanity from an individual just like Daniel Plainview drains the oil fields of California. Here, capitalism is competing with religion (a Protestant, uniquely American variety). The preacher seeks to drain something different from the Land and instead of bathing the world in oil, Baptismal blood will do. It's a particularly stunning metaphor for this particular time in the American experience.<br/><br/>Given the ground that has already been paved by previous works on this subject Paul Thomas Anderson is perhaps freer to focus on other aspects of this fall into the abyss. Stripped of any nod to the popular crowd, a radical score, no ""love interest,"" not a lot of time is spent on adding up sums of money and what it buys. We just see souls wither and the act the title promises fulfilled.<br/><br/>It's a strange, fascinating experience in the theater to watch this film. Every aspect of film-making here is exceptional, but it's the story told that parches the viewer. The heightened sense of realism makes what we see instantly familiar yet we dread what will come next.<br/><br/>This film ends very much the same as Stroheim's ""Greed"" and Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" ends. Meglomanicas never renounce their sins and atone. They fall, and in this film they fall hard.<br/><br/>In a year of some really magnificent films, this one tops my list, and time, I believe, will hold it with esteem."

","Having only seen the trailer for this film on an excursion to see ""no country for old men"", i bear intense anticipation for this film, and it's analogous relevance. An all-American, conservative, free-market oil-barren at odds with a religious figure seems all-too-relevant today, especially considering the fact that - in my understanding - neither comes out the winner. <br/><br/>The film - quite intelligently - forms it's stance on one side of a political argument, strategically more powerful, relevant and intrinsically more affecting here than within any stale form of two-sided, played-out, democrat vs. republican narrative, as is most common in a plot such as this. It is this that provides an unpolitical guise, while continuing to lend insight into the negative results of a culture that exists primarily on a take-what-one-can mentality.<br/><br/>I truly cannot wait to see what happens, and i am quite pleased to have an advanced screening pass. The plot-line and development seems confidently complex and critical, and will hopefully have every side asking questions at film's end. <br/><br/>One only has to view the trailer to see that this FILM is amongst the most brilliantly constructed testaments within the u.s.-based industry in the past number of years. The sheerly chilling beauty in the pairing of the ice-y, stalking music to the absolutely beautiful, equally chilling imagery lends credence to the impact that the film ought to have. <br/><br/>if nothing else, the film will look great. If as visually impactful as it appears, it should transcend the conscious presence of political narrative and rhetoric, and deeply affect the viewer as to the complexities of the ruling, powerful class that arose in the united states within the focused time period. This - through the observance of other reviews - seems to have been achieved.<br/><br/>A true GOLDEN EAGLE, if you will, of American film, as it appears. to hell with Scorsese and his hinderingly vague nouvelle appropriations.<br/><br/>on a scale of 1 to APOCALYPTO, this movie will surely be at least a 27."

","I think that this is a guy film. It has all the requisite brutality, murky barren settings, a lot of oozing mud, a paucity of character development, a baby appearing out of nowhere and a couple of head-slapping scenes. Tom Cruise's uber-macho rant in Magnolia is like a prequel to this Paul Anderson film in which even a glimpse of a woman is hidden; although D.Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview is accused of sexual misbehavior by his adversary, it must have happened during the scenes where I had my hands over my eyes to escape the gratuitous ugliness. ""There will be blood,"" which all critics are touting as The Best Thing Since The Crucifixion was like a two-and-a-half hour bodily assault with a large board.<br/><br/>The visually dull first part of the film had no dialogue; I was almost grateful because afterward Day-Lewis attempted some kind of weird heroic accent. Hardly an homage to anyone, it was a shot at sounding ""Amurrican."" Although greed was the Big Motivation in the film, there were hints of other possibilities never developed, like Daniel's raising someone else's kid and challenging Abel's beating his daughter. He was just All Greed, All the Time. The minimal plot was drearily predictable - well, Upton S. never was very big on plot. The many scenes shot in the unhelpful dark, the wicked beatings and some hit-me-over-the-head-I-don't-recognize-the devil-without-the-fire-and-brimstone business about good and evil must pass for 'symbolism' I suppose. Worst of all was Day-Lewis's leering and posturing (why did his limp appear long years after he fell in the mine?) that came right out of nineteenth century vaudeville - he was themustachio'd villain of melodrama. Poor Johannes Brahms - did he deserveto have his exquisite music behind that vicious ending?"

I will not say that it is a waste of time at all and I probably would have given it a beter review if it did not have the out of nowhere slapstick ending. No one aged except the deaf kid, who didn't learn anything. This could have been a good ending for one of my favorites, The Big Lebowski! I do not think I have spoiled the ending at all but I think I could have done a better job.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that religion is full of flaws. As for the acting, everyone loves Daniel, whatever. He was fine. My favoriete movie last year was La Vie En Rose with a backup of No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>The End of this movie had me laughing, I guess mostly because I am not a Christian but it was just stupid and funny as well. The dumb asses got what they deserved.<br/><br/>I would like to submit a new ending, as the one given after all that time sucked.<br/><br/>See it for yourself if you have the spare time. Not a 10 or 1 as they would have you believe. it could have been a 7 if the ending wasn't so funny. I couldn't stop laughing! Great comedy film!"
"Jimmious","6","3","9","19 April 2008"," A movie that will feel artistic to those who don't usually watch ""slow"" movies
","Let me begin with a summary of my thoughts, so that the majority of the people that read this review will be able to skip the main part... The movie was mediocre at best. Daniel Day Lewis was exceptional as usual. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Why you will probably ask... Well, there are many reasons. First of all a slow-paced movie isn't by default artistic which seems to be what many people think nowadays due to the lack of slow-paced movies. There Will Be Blood has an interesting beginning and well... you will stay with that interest until the end. Not one thing of importance happens in the whole movie, just a repetitive explanation of the characters involved and a slow , really slow development of the script.<br/><br/>When the movie ended I couldn't help but ask my self ""What will I keep in my memories after watching this movie?"". The answer was nothing. I couldn't (and still can't) find anything of importance in the whole script, in the whole plot that made me stay focused.<br/><br/>In the whole it's like watching a landscape portrait. Beautiful to see, but pointless and not creative.<br/><br/>6/10 for Daniel Day Lewis, 4/10 without him.<br/><br/>*By the way I must agree with many other people here that the music score was really bad. The music almost never fitted the scene it was played in..."
"PanamaJoe","7","3","9","15 April 2008"," Decent movie, bad soundtrack
","This movie is pretty good. Visually, it's stunning. The performances are great. As a narrative, it lacks a little bit - the protagonist is obviously sociopathic, but we never really understand why. However, my real problem is with the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Talk about oppressive! You know that music they play in horror movies when something bad is about to happen? In There Will Be Blood, that music is playing for the entire 2.5 hours. It's positively nerve-wracking - all tension and no release. I noticed this about 20 minutes into the movie, and it really detracted from the viewing experience.<br/><br/>I'd have to think that the same movie with a different soundtrack would be more enjoyable."

Apparently, according to people who actually liked this movie, the guy is supposed to be representing hatred and greed, and he's also supposed to have a great performance. Well, I didn't feel any of it... I felt like I was watching some old fool having unreasonable reactions to the little important stuff happening. Even if there is good acting, good scenarios, good soundtrack, there's still lousy plot and even worse script, and without those, the others are just a waste. On top of it all, you have to wait 150 minutes to discover there's no big ending that makes this whole nonsense worth it. It's just as mediocre as it is. 5 stars because it sucks, 3 stars because it could've sucked in 90 minutes instead of 150."

"MOscarbradley","10","3","9","5 March 2008"," Anderson's 'intimate epic' is a masterpiece
","""There will be Blood"" confirms my long held belief that Paul Thomas Anderson is the finest director of his generation working anywhere today. His achievement is all the more remarkable from being so different from what he has done before. Well, maybe not that different; in adapting Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"" for the screen, Anderson has zoned in on the relationship between the central character, Daniel Plainview and his nemesis, the young preacher Eli Sunday, and on the inner turmoil that drives Plainview, in a way that recalls the fundamental relationships in his own movies, ""Hard Eight"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"". However, this is the first time he has gone to another source for his material and the end result is electrifying.<br/><br/>This is an epic full of expansive, large-scale spaces marking it out as a different kind of epic from ""Magnolia"" or ""Boogie Nights"" but it is an intimate epic often told in close-up and with dialogue divided between only a very few characters. (It's like ""Giant"" but pared down to its very basics). It may also remind you of Huston's ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", (men, who in a different set of circumstances might be deemed as 'good', driven to terrible acts through greed), and ""Greed"" itself, Von Stroheim's great silent 'epic' also comes to mind. The first fifteen minutes or so are wordless and it comes as something of a shock when we first hear Plainview speak. It sounds like a narration in which he is addressing us, the audience, before the camera reveals him addressing a room full of people whose land he needs so he can drill for oil.<br/><br/>The comparison, too, with ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is driven home when we first hear him speak. Surely, this is the voice of Huston himself. I am not sure if the decision to play Plainview in the vocal style of Huston was the director's or the actor's choice but in doing so Daniel Day-Lewis creates a singularly memorable character whose vocal tics, nevertheless, don't distract from our appreciation of him. It is a performance that, once-and-for-all, establishes Day-Lewis as the premier actor of his generation. He isn't above playing to the gallery or reveling in the role to such an extent that his pleasure becomes somewhat contagious but like Brando and Olivier before him he can now afford to wink at and nudge his audience in the sure knowledge it's the character and not the actor who is hamming it up. Plainviw is one of the screen's great mad men and Day-Lewis imbues that madness with a Lear-like intensity.<br/><br/>So good is his performance there is a danger that Paul Dano, (the only other actor to really register), will be over-looked and this was certainly the case when the Oscar nominations were being dished out. Dano is superb as the sanctimonious 'false prophet' Eli Sunday and there are a few scenes when both actors are squaring up to each other that are master-classes in the art of acting. Dano disappears from the film about two-thirds of the way through only to return for a coda that brings the film to a memorable, if abrupt, close.<br/><br/>Like ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights"" this is a long film but it never seems so and I could have been doing with more of it. It is a beautiful film to look at, (Robert Elswit winning an Oscar for his cinematography), and Jonny Greenwood's ominous, symphonic score greatly adds to the drama. It has also been called a classic in the making but it is not self-consciously so. Rather it feels like a natural progression for its director, delving further into the psyches of his protagonists to discover what it is that drives them to do the things they do. Plainview may be a figure from an historical past but he could just as easily have been the father of Jason Robarts or Philip Baker Hall in ""Magnolia"" or the grandfather of Cruise in that same film or of Adam Sandler's quirky, volatile and maybe just slightly insane Barry Egan in ""Punch Drunk Love""."

","Instead of foregoing the clichés here i've decided to include them. Words like 'masterpiece' and 'classic', when applied to film, will now always allow 'There Will Be Blood' to spring to mind. So forgive me.<br/><br/>The long run time of this film may be seen as a disadvantage by some. Quite the opposite i'd say. For when something is so emotionally powerful, in engaging so many various thoughts and feelings, why would you want it to be over as quick as possible? In some of the more sinister moments, I felt a feeling quite inexplicable, riddled with that of fear, excitement, disgust, anger...the list is endless. Few films I can think of invoke a similar emotion. This was supplemented by a soundtrack which captured the mood effortlessly throughout.<br/><br/>Leaving the cinema, me and a friend were quite simply stunned by 'There Will Be Blood'. Struggling to explain what was so spectacular and unique about this film, the realisation was clear. A film that dares not to conform to modern stereotypes needs no explanation. With this film, you take what you want from it, which indeed will be quite different from person to person. Even interpretations of events and meanings may differ, which i'm certain Paul Thomas Anderson would have welcomed.<br/><br/>Go with an open mind, expecting nothing you may have experienced before. Take the film for what it is; an experience. If indeed you allow yourself, you'll feel just the way I do about 'There Will Be Blood'."
"t_balutz","10","3","9","20 February 2008"," Oil.Obsession.Power.Cruetly.Daniel Day-Lewis...Brilliant !!!
","Every rage inside should be released before it gets too unstable to be controlled. This movie is a piece of a one theatrical scene of great values of life and virtues yet not dared to be played. Greed, vengeance, blood, lie, murder, and hate are posted with biblical proportions. This is a ""Godfather"" comeback in an age of ""Bullet time"" cinematography, and it is a very pleasant feeling to see that such movies are made in the days of ours. Set in the early 20th century, the film follows the rise to power of Daniel Plainview, a charismatic and ruthless oil prospector, driven to succeed by his intense hatred of others and psychological need to see any and all competitors fail. When he learns of oil-rich land in California that can be bought cheaply, he moves his operation there and begins manipulating and exploiting the local landowners into selling him their property. Using his young adopted son H.W. to project the image of a caring family man, Plainview gains the cooperation of almost all the locals with lofty promises to build schools and cultivate the land to make their community flourish. Over time, Plainview's gradual accumulation of wealth and power causes his true self to surface, and he begins to slowly alienate himself from everyone in his life."
"dfrbrowne","10","3","9","18 February 2008"," Brilliant Character Study - Who is the most fanatical?
","**May contain spoilers**<br/><br/>This is a brilliant Character Study. I have read many comments that Daniel Plainview has no redeeming qualities but I disagree. I think there is a little of Daniel Plainview in all of us, I see some of him in me. He obviously loves his Son. In the scene where they are reunited when laying the pipeline this is clear. He is dammed for sending his son away to school but if he had not done this his son would not have learnt sign language the way he did so in hindsight this was also an act of love. Yet at the end when he tells his son of his real past he seems to hate his son, but again have we not sometimes hated the ones we love and in moments of real unhappiness said things deliberately to hurt them? No I think the study of Plainview could be a study of any ambitious and successful man who dedicates himself to his profession.<br/><br/>The real evil in this film, like the real evil in the world today is the religious fanaticism of Eliah and his church of the 3rd revelation.<br/><br/>I would much rather spend an evening out with Daniel than Eliah, wouldn't you? I think at the end Daniel does just not care any more, again like any ruthless business man he has all his riches but no one to share them with.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant piece of Acting by Daniel-Day Lewis, watch out for just the way he uses his eyes to express his feelings. I would highly recommend this film."
"J_Trex","10","3","9","10 February 2008"," The Montgomery Burns Story
","This movie, based on the novel 'Oil!' by Upton Sinclair, was excellent but the ending could have been better. The first 140 minutes were riveting, the final 15 minutes unraveled into a mess of psychotic actions on the part of main character, Daniel Plainview. The act of dismissing his adopted son, H.W., might have made some sense, in terms of Plainview's descent into acute alcoholism, but the senseless murder of the Preacher was silly. It really spoiled the movie. When it was finished, the crowd was speechless. The ending was so over the top.<br/><br/>I say the Montgomery Burns story because Plainview was a caricature, and in his mannerisms, his misanthropic ways, his unbridled greed, he seemed to be channeling Monty Burns. If the Simpsons hadn't already done a spoof of Citizen Kane, this movie would provide a good episode, with Bart as H.W., Monty Burns as Plainview, Rev. Lovejoy as Sunday, and Smithers could be Fletcher Hamilton.<br/><br/>The ending aside, as crazy as it was, this was a great movie. Day-Lewis deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. His character, Daniel Plainview, will become an enduring symbol of capitalism and human nature at its worst, which I am sure is how Upton Sinclair would have intended it."
"pyrocitor","10","3","9","6 February 2008"," There are no words...
","It is exceedingly rare in this day and age to come across a film which brings credence to the cliché ""taking your breath away"", and actually knocks the viewer flat to the point of being lost for words when attempting to capture the essence of the film. Such an experience seems to happen once or twice a decade at best, with the release of a film whose quality is undeniable, whose image is seared into the collective unconscious, and yet proves elusive in terms of putting down into mere words. Such a film is the latest staggering achievement by writer/ director Paul Thomas Anderson, There Will Be Blood - a work whose sheer masterful command of the cinematic form knocks the viewer flat like a forceful physical impact, as they sit, entranced and utterly absorbed by the spectacle unfolding in front of them. <br/><br/>It staggers the mind to think that There Will Be Blood is only director Paul Thomas Anderson's fifth feature length film, as his incomparable command of his medium suggests decades of experience. Adapting the novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair, Anderson has crafted an odyssey of greed, ambition, spirituality, family, and the subversion of all of the above, all centered around the quest of a turn of the century oil tycoon (Daniel Day-Lewis) struggling to make it big. But in the end, despite the immaculately detailed and informative journey of oil prospecting, the essence of the film could be boiled down to an age old sparring between faith and human greed and ambition, and Anderson's pitch perfect screenplay captures such underlying themes in an overwhelmingly affecting fashion.<br/><br/>But despite the film's lengthy running time and frequent slow, moody segments, the palpable tension throughout is enough to keep any viewer utterly immersed within the perversely affecting story unfolding in front of them. While such length in a lesser film might be considered self indulgent, Anderson refuses to simply tell the story of a man, and instead engages in an epic voyage of both the triumph of man's spirit, and the decline of his soul - and for every last moment, from the near silent opening twenty minutes to the flooring, astoundingly powerful climax, the film effortlessly captivates and draws the viewer in to the dark realism of the time. From the impeccable period detail, to the sublime beauty of the expansive countrysides to the harsh, dank grit of the oil wells, Anderson shows an astounding ability to immerse the viewer within his film - one can almost smell the oil and feel the rush of flame scorching the air. Similarly, the hauntingly beautiful score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood would normally seem more fitting in a horror movie than a period drama, but strangely enough, it perfectly compliments the eerie and tremendously unsettling tone of the entire film, matching the slow burning tension exquisitely. <br/><br/>If there was ever any doubt as to the unbelievable proficiency of Daniel Day-Lewis, his staggering masterclass of a performance here is enough to dispel it. The sheer force and spellbinding intensity Day-Lewis radiates seems to sear through the screen, bringing nihilistic and ferociously ambitious oil prospector Daniel Plainview to life in a disconcertingly realistic fashion. Present in every single scene of the film, Plainview is a truly astounding character: a self described ""family man"" who abandons his adopted son, seeing him as an ""inconvenience""; a humanitarian who threatens to murder the local pastor, and whose all consuming hatred for those around him and incessant greed and lust for conquest. Plainview is not a villain strictly speaking, but is more despicable and blood-churning than any villain could be, all the more so by the fact that despite his slew of abominable qualities he still captures the audience's sympathies right to the end of his sordid tale. Seldom in the history of the medium has a singular performance proved so incendiary, and Day-Lewis deserves every bit of recognition thrown his way. <br/><br/>Similarly, rising star Paul Dano easily holds his own against the titan that is Day-Lewis as a young, frighteningly charismatic preacher waging spiritual war against the unapologetically malevolent Plainview, and the fact that Dano's staggering portrait of a struggling young man has been overlooked by the Academy is simply unforgivable. While the majority of the focus is on the overwhelming power of the film's lead two actors, Kevin J. O'Conner and Cirarán Hinds give strong support, as does young Dillon Freasier in his film debut as Plainview's stoic son. <br/><br/>Despite many heartfelt efforts (including this one), no words can truly capture the impact of Anderson's stunning work. Suffice to say the film easily deserves every last bit of praise bestowed upon it, and more, as every last intricate piece meld together to form an utterly flawless and tremendously powerful piece of work. There Will Be Blood is not so much simply a film as an impeccable crafted work of art, an experience which merits viewing by any in search of astronomically powerful cinema or those wishing to see what is sure to become a modern classic in the making.<br/><br/>-10/10"
"richard-1967","10","3","9","1 February 2008"," A masterpiece! And even better on second viewing
","I bought the DVD a year ago, thinking that I had just scratched the surface of this film on first watching. How true! I finally watched the video and it was even better than in the theater. On second viewing, I'm changing my rating from ""10"" to ""10 plus."" This movie is memorable -- the kind of film that will stay with you for years. We will be watching it 30 years from now, as we now watch the Godfather. And the Daniel Plainview character was far more nuanced and deep than the first time around.<br/><br/>For this, I must credit Daniel Day-Lewis's extraordinay performance (DDL's superb ability to act silently - see the beginning of the Boxer for another example - makes him the greatest actor of his time). Plainview is not pure evil nor pure allegory; he is real, nuanced, fully-realized, and in his own way, a magnificent immortal character. Then there is the almost equally riveting Paul Dano (it is our good fortune to have Paul Dano re-cast as Eli as well as Paul.) Best of all, this story is an American morality play, timely in its evaluation, through one central character and his counter-part, of two eternal issues -- capitalistic greed and religious fervor.<br/><br/>Heap credit on DDL, then give at least equal measure to Paul Thomas Anderson, whose conception, screenplay, and direction with exceptional visual power, is what makes this an American masterpiece.<br/><br/>A word about the music: Not only is the foreboding Radiohead music a constant tension-provoker, but I will never listen to the third movement of Brahams' violin concerto -- considered to be a happy Rondo -- without seeing the ominous TWBB scenes in which it was used, particularly in the bowling alley.<br/><br/>This is the first addition to my Top Ten of all time in many, many years."
"monkeystylekungfu","10","3","9","29 January 2008"," A ""Masterpiece"".
","That's right, 10. And that's out of 10. That's 100% of its total potential. I love that we try to quantify the quality of something. It caters to that part of the mind that finds great difficulty rationalizing experience. And one thing is for sure, There Will Be Blood is an experience. At least, for me it was. It was a 'film', that much is also certain, but the combination of images, sounds, and words that compose this film behaves almost as some kind of catalyst. For what, I'm not so sure, but the bottom line is this: it's deceptively simple. I almost instinctively felt that something far more complex was going on beneath the surface, but it really wasn't. All of the meaning injected into this film stems from the fact that we are given vast amounts of time to do so. The mind is left to ponder, but never out of boredom; with the way that sound and image are combined and used in this film, you're basically forced to. And that's what I mean when I say 'catalyst'. I can't say that the film 'treats' us as active participants, because that implies that we are leisurely given the choice to responsibly chose whether or not we wish to participate. No, we're simply given no choice but to become active participants. And then there's the ending, which is one of the greatest I've ever seen. What makes the ending so completely satisfying is that it liberates us from the film's long, introspective grasp, which is reflected in the final line of the film. The ending is violent, yes, but that violence is cathartic, even if it is morally unjustified. And so I left the theater stunned that I should feel that way, yet almost happy to leave, as strange as that may sound. There Will Be Blood was like a mirror reflecting the ugly side of every person in the audience. It used curiosity as its lure, always recoiling, the audience always following until it was too late to look away. And what we saw was both honest and hideous, but most importantly, impossible to forget."
"refresh_daemon","9","3","9","27 January 2008"," An amazing portrait of the effect of greed on one man
","There Will Be Blood is a film about one man's obsession and greed. This man, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is, in his own words, ""an oilman"". And the story is essentially about how this oilman set up the oil well of his lifetime and how it utterly consumed him.<br/><br/>First of all, be warned that this film is very different from director P.T. Anderson's previous works. There aren't a lot of characters and overlapping stories, just one main character and a handful of supporting ones. There's not a ton of dialogue--rather, there's a lot of silence. And the soundtrack, while prevalent, isn't the wonderful musical candy of his previous works, but is striking and eerie.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is fantastic. The acting is strong, even little Dillon Freasier as H.W. Plainview, the son of our protagonist, Daniel Plainview. The film looks great and sounds great, although I felt like the score was something a little too intrusive in the mix, swelling up too much in front when it could've held back a little to give the silence more breathing room and providing cues that weren't necessary--although in its own right, it's compelling stuff for the ears.<br/><br/>The story is an amazing portrait of the effects of greed and a lack of love and mercy on a human being. While it's clear that Daniel Plainview is a man with money on his mind, we watch as his obsession with his oil and getting his own way tear apart all the things that we also found redeeming in him. I'm sure I'm not the first person to point this out, but in this sense, the story had much in common with Citizen Kane, as an examination of the nature of human evil and its effect on one man. And it's remarkable how we watch the man metamorphose so gradually and almost imperceptibly, until the end when we really how much he's changed, and for the worst.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a fantastic and powerful film, while certainly far from uplifting, it is a film that very subtly has a potent warning for those in pursuit of worldly success. And with such a superb presentation, even the 2.5 hour running-time wasn't even noticed. A remarkable work of art. 9/10."

Actually, this one will linger with me for a lot longer, and may haunt my nights as well. I am absolutely stunned by this film. I was mesmerized from the first frame to the last. I loved ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", but this one tops them both. Robert Elswit's cinematography is beautiful, even in the dark nighttime scenes. Jonny Greenwood's score is unique  Kubrick-ian, dare I say it  and fits the images perfectly. And I predict Daniel Day-Lewis will win the Best Actor Oscar, I can't imagine anyone else topping his towering performance. Paul Dano also deserves a Supporting Actor nomination (though I still lean toward Casey Affleck in ""The Assassination Of Jesse James"" in that category). And Paul Thomas Anderson finally should score a Best Director nomination for this; he's been nominated before for his screenplays, as he should for this one as well, but watch how he sets up his camera angles and lets the actors do their work (especially in the brilliant final scenes). I cannot wait to see this film again.<br/><br/>Wow, between ""There Will Be Blood"", ""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"", and ""No Country For Old Men"", 2007 has been a very good year at the movies!"

Day Lewis got richer next passing decade and he wasn't very nice getting there.<br/><br/>He works the work. He gets just as dirty as anyone else. Upton Sinclair was a socialist and though I haven't read his novel Oil I could feel his way of saying and seeing things throughout this picture.<br/><br/>It's almost a black and white movie. Black oil is definitely the color of the faces, the clothes and the demeanor of Lewis. We witness him commit murder. One who lied about being his brother and was willing to just walk away and disappear falls on deaf ears.<br/><br/>During one accidental explosion, Lewis's son goes deaf, never to fully regain it again. He beats up the minister of the Church of the Third Transfiguration for not being able to heal his son.

This is worthy of Nicholson, Pacino or De Niro who have played quite demonic characters in their careers.<br/><br/>Anti-religion movie? It most certainly is and showing an oil man getting away with just about anything makes it a political one as well.

PT Anderson has made the darkest movie in his career."

Daniel Day-Lewis gives quite possibly one of the best performances in the history of cinema. Paired with Paul Thomas Anderson's always perfect direction we have There Will Be Blood. For all cine-files out there the idea of the perfect film is paired with movies that have perfect everything: Direction, acting, writing, cinematography, effects, what have you. Such films as Casablanca, The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction come to mind for me, along with There Will Be Blood. There isn't a single false note in this movie. It is paced perfectly, every shot has a purpose and tells the story of an industrial man whose morals (or lack thereof) continue to show (or don't show) for a full 2 and a half hours of madness personified. This film asks questions about the nature of the human being and of the point where wanting something becomes wanting something too much. It forces us to ask ourselves questions that relate to modern society, and for a movie that takes place during the early 20th century California oil boom that is pretty incredible. It asks us these questions while presenting us with one of the most evilly misguided characters in film history. The movie shows the true darkness of Daniel Plainview in a perfectly drawn out film and what caused this darkness to finally rear its ugly head, until yes, there is blood. It is one of the best films ever made. 11/10"
"salvador-97","6","2","5","5 March 2015"," ""There will be blood"" is no masterpiece, and certainly not the best film of the decade
","It seems that, even though it (fairly) lost the best picture prize to NCFOM, TWWB is regarded as the best film of the decade. That if features a good performance by veteran actor Daniel Day-Lewis is an undeniable fact. But even there I'm afraid I have to disagree with most of this film supporters, because IMHO showing unparalleled fury or rage and overpowering every word with the weirdest of voices does not equal the best performance of all time, because that would mean being able to show some depth an nuance, which starring at the horizon and saying ""I hate most people"" certainly does not. I do believe he's a great actor, one of the greatest of all time, but this is certainly not his best performance. Apart from that point, which still remains as the best part of the movie, we're presented with a story about his character's greed for oil, and a character study of how his greed and contempt for the world gradually isolates him from even his son. That would actually be a great premise for a movie, if it was actually treated as in-depth study of real human feelings and emotions and for the better an entertaining one. What we get instead is a totally boring movie made by the most overrated filmmaker of all time who, aside from the amazing technique displayed in some breathtaking shots, can do nothing but throw at us how in love he is with his own material. Don't get me wrong, because I'm no transformers fan, and I love drawn-out movies, such as The Godfather, The Deer Hunter, Bergman movies, just to name a few, if they actually have something new or interesting to show or to say, which rarely happens through this wandering mess. How some people say it has a deep meaning that touched theirs souls like nothing else is beyond me. If you want real feeling that is gut-wrenching and tears your soul apart then watch a Bergman movie or read some Dostoevsky, because this pretentious mess ain't nothing of that kind. I know there are movies that grow on you after some watches, but after the third one I gave up and so consider myself in position to criticize it. ""Boogie Nights"" is so superior to this in even aspect, and I would go so far as to call that movie a flawed masterpiece, but certainly not this. After two and half hours of boringhood, there comes a finale that's both surprising and rather kubrickian, and although by then we all know it's a trick the director is pulling on us to make us think he has achieved something deep and true, we can still enjoy the fabulous Day-Lewis get lost in a sea of despair. It's the only memorable thing about this movie, other than the very good cinematography, the good performances and the amazing tracking shots unfortunately ruined by an unnecessary score."
"Marc_Israel_365","7","2","5","7 August 2014"," Interesting time piece but devoid of a plot that is worthy of the acting
","A new age of discovery movie that takes two apolar individuals , pits them against each other and brings you into their heads in a way previously done by the likes of Kubrick and Copolla. The false hope that is being pedaled is a bit offensive as is the desperation in that it is sold. Oil for one, and God by the other. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are excellent in how they dupe themselves along with others in their endeavors. But the sadness of such existences is only shown, not felt. The story line is predictable that not even the blaring musical tension can elevate. DDL had depth as Bill The Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"", but despite a sincere commitment, he is still a one dimensional character, albeit a charming one. Some movies are discussed in reference or even comparison to others by the same director, actor or genre. Others stand out as unique. ""There Will Be Blood"" has some of both, which is to say there is much to discuss in those regards. The bottom line is what needs to be considered, and this movie takes a long time to evidence a lack of character development and to show to unsurprising results of such an existence."

","There Will Be Blood was one of those movies I put off for the perfect time, just waiting to sit back and enjoy. Clocking in at 2 1/2 hours actually delighted me, as I set off thinking I'd enjoy this film, based on reputation and hype. It was one of those films I just figured I'd enjoy, having bought it sight unseen. <br/><br/>Yet the film is a dead film, in my view. It has no soul. There are no emotional moments. It stirs nothing in the viewer. Moreover, there are no characters to root for nor invest in. Compared to, say, The Assassination of Jesse James, a far superior film, both Jesse and Bob were at least interesting and had redeeming values. However, Daniel Plainview has none. Even if we were to compare this to the oft-compared No Country for Old Men, at least Chigur and Moss have some sense of identity. Plainview has none. He's not even somberly humorous, as are Chigur and Jesse in a number of scenes in their films. All in all, he's a dead character...<br/><br/>Yes, I understand what he ""represents"" and the ""symbolism"" of his greed, and how he ""longed for family"", and how the ""blood"" could represent ""blood"" and ""blood as in family"", I get all that...please don't try to convince me on those fronts. It wasn't awful, just had no soul. Was well-acted in some parts; but that doesn't make for a great story. There is no great story here. A better character study would be Sling Blade (seemed like the music was a rip off), Assassination, or No Country, as mentioned earlier. Each far surpass this ""bloody mess""."

","This film will go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. The story of an over ambitious oil man is told so effectively by the talented mind of director Paul Thomas Anderson. He draws us in with his eccentric style and holds our attention until the very end. The movie is brilliantly made, and quite unlike anything I have ever seen. The cinematography is stunning; the sights, sounds, and the epic scope of this movie are breathtaking. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is on a whole other level than almost any other film in my opinion. All the cast give amazing performances. But Daniel Day Lewis... there are no words to describe him. He completely disappears in this role. His mere presence in the film is unsettling. But his intense performance works because of its subtly. He doesn't have to forwardly express his hatred and anger often for you to believe him. He inhabits these traits so perfectly you can just sense it. This is no doubt one of the best performances of all time. And personally one of my favorites. <br/><br/>This is an instant classic.

","Or: ""There Will Be Greed""! Arresting, magnetic (but needlessly long and slow, with odd, seemingly unresolved passages) drama of ruthless American oil baron (Day-Lewis) through the 1890s - 1930s who, for the sake of his obsession of exploiting a small California township rich with oil, sends off his deafened son, kills a man claiming to be his brother and fakes a Christian baptism... among other things! <br/><br/>No history piece or Americana, but a dark, demanding and unusually complex male character study, with Day-Lewis' Oscar-winning performance a towering, multi-faceted centerpiece. Present in as good as every scene, he virtually eclipses and suffocates all the other characters, which becomes as much a benefit as a burden to Paul Thomas Anderson's script on the destructive forces of greed.

","As awesome as the acting is, especially on the part of Daniel Day-Lewis, I came away wondering why I had lost more than two hours of my valuable time watching a film about two souls so cynical and deceitful that they could not possibly add anything to my life or my values as a human being. The last quarter of the movie was also ponderous and turgid. The Oscar given to Day-Lewis was well deserved and the first hour of the film was intense and eminently watchable though the Day-Lewis character was quite repellent from the outset. Once that hour was up the film tragically went one-way downhill, which did not say much for the quality of direction. Photography? Again, quite splendid in the first half, then flopped like the rest of the film. Was Day-Lewis the ultimate incarnation of Satan and a symbol of savage capitalism?"
"grantmalf","10","2","5","20 August 2008"," Film making perfection.
","Having viewed There Will Be Blood for the second time last night I am still reeling in the wake of its perfection. Paul Thomas Anderson takes his direction to a new level, filming on a larger scale than he ever has, and doing so with the creativity and conviction that will ensure his place as one of the finest film makers of this generation. Every shot is stunning in its composition, framing, and lighting, serving the complexity and multi layered nature of the story. <br/><br/>Despite Anderson's seminal direction and cinematography the film is owned completely by the performance of Daniel Day Lewis. He provides a towering character study of a man driven only by a sense of greed and competition. Many a story has centered around the destructive nature of greed but no actor has captured it with quite as much passion and intensity. <br/><br/>By its conclusion, his Daniel Plainview is a shallow, souless man, destroyed by his own unwavering quest for wealth. Day Lewis is in almost every scene and is utterly commanding whenever on screen. His complete transformation and exploration of the Plainview psyche is on par with that of De Niro in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, Pacino in the Godfather, or any one of Brando's best performances. The performance is easily the best of the decade if not one of the best in film history.<br/><br/>Dano is worthy support as Eli Sunday, and the mere fact that his character can share the screen with Day Lewis is a testament both to the writing and to his performance. Johnny Greenwood's score is is the perfect counterpoint to the film, bordering at times on creepy, its edgy, off kilter sound enhances Plainview's descent into madness. This is an emotionally draining, yet completely stunning masterpiece, and an exercise in film making perfection."
"classicsoncall","10","2","5","26 June 2008"," ""I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.""
","The first hint of Daniel Plainview's unheralded villainy comes when he snubs Preacher Eli Sunday's request to perform a blessing upon the strike of the local oil well. You already have a sense of it as Plainview plies the unsophisticated rubes with a pittance compared to the value of their underground wealth. Those scenes conjure up ideas of what it must have really been like during the heady days of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century robber barons. Greed and power, pure and simple, taken well beyond the measure of Humphrey Bogart's character in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" which director Anderson watched faithfully prior to his filming of this modern masterpiece. If you need only one reason to watch this film, it would be Daniel Day Lewis' excruciatingly sinister performance as the oil baron Plainview, setting a new low in human depravity with his 'You're just a bastard from a basket' speech to adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier). But unbelievably, he tops even that with the 'I drink your milkshake' tirade against preacher Eli (Paul Dano). Brilliant in it's intensity and yet unmistakably devoid of any sense of human decency and compassion. It's as if he were describing himself when in an earlier scene, Plainview maintains that ""There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking"". ""There Will Be Blood"" is an intense and tumultuous character study of a man bent on personal success, whose methods and motivation can only result in personal failure as deeply devastating as the fortune he amassed."

That being said I just couldn't believe that this movie could generate so much hype and accolades from the artistic community and yet, at the same time end up being so aimless. The strange thing is, my attention was held pretty well throughout the majority of the movie because I just felt that something really good was going to happen......eventually.............something..........anything? The final scene comes and DDL (after giving a typically fine acting performance throughout) unleashes some pretty good stuff about milkshakes but then freaks out and bashes the dude's head with a bowling pin. Roll credits. WTF is that? To say that it was a letdown would be a little insulting to the words ""let"" and ""down"".<br/><br/>There were too many things that happened that really made no sense and were not explained as to why they were relevant. I even went back and watched the scene again where he figures out that the guy was not his brother and I am still having a really hard time what clued him in on the beach. I imagine it had something to do with going to peach tree dances but that means nothing to me. How also, does the old man know that he killed the dude? Anyway, my overriding thought after the movie finally ended was that I didn't get it. I didn't get what the point of the film was supposed to be.

","I saw this expecting something extraordinary. After the first ten minutes, I was looking at my watch. After the first half hour, I was tempted to turn it off and look at something else. I stuck with it since I have great respect for Daniel Day Lewis and I assumed things were going to get better. Not. There eventually were a few interesting scenes, but the music set the tone of ""scary things about to happen"" - and they never did. Along with the inappropriate music, there was a lot of background rhythmic banging, some totally out of place violin concerto music, and a disjointed and disconcertingly unfocused plot, if you can call the alleged storyline a plot. It makes me want to read the Upton Sinclair novel to see if he ever wrote something this boring and unconvincing. I enjoyed Paul Dano's performance - I wasn't sure if he was a fraud or a nutcase until the end. The cinematography was excellent but almost every scene went on way too long. I do think that DDL is a great actor, but I also think that he must take some responsibility for his character being such a boring sort of sociopath and for (reading other concurring reviews) not clarifying any of his character's motivations or true feelings. The movie is mostly a set of disconnected, excessively lengthy, cameos. Looking through the reviews on IMDb, I simply cannot figure out how IMDb's calculator averages these reviews out to 8.4. I am seeing massive numbers of 2's and 1's - which I believe is an overreaction to the hype. Sadly, when all is said and done, I think this will go down as a just mediocre and forgettable movie."

Parts of the film were filmed in Marfa, TX, so cool, knew it looked familiar.

For two hours it looks like the only thing funny about this literalist travesty of American Dream individualism is going to be his unerring John Huston imitation; but as the third act rounds the bend, the appalling things that Day-Lewis is party to become increasingly tinged with existential ludicrousness. And his predilection for avoiding big, substantive struggles by only picking on the biggest weakling available at any given moment leads abruptly to a climax that is equal parts wrenching, horrifying, jaw-dropping and laugh-out-loud hysterical. I've never seen anything like it, and it makes me question my reactions to everything that came before - it DEMANDS to be watched again. This is what bravura means to me, not raining frogs.

","Paul Thomas Anderson's mesmerising oil saga about a gold digger who strikes oil around the turn of the 20th century enraptured audiences as much as it disoriented them. The critics were wowed mostly by the majestic acting talents of Daniel-Day Lewis, who plays the titular anti-hero, a man slowly dissenting into a purgatory netherworld of moral and social bankruptcy. But it is far from just his film, or indeed Anderson's. The brooding score by Johnny Greenwood is mournfully unnerving, and the cinematography creates a vision of both a man and his hellish world that would give any monster movie a run for its money. It is difficult to comprehend the profoundly enigmatic aura of the film, without repeating the sound bites of a thousand other cineasts. you know what you have just witnessed is some kind of masterpiece, but you can't explain why."

It gives the film a unique edge and makes those memorable scenes that much more memorable. (ex- the scene when Daniel grabs his son and begins running away from the gushing oil - the buildup of rhythmic percussion is inspired!)<br/><br/>I think that the character Day-Lewis plays is also one of the most fascinating and memorable ever features in a movie. His consuming greed and passion for oil overpowers his love for his son. It leads him to commit the most vile acts, yet he feels no remorse. From my perspective, Plainview has committed his entire life to his job. He assumedly has never married, therefore never had children. This might sound odd and creepy, but I would imagine his character has never experienced true 'intimacy' with another woman - all the way to the finale of the movie. He is a 2-dimensional driven character with a brilliant 3- dimensional portrayal.<br/><br/>PLEASE- i recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing what movie magic is all about - and seeing what a film-masterpiece truly is! **********/********** stars!!!!!!!"

Much more conflict could have and should have been present. The acting is the most impressive part of the film, and by that I mean Daniel Day- Lewis.

His character is the movie. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Paul Dano does not match up or even come close (though he gives a solid B performance, contrasted with Day-Lewis he flat out fails, and miserably so). He was miscast in this role, and I know he was a stand in for the original actor who was dismissed from the project, but much more could have been done here with such an important character. <br/><br/>HW's character could have been so much more.

It's dark and full of metaphysical nuances that show what real character should look up on the screen.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis' character Daniel Plainview (best performance he's ever put on) goes from ambition driven to Satan himself faces off with his own guilts and Paul Dano's Eli Sunday...It's all about the way in which people do not change and during the hardest of times, evil will prevail. I know a scary thought to think of but then again it sure makes for an interesting watch.<br/><br/>You can't help but grit your teeth whenever Daniel is present and feel sad, but then very taken back by Paul Dano's character...it's not all about a battle mind you, it does have a lagging subplot which must have been put in just to be very faithful to Umpton Sinclair's OIL! the book that this material was based on.<br/><br/>To conclude, There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece and even though some people say ""it's too long"" or ""boorrinngg"" it doesn't matter, its what the film means and the ending caps it off very nicely, the gruelling journey is as entertaining as anything and i take my hat off to the people who enjoy most of the long shots and realise that sometimes Art prevails in a mainstream world."

This person said to me ""well there a lot more than that"". And there is. First there are sweeping epic scenes like the steam train arriving at the end of the line in this tiny place where nothing grows, or the oil derrick, or the fire, or the explosion that puts it out. And then larger than life acting on the sort of scale we don't see much of these days. Men struggling and crying and losing their moral compasses in order to make their marks. There are few women in the film and I was glad I saw it alone, unworried by thoughts of whether my wife was enjoying it, which she might not have. Indeed I was almost alone in the theatre. There was one other man there as we had come to one of the last public showings before the DVD release on a Sunday morning at the new AMC theatre downtown, where all the projection is digital. I could not tell any difference except that it looked the same as a completely clean print. The photography was at times magical, the score inspired, a mixture of this guy from Radiohead and Brahms and the acting was universally excellent and in Daniel Day Lewis extraordinary, unlike Wells in Citizen Kane (to which the film has rightly been compared), he created a character that was at once repulsive and comprehensible, so that I was horrified and yet anguished by his pain. I cried unrestrainable tears about five times. I laughed some and I was swept away a lot. In short, a perfect film in my book."

However, I will say this : There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis gives a gripping and powerful performance as Plainview. Even during the opening minutes, where there is no dialogue, he still commands the screen. It's to the credit of the others in the cast, especially Paul Dano as Eli that they hold their own against him.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson who wrote the screenplay as well as directing the movie, takes his time in telling his story. The battle of wills between Plainview and Eli is gripping, and shows that both are as bad as each other in their own ways. Plainview will do whatever he can to get his way, as will Eli.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism to be made is the ending. The scene at the end of the movie brought a few giggles from some audience members, until the final shocking act occurs. In truth, I'm not sure for the reason for the ending as is. True it may come from the source novel, which I've not read, but it doesn't quite sit with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The music by Jonny Greenwood from the band Radiohead grips through-out. It was a shame that it was ineligible for the Oscars as it's one of the best scores of the past few years.

","Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!,"" is a breath-taking tour-de-force of amazing cinematography, music, writing, directing and acting. Basically, everything in this movie is stunning! Beginning with a captivating 15 minutes of silent film and ending with a shocking and depressing blow, ""There Will Be Blood"" is a movie that will remain with the viewer like a dark cloud above their head for some time after the credits roll. The journey is epic, with the running time clocking in at 158 minutes, but ultimately rewarding.<br/><br/>This grand story spans three decades and follows the endeavors of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis, in an Oscar winning act). Beginning with him stumbling across an oil patch, journeying through his time as a self-proclaimed ""oilman"" and concluding with a power mad, alcoholic elderly man. Over this period we are able to see Plainview's gradual descent in madness due to power, wealth and ultimately, greed. However, Plainview is constantly battling Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, an excellent support), a prophet and leader for his local church.<br/><br/>Beating at the film's heart of darkness is Daniel Day-Lewis. This is easily his greatest performance, which is saying a lot. But his possession of Plainview is a physical and psychological work of art that beats everything he has done. Day-Lewis is the abyss of a man's soul  it's there in his limp, the eerie squint of his eyes and in the ""competition"" that flows through his veins and suggests the madness of his future. Plainview is not a caricature, though, of a power hungry man. Some of his acts are horrible, but his commitment is at times inspiring and at the start of the movie, he is a caring father and seemingly kind gentleman.<br/><br/>On the opposite end is Eli Sunday, a slimy little boy who is nothing but a false preacher who constantly tries to obtain money from Plainview. He is the embodiment of a crooked leader of a religion out to gain a group of mindless subjects to preach to. It is at the thrilling climax that these two gigantic figures clash with verbal and physical rage.<br/><br/>The acting is only a part of the brilliance of this movie. The beautiful cinematography is nothing short of astounding and rightly won the Oscar. Long, sweeping camera movements help show off the vast deserts, country town and enormous oil rigs. The score adds to the dark theme of the movie, at times it is actually creepy and carries a very horrific/Gothic element which works quite well. Finally, accolades must go to Paul Thomas Anderson for writing and directing, the script is perfect and PTA's direction is nothing short of flawless. Despite the movies running time, the pace flows beautifully and helps to unfold a deep and layered tale of power, wealth, greed and corruption.<br/><br/>4½/5"

","I bet this was a difficult one to sell; a three hour epic about an oil prospector prowling through turn-of-the-Century California where the lead character is as rotten to the core as they come. Yet There Will Be Blood is not a difficult one to watch and hopefully, in the wake of all the Oscar furore and a well-deserved Best Actor win for Daniel Day-Lewis, more people will be encouraged to go see a film that is fast on the way to becoming a modern American classic.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis of course is the heart of darkness around which There Will Be Blood revolves. He plays Daniel Plainview and when we are first introduced to the man, he is alone in the desert digging for silver. He is covered in dust and grime, a sun-bleached man with nothing to his name bar the pick axe in his hand and the bags of blasting Dynamite. That is of course until he strikes oil and his fortunes begin to change. Years pass and Plainview is now a made man, a respected oil tycoon who travels the country with his adopted son HW (Dillon Freasier) offering his services as a businessman promising to expand the fortunes of any community who he believes to be sitting on top of untapped oil reserves. Out of the blue he is visited by an impoverished farmer's boy named Paul Sunday who leads him towards an isolated town where black gold practically gushes from the rocks. Plainview sets up shop and begins drilling, but as he slowly makes his fortune, the lives of everyone around him come to be adversely affected. Daniel Plainview is no bringer of prosperity, he is a man looking to bleed the Earth dry.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits every inch of the man and puts in yet another brilliant performance in a career that has been built on them. Plainview is given no back-story (""I don't like to talk about such things..."") but he is still a captivating presence. His eyes glimmer with Vampiric greed, his voice is a deep Southern drawl and his body language so imposing that he is an intimidating sight, even in the dialogue-free first fourteen minutes where the root of his fortune is revealed. Barely a second of the film goes past where he isn't on screen but he is so naturally magnetic that even given the three-hour duration, you still want it to continue past the darkly-comic finale. Day-Lewis's recent Oscar win was entirely justified and should you need further convincing, pay attention to the scene where Plainview confesses his hatred of humanity to his brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), an exquisitely grim exchange that merely hints at the darkness within him yet provides the most illuminating snapshot we will get.<br/><br/>As his wealth escalates though, his soul deteriorates and he comes into conflict with the town's boy Preacher Eli (Paul Dano) and it is in the confrontations between them that There Will Be Blood is at its finest. Eli is no beautiful flip-side to Plainview by any stretch of the imagination; he is a flawed and weak man whose faith in the Lord gives him the strength to command his flock to acts of reverent worship, yet cannot provide him with the intestinal fortitude to truly challenge the oilman. Their final face-off in the midst of the great depression is breathtaking and wrought with nods to some of Kubrick's more absurdly humorous moments, Capitalism and faith colliding head on.<br/><br/>Magazines like Total Film in the UK have likened Plainview's story to Orson Welles's masterpiece Citizen Kane but There Will Be Blood is no mere imitator. Kane built a fortune and lost his soul in the process, but you could easily argue that Plainview had no soul to lose in the first place. When his son is deafened in the oil-eruption centrepiece at the half-way point, Plainview carries his son to safety then abandons the infant with a colleague to watch the derrick catch alight and he gazes on the inferno until dawn arrives. This is an outstanding film, a mesmerising sermon on money, faith, family and the madness that lies just beneath the surface, waiting to be tapped."

","Fifty years from now, 'There Will Be Blood' is going to be looked at by movie critics and historians as the single greatest film of this generation. I've seen hundreds maybe even thousands of films, and only a select few have come close to accomplishing what this film did in two and a half hours.<br/><br/>This film was great, amazing, and perfect. I loved every second of this film. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the finest performance of his career and absolutely deserved to Oscar. I was pretty disappointed watching the Oscars last night though on the count of the best picture category. Though I understand why the academy chose 'No Country For Old Men', I felt as though 'There Will Be Blood' deserved it so much more. Personally, I loved both films. I though 'No Country' was great and covered some very deep and emotional themes, but come on guys, 'There Will Be Blood' was just so much better. Every frame of that film is perfect, its not too long, I feel it's just right.<br/><br/>'There Will Be Blood' simply put is a masterpiece.There's no question.I really do feel the final scene, about 10 or 12 minutes or so, was one of the greatest scenes in movie history. I loved this film, if you haven't already seen it, go as soon as possible, it's one of those movies that's so much better to watch on a big screen than in your own home.Great film, I loved it. It's an absolute classic."
"johnpetersca","9","2","5","25 February 2008"," A True Classic
","Like many great movies, There Will Be Blood continually brings to mind other works without losing any of its distinctive qualities. I thought first of Black Snake Moan, released in late 2006, because of the intensity of the acting. Where Samuel Jackson in Black Snake Moan is powerful and impressive, Daniel Day-Lewis is entirely overwhelming. His work is on a par with the best of Lawrence Olivier and Marlon Brando. In his role as an ambitious American oil man of the early twentieth century, the British theatrical acting tradition meets American method acting with breathtaking results.<br/><br/>Additional comparisons can be made with Erich Von Stroheim's Greed (as well as with McTeague, the Frank Norris novel on which Greed is based) and Citizen Kane. The nine-hour length of the original version of Greed may have been one reason why Paul Thomas Anderson, the screenwriter and director of There Will Be Blood, chose to use no more than the first hundred or so pages of Upton Sinclair's Oil! for his movie. The very literal interpretation that Von Stroheim applied to Norris's novel led to the movie's extreme length and was cut to a little over two hours for commercial distribution.<br/><br/>There Will be Blood resembles both Greed and Citizen Kane in its focus on the inescapable madness of self-made men. Ross Perot and Howard Hughes are real-life examples of men who fill the archetype. All three movie protagonists are extremely ambitious and become wealthy during the course of the films. In all cases, the results of their ambitions are disastrous. In terms of symbolic meanings, the films' final scenes are remarkably similar: the fight to the death in the desert in Greed, the decaying castle in Citizen Kane, and the murderous bowling alley rampage in There Will be Blood.<br/><br/>But the primary work with which There Will Be Blood requires comparison is Upton Sinclair's novel. There Will Be Blood adheres closely to the initial pages of Oil!. Some of oil man Daniel Plainview's (his name in the novel is J. Arnold Ross) ingratiating speeches to the small farmers from whom he wants to buy cheap land for oil exploration are taken directly from the novel. Throughout the book, the primary character is the oil man's son, Bunny. In the movie, he's called HW, even as an infant, and plays an important but not a leading role.<br/><br/>As the story develops, the book and movie take quite different paths. Oil! becomes a socialist Entwickungsroman, with the son deeply conflicted between his role as an up-and-coming oil magnate and his growing disillusionment with the governmental and corporate establishments. The father fades into the background as social and economic issues inspired by the World War I and the Russian Revolution come to the fore.<br/><br/>In the movie, HW is injured in a drilling accident and becomes deaf. Eventually, he learns sign language and weds Mary, the daughter of a preacher from whom Plainview has purchased land. The father disowns his son when HW wants to go to Mexico and look for oil on his own. There's also a continuing rivalry between Plainview and Eli, Mary's evangelist brother. The men have similar charismatic talents though Plainview has no use for religion except when he can use it to manipulate others. The struggle ends when the old and alcoholic Plainview, living alone in his mansion, forces Eli to renounce his God and bludgeons him to death with pins from his bowling alley.<br/><br/>Despite the murkiness of the film's last half hour and the incongruity of its final violence, it is a cinema masterpiece. Far more than Sinclair's educational and somewhat stilted narratives on history and economics, There Will Be Blood tells viscerally just what it is that unfettered capitalism does to people. But it's psychodrama rather than agitprop. Its spirit is more Norris than Sinclair."

","I was lucky to see There Will Be Blood the day before the Oscar decision and I went to see it again Oscar morning because I was fascinated by Daniel Day Lewis's tour da force performance that I was convinced would win best of the year according to the Academy. I went back to read other commentary on here in regard to There Will Be Blood today and was amazed to see such widely divergent reactions.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, I assure readers out there that this ensemble was allowed by this director to get on camera truly amazing acting performances that another director or producer would surely have edited out in order to ""tighten"" the film. It's to Anderson's credit in recognizing the sheer artistry of these performances that some of the most fantastic on screen acting I've seen in quite awhile was allowed to remain in this film.<br/><br/>Truly, acting has taken second seat to control freak directors who wouldn't know what the word means and use actors like mannequins in their ""visions"" or what we've been spoon fed with Hollywood pictures in the last couple of decades amounting to theme park experiences where acting again takes a back seat. It's not that a lot of talent isn't out there, it's that anything remotely out of control and unexpected with an actor is usually ending up on the cutting room floor because it takes up on screen time that's believed to slow down the pace of the story (often true) or that seems superfluous otherwise.<br/><br/>We don't have a lot of directors anymore who are intimately familiar with what method acting is or how to work with well trained actors like we had in the days of Kazan.<br/><br/>So many kudos to this film for allowing the life back into performances on this scale.<br/><br/>Lewis's work was a result of his lucky pairing with Dano. The language of emoting these two actors have are at such odds in this film that watching them together playing out their character's destinies was downright shocking to see. This was because both of them turned in CONSUMMATE SKILLED ACTING PERFORMANCES. Lewis's performance was not possible without the playing off against Dano's character. That's how acting works.<br/><br/>For those thinking there wasn't the motivation for where the characters start and where they end up...I believe there are a lot of angles from which to study this film...believe me I don't often go back to watch a film twice in a row but I had to with this one. Start with the name of the work and then look at what is the obvious turning point of the film when Eli suggests he be allowed to bless the well. Look at the name of the father of the Sunday family and other clues to what Sinclair was telling us with this story which is, after all, allegorical...really listen to the screenplay and what actually comes out of these character's mouths...it could almost be said to hit you over the head with its modern take on what should be a familiar morality tale if you seek it."
"filmfangal","10","2","5","15 January 2008"," Mesmerizing and haunting...
","Mesmerizing...haunting...brilliant! The disturbing dissonance of the score is nothing short of masterful. Not enough can be said about Daniel Day Lewis' performance. I've never seen an actor carry off the ""ruthless, win-at-all-costs"" type of character as flawlessly as Lewis has in his portrayal of Daniel Plainview. To be able to keep me wondering ""is there anything redeeming about this character? Yesthere it is! Oh, nothere isn'toh, yes, there is!"" And then, ""OH NO!"" again. In fact, each and every actor succeeded in drawing me in to their gritty, desperate world. I was particularly impressed with the performance of the Realtor in Little Boston. His every movement was timed with precision and authenticity. Back to the music  which somewhat defies description, as it is both extremely unsettling and grotesquely beautiful. I was in awe of the score the whole way through.<br/><br/>I love it when a movie has me feeling the characters all around me for days later. No lie, I actually feel like I've been to Little Boston myself, in all of its gritty desperation."
"dead47548","9","4","14","15 January 2008"," A great film.
","There Will Be Blood is a gripping tale of American ambition at the turn of the century and, more importantly, the greed that comes with that ambition succeeding. We are introduced to numerous characters, all of whom say whatever they can in order to gain the most wealth. Every character places their own selfish needs in front of anything else and this compels the story into many dark, unnerving scenes of power and greed.<br/><br/>Behind every element of the story is the continuing battle between Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). The core plot is that of Daniel's greed and desire to make enough money that he can escape from everyone else, but Eli constantly shows up to get in his way. He's the kind of annoying ant that you see on the street and immediately want to squash and Plainview embodies that desire. Day-Lewis creates a wince every time Eli appears on screen that feels so much like myself and he finds humor in the young man's absurd preaching and gospel, for he believes that he is a vessel for God. But when Plainview's son H.W. loses his hearing, he finally snaps and bullies Eli into a puddle of oil, shoving it down his throat. This feud continues through decades all the way to the shocking, jaw-dropping final scene. I literally couldn't breathe or move for moments after the final scene...my mind was stunned into a complete catharsis.<br/><br/>Charging the entire film is the flawless performance from Daniel Day-Lewis who once again proves why he is the greatest actor of all time. This intense, completely absorbed performance is easily one of the greatest of all time and deserves every award he has received and the Oscar that it's the front-runner for. A haunting portrayal. Most actors would pale in comparison to such a daring portrayal, but Paul Dano rises up to the challenge of having to share the screen with Day-Lewis. He excels, and then some. Dano clearly had no reservations with completely immersing himself into this character. He goes over the top just as Sunday is meant to be and it results in a performance that is one of the best of the decade. Words can't begin to describe the genius behind these two performances.<br/><br/>Behind everything in the film is Paul Thomas Anderson who completely sheds the style that he's used in his previous films and creates something unlike anything I've ever seen. He perfectly captures the bleak aspect of the film's setting and the time period, which is the perfect contrast for the painfully unnerving story that he unfolds here. His direction is absolutely top-notch. Jonny Greenwood's score should also be mentioned as it sets the perfect, bone-chilling ambiance that the story should have behind it."

I realize that everything is about personal tastes, but just look at how many 1 Star ratings this movie inspired. Overwhelming.

But after the first hour, the film spirals down continuously revealing the deep personality problems of Daniel, his son HW, and the young preacher Eli Sunday. And the background music is the pits!!

","You hear stories of how directors (e.g. Scorses for Gangs Of New York) run elaborate plots to try to pin-down Daniel Day-Lewis, get him to read their script, and sign up to their current project. So craved is his talent.<br/><br/>You imagine that from his first reading Day-Lewis put pen to paper with excitement in anticipation of what he knew he could do with the character. As in every moment of his presence in this film you can see that he gives his all. He takes hold of this film and the character takes hold of him. Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a man on his own, an almost penniless oil prospector scratching holes in the ground. You watch him change over a 30 year period of his life. <br/><br/>The film begins with a sequence of scenes with an absence of dialogue. However, there is a mighty score reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddessy. This is a glorious decision by the filmmakers as the film now belongs less to the early 1900s of its setting and more to today (thankfully no twanging banjos here.)<br/><br/>You and Plainview develop an understanding. You admire his hard-working regime and his negotiation skills with the locals that he come across. You would trust him with your offspring. But, over time Plainview adds demons into his character. I will refrain from giving any more description on this. I feel that Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now was trying to achieve what Day-Lewis pulls off in this film.<br/><br/>I love films.

I couldn't stop laughing. Daniel Plainview was such a great sociopath, I loved it. The parts that really got to me were the scenes with his son. Towards the end, when H.W. is an adult and tells his dad that he is going to start his own company, Daniel's anger and selfishness were so extreme, it was heart-wrenching.

"adamassacre","10","3","10","12 January 2008"," I can't give enough praise.
","The first thing about 'There Will Be Blood' that hooked me was the acting. I think that Daniel Day Lewis gave the best performance of his career- with the only competition being 'My Left Foot' and 'Gangs of New York'. Everybody's talking about the stellar performance that he delivers, but the thing that shocks me is that NOBODY (at least nobody I know) has said anything about Paul Dano. In my opinion, his performance surprised the hell out of me. He didn't have much acting to do in Little Miss Sunshine, seeing as he was a mute for 3/4 of the film. His acting was really dynamic. Totally surprised me.<br/><br/>P.T. Anderson does an incredible job directing. The thing that really appealed to me was the symmetry involved in the majority of the shots in the film. He seemed to use a lot of symmetry in 'Punch Drunk Love', but not as much in 'Hard Eight' 'Boogie Nights' or 'Magnolia'. Lighting, contrast, and the overall tone of the film was VERY visually appealing. P.T. also did a great job with the screenplay- which I now own. And although a lot of what happens in TWBB doesn't stay true to the book 'Oil!', he definitely makes it his own- which is hard to do without ruining the film altogether.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Radiohead and Jonny Greenwood fan, and I loved the soundtrack. The majority of reviews that I hear say that the music was inappropriately used at times, but I think that although there was nothing tense going on on the screen, the music was used to show the darkness/depravity of the situation. Then again, I'm really biased.<br/><br/>I've seen every other film nominated for Best Picture, and I really think this should win. If neither this nor 'No Country For Old Men' doesn't win, then I'll be really disappointed. I don't think any other movie nominated for Best Picture even deserves to be in the same group as these two movies.<br/><br/>One last thing- the one thing that kept running through my head was, ""... there's no way this isn't going to be considered a classic forty years from now."" The dialogue is so memorable and perfect that I still remember MANY lines and how perfectly they were delivered by each actor. I can't say enough good things about this film. I've seen it twice, and I'll see it many more times.<br/><br/>Please see this movie... really."
"rlipton","9","3","10","9 January 2008"," amazing performances, emotional impact, subtle, but no political context
","All the good things people are saying I agree with, my little problem is that to really have made this an all-encompassing masterpiece, more political context is necessary, its not that I, perfunctorily, need politics, but in this particular instance, understanding this context would have only deepened the personal power of this movie. Certainly Sinclair, the author of oil, understood this. Who is standard oil, union oil, what about the monopolies of the railroads? which were mentioned by Plainview. These were not periphery issues but marbled the whole context in which all oilmen working and which influenced vast portions of the US. More specifically, the violence of Plainview was a microcosm of the large r violence of the oil enterprise generally, and this simply was far too implicit in the movie, it wouldn't have taken much to bring this out. I realize the director loves to focus on the specific and he'll get all sorts of kudos for this movie, as he should, but there is definitely a lack, that for example, ""before the devil knows your dead"" does not have, or ""no country for old men."" I did love the ending to the movie, the very weird tableau of the bowling alley, Plainview initially out drunk on the floor, then roused into monstrous form when he almost casually murders Eli with the bowling pin. This actually hearkens to the book, called ""bowling alone in America"" a study/indictment of US interpersonal relationships."
"applescruff420-1","10","3","10","30 December 2007"," What a movie
","This movie is a masterpiece. The way people view it entirely depends on whether or not they can stick with it through to the end. The end is crazy, and Daniel Day-Lewis does maybe the best acting I've ever seen during this portion. People put too much weight on the confrontation at the end, because they're trying to find some greater meaning to all of it. But there is great truth in what takes place. At the end of the day, guys like Daniel Plainview (greedy bastards) always suck the life out of people weaker and less aggressive than them, just because they can. And DDL has already given us plenty of buildup to see how this guy got to be so insane and sociopathic. I never thought Eli Sunday was some kind of mirror image of Plainview. When I read that in other reviews I grimace at the screen. Eli is (or should I say was) as Daniel said, ""a sniveling ass"", and Daniel is ""the Third Revelation"". This Eli kid acted like he had everything under control the entire time. He thought he was a step ahead or smart or something. And Daniel Plainview just wanted so badly to completely eviscerate this kid. Plainview is too cocky to let any dumb kid try and appear cocky within a 100 mile radius of him and not throw down. He hates any competition (although it is what ultimately drives him, he is never an amiable participant), most of all having to compete with someone so frustratingly below his level. So for this kid to pop up again in his life at the point where he really has hit his hard-drinking, psychotic rock bottom, what could have possibly happened that doesn't at the end of this movie?<br/><br/>All in all, Daniel Day-Lewis is the greatest actor on screen today, hands down. The kid who plays H.W. is a real find, and Paul Dano does a great job of playing a pussy trying to be a man. And the score, cinematography, art direction, and direction in general are flawless. Best movie of the 00's."

","Wealth can destroy a human being's real purpose for existing An incredible masterpiece! Writer/Director Anderson does offer a good insight to approximately the first third of Sinclair's novel, drawing on the viewers' attention to the history of oil drilling, prospecting and oil speculation of the industry's early years. Using a darker approach for defining the times and for his characters' portrayals, he subjects his audience to reflect on the disastrous effects of capitalism and evangelism on the obsessed. Set in 4 phases of time frame  namely 1898, 1902, 1911 and 1927 - the elemental themes of greed, ambition, power, deceit and betrayal, and in a strange and subtle presentation, of adoptive parenting, flow gradually and solidly through the film to expose the declining morals of the characters visually generated through the superb performances of the cast members.<br/><br/>Money being the root of all evil seems to be the driving force behind this film's story and the viewers get to see how money leads to men's obsessive hunger to control and corrupts souls. Long distance traveling, as this film implies, proves not to be an obstacle for those lusting for it. And human greed for larger wealth and control can turn the obsessed into discontented and irresponsible brutal and insane beings. Does the film's title speak of the blood spill from the dangers of oil mining, or of the oil gushing out like blood from veins, or of blood-ties, or of the real blood oozing out of a dead corpse, or even of the Blood of Christ? Whatsoever it appears to be referencing to does indeed reach its most dramatic climax with the film's most astounding three-word last line that could easily apply to all the victims of their self-made fate.<br/><br/>This film does offer an amazing study of an assortment of interestingly intriguing characters, fabulously performed by a great cast of actors whose every move and presence mesmerizes. Daniel Day-Lewis is stunningly effective in his role as Daniel Plainview moving through scenes like an astoundingly celebrated and skillful Kabuki actor! Just watch his facial expressions and his hobbling gait! Paul Dano is just as convincing in his role, first as the mysterious capitalistic Paul, and then as the radical freak, Eli. Whether it's Plainview, Paul or Eli, one will get to listen to the farces they can pull with their gift of the gab and their salesman talk and deceit! Boy, did I cheer for the one who loses his hearing yep, he sure is saved from having to listen to all the deceitful spin.<br/><br/>The stylized cinematic appeal gushes with brilliantly austere and breathless takes, successfully combining the best cinematic aesthetics with thought-provoking content while Jonny Greenwood's soundtracks  string heavy and so intense - pound and creep against the background to provide some uncanny haunting moments. The first 20 minutes of this film's almost dialogue-free introductive collaboration is so dramatically surreal and emotionally gripping. It's the finest and most original piece of art direction I've seen! At the age of 37, P.T. Anderson has proved himself to be a phenomenal filmmaker in the class of the likes of Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, D.W. Griffith and John Ford! And this film is a testimony to what it means by a genuinely powerful and excellent masterpiece of film-making art and craftsmanship."

","I am huge movie fan and have seen many of the movies in the IMDb top 250 but i just can't understand why this film is so popular. The only reason i give it two is that the scenery is nice but that's about it. The acting is awful (Day Lewis totally overacts in every film) and the film just moves so slowly that after what felt like hours of my life i looked and realised it was only 25 minutes in. I fully appreciate why it was made that way but there was just nothing interesting about it. For me the plot of the film could of easily be fit into an hour and even then would be pushing it. After watching No Country For Old Men and In The Valley of Elah around the same time i felt that these films had more going for them, even know neither were great."
"pfogertyca","7","3","11","19 February 2008"," Worst...Ending...Ever
","The final scene of ""There Will Be Blood"" outranks the Pam Ewing it-was-all-a-dream sequence from ""Dallas"" as the most ridiculous story ending ever. For those who haven't seen Paul Thomas Anderson's latest Herculean effort, I won't spoil things by giving away details, but suffice it to say that it's as if Anderson suddenly realized he forgot to finish the screenplay, so he wrapped it all up with a little set piece featuring scenery chewing actors, gallons of booze, and a bowling pin. If this movie doesn't win Best Picture at the 2008 Academy Awards, it's because of the colossal failure of the film's last ten minutes.<br/><br/>Up until then, however, this turn of the century saga about raw ambition and the overwhelming desire to succeed is riveting. Daniel Day Lewis is very nearly flawless as anti-hero Daniel Plainview, who literally climbs from the bottom of the oil barrel to the top of the industry over a period of 30 years. Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, the slimy evangelist, is equally terrific and has no trouble holding his own against Lewis' awesome talent. Dillon Freasier, who plays Plainview's adopted son, is also remarkable, especially considering this young boy had no acting experience before being cast by Anderson.<br/><br/>The look of the movie is breathtaking, the musical score is haunting, and Anderson's attention to detail (right down to Lewis' permanently blackened fingernails) is fantastic. Everything clicks - and ""Blood"" almost becomes the finest epic film of the last five years.<br/><br/>But Anderson drops the ball - or shall I say the drill pipe - in the finale, with Lewis and Dano becoming caricatures while the film implodes upon itself like an over-stressed oil derrick. It's too bad Anderson hasn't yet learned how to wrap up a movie - remember the frog rainstorm in Magnolia? Yup - it's kinda like that.<br/><br/>But if you can block out the ending, ""There Will Be Blood"" certainly ranks as one of 2007's best and most ambitious efforts."
"charchuk","10","3","11","17 February 2008"," Masterful
","I'm not sure where to start with my praise.<br/><br/>I could talk about the story, how it tells both the tale of Plainview and the oil rush while also being about neither in particular. It's a narrative that could be told in any time, in any place in America, with any protagonist. It could just as easily be the saga of Howard Hughes or Henry Ford. But it's also very directly about oil. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br/><br/>I could talk about the acting, how Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show and is also very nearly matched by Paul Dano in his dual role where you're never really sure if there's two characters or not. But if Dano's performance is terrific, than Day-Lewis is nothing short of legendary. It will go down in history as one of the few outstanding one-man shows in cinema, up there with Orson Welles and Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>I could talk about the visuals, how every shot seems sprung out of the mind of an insane genius. The exploding oil well is the highlight, of course, but there's also the fantastic dialogue-free opening that wouldn't feel out of place in bloody 2001. Combined with the frantic, alien score and the impeccably accurate sets and costumes, this is a film that is both a period piece and something else entirely.<br/><br/>I could talk about the themes, but I'd take way too long. I could talk about the music over and over again. I could talk about the bloody credits. I could talk about the bowling alley and milkshakes and whiskey. But I'll just say this: ""I'm finished."""
"Solipsisticblog","10","3","11","21 January 2008"," A brutal original is one of the year's best
","A brutal, dazzling film. One of the year's best and a unique, uncompromised vision of evil. Director Paul Thomas Anderson's (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) latest film tells the story of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), a self-proclaimed ""oil man"" whose only engine is to acquire and export oil. Plainview is not as concerned with wealth as he is conquest. He wants to subdue the earth and have dominion over it. Accompanying him on his mission is his young son HW, a loyal, trusting boy and excellent prop with which to give the illusion of family values to prospective business partners.<br/><br/>Daniel's quest takes him to the struggling village of Little Boston, California which he hopes contains previously untapped oil wealth. Before he can possess the land, however, he must contend with the charismatic evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who has his own plans for the town of Little Boston.<br/><br/>The performances, as in previous Anderson films, are phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis once again allows his role to completely possess him and displays the same intensity and hatred that defined his Bill the Butcher character--the main reason to see Scorsese's muddled The Gangs of New York. Paul Dano, who played the son with the vow of silence in Little Miss Sunshine, amazes as the evangelist determined to subdue Plainview. Their power struggle provides the film's primary conflict and when the two share the screen, you are transfixed. The film's score by Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood is insistent, overwhelming, and ominous. Like the film it accompanies, it is unique and exquisite.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood will not be admired by all. Many will find it emotionally distant, its vision of humanity too bleak, its rhythms odd and off-putting. But Anderson has constructed a singular and completely new work unlike any that has come before. This will either make you supremely uncomfortable or amaze you in its audacity.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"ElijahCSkuggs","9","3","11","14 January 2008"," Paul Thomas Anderson's Absolute Best Film.
","Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's OIL!, Paul Thomas Anderson has created a character study about greed, fortune, and the abominable ways the human spirit can persevere.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing as Daniel Plainview, a miner turned oil man, whose singular goal in life is to make as much money as possible. He inherits a child, raises the boy as his own, and uses the boy's sweet face to sell his business and expand his riches.<br/><br/>Paul Dano of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE fame plays Paul/Eli Sunday; two characters in one, depending on your own view, who tells the booming and notorious Plainview of some latent oil on his family's land. Once a bargain is set, Plainview and his young son, H.W., set out to find this acreage, and upon discovering it, make even more dealings with the Sunday family.<br/><br/>With the new income and Plainview's ceaseless money, Eli Sunday plans on building his own church, spreading the good word, and escalating his own name into a seat of power. But Plainview sees something in Sunday that no one else does, and soon makes clear that no one but himself is in charge.<br/><br/>With negotiations done, the well is sprung, men are brought in from all over, and Plainview has yet another vast property with an ""ocean of oil"" beneath it. But when an unfortunate event arises, Plainview's contempt for his fellow man becomes clearer with each scene, and his free fall into madness accelerates.<br/><br/>TWBB has a variety of memorable scenes with DDL stealing every shot he is in; from his encounters with long lost relatives, corporate heads, or simple townsfolk, Plainview is a man who purposely lives his life through fraudulence, intimidating and outsmarting people with each crooked step he takes.<br/><br/>Dano and DDL met on the set of THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE, and it is very obvious, due to the sheer physicality of their on screen relationship, that their friendship and acting compatibility is one of the best to date.<br/><br/>An explosive and intense film with stellar acting, music (Jonny Greenwood) and direction; made by a myriad of expert filmmakers."

to me it's not even worth 5, only a niche kind of audience can appreciate that kind of cinema.. yeah the kind that lurk on online reviews and biais the rating like that..<br/><br/>So to sum it up, that movie was just pure hype, I'm not even sure most people saw it whole, but the name rings nicely for sure.. other than that it's a terrible movie, so unless you're on your own to watch it, save your friends/family, don't make them go through 2:30 of that"

The structure starts off very plain and does not get any better throughout the entire movie... The minimal dramatic aspects (or turning points) of the movie seem to be stretched out to somehow try and encompass the ""appointed"" 2 hours and 40 minute time frame. I have seen more excitement on a Youtube video then what this director has tried to portray out of this screenplay.... I think some advice from the master Robert McKee needs to taken into some consideration!!!! ""Curiosity is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns.

","What a boring, drawn-out, disjointed piece of garbage! I have been hanging out to see this film, and now I wonder why. It is worse than that other rubbish Pulp Fiction, jumping from one unrelated scene to another. The lead character slaps people around in public and no-one reacts. The deaf kid burns the cabin down and that is the last we hear of that. No punishment, rebuilding.....nothing. Acting involves using yourself and a script to tell a story. In this case, half the movie is shots of the lead character walking around, either doing nothing, or doing the same thing over and over. When he is doing something, there is no explanation by the characters, or the filmmaker as to what is going on. From what I can gather, he spends his days and nights walking around, banging stakes in the ground, and slapping and threatening people for little or no reason. To sum up, read my first sentence."

And in sometime in the future, it will be hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, if it hasn't already.<br/><br/>Most of the praise and hype seems to be focused around Daniel Day Lewis' performance, which, as although I find the movie to be overrated, he does deserve all the praise that he has been given for it. This film features great performances from all of its cast members.<br/><br/>But a good cast never means a good movie, and frankly, There will be blood is too long, and too boring. There Will Be Blood tries too hard to create tension, and often fails. This film features huge gaps of time where it seems nothing is happening, and I think its safe to assume that Paul Thomas Anderson wanted us to guess if something is going on- creating tension. But as the score screeches into our ears it is pesky and annoying. It's boring and emotionally detached in a sense. There will Be Blood may be, from a technical standpoint, a great film, but it's a draining movie that sinks in its flaws. A big disappointment. 6/10."
"skinnyjoeymerlino","Null","2","6","15 September 2011"," For Those Who call Movies ""Film"" and use the word ""auteur"" in regular conversation
","Paul Thomas Anderson directed this very loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" and set out to make a epic masterpiece for the ages, using Kubrickian cinematography with the epic performance of Daniel Day Lewis and a foreboding chilling score of screeching violins. Critics and film snobs hailed ""There Will Be Blood"" as the best movie of the first decade of the Millennium. Praise was given for ""There Will Be Blood""'s subversive content, multiple levels of meaning, and in-depth character study of an amoral psychopath. <br/><br/>The first twenty minutes or so open with long slow, plodding panning by the camera over the Texas desert. That glacial pace establishes the tone for the rest of the movie, with interminable amounts of time where nothing happens. The central character is a cold-hearted bastard named Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day Lewis, in a rehash of his cold-hearted bastard turn in ""Gangs of New York"", only more evil. Plainview steps over anyone and anything to make a buck in the oil industry: using an orphan as a prop to gain sympathy, cheating honest people out of their land, pretending to find God so he can build an oil pipeline(?) and killing people along the way. The foreboding score establishes mood as if something epic is going to happen in the final reel. <br/><br/>Unfortunately nothing really does. After seeing three decades or so of Plainview's life he begins as an evil despicable man, becomes an evil despicable man, and ends as an evil despicable man. Instead of the grand finale that the audience interminably waits for, the final scene comes out of nowhere with a preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) that Plainview hates coming to Plainview to beg for money(also out of nowhere). Plainview yells about milkshakes, bludgeons Sunday to death with a bowling pin, then tells the butler ""I'm finished."" The End. <br/><br/>Raoul Walsh told the same story of an amoral psychopath with the gangster drama ""White Heat"" way back in 1949. Watch the final scene of White Heat where the great, great James Cagney as Cody Jarret stands on steel grating atop a chemical plant,laughing maniacally as bullets whiz by and fuel tanks blaze, yelling ""Made it Ma! Top of the World!"" just before the whole thing explodes in a giant inferno. There's an ending. And Walsh managed to do it with 42 less minutes than Paul Thomas Anderson does with ""There Will Be Blood"".<br/><br/>Whenever the guy typing this review mentions ""White Heat"" to fans of ""There Will Be Blood"" it is inevitable that they haven't seen it. Instead of Hollywood classics from the Golden Age, they prefer the too-cool-for-everything worldview of ""There Will Be Blood"" with its lack of storyline, laborious pacing, bleakness, nihilism and cheap potshots at the Christian faith. Perhaps Paul Thomas Anderson has personally adopted this schadenfreude worldview as he sadistically forces the viewer to realize they have wasted 2 hours and 38 minutes of their precious lifetime that cannot be given back."

","Writer-directors are a rare breed: they believe they can do most everything but in fact while they can pontificate about directing they are mostly utterly useless at the craft of writing. This is evident in this portentous bore of a film which is a metaphorical exploration of a businessman like Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>It constantly portends to something interesting - even dramatic within a time period and between other characters - but never ever does so. Exactly like Citizen Kane this is so incompletely written that it fails to be dramatic in anyway and is another magazine article with pictures of a person's biography. It is story telling in pastiche mode.<br/><br/>It should also be said that the music score was one of the worst ever in a major film: repetitive, annoying, misplaced with the screen action and the quotes from the classical repertoire lacked the intelligence of a Godard when does he the same thing. It was jejune.<br/><br/>The only people who should be unfortunate enough to watch this long winded and self important piece of overstuffed film making are other writer directors."

","It makes me nervous to write a review on a film I rate so differently from the majority of viewers, nevertheless, perhaps in a way that's reason enough to do it at all.<br/><br/>The initial setting is promising enough - greedy shrewd oil man cons religious family into parting with land that stands to make a killing in oil. It is written in the Hollywood bible that of course the righteous will prevail and the wrongdoer fail in the end.<br/><br/>The problem for me was that firstly the film reaches its logical conclusion early on with the oilman's son being struck dumb in a spectacular accident but that the rest of the film seems largely dedicated to finding new but unremarkable ways to prolong the agonising damnation of the same oilman, not adding any heightening of suspense from that premature conclusion, albeit that circumstances do change as the film winds its way over several hours to the end. <br/><br/>The plot should have been scrapped and rewritten from scratch early on in the process - I guess it's that old rule that the more money is committed the harder it is to retrace your steps to the point of failure."
"lee-p-sherman","3","2","6","25 March 2010"," Two and a Half Hours of Boring Non-Plot
","In 2007, everybody was singing the praises of two movies, ""Transformers"" and ""There Will Be Blood."" I saw ""Transformers"" in theaters, and it was awful. I didn't see ""There Will Be Blood"" until early 2010, and, while it appeals to the human psyche on a much higher level than ""Transformers,"" it's about as bad. In both cases I'm at a loss to understand why so many people fail to recognize poor film-making when they see it.<br/><br/>This is a two and a half hour movie where very little happens, and what does happen scarcely constitutes a plot. Instead of a story, it's a number of disconnected sequences. Any synopsis I write would seem more like a real story than what the movie actually tells, due to the inherent human trait of connecting and making sense of things, even when they're disparate and devoid of meaning.<br/><br/>You would have every reason go into this movie expecting greatness. After all, it's written, directed, and produced by P. T. Anderson, it stars Daniel Day-Lewis, and it won two Oscars. I don't know if I'd even blame you for thinking this review must be nonsense. But the whole is less than the sum of its parts, and the movie is a waste of time. A lot of time. It's the same length as a seven-part ""Doctor Who"" serial (not counting credits etc.). In fact, I think that's a good way to illustrate how poorly this film uses its time.<br/><br/>The first three and a half minutes of Part 1 are lengthy shots of the film's protagonist, Daniel Painview, digging an oil well, with no dialog, narration, or music. This was my first warning, but hey, not every movie can open with an exploding moon knocking a coffee cup off a table or planes dropping napalm while a Doors song plays. What follows is an illustration of how Daniel became an oil man and how his business operates now (the year 1911). Part 1 closes with a young man named Eli Sunday telling him about land where oil has been discovered.<br/><br/>We're a ways into Part 2 before the first inklings of a dramatic conflict appear. Near the end, Daniel buys up all the land in the area, except for part that's owned by an old man who he can't be bothered to meet with in person. Eli and others continue to have misgivings about him. We also learn that, while Daniel appears to be an honest, friendly family man, this is actually a façade. He's a shrewd businessman, and a skillful liar. Construction of the derrick is finally underway when Part 2 ends.<br/><br/>In Part 3 we learn that Eli is head of a local church. Daniel doesn't let him bless the well before drilling begins, which happens about halfway through Part 3 (notice the rate of progress here). Eli, the most sympathetic character so far, turns out to have all the makings of an ""X-Files"" guest star. He's insane. He has multiple personality disorder. He is sometimes Eli, and sometimes his twin brother Paul. He believes he's a faith healer and an exorcist. His congregation think he's the real deal. The cliffhanger that ends Part 3 would be an eruption of natural gas at the oil well.<br/><br/>What passes of a plot in this movie gets underway in Part 4. The disaster destroys the derrick and leaves Daniel's son, H. W., permanently deaf. He's also portrayed as mentally ill in Part 4, though this thread is dropped later. We jump forward to where Daniel has three working oil wells and is coming unhinged. He and Eli have the inevitable falling-out. Daniel meets a con man claiming to be his long-lost half-brother.<br/><br/>Daniel ships H. W. off to some kind of care home at the beginning of Part 5. He's very rich now, and continues to act unhinged, though he's mainly portrayed as consciously evil rather than mentally ill. Part 5 concludes with him uncovering and killing the con man.<br/><br/>In Part 6, Daniel gets away with the murder, buys the land of the old man he didn't meet with earlier, and builds an oil pipeline through it. The condition is that he has to become a member of the old man's church, which happens to be the one Crazy Eli leads. They shame Daniel into taking back his son. A brief montage shows H. W. growing up rather normally and getting married.<br/><br/>Part 7 consists of two scenes set in 1927. That's right, two scenes take up more than twenty minutes. In the first one, Daniel disowns his son, who has grown up to believe in the values that Daniel only pretended to believe in. In the other, Eli asks for Daniel to help his church (including paying money he's owed for sixteen years). Daniel humiliates and murders him.<br/><br/>And that's it. These few events, lacking any real rising action, falling action, overarching conflict, or resolution, take up two and a half hours. Contrast that to what happens in a seven-part ""Doctor Who"" serial, or seven episodes of ""Escaflowne,"" or three and a half episodes of ""24,"" or two and a half hours of any other work of dramatic storytelling that's worth the time it takes to watch it.<br/><br/>Before I finish, I have to say this movie could be worse. It's directed by somebody who really knows how to put a shot together. There's nothing wrong with the cast, and some of them really sell their characters (especially Paul Dano as Eli Sunday). The writing is mostly believable and self-consistent. It's just directionless, pointless, and dramatized at a testudineous pace. I should have spent the time watching a seven-part ""Doctor Who"" serial, because they're all better than ""There Will be Blood."" Even the one where mad scientists force Martians in British spacesuits to rob banks."

Someone is using his guile to dupe us sheep into giving away our money for no good reason, namely this film.<br/><br/>This movie should only be viewed by those who loved Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"", on which this film is based. The cinematography is excellent. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent, as usual. But the film is nothing more than a moving-picture-slide-show of the key scenes from Sinclair's novel. There is no coherence, rationality, or depth to this film. We never feel compelled to root for a sympathetic character. Granted, Daniel Plainview is a monster, but there should still be a hook in the film. There is none. The director relies on our patience, or resistance to just walk out, to hold us in our seat.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film but it is only for the extremely patient. One should also not be squeamish. There are scenes of very realistic violence and harsh emotional abuse.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give this one star is that it is watchable. (Keeping in mind that I have never been able to sit through Annie Hall.) A great book does not automatically make a great movie.

","The English language has its limitations. A sorcerer could not conjure up enough negative adjectives to properly describe this two hour and 38 minutes of film wasted on an absurd and insane movie about an absurd and insane man and the seemingly hapless people he intimidates and berates with his insanity. After the first thirty minutes you began to wonder if the movie will be interminable. Then you realize the answer is yes. And during the endless boredom of its interminability it is fragmented, senseless, pointless, dull, ridiculous and insultingly banal. If you have not seen this movie I envy you. I wish I had not. While watching it you may keep thinking soon, soon it will make sense. A plot, a point, a focus will emerge and there will be an actual story instead of a piecemeal collage of scenes of insane raving and insane acts. The producer and director could have saved time and money by going to an inane asylum and following the most violent and deranged inmate around with a camera. And it would have made more sense."

","First off - Best Acting Oscar? What a load of rubbish! DDL plays a caricature throughout. He's either doing an impression of Sean Connery playing a pantomime villain, or a camped-up sheriff in a bad western. This should have been called 'There will be boredom'. Two hours of endless yawns, where I failed to feel a thing for any of the characters. It was so unclear what this was about. Was it about a father and son relationship? Greed against good? God against oil? None of the above were realized in this arduous and thoroughly pointless epic. Basically, if you enjoy watching an actor pull off all the tricks, you'll like this. But if you like a well-paced story, with humor and drama, you must admit this is trash. Okay, so it was quite atmospheric at times, with the droning soundtrack and the bleak and expansive landscapes. But this hardly qualifies it for award consideration. It's just a vehicle for DDL, and if you think he's good you'll like it, but he's not. The milk shake monologue at the end is cringe-worthy. What a waste of time. Pretentious and slow film-making at its worst. Oh yeah, and yet another movie without a meaningful part for a woman."

","I always see this movie lumped along with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as two of the ""new greats"", but if I am to be completely honest, this was another disappointment. So I guess it's fitting that I feel similarly about both. Daniel Day-Lewis was pretty intense in his part, yes... even though it often seemed like he was putting on a caricature. If it weren't for his seedy and gradually more declining snake of an unscrupulous oil businessman there wouldn't have been much to stick around for. I had to love the photography and locations, which really gave this picture a vivid feel for the early 1900s. Just about all the scenes featuring both Day-Lewis and Paul Dano (who played the overbearing young preacher) were fun, and often times downright laughable - whether intended or not. The relationship between Daniel and his son was involving.<br/><br/>But when I got right down to it, I had to ask ""what's the point?"". I haven't read Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel called ""OIL!"", on which this film was based; so I guess it's yet another tale of what money, greed, power, authority, and religious obsession can do to people? And I had to honestly ask myself if I would have even bothered, had THERE WILL BE BLOOD not been praised at the Oscars? Was it worth dedicating two and a half hours of my life to? Will I ever desire to watch this again and again? For a lot of movie buffs I think this film is a good example of trying to savor something that's popular and deemed an exceptional movie when it's really not all that. I can't imagine that some of the ratings would actually be as high as they are for this, had it never been highly touted, or if there were no pre-conceived standards for it. I found myself almost liking the good qualities about it enough to stretch it to a more respectable three stars, especially considering its supreme status... but forget that. Liking the acting and cinematography, a few odd sequences now and then, but ultimately wishing it was at least 45 minutes shorter and checking the clock ... that can't be ""good"". **1/2 out of ****"

","I bailed at 2 hours and 13 minutes. I don't care how it ends. Why is it that filmmakers think dragging viewers through unneeded minutia is art? There are wide shots in this film that I could have shot and directed. Perhaps the director forgot to shoot a close-up. Do we need to see a father, barely a speck on the screen, walk all the way to the group returning his son to him and then watch him and his son keep on walking and walking and walking into another scene. For what? To say you did all this in one shot? A first year film student could do that. It certainly doesn't come close to rivaling the opening shot in Touch of Evil. And in Citizen Kane, Welles covered far more sweeping material in 119 minutes (instead of 158!). Attenborough covered Ghandi in 188 minutes, and this was one of the most epoch stories of the 20th Century. Even Upton Sinclair would not have put mired his readers with such tediousness. Reminds me of Kevin Costner's attempt at Wyatt Earp, where the movie really starts when the badge is pinned on Wyatt's shirt, about an hour in. Don't confuse screen time with quality. This flick needs a tough edit, at least 45 minutes."
"galensaysyes","4","2","6","2 November 2008"," But couldn't there be some life along with it?
","Movies have probably grown worse over the years, generally speaking. But in this century and the years immediately preceding, they've grown worse in a weirdly unpleasant way, or combination of ways. The why and how are mysterious.<br/><br/>I'm referring only to serious movies. Not romantic comedies, which are only a little worse than they ever were, or blood-and-thunder adventure stories, which are probably a little better, or at least bigger. I'm referring to the movies that never crack a smile and, if any spectator should be injudicious enough to do so, wipe it right off his face. There Will Be Blood is one of these. So it isn't uniquely bad, but it's worse, or at any rate less easily watchable, than most others. I believe that's because it was made by a director, and with a star, who were out of their element.<br/><br/>So sober have movies become these days that their very titles are threats: There Will Be Blood; No Country for Old Men; Atonement. They warn us that they're going to be no fun, so don't even look for it. And they deliver on the threat.<br/><br/>Every couple of decades, movies go through a phase of ordeals, of putting the audience through the mill. Sometimes the object is just to sell the show by challenging people to see if they're tough enough to take it; other times, as lately, the object is redemption, or the illusion of it. The movies are a penance for our imagined sins, and after suffering through them we're supposed to emerge purified, or feeling purified. And Hollywood always this kind of movie for Oscars, as though in an effort to be purged of its sins, too.<br/><br/>Only now, following in the classic American tradition of both eating our cake and having it, the redemption is at second hand: we're no longer expiating our own sins but someone else's, putting us two up morally. In the era of There Will Be Blood, the wrongdoers aren't us, aren't characters we can identify ourselves with; they're the other guy: probably, in these war years, the President who ""started"" it.<br/><br/>The movies seek to improve us, not to interest us. This used to be their primary concern, but they gave it up at the onset of the 90s, and now don't even make the pretense of enlisting our attention. Evidently they feel they don't need it any more, and they're perfectly right. Once their success depended on the audience's good will; now they're all presold in advance and have no need to cater to anybody.<br/><br/>As a pair of contrasting examples, take My Left Foot and this movie (which, coincidentally, star the same actor). My Left Foot, which came at the close of the prior era, the era of audience involvement, opened with the main character putting a record on a gramophone and switching the gramophone on--all using his foot. I defy anyone who sees that not to want to find out who the person is that can do that.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood opens with the main character picking away in a mine, and keeps on him doing this for possibly fifteen minutes. Who he is, where he is, and what he's about, other than mining, we don't know. We're not even granted a voice-over narration, of the type to which almost every movie nowadays succumbs to avoid having to do its job.<br/><br/>This abundance of voice-overs testifies to the same fault as our uninvolvement in the movies: the movies are incompletely written, their stories not fully worked out, their characters only half-understandable. Reviewers sometimes point out the unsatisfactory endings, not noticing that they're unsatisfactory because the beginnings and middles were the same. If the stories were sound, and the movie makers stuck to them, they'd go a long way toward making up for, or rectifying, the other faults described.<br/><br/>In There Will Be Blood, when the story finally does start, it doesn't move naturally, but lurches or lunges from one tableau to another. Eventually it becomes more consecutive, but it never unbends. In this, too, it's typical of today's movies. They assume a stiff and sober demeanor, like someone dressed up in mourning clothes that are too tight; rigid in posture, slow of step. They're movies that can hardly move.<br/><br/>This one didn't have to be that way. Daniel Day Lewis, who dominates it utterly, is by nature a restricted and restricting actor, but there have been times when he's been able to break free of his bonds. Always this has been when he's playing a character who's analogously blocked and has to fight through what's blocking him, cf. Christy in My Left. His role in this movie is the opposite, freewheeling and unbounded: a zealous proselytizer for free enterprise. It's a part for a big, expansive actor, and out of Lewis's natural range. So is the American accent he affects, which becomes a kind of speech impediment and renders the emotional meanings of his scenes almost uninterpretable.<br/><br/>The director is on the wrong track also. In a previous movie, Punch Drunk Love, Paul Thomas Anderson showed his natural metier was comedy--pessimistic screwball comedy, to judge by that movie, which was lovely and intuitive. Anderson could be the next Preston Sturges. But here he's being Terence Malick, with a static, disjointed historical epic whose eye that keeps drifting toward the landscape and whose leading character talks funny. The difference from Malick's movies is that they're always watchable and occasionally light up the past, albeit in flashes. They indicate that Malick is given to meditating on the past, whereas this movie indicates Anderson is little at home there, and isn't particularly meditative. He's a good guy and a talented moviemaker; he's simply in the wrong ballpark.<br/><br/>A serious film--the real thing--is not that hard to differentiate from the would-bes. It has that within which passeth show; these but the trappings and the suits of woe."

","There Will Be Blood is undeniably a fascinating film, but while it entices the palate with a barrage of unexpected flavors, it offers little in the way of fulfilling sustenance.<br/><br/>Jonny Greenwood deserves a lot of the credit for making this film as gripping as it is--his score provides a menacing, off-kilter tone for much of the film. As much of the credit belongs to Day-Lewis, however, who keeps us on edge with a fury barely contained by his well-spoken demeanor.<br/><br/>Where the film falls flat is in both characterization and ill-wrought social commentary. While Day-Lewis' Plainview character remains interesting throughout the film, he is never likable and rarely sympathetic. The couple of somewhat sympathetic characters get a small share of the screen time.<br/><br/>The problem is not that the main character is also the villain of the piece. Most recently, The Dark Knight has demonstrated that this can work very well indeed. The problem is that the only characters attempting to fight Plainview's sick ambition are just as evil or misguided as he is.<br/><br/>The worst thing I can say about There Will Be Blood, though, is that it professes to treat with both capitalism and religion, and does neither with anything approaching a careful hand, much less an even one.<br/><br/>Director Paul Anderson can't seem to decide whether the religious are insane or phony, but he seems certain that they are one of the two. It's a broad brush that attempts no understanding and falls totally flat.<br/><br/>Capitalism, on the other hand, is only touched upon; It is not demonized as horribly as religion is, but neither is it discussed in any meaningful way. Anderson seems to want to say something about it, but there is little insight to be found here.<br/><br/>The world of There Will Be Blood is populated by despicable people, and I could never bring myself to care about their goals or desires. I kept watching, because the story was presented in an edgy, different way, but I was never rewarded for my commitment.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is an ambitious movie that professes to greatness but achieves only edginess. It is ultimately an empty, unsatisfying experience that leaves you wanting something more--something the film never provides."

","Very weak screenplay with little to create real character. The unlucky actors have almost no material and unfortunately must do what the director asks, which is mostly under- or overacting, depending on the scene, almost none of which seems real. The actual dialog, if you can call it dialog, sounds like an attempt at period speech, but is not at all convincing in that regard. Moreover, the musical accompaniment on the soundtrack is obtrusive, distracting, and calls attention to its supposed high-mindedness. The whole enterprise seems to be the product of a director who, like the characters in the story, such as it is, has gone off the deep end with rather high self regard. The rating this film has received on this site is inexplicable, except to say that the majority of viewers must have been taken in by the excess of pretentious drivel."

","This is a wannabe Hollywood Epic. It's boring and overrated. It centers on bashing Christians and oil tycoons - two for the price of one in Hollywood. The main character played by Daniel Day Lewis is a skeleton: no meat, all bones: and I'm not being literal. We don't get to know him at all. Lewis overacts by making up a totally fake accent, that sounds like he's doing a John Huston imitation. Although the first hour isn't bad. Things build well as we see his rise to power through - basically - hard work and a lot of trickery: the same way bigwigs in Hollywood come to power, although with movies as opposed to oil. But after the main character - Daniel Plainview - starts to run into ""family problems"": his son going deaf, a transient pretending to be his brother, the film starts to tread in muddy water. And I don't blame Lewis and his overacting; Paul Dano gives the most hammy performance as a ""faith healer"" that I've ever seen in my life. His performance made Lewis seem subtle. This is an eight foot ballerina, and watching it I felt it landing on me."

This is a film I would show in any Cinema class. Every future director should appreciate this film for it's formal perfection. But that's it. I couldn't tell whether Daniel's character was too complex or too simple to be INTERESTING. In this journey, you escalate towards chaos at a boringly constant pace. Never drawn to it, never surprised by it. I tried to like it. I looked for the metaphors, the edge, the anxiety, but it just wasn't there - it wasn't ACESSIBLE. I paradoxically felt I looked into a work of art which was deprived of humanity. I reckon it was Mr.Lewis' fault. I soon saw the evil that lied deep within his eyes. You didn't need 2 and 1/2 hours to get to know Daniel Plainview.Hell, you just needed a photograph. If you are enthralled by technical details, watch it.

","Don't believe the hype. I was definitely interested in the film, and eager to watch when I grabbed a copy of it. The PG rating threw me off, in knowing it had a major villain in it, and with the title ""There Will Be Blood"", but from the good ratings I was still very intrigued.<br/><br/>But throughout the 2hrs and near 30min of this movie, I realized it was definitely not as exciting as I thought it would be. Sure, a few scenes such as the oil-explosion scene were intense, and seeing Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) completely throw his son away as he leaves him on a train concreted him as a villain, but with high expectations after seeing No Country For Old Men, it was rather a dull movie.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's ""Anton Chigurh"" character in No Country For Old Men is a far more exciting and cold character than Mr. Plainview is. There Will Be Blood is dragged out and should really be maybe between an hr and two. The director drags on scenes for minutes for no importance other than to attempt and make it powerful. I like the idea, but doing it in every scene makes the movie seem overly long.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good dramatic film for anyone looking for a long, somewhat meaningful movie of a selfish man not caring about anything except power. Ones looking for an action movie or anything from a boring-2hr-30min-drama should not decide on this film, but rather a far more riveting movie in the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men."

Eli is equally uninteresting, and we never really get to know the son. Some of the dialogue is clever, but it's never clever enough to save this movie from the overwhelming miasma of depression cast by the hideous protagonist and the appallingly slow movement of the story. I understand the use of empty spaces and immobility in a film. Malick, Sayles, Kubrick, and Haynes have all managed to produce brilliant moments of exposition in which nothing actually happens and little is visible, but this movie just doesn't reach those heights.<br/><br/>Finally, worst of all, the sound track is just ghastly. It's like Philip Glass on Quaaludes.

","This is one of the most over-rated movies in recent history. Upton Sinclair, who wrote the novel on which this film is based, was one of the original ""muckrakers,"" noted for his deep-rooted anger, not for his subtlety. This is an unsubtle film and, while Daniel Day-Lewis was awarded an Oscar for his starring role, I felt that, in the Upton Sinclair tradition, he acted excessively. To be sure his character was conniving and ruthless but even when he is poor and struggling to locate his first well, Day-Lewis is already portraying him as a villain to hiss. The story may develop and evolve but Day-Lewis does not (though he is sober at the beginning and a drunk at the end). Day-Lewis plays a single note throughout the picture which is disagreeable and unenlightening. Upton Sinclair belonged to a particular period in history and, far from bringing some new 21st Century insight, he is best left where he was -- in the age of the robber barons. His books are not often read today for a good reason. They are too heavy-handed -- as is ""There Will Be Blood."" I feel generous in rating it at ""4."""

","Blood, oil and religion seem to be the heated topics for this version of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"", and the presentation is starkly realistic from beginning to end, with DANIEL DAY-LEWIS giving another one of his towering performances in the central role of a corrupt, guilt-ridden man who can't talk about his evil deeds.<br/><br/>His antagonist is a preacher (PAUL DANO) of hellfire and damnation, played with an oily mixture of naiveté and money madness, who wants his fair share of the wealth on his doorstep. It's really the battle between these two men that grips most of the story and leads to a startling climax.<br/><br/>While all the performances are valid enough, it's a shame to see CIARIN HINDS so wasted in a role that barely gives him a chance to utter more than a few lines as a steadfast friend. More prominent in the supporting cast are DILLON FREASIER as the boy adopted by Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) when his real father is killed in a mining accident toward the beginning of the story. The boy is led to believe that he is the real son, only because Day-Lewis wants to use him and his innocent face as a way to secure deals. When the boy is a grown man and wants to move away with his new bride, Day-Lewis ruthlessly exposes the truth about him being an orphan and banishes him from his life with hateful curses.<br/><br/>All of this is never fully explained, but we do know that he has a hatred for most people which he openly admits to a man who poses as his long lost brother Henry (KEVIN J. O'CONNOR). Here too, we can sense a dangerous relationship built on lies and moving toward a violent climax.<br/><br/>DANIEL DAY-LEWIS inhabits his role with great intensity and although he is said to base his speech pattern on John Huston, he looks and sounds like he's chanelling Walter Huston as he appeared in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" as the old prospector. There are moments when his facial expression reflects the sort of penetrating gaze and wicked gleam in his eyes that Walter Huston had. It's almost uncanny. At any rate, Day-Lewis certainly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for this gripping film, stark but relentlessly moving and sometimes emotionally draining to watch."

His joy & pride, and enthusiasm were very inspiring. But the movie lets one down. It seems more a vehicle for his acting than his acting was to tell the story. The overall mood was one of uncertainty, apprehension, pending disaster. Plainview himself is an uneven, uncertain character.

His love for the child certainly seemed genuine whatever his stated reason for adopting him. Very impressed with Paul Dano whom I did not remember from ""Ballad"""

The third act is virtually unnecessary - after 15 years, none of the principal characters have changed.<br/><br/>Additionally, the impact of the climax is diminished by Daniel Plainview's previous murderous actions - there are no surprises after 150 minutes.

However, the music and the movie itself couldn't win an Oscar which I think is not fair.<br/><br/>The music has been similar to the old classics in the sense that it did not create a feeling for the moment to unfold, it created a feeling for the whole movie in itself to unfold.

"bobsgrock","10","2","6","22 February 2008"," A mind-blowing masterpiece.
","Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a stunning achievement on multiple levels that overlap and dissipate in the mind of the viewer. After seeing it the first time, I walked out of the theater bewildered and amazed. Certainly I had seen a great film; the cinematography, editing, direction, writing and acting were all the finest offered by American cinema. Yet, I wasn't entirely ready for the viewing. I had hardly heard of Anderson prior to this, so I couldn't put the film in its proper context.<br/><br/>Having now seen all five of Anderson's features, I am still totally enthralled but also more knowledgeable of what his vision was and what it means. The main theme is the battle between two of America's central elements: capitalism vs. religion. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) represents the former, shown as a giant of biblical proportions with and evil and demonic twist. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) is the latter; smaller, weaker yet just as ambitious and pragmatic. Each side knows what it wants and is willing to go to any lengths to get it. The main problem lies within the conflict that arises from them getting in each others way. There is also the notion of parental neglect, something Anderson visits frequently in his work, and the effect it has on both the child and parent.<br/><br/>As if the thematic material wasn't rich enough, Anderson has also crafted a finely-tuned piece of cinema that fits together like a classical opera. Each element is richly photographed by the great Robert Elswitt and sublimely edited by Dylan Tichenor. Anderson was fortunate in casting Day-Lewis, perhaps the Marlon Brando of this generation, and he uses him most advantageously. From the opening sequence, we understand this character is larger than life, fully formed and able to cause growth and pain simultaneously. Day-Lewis plays him full of fire, passion and blood-thirst in a performance that certainly won't be equaled for quite a few years. Anderson's direction also deserves praise. He maintains the pace and plot quite nicely, never letting it run off the tracks until it needs to; the final sequence. Many have criticized this move but after multiple viewings I think it was correctly done in order to show the final panorama of influence Plainview had on this community.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the general audience, and I would advise anyone who is not a serious cinema lover to watch it. At times, it is quite confounding and like most of Anderson's work it can seem very pretentious. Still, if you are ready and willing to go down this dark path of American greed, cynicism and spirituality, Anderson and Day-Lewis are willing to take you there."
"lor_","Null","2","6","12 February 2008"," Powerful anti-success story
","Adding my praise to director Anderson and especially thespians Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, I have a couple of reactions to There Will Be Blood that hopefully are not repetitive or redundant.<br/><br/>First of all, growing up and addicted to the TV movie packages, my favorite film genre was a subset of the popular Warner Bros. 1930s movies. Edward G. Robinson starred in many vehicles which had an almost rubber-stamped, surefire format: he was a self-made man who rose to the top in the first few reels, only to reveal numerous tragic flaws that brought him down down down to oblivion by the fadeout. Never a happy ending, but always extremely satisfying to watch his familiar arc -enjoy his heady success, and learn (esp. for a youngster like me) from his tremendous errors. Everybody knows Little Caesar, but more typical for E.G. Robinson were the films Silver Dollar (he gets ruined by the Gold Standard); I Loved a Woman (E.G. as unscrupulous Meat Packing magnate); Dark Hazard (about dog racing); and others.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is the first film I've seen in a long time that brings back this format, though of course much harder edged than in the 1930s. Daniel Day Lewis is quite a different actor than Robinson, but both faultlessly engender sympathy for their characters, even when the fictional guys are doing reprehensible things.<br/><br/>The other issue came up this weekend when I mentioned There Will Be Blood to a friend who said she hadn't seen it because she heard it contained ""gratuitous violence"". I immediately looked it up and the dictionary defines gratuitous as ""unwarranted"". The debate over gratuitous violence is certain to continue for a long time, but I don't believe the violence is unwarranted in There Will Be Blood. And recall the previous epicenter of this debate, Sam Peckinpah, who in his ongoing opposition to the Vietnam war was outspoken in his wish to ""rub our noses in it"" when he staged the memorably violent scenes in his films of that period, notably Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch. The central theme of Straw Dogs was the Territorial Imperative, a theme very well handled by Anderson in There Will Be Blood."

","A gripping film from Paul Thomas Anderson. Expertly photographed and designed, with some amazing set pieces, including an oil-field fire which will bring back unpleasant memories for those of us who remember America's first war with Iraq, which may well have been in the director's mind: Mr Anderson is not afraid of powerful symbolism, as admirers of Magnolia will recall.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a tale of single-minded acquisitiveness and greed. The central character, Daniel Plainview (great name!) is not able to tolerate any opposition or competition. Various stumbling-blocks, entrepreneurial and/or emotional, present themselves, the longest lasting ending in an extraordinary stand-off between Plainview and a fellow opportunist, played superbly by Paul Dano.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, but the time flies by. In fact for me the final half-hour or so is over-compressed, as though material from the source novel by Upton Sinclair was being glossed over by the movie's final time-jump. Probably unavoidable, and almost certainly the right decision, but I wonder if there are cut scenes that might surface in the DVD release...Regardless of this, the final scene is extraordinary.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is breathtaking as Plainview. It's not just the sheer charisma of the man: the size of the performance, the truth of every moment, the complexity of thought that is shown crystal-clearly to the audience without any feeling of telegraphing, the sustaining of character through long takes with on occasions enormous physical demands: all this is jaw-dropping stuff.<br/><br/>In accepting an award for his role, Day-Lewis mentioned the passing of Heath Ledger, and has had some stick for it in the press because the two had never met, yet Day-Lewis was clearly moved at the passing of his fellow actor. For me it's clear that Ledger's performance in Brokeback Mountain has something in common with Day-Lewis's performance in There Will Be Blood, and that is this sense of uniqueness: the role and the actor were an all-time perfect match. As it was impossible to imagine any of Heath Ledger's contemporaries finding a way of triumphing over the challenges of bringing Ennis del Mar to life, it's equally impossible to imagine any of Day-Lewis' contemporaries scaling the heights, and plumbing the depths, of Daniel Plainview. Actually, in Day-Lewis' case, it's hard to imagine any of his predecessors managing it either. Not even Nicholson or Bogart, neither of whom could bring grandeur to the role - no disrespect to either: it's just that grandeur wasn't their thing. They made their careers at least in part by undercutting grandeur. Which leaves only, maybe, John Huston, who was able to blend a certain patrician quality with gnarled pragmatism in his few screen roles But could he have technically sustained the acting bravura of Day-Lewis in, say, the baptism scene of There Will Be Blood? I don't think so.<br/><br/>To sum up, this is a masterful movie, with a benchmark central performance."
"Jonny_Numb","8","2","6","3 February 2008"," Tainted Blood
","(Spoilers ahoy.) <br/><br/>Regular viewers of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup should be familiar with the grotesque, hilariously offensive parody show ""Robot Chicken."" A recurring in-joke involves director M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"") popping up periodically to make the following declaration: ""What a twist!"" And while I'll be the first to admit that narratively desperate films that trot out manufactured twists bother me very little (maybe since something like ""Saw IV"" has nowhere to go but down in the first place), films like ""The Prestige"" (which twisted me into cold indifference) and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood""films of no small qualitywound up diminishing my overall high opinion of them.<br/><br/>Yet before I get around to the closing 30 minutes of ""Blood,"" in which an otherwise sturdy narrative becomes unhinged, let me comment on the first 120.<br/><br/>I had never seen a PT Anderson film before this, so I came in with a bit of skepticism. I tend to be wary of films that get released late in the year for the sole purpose of unleashing the torrents of critical praise and opening the Oscar-nod floodgates (even more prominent with the Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men""), but ""There Will Be Blood"" kept me engrossed quite well. Despite the lengthy run time, the film itself doesn't feel long, and the lush cinematography (by Robert Elswit) and dusty locationsplus fine attention to costume and set designproperly evokes the physical look and technique of the early classics of cinema. This is one of the most unassuming, understated ""epic"" films I've ever seen, with machinations so subtle that periodic revelations hit with bruising force.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil-driller at the turn of the 20th Century who quickly rises to riches and notoriety. He's driven, and makes up for his lack of persuasive skills with a shrewd cleverness that only underlines his bitter hatred and disgust toward humanityat one point, he's negotiating with the railroad managers and wonders what he'll do with even more riches. Plainview has a band of trusted workers, and trots his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), along to his meetings with clients and townsfolk. Early on, Plainview is approached by Eli Sunday (Paul Dano""Little Miss Sunshine""), who claims to know of a place rich with oil, and will guide the driller to it, for a price. As it turns out, Eli is the leader of the local dustbowl parish, and quickly unravels into a character whose motivations are as selfish and hypocritical as Plainview's.<br/><br/>But Anderson doesn't clue us in all at onceone of the more delectable aspects of ""There Will Be Blood"" is a deliberate pace that slowly shades in the characters, turning both Plainview and Sunday into individuals who undergo change in a variety of ways, for good and ill, while keeping the underlying motivations obscured. This understated battle of wits is sustained quite well for the film's first two hours, as is the awkward relationship between Plainview and his curiously remote, unusually mature son.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""There Will Be Blood"" slips into the same territory that undid ""The Prestige"" in its final minutes. I don't know what has compelled talented filmmakers to gravitate toward the ""What a twist!"" mentality in the past decade, especially when their story lines are so solid that a twist could do nothing less than diminish the value of what has gone one before. The initial twist in ""Blood""involving Plainview's sonis actually fairly predictable, and while it does illuminate certain scenes that occurred years before, it is established and hastily dismissed (its failing being that I ultimately didn't buy it as a natural narrative progression). Almost immediately after, there is a confrontation between Sunday (who has since become a successful religious commentator) and Plainview that layers on the pop-psychology double-entendres until both Dano and Day-Lewis erupt in a fracas of method histrionics. The scene itself is rather laboriously set up, with Sunday's appearance functioning merely for plot closure, and the final fight we have been waiting to see all along.<br/><br/>That being said, ""There Will Be Blood"" does possess passages of such raw purity and beauty that the film is, for a bulk of its run time, genuinely spellbinding. The performances are spot-on, with Day-Lewis carrying the film as the type of bitter bastard who would usually make 2+ hours feel like an eternity; Dano is the more understated foil, giving a performance of quiet grace and wickedness. And as a whole, it is simply beautiful to look at. While allusions can no doubt be drawn between ""Blood"" and America's current foreign-policy mess, I was so captivated by the film that I barely considered it.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"blanbrn","7","2","6","2 February 2008"," Epic tale of greed, determination, and corruption. The good and bad of capitalism and the rise and fall of a relentless prospector.
","""There Will Be Blood"" is clearly a classic film that has all the interesting and intriguing elements of greed, power struggle and drama that a picture needs. Well directed by Paul Thomas Anderson as his use of the scene work and cinematography is brilliant and the scores played during the film are enchanting and moving. This film was inspired from a 1927 novel from Upton Sinclair called ""Oil""! Set before the start of the 1900's in the old American west you have a young and eager man Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis) who has claim only to a young son, with his only hope as an oilman is to be relentless in his prospects and searches for new oil finds and discoveries. As the film moves along the fortune improves from Daniel's striking gold by finding oil and later from learned tips a boomtown is discovered.<br/><br/>Upon Daniel becoming a tycoon the drama and tension of the film takes flight as power struggles exists with the town's dangerous young preacher(Dano) and a tragedy takes upon Daniel's son from an oil machine explosion. Thru the film spanning all during and before the 1900's up till 1927 the viewer can see the highs and lows of the Plainview character and how the capital market is good with greed and can be manipulative, yet evil when down as in the films end we see how Plainview responds to the toll it's taken upon him.<br/><br/>Overall ""There Will Be Blood"" features an excellent performance by Daniel Day Lewis and the score and look of the American west is stunning and with it's themes of capital market highs and lows combined with greed, pride, and religious struggle along with personal tragedy this film is one of the better winners of the 2007 film crop."

","I found it interesting from beginning to end. Usually in this long of a movie I start wondering when it is going to end. I didn't do that. The acting was superb! And not just Daniel Day-Lewis. All of the actors were awesome.<br/><br/>Usually my husband and I agree on most movies. When we walked out he said ""Well, that was 2 1/2 hours wasted of my life."" He agreed about the acting and direction. He just thought it was boring.<br/><br/>It is slow. It is not an uplifting movie. There are no car chase scenes or a thousand bullets flying. But, slow is OK. I found it very entertaining. The story line was interesting as well as that time period and in regards to the oil strikes and that industry. Great movie."
"D_Burke","10","2","6","30 January 2008"," Legendary performance by Daniel Day-Lewis
","I can't say that Daniel Day-Lewis's performance alone made this movie great. The movie was itself great in a lot of ways, including the directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (who I don't believe has made a bad movie to date), the cinematography, and the intriguing storyline. However, I can't think of any other actor who would have done as well in the role of Daniel Plainview. Day-Lewis really moved his actor status up to legendary with this role, and it's a good thing Martin Scorsese talked him out of retirement seven years ago to do ""Gangs of New York"".<br/><br/>Perhaps the other best things about this movie is that it doesn't follow the typical storyline you would expect from this sort of movie. I expected this movie to be a rise-and-fall story along the lines of ""Boogie Nights"", where Daniel Plainview works hard to get oil, gets money, and becomes more corrupt. And I thought a subplot involves the Eli Sunday character (played extremely well in an overlooked performance by Paul Dano) would be the moral center of the story who resists corruption. That doesn't exactly happen that way. In fact, without giving anything away, there are more scenes than expected where Daniel Plainview is portrayed as a more noble character than Eli Sunday. Additionally, Daniel Day-Lewis brings an unexpected amount of comic relief to Plainview that not many other actors would be willing to muster.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that this film is nominated for Best Picture against ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Juno"", both excellent films that I have seen as of January 30th, 2008. Despite this film being 2 1/2 hours long, I enjoyed it all the way through. If it doesn't win Best Picture, Daniel Day-Lewis definitely deserves to win for Best Actor (say that five times fast). Great film overall, and excellent period piece!"

Perhaps if you don't like this movie, instead of accusing people who like it of falling prey to an Emperor's New Clothes"" mentality, you might have to admit that you didn't ""get"" the movie, or that your life experience is inadequate to understand the complexity of what is being expressed.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the movie please consider this: Have you ever owned, or run a business? Do you have any idea what it takes to succeed in business, and what demands it places on a person, physically, ethically, and psychologically? If you haven't, you may not appreciate the fact that anyone who has will see pieces of themselves in Daniel Plainview, and will have to examine their own souls after seeing the movie. They will squirm in their seat as they alternately sympathize and deplore Daniel Planview, and their own selves in the process.<br/><br/>Don't dismiss this as a simplistic tale of a ""Bad man who is greedy and has a downfall, how boring!""

"allan825","10","2","6","29 January 2008"," Shakespearean
","An uncompromising, Shakespearean drama of titanic passions and their consequences, There Will Be Blood is anchored by Daniel Day-Lewis's volcanic performance as an obsessive, ruthless, satanic oilman. Also highly notably are the cinematography and the often ultra-dissonant score (composed by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood), both of which help carry a riveting, nearly wordless opening sequence that announces this will be anything but a conventional film experience. (The use of the buoyant finale from Brahms's Violin Concerto at two points as a supplement to Greenwood's searing string writing, which shows he knows his Ligeti and Xenakis, is deliciously incongruous.)<br/><br/>The film doesn't strive to explain much, which is one of its great strengths; it presents and leaves it to viewers to find connections between events and later actions on the part of characters. A more conventional film would underline motivations more clearly through dialogue. That makes certain scenes--such as when H.W. sets his father's sleeping quarters ablaze or when Daniel threatens to slit the throat of an oil executive--seem strange and incongruous. But never implausible. A second viewing (which I highly recommend) really clarifies the structure and the subtle handling of motivation and psychology.<br/><br/>I am haunted by the intensity of Lewis's performance, particularly the firelit scene in which he announces his misanthropic character (again, Shakespearean: think of the opening of Richard III, etc.). The way his face splits into a malicious grin as he contemptuously utters ""these...people"", followed by incongruous laughter, gives me chills (a scene unsurprisingly highlighted in the film's trailer). We all, no doubt, have a certain measure of Plainview in us--avarice, misanthropy, corruptibility, a potential for explosive violence; things most of us strive to overcome. But Plainview never becomes ""civilized"", not even after acquiring great wealth. He sleeps on the floor of his bowling alley, as if he were still out prospecting in the wild and forced to rest on the hard earth. Seeing him let all his untamed, misanthropic rage boil over in the conclusion is exhilarating and horrifying--but, in light of what has gone before, a seemingly inevitable denouement. Like Macbeth, Plainview is a man who had talent and potential but was corrupted by his passions. A flashback shot, just after the decisive rejection of H.W., says it all: We see Daniel walk away from the boy who has become his son, toward the derrick: That's the choice that has shaped who he has become.<br/><br/>Coming as it does toward the end of the Bush era, the picture could certainly be seen as an allegory of destructive forces that have shaped much American history and currently form integral parts of the Republican party: evangelical chicanery and unbridled corporate greed. The Nietzschean will to power behind both leads to an uneasy alliance--to say the least. This is by far Paul Thomas Anderson's best and most penetrating film to date, and you'd have to go back to something like Raging Bull to find such a tour-de-force collaboration between a filmmaker and an actor of genius."
"grahamdhallman","9","2","6","23 January 2008"," Finally a PTA film with staying power
","I know there are film lovers out there who feel PTA's Magnolia and Boogie Nights are timeless classics. But I firmly disagree. At the end of the day, neither of these films stay with this viewer. Both films are just too psychoanalytical and melodramatic in the world of bourgeois whiteness for me. Who really cares about the underworld of porn, or the inner dynamic trials and tribulations of Simi Valley whites? Yet, both films, at times, demonstrated that PTA is capable of greatness: whether it be crafty dialog or taken for granted interconnectedness.<br/><br/>""There WIll Be Blood"" absolutely changed my perception of PTA as the poster boy of white melodrama. The character development, direction, and relevant themes are mature and critically analyzed through outstanding performances from Daneil Day Lewis and Paul Dano. The movie does justice to Sinclair's ""Oil"" and casts a surgical shadow on the corrupt world of big oil business while concurrently fleshing out the dynamics of family, religion, and the American dream. <br/><br/>Lewis' performance as Daniel Plainview should win him an Oscar, though Tommy Lee Jones' performance (In the Valley of Elah) is nearly on par. What separates Lewis' from the rest of the Oscar competition is his seemingly complete immersion into the Plainview character: the inner demons, mannerisms (both subtle and grand), turn of the century accent, Midwestern roots, dark humor, and guilt make for an epic character filled with complexity and an underlying sense of principle. Sadly, Plainview's dark side prevails.<br/><br/>If there is one downer in this film, it's the Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead guitarist) soundtrack. It's overstated and often inappropriate, and yes I realize that most of you will disagree with me. I think the cast more than holds court justifying the haunting, opaque reality of this film and Sinclair's novel. Thus, let the actors set the tone Mr. Anderson. But then again, Radiohead, a too often whiny band, receives most of its upper tier distinction amongst none other than: bourgeois whites."
"supramaxx","9","2","6","22 January 2008"," A character study not seen since Citizen Kane
","There Will Be Blood<br/><br/>This film initially intrigued me because it had so many positive reviews. After all several critics said that this should be the ""Film of the Year"". I saw the trailer once in the movies, and thought it was a historical movie about the oil boom era of the United States in the late 19th century. My cup of tea, being that I love any movie that has to so with History. However I was in for a rude awakening from what I anticipated. More than anything ""There will be Blood"" was an intense and profound character study that I have not seen since probably Citizen Kane, it has elements of history, but even stronger and more subtle messages about evangelical Christianity, greed, hypocrisy, capitalism, and the dark side of human nature. The story of centers around the persona of a certain man named Daniel Plainview and his quest for oil wealth and exceeds plainly in doing so.<br/><br/>The Good: Daniel Day Lewis who plays Daniel Plainview gives a performance to remember as he plays a man who is devoid of all ethics and love in his quest for wealth. He displays all the intensity and greed of his character in exceptional light. The supporting cast, including Paul Dano who plays Plainviews nemesis, the leader of the evangelical church of the 3rd revelation, Eli Sunday, is more than exceptional in their roles. The cinematography was excellent giving you a feel of early 20th century rural California. The plot and story while slow for some, is absolutely perfect in the depiction of the sinister of this man and how he affects a rural community. The strong messages of hypocrisy within religion institutions, human nature, evil, insidiousness, and greed are all exceptionally depicted here, as well as the ever-important historical aspect of the movie. The sound score was also excellent, with a haunting score whenever something of significance happens. A character study at its best.<br/><br/>The Bad: The movie might me a bit slow-moving for some. There are no overly violent, nor any sexual scenes, which is a huge plus for me, to others that is what makes a movie. The only other bad is that the role of Paul/Eli is confusing when one finishes the movie. But it can be clarified in any movie message board, they are twin brothers.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Daniel Plainviews sinister and insane facial expressions, especially when he starts losing his sanity. As well as his nihilistic views of humanity.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Again, I haven't seen a character study like this since ""Citizen Kane"" and its distinct depiction of a few elements of American culture, human nature, greed, capitalism, sanity and religion make this movie well worth the price of admission. The emotions displayed in this movie covers the whole spectrum. No big bangs here, just a satisfying film experience that leaves you pondering about certain aspects of humanity.<br/><br/>Supra Score - 9.5/10"
"christopher_m_k","10","2","6","21 January 2008"," a lot from a little
","There's something powerful about this film. What packed the biggest punch was the idea of a hollow victory, which the film beautifully portrays. I'm surprised that so many people seem to be enjoying this film, but there are many levels on which to appreciate the work. I've been finding it more insightful as I back away from it. On closest inspection, it's the story of a man doing what we observe and saying what we hear. A little further back, it's a exploration of a character. Further still, we see cruel and powerful movers in a harsh light. But when you back up just a little more, you can see something even more true. It's the emptiness behind everything. It's the futility of choice. It's heavy stuff, kids. Heavy stuff. So I guess there's something for everyone and nothing for everyone."
"hypostylin","10","2","6","21 January 2008"," Stirring, riveting, and masterful.
","There Will Be Blood is a harrowing, pensive, and rhythmic work that reveals and subsequently skewers you with ghastly human truths. Once ignited by greed and power, these truths are impossible to extinguish. The film is epic in its setting and cinematography, but simultaneously intimate in its contemplative, intense, and brooding focus on its characters. The two scopes complement each other perfectly.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is, of course, remarkable. The drawl that he applies to the character is over-the-top, but so is the character himself in his strident eschewal of any substantive human contact, as well as in his bitter resentment towards snake oil preacher Eli (played fantastically by Paul Dano).<br/><br/>Jonny Greenwood turns in a masterful score that hearkens back to Krzysztof Penderecki's bombastic, droning atonal blares that were adapted for Kubrick's The Shining. It's fitting, as Daniel Plainview's sharp descent into madness mirrors that of Jack Torrance. Greenwood's work avoids the sterile and generic orchestral din that has dominated most cinema of the past ten years, and instead experiments with sustained, moaning strings and piquant ticks and snaps. The aural doom-scape he creates quickly and deservedly assumes the role as the film's third principle character. This is the greatest film soundtrack of the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>With its pitch-perfect music, performances, direction, and cinematography, There Will Be Blood is a stunning achievement."
"binaryg","10","2","6","19 January 2008"," Seduced by Blood and Oil
","I've watched four versions of Macbeth recently and the witches, among many things in the play, are fascinating for the spell they so easily cast on Macbeth. And so it was, after seeing There Will Be Blood I felt under a spell and seduced by director Paul Thomas Anderson's new film. I've seen it again since and feel more drawn on and into this poetic, and ambiguous work. I am amazed by the power the film has been able to exert on me. I'm amazed in the same sense The Shining drew me into the mystery of the characters and settings of that film. Instead of being led through the halls of a haunted hotel or the literal hedge maze, in There Will Be Blood I'm led down into the Earth where silver, gold, oil, and Hell exist and I am a-mazed. There are many images in There Will Be Blood of fire and damnation and of the Devil himself in the characters of Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday. Both know the Devil well. All of the acting is top-notch but Daniel Day-Lewis creates not so much a man as he does an elemental force of nature, a force that can and will destroy even those he deeply cares about, his own family<br/><br/>I see a great deal of Kubrick in this work by Anderson although a see many, many other cinematic references to other filmmakers, films, and characters. The sense of black, bleak humor the use of music bring layers of meaning and texture to the film are so reminiscent of Kubrick and really only speaks to the mastery and maturity Anderson has achieved at a young age and with only now five films in his career. He has made his own masterpiece, a film, which resonates with the history of the conquering of the American West, and with the with the course of current events where we find ourselves addicted to the oil pumping through our veins to such a degree that we kill and destroy to secure it. There Will Be Blood is a great film and for me represents a passing on of the Directorial Torch. Paul Thomas Anderson is a Poet of Light like Altman, Welles, Houston, Kubrick, and others before him.<br/><br/>The Poets light but Lamps /Themselvesgo out /The Wicks they stimulate /If vital Light /Inhere as do the Suns /Each Age a Lens /Disseminating their Circumference<br/><br/>-Emily Dickinson"

","Whether ""There Will Be Blood"" is any good to you at all depends on whether or not you enjoy watching greedy people mastermind the undoing of other greedy people. Think of 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead', but with an extra glaze of acid laid on thick. The movie is hard to watch, and its emotional high points are moments of unbearable tension, slimy avarice, and nervous, squirming laughter. If this is the kind of thing you enjoy (I admit I do), than be all means, this is your movie. This one will also appeal to even the most casual fan of Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives a performance so earth-shaking that it renders all possible adjectives limp. As oilman Daniel Planview, Lewis creates not a man but a creature with human flaws-here is a thing that sees every facet of life in terms of what he stands to gain. It's alternately fascinating and horrifying to watch an ensemble of money-grubbers fight amongst themselves to earn the favor of Plainview, who is in turn ardently working to repel them along with the rest of humanity. In the finale, when Plainview decides to throw aside the inconveniences of law and religion to fight his battle for self-absorbed isolation, Lewis elevates a series of already good scenes to classic status. This is also your cup of tea of you like to pick apart and argue about your film fare. For example: if Plainview is working so hard to cast off the personal experience and stock up on materialism, then why do we have a scene in which Plainview shoots a stack of his recent purchases? Are even material things a burden to him? What is his definition of freedom? What is any man's definition of freedom? See! Great discussion movie. The Wrap Up: This one is for fans of: Feel-bad cinema, Daniel-Day Lewis, discussion movies This one is not for: Fans of uplift and sentimentality, impatient filmgoers, squeamish audiences. I thought: While the film sometimes sags into its own whacko zone, and the fat needed some trimming in places, this is the kind of bold, volcanic film that defines the word ""originality"". Definitely worth a look. B+"

","WONDROUS, wondrous movie.... It single-handedly restored my faith in American cinema. A masterpiece of movie-making on all accounts: Story, script, acting, photography, lightning, staging, location, casting, wardrobe, makeup... Nothing left to inertia or careless overlook. It is utterly beyond anything I have seen in, lets say, the past two decades. I am serious people. I am even considering reducing all my ratings (several hundred) by one star so this one deservingly stands-out.<br/><br/>You see, there was a time, lets say the seventies, when American film-making had something new to say, something that even European cinema was desperately trying to mimic..... Yes, even the French looked up to us.<br/><br/>Then came Steven Spielberg and Hollywood has never been the same again.<br/><br/>Since then, the studios brought us colorful effects, cheap thrills and laughs.... But nothing as sensibly well-rounded as, lets say, what Robert Altman was capable of with ""3 Women"" or ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"", Sidney Lumet with ""Dog Day Afternoon"", Terrence Malick with ""Days of Heaven"" or the best first half of Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"". That way of visual storytelling paid attention to the charged loudness of a long pause, to the mastery behind long, single takes, to the worship for a steady camera and focus on subtle acting, to the faithful reenactment (not trendy interpretations) of historical artifacts. On those times a wink of an eye was so loaded with meaning, a single note so fully embodied with tension, a prop utensil so beautifully reproduced... There was complexity and thick, layered stories. I loved that period of narrative introspection.<br/><br/>This is what ""There Will be Blood"" brings back: True purpose on its enactment: Archetypal stories with humble stories of epic proportions. Evil and good intertwined. God through human ambition and frailty. Open endings, interpretative meaning... Love for storytelling, not the pursuit of lowly bucks behind mass-produced ""blockbustering"" science.<br/><br/>I am so happy today... This movie is truly a gem to my eyes. Please visit it with open ones, and yes, an open mind perhaps already narrowed and pre-conditioned to the ""expected"". But please do visit. Only the symbolic end scene can be judged as overplayed somehow.... The rest is beyond reproach. This movie is a demonstration of what cinema should be all about. A textbook classic to be taught to future generations of filmmakers. I hope."

","At the end of ""There will be blood"" I started to think about the movie, its messages and its meanings and in doing so I almost forgot how beautiful the settings are, how big the scope is and how good the story itself was. Indeed the interactions between the characters are great and the film is able to convey a lot of emotional tension. And this is because the characters are unpredictable, you know what they want but not completely and often they act in a unexpected way. I was so invested in the meanings of the movie because it doesn't convey all the answers but leaves the viewer with a lot of ""why"" that he has to answer himself. And the most convincinIg thought I had is that the protagonist of this movie is the Nietzsche's ubermensch (the superman) and throughout the film there are a lot of concepts of his philosophy. But nothing could have been possible without Daniel Day-Lewis: he is so great that I can't describe his work with mere words. In this movie (actually, in every movie he's in) he gave an incredible performance and as usual he disappears in his character. The way he moves, his looks, the way he talks, all these things made memorable an already well written character. In conclusion: a great film by Paul Thomas Anderson."

","In the early 20th century, an industrious prospector in Southern California, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), becomes a shrewd oil magnate, whose journey is paralleled with a dubious Pentecostal pastor of a remote church, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" (2007) is a one-of-a-kind period drama with Western elements.

The contemporaneous ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" are good comparisons.<br/><br/>Whilst the story and main characters are simple on the surface, they go deep and there are many gems to mine: What good is success if you have no one to love and enjoy it with?

"neonadventure","9","1","2","16 June 2019"," There Will Be Blood (2007) Review
","Plot: The story is about a man's life through greed, power, family, and rivalry. Our main character, Daniel Plainview, goes out to seek for some oil with his son (adopted), H.W. Plainview, as his defense when it comes to getting a good place to steal some oil from the places around it. Daniel thought it was going to be a normal oil rig, when his oil rig started to release some gas, causing the oil rig's ass to get on fire. And when he thought that was over, he gets a few more problems until the Devil gets into his soul.<br/><br/>My Thoughts: I wrote this review after my 3rd time watching this movie after a month of watching it the first time. (Wait till you hear that I watched the Incredibles also from June to July 5 times) Just when I thought I loved everything in the film, the scene that I hated the most was when Daniel Plainview opens the oil rig and the music starts playing. The music is constantly being cut from the beginning to straight to the end and they play the beginning of the finale twice and then finally the last notes. By far, I was surprised that I haven't noticed this but this just felt bad and the music is being butchered and transitioned badly several times like a butcher. Other than that, I loved it. The oil represents the Devil's blood and Daniel's quest to get as much of the Devil's blood inside of him. The oil rig had a whole ocean of the Devil's blood in it. And when it caught on fire, I believe that was when Daniel really saw the Devil himself. The movie makes me think about how they portray Daniel Plainview as the Devil and not a greedy sociopath. The cinematography was shocking and it was different compared to his other films like The Master and Boogie Nights. It wasn't stylish, yet there is the great cinematography that makes us remember Daniel Day Lewis as one of the scariest movie characters.<br/><br/>This remains as one of my favorite films because the movie makes you think deeper and makes us see the movie in a whole new way after finding out what it meant. I love the music, especially Convergence, I love the beat. (Also ""There Will Be Blood"") This movie has a deeper meaning that we people didn't expect and in a way, this movie honestly made me terrified as if the movie was a horror film and it shows the innocent Daniel at the beginning evolve into the violent man he is now.<br/><br/>It's about the milkshakes. And if you can't handle the hidden meaning, then I will slurp that milkshake in front of your face.<br/><br/>THERE WILL BE EMPTY GLASSES OF SUNDAES AND FULL GLASSES OF STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKES WITH CREAM ON TOP."

Some of the characters dont have a nice development, the ending its kind of illogical but what i found to be the greatest mistake of this movie its the lack of woman and the lack of reflection.

","1. The casting is perfect, it wouldn't have worked without Daniel Day Lewis.
2. The acting is the best I've ever seen. DDL got his well deserved 2nd Oscar for this.
3. The music is perfect. It reminds me of Kubrick's Space Odyssey, especially in the beginning when the oil first appears. It has a pretty scary appearance just like the monolith in Space Odyssey.
4. The camera movement and the shots are beauty and meaningful too. Not like in today's films.
5. The cuts are just perfect
6. The directing is brilliant.

","Acting was great, cinematography was beautiful. But story was extremely lacking. Other than the corrupt preacher, we have have no backstory to any character and this have no explanation of any motivations. The tone of the movie was very odd to me-in particular regarding the music. Without the score by Johnny Greenwood, the movie could easily pass as a typical drama. The only reason any part of the movie seemed ""scary"" was due to the music. It solely gave an ominous feel, not the story."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","2","2 March 2018"," There Will Be Blood should've been titled ""Here Be Oil"".
","If you were hoping for blood, violence and plenty of gore...put this film back and choose a Tarantino film instead. What we have though, is an extremely intelligent character study on an individual who is the definition of corrupt. Whilst mining silver, Daniel Plainview discovers an abundance of oil and rapidly starts his own oil extraction company. Success, money and power skews his moral compass as he slowly becomes one of the most unlikeable movie characters I've ever seen. He would do pretty much anything to maintain his company, much like any extreme tycoon enterpriser. Murder people? Definitely. Charm landowners to only then deceive them the next minute? Yeah, why not. Abandon your own son? Whoa now, a step too far. A subtle darkly comedic undertone surrounds the film, particularly with the theme of faith. Mind you, it becomes clearer during the final act where he repeatedly provokes someone into shouting ""I am a false prophet!!"". Whilst the narrative is savage and depressing, simultaneously the visual imagery is just as relentless. The scene where the oil well is accidentally set alight was a beautiful mess. I was entranced. I don't think prospecting or mining is a career I would want to pursue after watching this...! Daniel Day-Lewis deserved that Oscar, he was phenomenal. Yet another transformative performance. Felt sorry for Paul Dano who was excellent but completely overshadowed by Lewis. The musical score was abrupt yet fitting, really admired it. The film did slow down during the second act where Plainview meets a long lost relative, but picks up again in the third act. This deserves the critical acclaim, and perhaps with future viewings it will get the perfect rating. Cements Daniel Day-Lewis as one of the best actors ever."

","P.T. Anderson is a brave film maker, and everybody has known it since his first endeavors in the 1990s. He isn't afraid to get trapped in his own style, taking the risk of treading a thin line of what could be called ""tedious"" or ""pointless"" film making.<br/><br/>Obviously, this film has won its accolades and deserving place in ""best of lists"", as it ultimately is a tour de force both in directing and in acting. The two leads are astonishing, and Day Lewis is exceptional, as his descent into paranoia is a performance of an archetypical character, much attempted by lesser actors, but only equaled by few (Al Pacino in Scarface is a prime example). The climax is nothing less but excellent.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, the film could have had a better pace, as it can't be described exactly as ""gripping"". It definitely gets better with multiple viewings, but the entertainment value could be a little higher."
"jacobcornblatt","10","1","2","29 August 2015"," ""I am the Third Revelation!""
","P.T. Anderson's brilliant adaption of the classic novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sinclair is, without a doubt, one of the best American films ever made. Stories of greed, religion, and family have been done countless times, but never has one felt so epic. With acting for the ages and stakes that few others can pull off, ""There Will be Blood"" is a phenomenal movie front to back.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis, a method actor like no other, not only paints the perfect picture of a troubled, unstable man, but also manages to portray his mindset so sophisticated and subtly. Paul Dano is fantastic, as well (even though he is a bit outdone by Lewis). <br/><br/>The highlight of this picture, however, is the stunning cinematography. Robert Elswit captures the landscapes perfectly, but shines during the crux of the film: the explosion of the oil rig. Elswit manages to present a devastating event -- i.e. the fire -- as something that is merely a stumbling block for Lewis' character, while still making it as powerful as it truly is. <br/><br/>The final item to discuss is the sheer brilliance of the editing and directing. In almost every transition, there is some sort of juxtaposition, may it be in the color, light, or sound. The story this film discusses has many sides, and the juxtaposition is the perfect way of acknowledging these sides. <br/><br/>Once again, Paul Thomas Anderson proves how great of a filmmaker he is with ""There Will be Blood."""
"sharky_55","9","1","2","12 August 2015"," What are you looking so miserable about?
","I wish more films would open like There Will Be Blood. Bleak, uncompromising and largely silent apart from the siren assault from Greenwood at the opening fade-in, the rise of Daniel Plainview is slowly and methodically unveiled. He starts as a primitive and solitary figure, propping himself up after an injury, then with a few workers (his family, as he calls them, and indeed one of the orphans becomes a part of his family), and only 15 minutes in do we finally get dialogue. It's a purposeful and seductive opening monologue from Daniel Day Lewis, the kind of rich and sonorous speech that is full of experience and trust and honour, but it doesn't fool the rowdy crowd. Realising they cannot be taken advantage of, he leaves and cannot be convinced to return. Plainview gives a similar, more evocative speech later on as he pitches to the residents of Little Boston, this time overlaid with visuals of a thriving communal effort from his workers and their families. And this one is vastly more successful. It's the strength of the performance that elevates the film into a captivating tale of greed and power. Paul Dano's Eli performs absurd exorcisms of spirits and ghosts, but through his own grand act and conviction, the congregation is enthralled, and so are we. And when Plainview says he is an oilman, we tend to agree. <br/><br/>Apart from his steady deliberate speech (which fires up in fits of rage when appropriate) Plainview also possesses a distinctive walk, a hobbled gait that is perhaps the result of that horrible fall in his first mining venture. Or then again, perhaps it's a remarkably diligent performance. TWBB is built upon these kinds of precise acts of showmanship, and within them we revel at the battle between Plainview and Eli for the people. When Daniel buys a new dress for Mary and holds her little hands as she blesses the new oil well, it's quite lovely, but we only have eyes for Eli in the centre of the frame, stoic and unmoving, despite the lingering tension and anger between the lines. Eli gets one back when suggesting the death of one of the workers could have been prevented if he had been allowed to do the blessing, and of course this is escalated when H.W. is injured by the cursed well. Both are forced to break their character for financial gain, Plainview to buy that last piece of land for his pipeline (""I've abandoned my boy!"" - but he admits it was worth it), and Eli desperate for money at his last days. <br/><br/>It's remarkable how PTA can use one little accident to show us so many things. In his reaction Daniel shows a rare glimpse of humanity and desperation, even as we are forced to acknowledge HW's role in pitching his family company's vision. The pivotal scene is filmed appropriately in the chaos; the hand-held camera tremors and the sound design of the erupting gas and oil is guttural and thunderous, dulled only when we focus on the now deaf H.W. Here's where Greenwood's score excels; its percussion beats and frenzied strings arpeggios (some credit must go to Fratres by Arvo Pärt) provides such a heavy and ominous atmosphere, and yet that is equally juxtaposed by the gorgeous silhouette of Daniel and Fletcher celebrating in the shadow of the burning derrick. Fletcher asks of H.W.'s welfare, but as the camera slowly zooms in to a close up of Daniel, we know exactly what is capturing his gaze. It's truly a stunning achievement for DP Robert Elswit, who ranges from the harshly lit and bleak beginnings of Daniel Plainview's oil streaked face, to the rise of his vast sweeping oil empire, and to a dim and claustrophobic mansion that an elderly Plainview rots in. That ending is certainly a change from the vivid visuals that demonstrate the stink of the oil, the dry barren landscape and the years of hard work and toil that resulted in his wealth. <br/><br/>The final psychotic scene in the bowling alley is tight and potent. Here we see two broken men, masked by wealth and religious virtue respectively, each empty. Daniel seizes the opportunity for revenge and humiliation by spurring on Eli to rebuke his lifelong performance, and Dano's increasing disturbance and discomfort as he raises his voice is so perfect. And so is the insane jeering and ramblings of a drunkard who, despite having everything, has nothing of substance. He renounces his remaining family (""bastard in a basket"") after seeing a threat to his empire, and beats and bullies the pastor who he blames for his false promises of faith and healing and also the loss of his adopted son, the last living remnant of his humanity from years past. And with a sort of ambivalence in his final casual remark, the life of Daniel Plainview ends there, and Brahms' lively Violin Concerto bursts in. <br/><br/>What There Will Be Blood does is allow us time to ponder and reflect. I have no need for the tiny sub-plot of the twin Sunday brothers, or the tired confession of Daniel to Henry of his misanthropy, drive and obsession. There's plenty of subtext in PTA's film-making to allow for us to dissect that from Day-Lewis. But even so, the film is an intensely visceral affair."
"theolykkebil","10","1","2","14 June 2015"," The story is centered around a man named Daniel Plainview, striving to make a living in the oil business.
","For me, this movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis place as the best actor i have ever seen on screen. He totally transforms in to this character that is so egoistic, and bad in many ways but then again so intriguing. He is the kind of actor that can play anything, from president of the united states Abraham Lincoln to gang leader in the 1800's Bill the butcher. <br/><br/>But it isn't only Daniel Day-Lewis performance in this movie that makes it absolutely amazing. Its also the entire style of the movie, the desert world in witch our protagonist strives in.

","Being in my late teens/early 20's I don't consider myself a movie critic, but more of a buff. I've seen a lot of movies, good and bad. I've also read the novel this movie is based on ('Oil' by Upton Sinclair). Now I may have missed some performances that were life changing and timeless, but I have never seen a performance like the one Daniel Day-Lewis put on. Think of the scariest and most unsettling performance you can think of (mine was a toss up between Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal, Kathy Bates in Misery, and Christian Bale in American Psycho). Day-Lewis brings to life the greed, and hate and selfishness of an American society. People bent of that daring idea of ""working hard and you'll get there"" and the sacrifices a person makes to get there. Paul Thomas Anderson's film isn't just art, or a good movie. It's an epic, something that Hollywood has so dearly missed since the days of Brando, Humphries and Kubrick."

","Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson have created one of the greatest movies of this time and perhaps of all time. There is so much ambition, brilliance, detail, and probably everything that you would put in a great movie. I don't think that anything, and anything could top this level of amazement for me. The film has put me through a cathartic and dogmatic experience by just watching. Truly outstanding on every level. A masterpiece One of the great things about this film is that it cannot be put in a specific genre, or cannot even be pinned down to what 3-4-5 different genres got mixed into the end result, because this film simply defies that question. It's too universal, complex, and humane to be categorized easily. It's not even an art film or a western exactly. It echoes classic Hollywood, but it's way more ambivalent and ambigous than that. It's definitely a highly artistic piece of periodic cinema from an American auteur in the age of postmodernism. I cannot define it much further.. I love the music throughout the film. It defines the energy. Just a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. DDL morphs the character so well I can almost feel the aches and pains from years of hard work and injury."

","I bet that there will be thousands of extremely long media student theses about this movie in the future. There is so much depth and so much description in every scene, every set, every line and every expression that I don't know if I could ever get tired of watching this movie. I have watched this movie four times, and if it was rereleased in theaters I would spend 15 bucks to go see it again on the big screen.<br/><br/>First, Daniel Day-Lewis was extraordinary in this film. While many people could agree that DDL's performance here may be one of the greatest ever in cinema, it doesn't dominate the picture. The strength of the characters, the other acting, the sets, the direction and story are equally amazing. One of the most extraordinary things about TWBB is that you don't focus on the film making; there are very few period pieces that don't make you think about the sets, cinematography, props, accents, wardrobe and historical authenticity of what is showcased. In terms of the strength of the ""forth wall"", the only other movie I think compares to this one is the Outlaw Josey Wales.<br/><br/>While simple, the story is incredible deep. People who call this movie slow should probably watch it again more carefully. If anything this film moves too fast to really appreciate all of the methods and themes used to progress the story. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and every frame of this movie fulfills that promise. I imagine that a full examination of this film could fill up a thousand page hard back book fairly easily.<br/><br/>After appreciating this film, I have trouble considering other movies masterpieces. I think that is reviewers had watched this film multiple times that it would have sweep all of the awards. I also think that there Will Be Blood will be rated as one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>The fact that in 2008 this film didn't use any digital intermediate, it was shoot on petrochemical film, cut using scissors and taped together in an almost century old way, is just another aspect that makes this film so mind bogglingly great. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Hollywood's last hurray, and we never see a movie of this quality again."

","Going into this film, I was half expecting another Oscar scooping critics wet dream, like The Shawshank Redemption. I personally am not a huge fan of these types of films (although I do see their appeal), but having watched There Will be Blood, I was amazed. <br/><br/>First off, the dialogue is intense and Daniel Day-Lewis gives a perfect performance, dark humour working with his monologues so well. And although it is a fairly long film, the story stays captivating from beginning to end. <br/><br/>Then, as you scratch beneath the surface of the film, you get to the potent anti-materialism themes. These are visible in a number of scenes, the best example of which I think is the scene towards the end, where Daniel Plainview is using his wealth and material possessions to make H.B Ailman contradict the faith he believes in so he can work with Daniel and get wealthier. This just goes to show how much power money and material gain has in modern society. Plainview also tries to replace the family and friends he never had with members of 'family' that aren't actually related to him and soon ends up leaving these people to bask in his riches. <br/><br/>There Will be Blood is a fantastic film with awesome monologues, a few gruesome deaths and world class character development. Thoroughly recommended."
"Horse_MD","10","1","2","17 March 2014"," It's Complicated
","It's tough to recommend this to the usual crowd. The cinematography by Robert Elswit (who won an Oscar for his effort) and his team stands above any other I have ever experienced. Mr. Elswit bypasses any camera tricks and movie magic and sticks to tradition to create beautiful, sweeping vistas that sit next to the dark themes of the film in a striking juxtaposition. Mr Day-Lewis (who also received an Oscar for his work) turns in the best performance of his career and one that will stand through the ages as a triumphant portrayal of an incredibly complex and flawed man. The OST by Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead fame) is haunting and jarring, especially in the scene where young HW Plainview loses his hearing in the derrick explosion. Greenwood's percussive track lays out chaotic drums layered over one another as the film happens silently in the background.<br/><br/>These are all things that I can tell anyone and convince them that it is a technically proficient film, but it's more than that. It's complicated. The film's completeness is somewhat of a marvel, telling years worth of story over its' admittedly drawn-out 158 minutes. To me it never felt long, though I can understand anyone's complaints about length.<br/><br/>Again, these are all tangible things. These are things anyone can see. But when you take these things into account, I can't recommend the film to anyone. Not my wife, not my film buff friends. Not you, anonymous reader. I cannot recommend it because I'm selfish. I want to relish this film all by myself. I want to discuss it with myself and shake my own hand for loving it. I want it to sit atop my list of favorite films and no one else's. I want Paul Thomas Anderson to call me and thank me for loving the film that he made expressly for me.<br/><br/>Why? This is the film that I feel perfectly expresses the medium. The frames of this film feel sacred and hollowed. The first time you see the film may be the only time you see it. There has not been another occasion where I have found it appropriate to watch this film again. It sits in my mind, perched high on the mountain of other movies I have seen and calls down to me, invoking the feelings I experienced the first time I watched.

The first part of this film has no dialogue, there's just the musical score and scenes of his early life that is perfectly well blended and well paced. This movie is like a guide for young actors and actresses on how to utilize the environment and mix things up with their style of acting. The acting is really clever here. Daniel Day-Lewis gives his best performance. In the end you'd see why he turned into such a monster. The story is not your typical success story, it's more realistic and murky. How things might not pan out the way you want it to be. In conclusion this movie is perfect for anyone who appreciates cinema and it's surely a must for any film goers out there.<br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter : @MonsieurHansLim"

","Caught this by accident on BBC TV and was transfixed. A powerful story, with excellent performances and a wholly authentic feel (inasmuch as I know what that period of history in that part of the world was actually like!).<br/><br/>And as a musician/composer ('classical') I was equally impressed with the music (Greenwood & some amazing cello/piano by Arvo Pärt), which (IMHO) doesn't so much 'illustrate' the story as take on a life/character of its own. <br/><br/>Strongly recommended, but remember to listen (how could anyone not??) as well as watch for the 'full effect'."

","There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie with a very well written and well developed storyline with an outstanding cast.The character development is also top notch,especially for the main character,Daniel Plainview,you go on a long journey with this character for two and a half hours and the characters whole story is very well written.It is without a doubt one of Daniel Day-Lewis's greatest characters,he puts all his heart and soul in to this role and well deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role,you wouldn't even believe it is actually him.The only think that really bothered me is that the title is very off putting,it makes it sound like it will be a very violent intense movie,which it really isn't,I got why it was called There Will be Blood toward the end,but as you're watching it you expecting a lot of violence and war to eventually break out in some way,which dosen't happen.There Will be Blood is a great drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers. <br/><br/>Set in early 20th century Texas,Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis),a self made tycoon,will stop at nothing to expand his empire."
"nrr817","10","1","2","14 February 2014"," An Incredible Story of Ambition vs Faith
","There Will Be Blood is one of the best films of the 2000's. The great Daniel Day-Lewis gives us (at least in my opinion) his best performance with his portrayal of the ambitious oil pioneer Daniel Plainview. So determined and greedy is Plainview, he goes to the length of even proclaiming his adopted and deafened son HW his competition and an enemy after HW wants to follow in his father's footsteps and start his own drilling company. An incredible story is also told of how entrepreneurship and ambition clash with the old-fashioned, faith based values of the traditional priest Paul/Eli Sunday, who was played by Paul Dano.<br/><br/>The film also has many great scenes, but it has one of the most memorable scenes of the 2000's. Anyone who has seen what happened in Plainview's bowling alley and has heard Plainview make that sucking sound and utter those famous words, ""I, drink, your, MILKSHAKE. I DRINK IT UP!"" has most likely had that sound and those words stuck in their heads after watching it, myself being one. As much as I liked No Country for Old Men, I also believe There Will Be Blood should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. A truly great work of art."

"aequitas_veritas_007","8","1","2","25 December 2013"," An American Epic
","The acting is second-to-none, the settings are realistic and beautiful, the characters are deep, but the story lacks a certain zest. The film is almost everything that I heard it to be, but watching the film, I found myself waiting for something to happen. I kept waiting for a certain something in the story that would entertain me as much as the characters themselves did. After a rather lengthy opening sequence with no dialog, the mood of the film is set fairly well. There are essentially two main characters clashing throughout, and mainly the whole movie is the will power of two men fighting. The movie itself is masterful simply by the mere scope of it all. <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis once again sets himself as one of the absolute finest actors of my time. The rest of the cast are equally impressive. Paul Dano outstanding in his dual role, and until the story shows that they are two separate people, I believed the young man to be quite psychotic.<br/><br/>Indeed the only place I find fault with this film is in the story itself. While I believe this to be an American Epic film, and would highly encourage a viewing from any movie lover, a single watch is plenty. 8/10 and I will not buy this on DVD or BluRay."
"jaldana-703-727137","10","1","2","21 July 2013"," Masterful
","Paul Thomas Anderson is, my honest opinion, the Stanley Kubrick of my generation. Kubrick had a way of making films that weren't just entertaining but also intelligent. There is also the fact of the incredibly haunting scores that accompanied his films. There Will Be Blood is the film that I believe will be what proves his genius. The film delivers an interesting commentary on religion and on capitalism.<br/><br/>In his previous works such as Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love, he worked on a more small scale. There Will Be Blood is nothing short of an epic film. It has a grand scale much in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia does. The grand scope of the film displays how large the landscapes are and just how much he has to conquer. The score of the film is just as compelling as a Bernard Herrmann score. Jonny Greenwood is on his way to becoming one hell of a film composer.<br/><br/>Finally it to be mentioned that the main reason to watch this film is because of the once in a lifetime performance done by Daniel-Day Lewis. He is a ruthless, but not heartless oil man. At times he shows the love he has for his adopted son but I always get the feeling that he might just be doing it for a purpose to show off a fatherly like perception that he wants his clients to think he has. The end is an amazing cinematic finish that can't be overlooked.<br/><br/>If you think that this film is too long then you are probably not paying attention to what a good film is. This film is one for the ages and I think that everyone should owe it to themselves to watch it and feel something from it."

","""There Will Be Blood"" is a 2007 film directed by P.T. Anderson and starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano.<br/><br/>It's the story of an oil tycoon, starting out in the early days of the century and going through to about 1929.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, and in the beginning, we see him searching for oil with a team of men. I have to inject something here: what I loved about the beginning was the lack of dialogue. Whenever we see westerns or pioneer films or whatever, characters speak as we do today. However, I believe that miners, trappers, traders, gunslingers et al. didn't do much talking, in fact, they were probably just one or two steps up from neanderthals, without much education, and living somewhat isolated lives. The beginning of this film captured this beautifully as the men worked side by side, saying very little.<br/><br/>Plainview becomes wealthy - he seems charming as he travels around with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) but he's out to get land as cheaply as he can, and he makes promises he doesn't keep. He ultimately comes up against the Sunday family, whose land he buys, but one of the sons is a preacher, Eli (Dano), and the two come into conflict immediately.<br/><br/>There's not much plot here; it's the story of a morally bankrupt man who becomes more and more morally bankrupt and richer as time goes on, more of a drunk, and more isolated. He abandons H.W. after he goes deaf as the result of an accident, but he's shamed into retrieving him by Eli making him confess his sins in church before he's baptized - the price Plainview has to pay in order to get the Bandy land, the last holdout.<br/><br/>The film is propelled by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, the young gay lad of My Beautiful Laundrette, the star of My Left Foot, Lincoln, the hunk in Last of the Mohicans - the man's range is unbelievable. He gives a terrifying performance. Like his performance did in Gangs of New York, Day-Lewis scared the hell out of me as this volatile man who would just as soon kill you as talk to you. It's searing, it's gut-wrenching and ultimately devastating.<br/><br/>Without an actor of his caliber, I can't see this film being successful - it's too long, for one thing, and there's just not that much story. Paul Dano is very good. I've read that some felt he wasn't dynamic or charismatic enough as the preacher, but I think the point was to be very different from Plainview in personality.<br/><br/>All in all, worth it for Daniel Day-Lewis, as are most films in which he appears."

","There Will Be Blood may be one of the best movies made in the 2000's. Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is a masterpiece, and Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview should be considered the 8th Wonder of the World. If you ask me, this movie should have taken the award of Best Picture at the 80th Anniversary of the Oscars. This movie is just unbelievably breathtaking from beginning to end. I myself just finished watching it for the 5th time a few days ago, and to me that movie will never ever get old. For someone who has not seen this movie, I highly recommend it as long as you are not bored easily and care more about the characters and dialog rather than a magnificent storyline and persisting action.Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the great directors of our time. He has to be mentioned in the line up with Tarantino, the Coens, Darren Arronofsky, and in my opinion, even Scorcese. With P.T.A holding 3 of the 5 spots in my ""Top Five Favorite Movies"" list with: Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, and The Master, it's easy to tell that he is my favorite director and that is why i am praising this movie so highly. Just the way that he uses his camera angles and ability to direct his actors are both astounding. Paul Dano should have at least been nominated as Best Supporting Actor, with his role as Eli Sunday, if not have won it. I give full credit to this movie turning me into the movie lover that I am today."

","Its worth seeing this excellent movie .. if only to see Daniel Day Lewis. He won the 2006 Academy Award for his great performance as the grotesque Daniel Plainview .. a man who hated everyone .. and ended up rich and very much alone. His single-mindedness in relation to money, is not so un-common in the real world. This epic movie runs for 122 minutes (it seems shorter) and it pulls no punches as it hammers home some lost truisms. The false prophet Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) has his head smashed in by Plainview who slips into alcoholism ""due to loneliness?"". His final act is to do some good (he thought). He hated all men .. but a false prophet ? That was too much. In a way this is a study in self loathing--a study of the obsession of money--and what it can do to an unbalanced individual."

There are times in the movie where the protagonist Daniel Day-Lewis does something really dark. Also the movie feels rather long and quiet at most parts. Most of the intro of the movie has no talking at all. But other that there is nothing terribly wrong with this movie. There are also several great lines in this movie. One of my favourite's was ""I drink your milkshake!"". That quote stuck in my head for the rest of the weekend.

","An oilman's quest for the American dream that spans 30 years slowly turns into a bad ego trip in this loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's ""Oil!"". Paul Thomas Anderson's usually a master storyteller, and a great director, too. However, he doesn't quite do as well this time around, and the film doesn't live up to the critical hype, therefore making it overrated. Some moments work, others just... drag, rendering the viewer as to not give a crap what's going on. On the bright side, Daniel Day-Lewis does an over-the-top performance that ultimately won him another Oscar, its look fits the period, the music is stirring, and there's some intense parts. But, as a whole, it doesn't satisfy, give us a big payoff for spending 2 1/2 hours watching this, or bother to be more entertaining. It's a relatively tough film to watch, but you don't feel rewarded for doing so. You don't have to sit through this film to understand the nature of greedy people like Daniel Plainview; you might have somebody in your family like that. If not, just watch better movies about their rises and their falls."
"timbertea","2","2","7","6 January 2011"," Another grossly overrated film.
","I had much higher expectations than what this film delivers. It starts out slow, but reasonably well. It had a bit of potential, but it never delivered upon that potential. The pace is slow, and dreadfully so in many places. It starts off with what appears to be a fairly well done recreation of the early days of the American oil industry, including the blackmail of competitors to get them to sell out by controlling distribution. (Someone could say the same thing for the beverage industry, and most of the food distribution network today. Hint for someone who wants to make a documentary film!) While the main character has some depth, his transition from merely greedy to murderous hater of all humanity is a little abrupt to be completely believed. I found this movie primarily depressing, and a torture to sit all of the way through."
"vikpk","2","2","7","15 April 2010"," Vivid and bleak
","I gave this film 2 for two reasons. One over the lowest grade of 1 for day Lewis' good effort at acting. The trade of directing and camera work is also impressive. However, the depiction of the ""religious people"" is yet again simplistic annoyingly judgmental and plain nuts. That deserves the low grade.<br/><br/>Just think of the maniacal Eli with his lust for church power and influence at his young age. The scene at the church where Eli cast out an evil spirit from an old woman is laughable. No true Christian community would stand the nonsense theatrical yelling of their preacher. Even more ridiculous is the slapping on the face of the kneeling Plainview in front of the whole church by Eli. This is not church this is torture. While being slapped Plainview yells ""I'm a sinner! I'm a sinner!"" <br/><br/>My goodness, aren't there any churches left so the director or writer would go and do their homework before they mesmerize their audience with insane depictions of a congregation on a Sunday morning? Well, they can blame it on the novelist, I guess."
"MartinJamesLong","5","2","7","24 January 2010"," Overrated and boring
","I can see why Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar for this film. His performance, as Daniel Plainview, is absolutely marvellous. I also liked the bleak tone to the film and some of the imagery and cinematography.<br/><br/>However, there wasn't much else that I liked about it. The role of Eli Sunday was quite a complex one and required a far better actor for it than Paul Dano. Dano has very little charisma and as such, most of the scenes with him in failed miserably. Also, the film could have benefited greatly from further character development of some of supporting cast. Plainview's seemingly senseless murders were definitely in tune with his character but we knew very little about the people he killed, so it was very difficult to care about them.<br/><br/>The ending was almost a saving grace for the film. I really liked it but it doesn't detract from what is, essentially, a very boring film.<br/><br/>Just about gets a 5/10 for Day-Lewis's performance. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this film.

It left me with a feeling like it never actually succeeded in having a good enough script to back-up the cast. Maybe there was mystery and intrigue, but the final scene where... well those who have watched it know what happens.... is just truly an anti-climax.

","This is an interesting film. Interesting in a very broad sense. For a start, it's been praised beyond its worth. Why? It's very slow and very meaningful and it seems that slow and meaningful is the Emperor's New Clothes when it comes to modern movie audiences. To glance at your watch is sacrilege; to question any aspect of its import is lowbrow.<br/><br/>I did like There Will Be Blood. I just didn't love it. It has moments of real quality - every one of which is about Daniel Day Lewis, whose own performance in this movie really can't be overstated. He is a towering presence here, even handling the rather clumsy ending with real commitment and passion. Although I ultimately wasn't bowled over by the destination, I was 100 per cent there with DDL throughout the journey.<br/><br/>The film charts a man's spiral from integrity to madness but the most interesting arc is Daniel's relationship with his son. Dillon Freasier as HW is a great foil for DDL's Daniel, and his rejection by his 'father' is horrible and real. Although, strangely, I found no part of this film genuinely moving. There's a detachment throughout which is only alleviated in a single brief flashback to the relationship the boy once enjoyed with his father.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Daniel's character is peeled like an onion, but I didn't feel any single revelation was truly momentous. Instead we get a series of insights which I was surprised was deemed to be sufficient to build into Daniel's ultimate disintegration. His reunion with his young son is so fierce and then we leap forward to the boy's marriage and everything's fallen apart. We're left to fill in the gaps for ourselves, which is less than satisfying when the demise of that relationship is pivotal to the film.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a bit long and I found myself shifting in my seat and welcoming the end credits.<br/><br/>As so often, don't believe the hype and you'll enjoy the film. Believe it and you might be a bit baffled."

","Maybe rack it up to all the hype, but this movie didn't meet my expectations. Agreed that DDL's acting was superb, and Paul Dano and Dillon Freasier also turned in really convincing performances.<br/><br/>You should expect to sit through 2 1/2 hours of a character study, which is what I was expecting. But, I thought this study could have been done better than it was. Two specific examples: 1) there were things that Daniel Plainview SAID were part of his personality, but I would have liked to see more supporting situations in the movie to prove them; and 2) I felt PTA could have given the audience more insight into WHY Plainview was the way he was.<br/><br/>If you liked The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, you will like this movie. The pacing was similar, and you lazily follow the characters through subtle developments over a long time. I really appreciated what PTA was trying to do with this, but I think it could have been done even better than it was.<br/><br/>A minor aside, I was a bit distracted by the soundtrack that often sounded like a clip from the TV show ""Lost""."

","My reasoning for watching There Will Be Blood is the same as the reasoning for watching No Country for Old Men a month or so ago. A stark and brutal-looking film comes along, wins almost universal praise wherever I look and draws awards and nominations like ducks to water. Seeing as how much I enjoyed No Country, I wondered how exactly There Will Be Blood would stack up against it. Better? Worse? Equal? Only one way to find out.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a much more straightforward character study than No Country for Old Men. Daniel Day-Lewis as Plainview, the humble miner turned ruthless entrepreneur, is just as engaging and mesmerising as everyone has made him out to be. There's nothing I can say about his combination of method acting and research that hasn't been mentioned in any other review. It's sublime. He's a rougher, tougher Charles Kane whose every redeeming feature is actually part of what makes him so menacing.<br/><br/>Now that I've got the obligatory Day-Lewis reference out of the way, now onto the rest of the film. The only other PTA film I've seen is Boogie Nights, which sounds like a far cry from There Will Be Blood, and in many ways it is (although I did notice similar use of long takes of dialogue). The rest of the film is an experience I'd best describe as ""visceral"". Despite the title, there is very little actual bloodshed, but what there is hits you hard and unexpectedly. The film even manages to generate a few moments of tension that get under your skin in a good way. Hell, there's even a couple of laugh-out-loud moments (this may sound odd, but I laughed more during There Will Be Blood than I did during Juno).<br/><br/>The film rumbles along at a peculiar pace, from the 2001-style opening to an unforgettable conclusion. In between, your attention is captivated by Plainview and his world, a world of greed, lies, hard work, inconveniences and, of course, blood.<br/><br/>Any assessment I make of There Will Be Blood always comes back to asking myself whether it's better than No Country for Old Men. Although the two have very little in common, they're both excellent, and it's tough to decide which one to give the edge to. It will be interesting to see how they fare at the Oscars, especially against each other. There Will Be Blood was an excellent film, and not just solely on the back of Day-Lewis's performance. It's a gripping experience, and will constantly surprise up until the bitter end."

","""I drink your milkshake!""<br/><br/>After going to see this film i left the cinema thinking to myself: <br/><br/>""I may have just witnessed one of the greatest movies of all time"" <br/><br/>Its a story of an oil tycoon called Daniel Plainview (played by daniel day lewis) who accompanied by his son, takes over a small village in the desire of oil and money. There are many side tracks for Daniel on his way to success and this constructs a marvellous and emphatic film.<br/><br/>The beginning is a 15 minute sequence which involves no dialogue. Its extraordinary how a 15 minute clip with no dialogue could keep me so gripped to the film. Its an illustration of how Daniel strikes oil for the first time in the method of mining for silver. The mesmerising opening sequence is similar to the beginning of 2001: a space odyssey in which the discovery of human kind takes place. The beginning of 2001 is epic, extraordinary and fascinating much like this opening. This opening is about the beginning of a business filled with greed.<br/><br/>People say that money is the root of all evil. The lust of money drove Daniel to lose everything he loved. At the beginning, he says that he loves everything. But as the film goes on and as his oil business increases Daniel turns from an omnibenevolent person to an omnimalevolent person. This deterioration of character to Daniel is all because of the greed and lust he grew through his business. Oil is the root to all evil in this film.<br/><br/>Daniel buys the lease of the village which the oil contains from Eli (part of the family that live there) in a transaction that seems fair and reasonable. But later, Daniel's true greedy side is shown when he rips off Eli. Eli asks Daniel for his money and instead of handing the money over, Daniel hands him over a few slaps and a rub in the mud!. Whether this is out of anger because of Daniel's child becoming deaf or Daniel showing his true colours, its a fantastic scene.<br/><br/>One thing i noticed while watching the film is the fact that many themes in it resemble Kubrickian style. 2001 was a Kubrick film as mentioned earlier and the theme of discovery is explored in there will be blood much like 2001. Furthermore, the superb musical score of the film is very similar to Kubricks 'The Shining'. The music is cold, hard and gritty. At one point i believed that the opening musical score was taken directly from The Shining but this was under debate in between my friends!. The overall music score of the film involves very classical style music which is the music Kubrick used in all his films. The ending i pondered was resemblant of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' in which it ends with one cool line (""Im finished"") and is rounded off with a long classical score. Kubricks ""Eyes wide shut"" ends similarly to this in which it ends with the one line ""Lets f**k"".<br/><br/>The ending is very crisp. Daniel loses his son and his business. At this point, Daniel is completely changed and is only a business maniac. The news of his son wanting to start his own business spurs on the idea that his son is a competitor and shouldn't be loved. Although the loss of his business is shown clearly, it is insinuated with the finished line 'Im finished!'. This is after he kills Eli. Daniel has lost his mind out of greed. The significance of the last line is perplexing. This could suggest his life is finished due to his inevitable trip to jail for murder or it could symbolise the ending of all family relationships due to Eli being his son in law. It is whatever you want to perceive it as.<br/><br/>This is a suspenseful and chilling masterpiece with breath taking performances and cinematography. My review is very linear, it would be best for you to go and see it! <br/><br/>10/10"
"kwoods-5","9","2","7","7 February 2008"," An absolute masterpiece
","There Will Be Blood is an amazing piece of work. P. T. Anderson has created a film so far beyond his earlier work that it can scarcely be believed to come from the same filmmaker. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is one for the ages. He appears in every scene of the movie, but he has such a ferocious presence that, for two and a half hours, you can't take your eyes off him. <br/><br/>This is certainly no popcorn movie. The teenagers won't be flocking to the multiplex for this one. It's so relentlessly grim and dark that I doubt it will do a great deal at the box office, but, for my money, it's easily the best film of 2007. This battle between capitalism and religion is truly a clash of the titans. The protagonist's journey from greedy obsession to madness is, in the hands of Anderson and Day-Lewis, simply astounding. The ending seems to have a love-it-or-hate-it quality. I thought it was a perfect ending, and I don't understand why some don't think it works. After seeing this film, I wish Anderson and Day-Lewis worked more often, but this masterpiece was well worth the wait."
"Matt_Layden","9","2","7","2 February 2008"," Chilling, Haunting and Beautiful. There Will Be Blood - One Of The Year's Best
","Daniel Plainview strikes oil while mining for silver. Knowing the riches there are in this field he quickly changes his career and adopts a son after his father is killed in an oil rigging accident. Daniel's greed for power and money consume him and turns his loved ones into enemies and quickly becomes the target of a young pastor, Eli, to turn to God.<br/><br/>Every time you hear that there is a performance so good it will win an Oscar, the first thing that comes to your mind is how boring is the film going to be? Monster, Ray and Capote all suffered this fate of not being able to keep up with the performance. With There Will Be Blood, P.T. Anderson gives us a stunning film that is as chilling as the performance from it's lead actor Daniel Day Lewis. If the film itself doesn't draw you into it's web, the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis without a doubt will. As it stands, it is impossible for him not to be recognized this year.<br/><br/>For the first twenty minutes or so there is no dialogue. It's just Plainview working underground, he's dirty and broken, but manages to find a way to still get money. Later on he becomes an oil man and uses his ""son"" as a cute image to get people to side with him. Lewis is remarkable here as you've all been told. He becomes to character, he is the character. While there have been amazing performances in the past few years, this one is without a doubt one for the books. Even if the film isn't remembered fifty years down the road, DDL's performance will be. Paul Dano is the supporting actor as the young pastor Eli, he also has a smaller role as Paul, Eli's twin. At times Dano is frustrating, his overacting is obvious for the character, who drives demons out of the residents, but there are times when his stone cold face is just too bare. Hearing him scream and whine like a little girl every now and then is a bit annoying as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful. Anderson knew exactly how he wanted this film to look like at he got his wish. The landscape is so beautiful, it becomes a character itself. It holds the oil or main character wants, the people who live on this land stand in his way. The film opens, much like No Country For Old Men, with views of the mountains and the land. Both films are beautiful to look at and watch.<br/><br/>P.T. Anderson's previous films are pretty fancy. With There Will Be Blood you can clearly see his maturity as a director. This is not to say his other films are bad, on the contrary they are very good. But There Will Be Blood seems to be in another category all by itself. It doesn't belong with the others, it stands on it's own. If you were to watch Boogie Nights one day and Magnolia the next, you would be able to tel it was from the same director. Here he manges to hide his style within the film so well that it doesn't jump out at you like the others. He is more restrained with fancy camera movements and more concentrated at what the film is about. It's about this man and his greed for working.<br/><br/>If the visuals are beautiful, then the music is chilling. Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead supplies the film with the score it needs to be the film it wants to be. Without it, it might not have had as much of an impact in some scenes. It's the music that drives these few scenes and it works perfectly. The thing that makes it work so well is that it's unusual and bizarre.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is one of the years best films. It has one of the best actors giving us a powerful performance for the ages and a score that is chilling to the bone. There are bits and pieces of comedic fare, but most of the film is dark, much like the main character of Plainview. The final act of the film is heartbreaking and shocking. If you didn't like the ending to No Country For Old Men, you might not like this one that much either. While it is a more finished ending, it does kind of just happen. But it goes out with a bang and yes the film does live up to its title."

","First of all, I would like to say that although I am pretty young (15), I have a great appriceation for film and the craftsmanship that goes into it. That being said, I'm not old enough to have experienced the ending of Psycho in theatres, see Brando's riveting performance in On The Waterfront without the hype from my dad, but I have seen such 'epics' as Cry_Wolf in theatres. Depressing right? I had been following this year in movies play out (for the record, it was an amazing year in cinema), and have been following TWBB for months now. I tried seeing it twice during its limited release (2 theatres nationwide), but each time, it was sold out days beforehand. I finally saw it a couple nights ago and felt compelled to write a comment. I thought that NCFOM and Eastern Promises wouldn't be surpassed, and I would go and watch DDL dominate the screen for 150 minutes, and see a very good film. I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie starts out with almost no dialouge, but with characters communicating through actions. It is done so eloquently, I felt like that if this was a silent film, it would've been just as good. The film continues with more brilliant cinematography, a dazzling script, and an incredible score. DDL shined as Daniel Plainview, who is one of the most haunting villains to ever grace a screen, but Paul Dano was also very, very good as Eli Sunday (I kept thinking Anthony Perkins as I watched him) and the cast in general is superb. The film runs a little long, but I enjoy longer films. Everything was in sync and impressed me, from the end credits to the accuracy on how oil was drilled in the early 20th century. There are also a lot of subtle meanings in the movie (DANIEL Plain-VIEW...think religion) and is not overly intelligent. Its a beautiful experience, and as I left the theatre, speechless, I could only think that I was more impressed with The Godfather, and that TWBB gave me the same feeling as after I saw Andy Dufrane sitting on a boat in Mexico, gazing at the sillohuette of Red. An amazing picture which should be viewed by all."
"Bobbyh-2","9","2","7","2 February 2008"," This stunning, masterful film has a lasting impact.
","Thirty seconds into this film, I was hooked. The stark opening sequence, coupled with the remarkable music, generated a level of tension that became electric, and never really let up. As a study of a certain kind of human nature, and certain all too human characteristics, it would be hard to conceive of a more potent blend of components: writing, cinematography, and--above all--virtuosic acting. While the cast as a whole was wonderfully effective, the work of Daniel Day-Lewis simply towers over anything I've seen on any screen for quite some time. I like to think I have a large store of descriptive language at my disposal but, i this instance, I feel somewhat stumped: volcanic (in places), nuanced (where nuance is needed), and always showing great care in the choices made, Day-Lewis, who is seldom off-screen, simply overwhelmed me. (HERE COMES A SPOILER) The final climactic sequence, coming at a point when it didn't seem that DDL could possibly have anything in reserve, was both hypnotic and horrifying. Happily, while I had felt that DDL simply blew Leonardo DiCaprio away in Gangs of New York, in this film he was superbly supported by everyone. Yes it was not fast-paced, but what of that? It was relentless and infinitely absorbing. It deserves at east a couple of Oscars if these awards have any significance at all--and this in a year when there was some very fine competition. I expect that this is a film that will stand among the very best of the coming decade. I look forward to seeing it again once I've had a chance to catch my breath. This movie shows how effective a motion picture can be as a synergistic work of art. DON'T miss this one."
"angelynx-2","7","2","7","26 January 2008"," Best Actor, yes. Best Picture, never.
","A gripping, utterly ruthless performance by Day-Lewis that definitely deserves acclaim, but a script with no narrative arc, no resolution of anything, just a dead-end stop in nihilistic gore. Is that it? the single-minded pursuit of profit destroys sanity and morality? that's all we get? <br/><br/>I can hardly believe that I've seen this film compared to ""Citizen Kane"". There's no sense of epic futility and loss here, not even the soul-aching bewilderment of Sheriff Bell's last lines in the also-open-ended ""No Country for Old Men"". It just...ends. All we can do is hope the butler knows who to call next. <br/><br/>Not even CLOSE to Best Picture of the year."
"iwatchedthis","7","2","7","14 January 2008"," was i the only one watching
","let me explain that i do not like westerns before you read any further. i actually think that the western genre was almost extinct before this year because we longer have a 'wild wild west'. western's only exist in a period piece sense. having said that i went to see 'there will be blood' with an open mind because i enjoy pt anderson movies. the sets, the script, the acting, the costumes... all of this was superb. my problem lies in my love for pt anderson and the lack of his direction in this movie. i felt like this was a movie that was directed by all of these other elements, and anderson really had no influence on anything that was going on. yes, it is possible that anderson liked westerns and really wanted to create a western and he was inspired by all of this... but in all seriousness, it felt like it wasn't enough. i felt like the movie went on a half an hour too long. by the end of the movie i wanted to die. this was probably because i had to urinate and also because i hate being in movie theatre's with the amount of riff raff that goes to the movies these days (thank god for VIP theatres). i was kept in the theatre by wanting to see something that would redeem the movie. i was wrong in thinking that something would. by the end of the movie i was left wondering if there was something i didn't get. afterwards i was left thinking that most people that had seen the movie, because of the intelligence level of the audience, didn't actually like the movie, but felt like they should like the movie because critics told them to. or maybe i am wrong and i just didn't get it."
"austenrb06","6","2","7","13 January 2008"," Day-Lewis makes the movie.
","I will say first that i think this movie needed someone like Daniel Day-Lewis to carry it through the 2 plus hours, and i don't think anyone else could have played his character nearly as well as he did. A lot of people that have commented on this movie have said that it was perfect, but i choose to disagree. I'm not saying it is not a good movie, it is a very well made one and definitely worth buying a ticket and driving into town (which i did) for. When I first walked out of the theater i could not decide if i was disappointed or if the movie (which i had been waiting to see for months) just wasn't what i expected, and i decided on the latter simply because the movie made me think the entire drive home and the next day. It seemed to me like there was a lot of buildup during some of the scenes where i expected something drastic and major to happen but those feelings just plateaued. I guess this could partly be attributed to the dramatic score by Greenwood, which for the most part was captivating but once or twice out of place or overdone. The sets and filming locations were very well constructed and thought out. I'm glad to see that No Country and TWBB, two fantastic films, were both filmed in my home state. Overall, I really enjoyed watching Plainview's descent into madness and utter hatred of man, as well as the story's views on big business and the money grubbers controlling oil at the time. Day-Lewis carries the weight of the film and Daniel Plainview is a character that i wont soon forget. This movie wasn't perfect but was fantastic and should be appreciated. As far as Oscar's go, I wouldn't be surprised if Day-Lewis wins Best Actor but for Best Picture, I think No Country will take it."

"Monotreme02","10","3","14","17 February 2008"," The best film of 2007; an outright masterpiece, it shook me to the bone
","Before delivering this new opus, Paul Thomas Anderson was already, in my book at least, one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers and certainly one of the best to grow and flourish out of the independent film scene and Sundance Film Festival. His films were unique in their style and scope even though Anderson didn't even try to hide his cinematic references; he openly discussed influences from Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese, and these influences were more than prominent in his films, especially his two oeuvres, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both of whom characterized with an ensnaring sense of visual style with dizzying, ever-flowing camera-work and featuring broad, multi-character palettes. Punch-Drunk Love was a deviation from his previous films in that its scope was notably smaller, but Anderson's visual style and ""indie"" film quirkiness were prominently front-and-center. It seems that the 4-year break since his last film have changed the director, who returns in There Will Be Blood with what is his most mature, epic and self-fulfilling work to date. Stripping himself of his Altman and Scorsese influences, this time around Anderson provides us not with a sprawling mesh of multiple characters or quirky dramas, but rather a singular, monolith character study perhaps most easily comparable to Citizen Kane; There Will Be Blood is, first and foremost, an utterly full and complete dissection of its main character, Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>After viewing the film I tried to imagine another actor portraying the main role, but came out empty handed. Half of what makes the character of Plainview is Daniel Day-Lewis' proficient, spellbinding, grand performance. His turn in this film has prompted me to go back and seek out all of Day-Lewis' previous films in an attempt to take in all of his film roles, and as I see more and more of him it is becoming my opinion that he is the single greatest actor working today, and perhaps who has ever worked. His ability to completely and utterly disappear into his roles; the wide variety of roles he has played  going from a gentle aristocrat in The Age of Innocence to an insane and viciously violent gang boss in Gangs of New York to a real-life quadriplegic artist in My Left Foot. The man is a truly a mystery; reclusive, managing to be perhaps the only actor working today who is selective about his film roles and seemingly refuses to act in something ""just for the money"" as many of the great actors have had to do over the years  it's no coincidence that he has done only 12 movies in 20 years; 4 of them in the last 10 years. After Gangs of New York he swore to never act again, instead focusing on his hobby of shoe-making  but I can't seem to express my thankfulness that first his director-wife Rebecca Miller and now Paul Thomas Anderson have managed to coax him back into the profession. His recluse is a curse for movie-lovers, and it is simply unfair to us movie-lovers, not to mention unfortunate, that perhaps the most talented actor of all time denies us his genius. His climactic performance in There Will Be Blood is not only a career best, but is also, in my humble opinion, a top contender for the single greatest film performance of all time.<br/><br/>Again deriving from his usual style, Anderson has stripped himself of his extensive troupe of famous regulars and populates his film mostly with unknowns and non-actors, although he does provide us with one more familiar face in the cast, the young Paul Dano. Although the young actor has previously had small, supporting roles in television and some lowbrow movies, last year he wowed us with his poignant turn in Little Miss Sunshine. If that increase in quality projects was any indication, his gripping, powerful turn in There Will Be Blood assures that his career is heading in the right direction. It is an incredibly skillful performance, least of all just because of its impressive ability to riff off of and play against the freight train that is Daniel Day-Lewis. It is a performance that deserves a lot more praise than it gets  people no doubt distracted by Day-Lewis' dominating role, but I'll have Dano know that I'm rooting for him, if that's any consolation.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson never ceases to amaze me. Two of his previous four movies are, in my opinion, unprecedented masterpieces, both have garnered 10/10 ratings from me, and both are very high up on my top 100 movies list. I thought that contemporary cinema couldn't get much better than Boogie Nights and Magnolia. But Anderson has succeeded in proving his true worth by delivering something that is at once entirely different from his previous two masterpieces but also an unparalleled modern masterpiece of its own. I feel torn because after viewing this year's other neo-Western masterpiece, No Country for Old Men, I was sure that this was the Coen Brothers' year, but after being absolutely blown away by Anderson's opus, my initial opinion is challenged. Masterpiece doesn't even seem fitting enough a word for this unbelievable, indescribable work. Anderson creates such thrilling scenes that my heart was frantically pounding throughout most of the film, reaching a peak in one of the most absolutely, downright incredible scenes in recent motion picture history, the now infamous bowling alley scene. This movie literally blew me away; it shook me to the bone. With There Will Be Blood, Anderson has crafted a technical, directorial and thematic masterwork, reinforced by an inexpressibly remarkable performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, and delivers the best movie of 2007 and one of the single greatest modern classics of contemporary cinema."
"fertilecelluloid","9","3","14","10 January 2008"," ""There Will Be Blood"" delivers on its promise and then some
","We are promised that ""There Will Blood"" and there is in Paul Thomas Anderson's intense tale of oil man Daniel Plainview's (Daniel Day Lewis) war with the world. Plainview is a man in competition with himself and everybody around him. He drives his competitor's into the ground and makes no concessions to anybody . He is a complex, admirable (at times), fascinating character who possesses more than his fair share of humanity's worst excesses. Anderson pits his surly protagonist against a smart, young fundamentalist Christian who is on to his game but lacks Plainview's sociopathic ambition. The film's main character is the juice, but we're also rewarded with intense sequences involving much pain, lots of blood, and shocking, terribly convincing violence. Scenes featuring mining accidents resulting in injury or death are uncomfortable to behold. ""There Will Be Blood"" has the intensity of ""Taxi Driver"" and that film's riveting focus on one character. It is not a horror film in the narrow sense, but it trades in horror's base elements -- suspense, abnormal psychology, violence, greed, fear and blood. Several dozen pints of it. This is riveting stuff. But what do you expect from Ghoulardi Film Productions?"
"mistarkus","10","3","14","8 January 2008"," Grandiose Classic
","A throwback to great movies from decades ago with superior character acting, bombastic musical scores, grandiose cinematography and deliberate, but by no means slow or boring, pacing. Pacing that takes you and immerses you for quite some time into the setting and the period.<br/><br/>The cinematography, direction and score all are great but will most likely stand out in history after the movie becomes a classic is the superb acting. Daniel Day Lewis's performance ranks amongst the greatest acting by Brando, Pacino, Nicklaus etc. It is a little over the top and not completely realistic however, the nuanced facial expressions showing a variety of emotions at the same time, the unique talk and the stumbled and hunch walk become Lewis' own artistic portrayal of Daniel Plainview's essence.<br/><br/>The deliberate, suspenseful pacing along with the intense music and slightly artistic - not so Hollywood spin was reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's movies. Similar to Kubrick's movies the slower pacing is not detrimental to entertainment since it ""brings you there"" for more than a moment and allows you to ponder as you watch. This is a far cry from the instant gratification style of entertainment from most of the movies nowadays.<br/><br/>The music and acting created an exciting earnestness in the beginning as we witness Plainview make his deals and drill for oil. He is a shrewd businessman and it is interesting to see how he conducts his business and get what he wants.<br/><br/>The larger than life period piece could have gone anywhere and been about a multitude of things such as Plainview's business dealings, how he got his land, started drilling, his ideas on how to transport the oil, people who tried to take advantage of his fortune, the people he had to appease or even a commentary about the evils of capitalism. It did go into a lot of these topics but it did not dwell on them. Going into all this may have made it unwieldy or as some movies do, seem like it was trying to tackle too much and as a result sacrificing depth. The writer/director wisely focused on the most interesting theme which was the character Plainview's dark consciousness and internal agony.<br/><br/>He wages a war against his tortured conscious. Since no one is any competition or poses any threat to Plainview's ingenious business savvy and skills, his only real enemy or obstacle is his own heart and soul. He is strong enough to ignore his tortured consciousness on his own and punishes himself in his own way by sleeping on the ground and never enjoying any comforts or pleasures that his wealth brings. That is why the main antagonist and other main character is not some other person who might encumber his business but rather the one that makes him aware of his conscience and his sin. The priest represents a tangible, unavoidable, actual being that forces Plainview to confront his demons. The priest is literally thrust into Plainview's face forcing him to actually see and hear the representative of the institution which absolves sin and cleanses consciousness, the church.<br/><br/>The ending may be confusing and is highly criticized but if you keep the theme of the tortured spirit in mind you will understand the point of the final battle and the main point of the movie."

The only thing completely misses the mark for me is the script. It falls victim to the same thing that so many other potentially good stories do; the whole central conflict is dependent on people acting completely unreasonable. The whole plot would just crumble if people actually behaved and talked like people do or did back in the early 20th century. I'm also not sure how I feel about the score. It's almost as if it's overcompensating for the lack of anything interesting happening. Suspenseful music often keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire scene and you expect something awful or grand or surprising to happen. And then nothing ever happens. You begin feeling betrayed by it. Like it never delivers on its promise of action or drama. Then the movie just seems to lull on forever."

","For the record, I haven't seen a P.T. Anderson film that I enjoyed. Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love had some good moments but ultimately empty. Magnolia was inanely self-indulgent, his worst movie so far in proving ""pretentious"" with the capital P is the high definition of pro art-house film-making.<br/><br/>I blew off P.T. Anderson as yet another smarmy hack director until I read positive reviews gushing praise for There Will Be Blood, with a praise for Daniel Day-Lewis's ""magnificent"" performance and beautiful cinematography. So when the DVD came out to the Red Box, I rented it for a measly dollar. And I'm glad not a second dollar is wasted on another rental day.<br/><br/>Now, since I'm a Terrence Malick admirer, the cinematography is one of the sparse few redeeming features of the film. The Oscar win for Best Cinematography may be deserved, but it offers nothing new because dual cinematographers Néstor Almendros and Haskell Wexler achieved in much a similar pattern, albeit better in Days of Heaven which is 3 decades old. Daniel Day-Lewis' much-hyped performance? Not much. His performance is more intense and subtler in The Gangs of New York without going hysterically over the top like he does in some scenes of overacting that would have put Al Pacino to shame. The best actor in the movie is Paul Dano, because his role as a superstitious priest is credibly impressive. I thought he was unfairly robbed of the Oscar nom for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The pacing is plodding with a barely lean plot and characterization -- the whole movie interspersed with some boring spots. Unlike the prettily shot but awfully boring movie ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (I turned off DVD player after half an hour passed), There Will Be Blood held my attention despite its boring spots. It's safe to say that despite my admiration of older and classic films, There Will Be Blood is definitely not recommended for those with short-fuse impatience and short attention span. Patience is a virtue throughout the movie, until the last 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The last 15 minutes of the scenes involving the visiting priest and the protagonist-villain is so farcical it flips the entirety of the movie as though the movie's a joke on the audience. I'm not sure what was P.T.'s intention -- the finale so ludicrous it invites second thought as to what was the point of the movie -- not about power, greed, whatever. Sure, there's sociopathic villainy as embodied by the character portrayed with zeal by Daniel. Sure, the priest might have deserved the fate as a hypocrite seeking self-serving interest that antagonize the villain who reacts with emotional volatility.<br/><br/>Enduring two hours of fascinating characterization amid intermittent tedium of pacing only to be bamboozled by the ending makes the casual viewing hardly worth bothering. There's no such a thing as ""less is more"" -- P.T. insists on ""more is more"" and so we get the treatment of a ridiculously long movie with the story so basic it could be told in less than 120 minutes, as Malick have done in condensing his second feature film without noticeable loss of character development and plot despite a shooting script that's said to be equivalent of three hours long (including nature shot inserts) with a million feet of film shot.<br/><br/>Regrettably, despite the universal praise, Daniel's performance did not impress me. More of the same as he has proved to be an established actor with consistently good filmography since winning the Best Actor Oscar for My Left Foot. The ending with Daniel's crazed character on the verge of overacting confounded me on the real thematic point of the movie. Whether it's a deadly serious drama or a darkly comic period epic that provide hearty laughs at some intentionally absurd scenes with hammy dialogue is left to the viewer's interpretation.<br/><br/>Overall, There Will Be Blood is not a good analogy on power and avarice that transform the personality of the emerging oil baron. The novel that inspired the movie by Upton Sinclair is probably more substantive in fleshing out the characters and sharp proses for maximum literary impact. P.T. Anderson's effort is wasted making the film that turns out to be less stellar than expected. Don't believe the hype; that's the pretentious, snootily pompous New York - Los Angeles film critics' job to sell the picture that impress them the most in terms of acting, direction, production value, cinematography and script, neglecting to mention the bizarrely surreal comic and snail-pace aesthetics of the film. It's called ""director love worship."" <br/><br/>Disappointingly underwhelming. Don't believe the hype.<br/><br/>** 1/2"

","I really, really didn't like this movie. It really had no plot or climax and I felt that it skipped forward in time before the viewer resolved what was going on in the previous scene. I was looking at my watch like every 20 minutes to see how much longer I would have to sit through the most boring film ever. I think it is highly over-rated and I felt that the actors were over-acting! I felt a real disconnect with the main character because I felt he was so fake. I did believe Eli though, and that is why I gave this movie 2 stars. I really respect the people that enjoyed this movie because you probably found some emotional connection that I didn't have."
"maggielt1","10","2","8","19 February 2008"," There Will Be Exhaustion...but the good kind
","I went to the cinema fully prepared, no drinks ( so I wouldn't have to interrupt the film with a toilet break ) and excited. I knew what I was expecting. I did not expect violence, sex or drugs, otherwise known as what people expect these days from a movie. I expected a soaring and haunting score, powerful cinematography, exceptional direction and above all the performance of a lifetime from one Mr Daniel Day-Lewis...and My God did it deliver. I knew what was coming and I was left breathless and exhausted, an experience unchallenged by any movie I have seen before and I am likely to see for a long while. Granted one of my friends fell asleep, but don't let that dissuade you. I loved every moment, and while at nearly three hours it did stretch others to the limit, I was absorbed and involved and overcome with its majesty from its silent and lonely beginnings to its beautiful and monstrous crescendo. Mr Day-Lewis-unarguably the most accomplished and one of the greatest actors of all time- is the heart and soul of the movie, you cannot take your eyes off him...there are no words to describe how masterful he is, lets put it this way, he makes Johnny Depp look like the spice girls for acting ability...truly astonishing. Paul Dano is eery and quietly fantastic as the Preacher, a true profiteer of the worst kind of fraudulence; that of the soul. He cannot match Day-Lewis for performance, but come on, who could? H.W Plainview is similarly wonderful, subtle and emotive, he could teach young acting veterans such as Daniel Radcliffe a thing or two. The story is more Spartacus than Gladiator, and people of taste will appreciate that this is to the film's benefit rather than demise. It will never be a box office smash, and if it was I would probably love it a little less. It is subtle but no less deadly. It is phenomenal. You begin, your breathe caught in your throat, the first sonorous beat sounds and your heart pounds. The first word is spoken and you are hooked. The credits roll and you feel drained, exhausted and broken...but in the most spectacular and beautiful ways imaginable. It is so worth it. ""Do you take There Will Be Blood into your soul?"" Yes, yes I do."
"schism101","10","2","8","19 February 2008"," Gripping and epic movie making!!
","P.T. Anderson's THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a gripping and dominating example of grand movie making bolstered along by a remarkable performance by Daniel Day Lewis. The film begins with dialogue free 15-20 minutes of Daniel Plainview (Lewis) attempting to mine for silver. This first part starts off slow but you are entranced by the actions and the details involved. When we eventually here the first lines of dialogue, we see Plainview trying to get the support of a local town to allow him permission to drill in there area. He doesn't find any support at all for his plans, but from the word of an anonymous tipster, Plainview finds out about a town called Little Boston, that is practically seeping with oil. He goes there and eventually confronts the towns local preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) a creepy and at times self deluded man, who is 'vessel to god' according to his father, as he appears on the surface, yet below just has the same greedy aspirations and self delusions that are already present in Plainview. Once the drilling has started and Plainview's wealth begins to grow so does his disenchantment and emotional departure from those around him, including his son, whose relationship becomes severely strained. What we have here is a film that looks at the development of three prevailing and powerful strands of American society Oil, Religion and Money. Plainview is the model of ruthless capitalism, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants in the pursuit of wealth and power, in one of the films best scenes he explains his characters motivation's in how he has ""a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people."" His almost sociapathic contempt for other people drives the man in pursuit of oil, and the wealth that comes with it. Day-Lewis is electrifying in the lead role, almost acting like a man possessed, always commanding the attention when ever on screen. Though particular mention should go towards Paul Dano as Eli, the preacher whose hellfire and brimstone sermons are the only attraction for the town of Little Boston, yet his preacher though flamboyant on stage, is also just as ruthless and greedy as Plainview, though in a less obvious manner. Along with the performances comes some superb direction from P.T. Anderson, that is certain to establish him as one of America's most important filmmakers, and added to that is a superb soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, an eerie and minimalist composition that is combined with orchestral soundtrack. Overall this has contender for film of the year written all over it, and will be probably stand as a truly classic American film in years to come."
"mgiese22-1","9","2","8","2 February 2008"," There Will Be Oscar Winners
","What can I say about ""There WIll Be Blood."" Daniel Day Lewis gave an outstanding performance, which is definitely worthy of an Oscar win. The film is based on a book titled ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair. Daniel Day Lewis plays a man (Daniel Plainview) drilling/searching for oil in the early 1900's. He, has a way to baffle people into selling their land for dirt cheap prices (even by 1900 standards). Even though he says he will share some of the profits with whomever land it is, he rarely keeps his end of the bargain. Once a drilling goes wrong and his son's hearing is injured, Plainview's attitude begins to change for the worse. He starts getting extremely greedy and angry. There are so many good hidden ideas brought up in this film. One I want to comment on is Plainview's last name. Plainview has a one track mind and that is getting as much oil, and in return money, as possible (i.e. he has his plain sights on achieving more oil and money). He says in the film that he hates most people and he doesn't want anyone to be successful. I'm a little skeptical on the ""R"" rating however. There is nothing in the film that would warrant an ""R"" rating. Other than that the film was fantastic and I highly recommend it."

","This movie simply solidified my belief that Paul Thomas Anderson is a cinematic genius unmatched in present day film-making. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the greatest cinematic performance I've ever seen. I certainly hope the Academy sees fit to finally award Paul Thomas Anderson an Oscar for screenplay...he also deserves to win for Directing and Picture, but I think those are longer shots. If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor...The Academy's credibility will be shot.

I don't have much to say, only a short comment on Daniel Day-Lewis' performance. I'm no film school kid; I haven't seen a million movies and have no business comparing Anderson to Malick. All I can say is that Daniel Day-Lewis' performance was the best I've ever seen. For me, it's between him and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter (I haven't seen enough of the other great performances, ie Brando in Streetcar or Waterfront). Just the way he inhabits the character, inhabits the film. When he's off-screen (rarely), you're just on the seat of your pants waiting for him to return. Unbelievable."
"bobbobwhite","9","2","8","22 January 2008"," Great epic tale of a post-frontier oil tycoon
","(Earlier made the mistake in this review of calling this a Coen Bros film; was thinking of No Country For Old Men, another great one. Sorry for the mistake; correction made)<br/><br/>You might have thought Day-Lewis' character Plainview was just ""plain"" nuts in his desperate search for oil and he was, but most fantastically successful businessmen of olden days(some today too) were ruthless, heartless competitors who not only wanted to win, they wanted to bury the competition just as Plainview did. He was a certain type of harsh man perhaps more common in that day and time than now, but in contrast, he could also appear to be a regular family man and father and could be downright friendly in his own direct businesslike way of holding town meetings in which he gently but persuasively tried to convince landowners to sell or lease their land to him for oil exploration. And, he was mostly fair to them in what he paid for their oil rights. He was totally paranoid within his mental illness, but he was a very good businessman and fabulously successful in what he did. <br/><br/>This very different and fascinating film was at times hard to watch as it kept us upset and anxious throughout, always trying to figure out the madman Plainview and what harsh thing he would do next. On the one hand, so loving and affectionate to his non-threatening,(stolen-not-adopted) sweet young son, but so ruthless and killer-hateful to that same son when grown and wrongly perceived as a competitor. So single-mindedly driven in his search for oil, so crazy-minded when anyone threatened, or even maybe threatened, what he wanted to do to get all the oil and win everything while utterly crushing the competition. He was a self admitted people hater, and showed that immense hate whenever any disagreement with what he wanted arose. What a study in contrasts he was, and Day-Lewis made him one of the most interesting film characters in ages with his spot-on, brilliant portrayal of this madly-obsessed fortune hunter.<br/><br/>(A side note: when someone so outstanding in their field displays their immense talent and skill, it is a wonder and honor for us to watch, and Day-Lewis is that person in films today, as was Hopkins in his prime, and of course, Brando. Pacino, Sean Penn, and P.S. Hoffman might also be placed in that rare atmosphere today.)<br/><br/>Blood was such a special and uniquely made film, with many starkly lonely, but very effective mining country shots and a deeply brooding classical score contributing much to the special overall strangeness. As the young Plainview explored for his first oil discovery, we saw only him digging in his mine, with no spoken words for the first 15 minutes or so, to mesmerizing effect...when was the last time you saw(did not hear)that in a film? And Day-Lewis...what more can be said about his talent that has not been said? This much can be added.....see him every time you can as there have been few in his talent realm in the entire history of film. He is of greatness.<br/><br/>If I had my second thoughts as Anderson, the filmmaker, I might have ended this harsh story about 15 minutes before the actual end, or eased the ending a bit. But, that would have been a mistake, as the ending used did so accurately show the horror that a driven and deranged person is capable of doing to another when a slight done even many decades earlier is still felt hotly burning within and crying out for the worst possible revenge.<br/><br/>See this film for a great epic story of early-day, American empire building, and to get to know the type of man who did much of it a hundred-plus years ago, and may still do it in today's world(Bill Gates?).<br/><br/>Also, read J.P. Morgan's biography or that of Henry Ford if you think Plainview's character was pure fiction. It happened."

The whole business of building the big the oil derrick, getting the gusher, and the resulting fire at sunset in the desert were mesmerizing. The evil sounding music from the beginning to this scene worked brilliantly. Daniel D. Lewis is fantastic as the manic man striving to build an empire, and that crazy preacher kid is fun to watch as well. Like many, I found the ending disappointing, and in general, Daniel's descent into paranoid madness was a bit sad. If you've ever seen Italo-American masterpiece 1900, you may sense some similarities, but there I think it is more gripping. If you're a film buff, you must see this movie."

","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a self proclaimed ""family man"" out to make a simple living in oil. He's got his adopted son H.W. who he brings along to prove what a swell family man he is. Daniel is nothing of the sort. He is a greedy, businessman, and this movie, instead of giving a solid plot, gives a view of his character from 1898 to 1927, and how he changes over the years.<br/><br/>The cinematography is what makes even the dullest of moments in the film watchable. Every shot seemed to be thought out perfectly making even the smallest of things beautiful, and makes this movie a visual feast. The characters are interesting, as they should be, because this is not a plot driven movie, but a character piece. The acting is captivating. When Day-Lewis gives a speech, you want to hear it. Paul Dano was also a great addition to the cast playing two roles, his main role a crazy preacher who is constantly badgering Daniel for money for the church. The writing for the characters was also good. Even with the big theatrical over-exaggerated pauses and unrealistic bouts of silence for dramatic effect, the characters felt real.<br/><br/>Don't go for the plot, but expect to see a time line of man's life and how he changes.

"JamesHitchcock","9","2","9","14 March 2008"," A Symbol of Heroic Evil
","""There Will Be Blood"" is based on one of the classic themes of the cinema- indeed, one of the classic themes of all drama- the rise and fall of a great man. Perhaps the greatest cinematic treatment of this theme is ""Citizen Kane"", and as in Welles's masterpiece the great man in this film is not a king, statesman or general but a business tycoon, and his ""fall"" involves a decline in his moral character rather than a reversal of his financial fortunes. The title may have been chosen to reflect Shakespeare's ""blood will have blood""- a line from ""Macbeth"", a play about another man who achieves temporal power at a terrible cost to his soul.<br/><br/>The film is set in the American West in the closing years of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of the twentieth. In 1898 Daniel Plainview is a silver prospector in New Mexico who, by accident, strikes oil. This lucky discovery enables him to become a relatively prosperous oilman, but he is to achieve far greater wealth when a young man named Paul Sunday offers him information about a vast reservoir of oil. This turns out to lie in Little Boston, California, beneath land owned by Paul's elderly father Abel. With the assistance of Paul's information, Plainview is able to buy the land from Abel, who is ignorant of its true worth, and to become one of America's wealthiest oil tycoons.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is too complex for me to attempt any sort of synopsis. There are, however, two major themes running through it. One of those is that of the family. Plainview, who has acquired great wealth through Paul's willingness to betray his family, is fated never to achieve happiness in his own family relationships. He never marries, but adopts as his son a young boy named HW. (We never find out what those initials stand for). When Plainview strikes oil at Little Boston, the escaping gases cause an explosion in which HW is deafened. The boy, left permanently deaf, is sent away to a special boarding school and becomes estranged from his father. Later a man comes into Plainview's life claiming to be his long-lost brother Henry; Plainview originally believes him and takes him into his business, but when he discovers that the supposed ""Henry"" is in fact an impostor, kills him.<br/><br/>The second theme is that of religion. The film can be regarded as an exploration of the Biblical theme of ""What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul?"" Plainview's great adversary is not a business rival but Eli Sunday, Paul's brother and the pastor of a local church. Plainview is not a religious man- his only god is Mammon- but agrees to be baptised as a member of Eli's church in order to purchase from another member of the congregation a piece of land which he needs desperately. Eli, who has a long-standing grudge against Plainview, takes the opportunity to humiliate him by forcing him to make a public avowal of his sins, including his abandonment of HW. For all his fire-and-brimstone fundamentalism, Eli has worldly ambitions of his own, and needs money to build up his church. The film's climax comes when he is forced to ask Plainview for financial assistance, which the tycoon sees as an opportunity to avenge his own humiliation many years before.<br/><br/>2008 will go down in history as the year when the two major contenders for the ""Best Picture"" Oscar were both in the Western tradition. The award eventually went to ""No Country for Old Men"", which can be regarded as a modern day Western along the lines of ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" or ""Lonely are the Brave"", but of the two I greatly preferred ""There Will Be Blood"". ""No CountryÂ….."" has its virtues, especially a great performance from Tommy Lee Jones, but overall I found that film too emotionally cold, and certainly not the Coen Brothers' masterpiece, as some have hailed it.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"", by contrast is a magnificent epic, beautifully photographed, with two great performances at its heart. One is from Paul Dano, who plays the dual roles of Paul and Eli Sunday. (He was originally cast only as Paul, but took over the larger role of Eli when the actor playing it dropped out; the script was altered to make the brothers identical twins). Eli is the sort of hypocritical, sanctimonious preacher who sees religion as a path to worldly success and power over others; in the early days he may possess a small kernel of genuine religious faith, but by the end of the film he is as materialistic as Plainview himself, happy to proclaim God a superstition and himself a false prophet in the hope of financial advantage.<br/><br/>The other great performance, of course, is from Daniel Day-Lewis. Like Sunday, Plainview is a man who possesses some genuine qualities, such as courage and determination (shown in the lengthy, wordless opening scene where he manages to extricate himself from the silver mine after breaking a leg), but he quickly becomes corrupted by greed. Despite his good fortune in material terms, his life is an unhappy, loveless, sterile one, dominated by his bad qualities, not just greed and avarice, but also envy, resentment and a bitter hatred of the rest of the human race. As he says: ""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people"". And yet, for all Plainview's faults, Day-Lewis makes him a titanic figure of epic grandeur- a symbol, like Milton's Satan, of heroic evil. At times he becomes almost pitiable. Together with the very different ""My Left Foot"", for which he won his first ""Best Actor"" award, this is Day-Lewis's greatest film. His second Oscar is well deserved. 9/10"
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","9","4 March 2008"," A true vision of hell
","People will rave about Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. Indeed, it is one of the greatest performances of the past year. However there's a lot more about this film that is fascinating and great than just the acting. It is certainly one of the best things about the film, but it's difficult to describe how it works and why it works well. The film is simply powerful in it's subtly and it's vision of the early 20th century America. The idea of oil drillers and petroleum operators is, in itself, fascinating. The film uses these ideas and works them through the character of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis). Daniel is a man, destroyed by hard work and closed mindedness, who has a son, HW, who doesn't even belong to him and who is is seriously deranged by the utter aimless direction that his life is slowing heading toward. Sure, he has the ability to become prosperous in business and in wealth, but it will never truly change him or help him. He is a man who is already lost in his extremes. Enter Eli Sunday(Paul Dano), a bible thumping, arrogant, and greedy person that Daniel Plainview despises. Daniel hates people who use religion to make money and to not accept responsibility for their actions. Eli Sunday's money making religious scam business is more successful than Daniel's oil drilling business, despite how they don't appear to work as hard as he or his men do. Both Eli and Daniel are bad people. Daniel is bad because he is a mess of a man who, despite being successful and smart, is a liar and does 't think twice. Eli is bad because, although he is also successful, he is arrogant, loud, annoying, and doesn't seem to realize who Daniel is. The film is about how these two men are able to exploit each other and cause the downfalls of each of their businesses. This is a film that truly says something about how confused the human spirit can get under the most bizarre circumstances. The two characters do end up completely losing it, but this isn't a surprise to anyone. When I first saw the film, I criticized it for the last third, which I felt went too far in it's grotesque nature. After seeing it a third time, I understand now that the last third of the film is perfect for the rest of the film. I knew that the two characters would be descending into madness, I just didn't expect it to be so extreme as it is in this film. The last third part of this film works because the audience has a sense of impeding dread from the very start. This is why the music by Johnny Greenwood in the film works so well, because it drones and sounds very industrial. At the beginning it's distracting, but you get used to it because, in a sense, it's like the soundtrack to hell. I don't believe in the afterlife in general, but if hell did exist then the world of this film would probably be like what it is like. As extreme as the film sounds, it is not because of the content. People going into this expecting a lot of blood and murder are going to be shocked that most of the violence is limited to the last third and they will most likely leave before them. What makes this film so extreme is how indiscriminate the character of Daniel Plainview is in the people he hates. He doesn't hate them to a certain extent or is mildly annoyed by them, he hates them all about as much as a human being can hate another human being. It is in this that drives the character down. These characters are bad people. Watching this film is like watching two hours of a big, beautiful, vast world being created and then seeing every single part of it get destroyed and set aflame in thirty minutes time. Daniel Day-Lewis does such a fantastic job. His character is so complicated and horrific and somehow he gets to a point where he can do whatever he wants. Daniel Day-Lewis goes off into his own little sick world in this and I will be very surprised if he is able to recover from it. Paul Dano is a good contender to go head-to-head with Day-Lewis in who can be the crazier character. It's a brutal ride, but it's accelerating and, above all, brilliant. This film took me into a fascinating and horrific world and I loved every minute of it. Truly a fantastic accomplishment.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: One thing I need to mention, however, is the ending. Many people have criticized the ending for it's grim and bizarre turn of events. Basically, it ends with Daniel Plainview finally having enough of Eli Sunday's lies and manipulation and beats his head to a bloody mess with a bowling pin. Daniel's butler comes down sometime later only to discover the bloody mess, with Daniel sitting by it. Daniel then turns around and says, ""I'm finished."" CUT TO HAPPY MUSIC. The obvious purpose of this ending is to show that Daniel is left with nothing. Of the two men, one could argue that Eli loses more, but the only thing Daniel doesn't lose is his life. He is dead in every way possible. The only way for him to conform to that is to make Eli be actually dead. I found it to be powerful, shocking, and very unique. It sure wasn't a pleasing way for a film to end. There isn't any real closure, but there isn't always a meaning behind everything in life. END SPOILERS<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-Perfect performance by Daniel Day-Lewis<br/><br/>-Beautiful look<br/><br/>-Excellent attention to detail<br/><br/>-Marvelous opening scene<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>-The music may be annoying for many viewers<br/><br/>-The final turn of events is off-putting, to say the least"

","Having read Upton Sinclair's crude novels as a child, I did not know what to expect from this film. The title depicts exactly what is promised. Daniel Day-Lewis plays a greedy miner, father, and businessman, so dirty, that I cannot imagine him without dirt in his nails and oil on his face. When you watch this film, pay attention to his body movement, as he becomes the limping, physical personification of evil. ""There Will Be Blood"" is an All-American account of a man's mistakes throughout his lifetime; confessing how this country was based on greed, hate, competition, and (with no surprise) blood. Paul Dano gives a chilling performance as an adolescent priest who mirrors Plainview's personality. Overall, this film will teach other actors and filmmakers, for years to come, what it means to make a film with a message. The reviews I've read on this film have so far been unanimous. This film is a masterpiece in every aspect: ""Blood"" offers camera-work with all the right angles, a set design that is almost too realistic, an instrumental score that could tell the tale alone, and a set of performances that we could all learn from."
"dacavari2003","10","2","9","6 January 2008"," The ""Great American Movie""?
","I would say this has to be a serious contender for the ""Great American Movie""-- a story that embodies fully and nearly perfectly, if not perfectly, the American mentality-- the dream to win at all costs, to achieve beyond all measure, to change the world at the expense of your soul. If not that, this is at least the most perspicacious comment on the ethos of America that has pushed it to the front of the world stage for all these years (and led it to war most recently), the mentality that is responsible for all the great achievements and shortcomings in the American character. I always thought P.T. Anderson was gifted, but I was never wowed until now. I haven't been wowed like this since ""The Godfather."" As for the technical accomplishments of this film, they are quite close to perfect-- from the score, the editing, the sound mix, the cinematography, and of course, Paul Dano's amazing performance and Daniel Day-Lewis' unmatched immersion in his role. Have I run out of SAT adjectives to praise this film yet?"
"buzzbruin","9","2","9","3 January 2008"," A strange absorbing film
","P. T. Anderson makes an old-fashioned film completely different from his other films. This is a story of an oilman around the turn of the last century, a man who is driven by ambition greed, and hatred for his fellow men. He is really a huckster conning landowners out of their mineral rights by the sheer strength of his personality, and his ability to answer any question they might ask, and satisfying their poverty-driven greed by promising them untold wealth. He is opposed only by an impossibly young preacher who tries to help his people, but fails. The movie revolves around the evil,power struck, hater of men played by Daniel Day-Lewis. His morality knows no bounds and he is willing to do anything, including cold-blooded murder to gain what he wants. The film is great in showing the plight of the land-owner and working class of Americans during this period. It is epic in all places, acting writing directing music, photography. PT Anderson and Lewis are GREAT film-makers. Everyone should see this film."

","This film is simply stunning! There is not a scene in the entire film that didn't keep me so gripped to the screen that i felt that blinking would mean that i would miss part of this stunning work. My eyes may have hurt after watching this film but that was well compensated for by the masterful direction, stunning cinematography and, dare i say, the best acting in a film that i have ever seen. now on to the predictable part, Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance can not be compared to previous screen greats like Marlon Brando, Robert Deniro and Al Pacino(who is a bloody arrogant bugger!) because in my opinion, it is quite simply better. I have never seen a film where the main protagonist made me so intrigued as to what was going to happen to him next. The other performances were only elevated by this and, although not as stunning as DDL performance, were never over shadowed by it. this is a great credit to the actors and the stunning direction of PT Anderson who has gone about creating one of the great works of modern cinema!"

","After reading so many good reviews of this film I was really looking forward to watching it. Many reviews mentioned the soundtrack and I agree it was superb, as was the acting.<br/><br/>My problem with this film was the lack of conflict. Good drama needs conflict and the conflicts in this drama were poorly manufactured. There was no realistic struggle or hurdle to overcome and that reflects a weak script.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have minded if the drama centred on how the protagonist was a driven man that had to do what he had to do. A character study can be enlightening, but this one wasn't. The story changed tack on a couple of occasions and they were poorly constructed story points that only succeeded because Daniel Day Lewis' great acting.<br/><br/>This could and should have been much better. The cinematography is excellent, as was the editing and direction.<br/><br/>It's great to watch something that isn't about comic book characters and CGI, so watch and enjoy it for what it is - great acting, a superb soundtrack, but a hollow story."

The movie has Daniel Day-Lewis as the lead and Paul Donna as a supporting actor.
Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant in the film and I think Paul Donna does not get enough recognition as the priest whom he portrayed very well.

My only criticism for the movie, is that I felt it lacked jeopardy and maybe needed the stakes raising.. You could argue with me however, that the film focused more on the personalities themselves! And did not need to rely on complexed plot points, action or anything else that might be expected from this genre..

","Why do I love this horrifying film so much? First, it has a balance of pace not seen since Jaws. Slow, quiet, steady build-up, followed by crescendos. Those who are bored by variable tempo just might be adrenalin junkies - as if Jaws didn't stimulate enough. Next, there is Daniel's adopted son, H.W., acted by Dillon Freasier. Pay attention, Hollywood, this is a master class acting clinic put on by young Mr.Freasier. Steven Spielberg has done a phenomenal job of brainwashing audiences and critics for decades that children should act like they did in Close Encounters or E.T., but Mr. Freasier is an utter repudiation of the glib Spielberg lens. In real life, children are like H.W., dragged along by adults, and not emotionally or intellectually precocious or multi-dimensional, and least of all, artificially animated. Kids are simple and raw, like H.W., and that's, brilliantly, that.<br/><br/>But this is not about bashing Spielberg, whose films range from good to classic. This is about that almost extinct species of Hollywood film that was spotted in 2007: the epic classic. There Will Be Blood is a sprawling, immersive, atmospheric film that belongs near the head of the class in the company of The Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jaws, Star Wars, Rocky... you get the picture. I could go on about all the film's mastery, from acting, to music, to scene transition, but others have covered that very well. Instead, my takeaway is its message.<br/><br/>The film's power lies in its utter shredding of the political and ethical sciences in the face of the force of nature, personified by Daniel (who is not human, except in form): the world is animated by knowledge, courage, and action, not by right or wrong. Morals are a human artifact, our prism for gauging how civilized or primitive our species is. Inaction, ignorance, fear, and/or unwillingness to defend or develop one's property (moral action) are deserving of succumbing to natural primitive forces. Custodial rights flow to those who transform the resources of Earth and not to those who passively exist with them. It's a cold, impartial message from reality itself, and it's stark truth is why this movie is polarizing. Does a billionaire really bash a nebbish to death? Another human could choose to help or ignore such a hapless, insipid soul, but Daniel Plainview is not that human, for he is the personification of nature: survival means removing all doubt, so neither a fake brother nor a fake preacher can threaten his being, embodiment of life: animation. This is a man vs. nature story, and in the absence of man's action (moral and defending morality), natural action (Daniel) rules.<br/><br/>So, we are left with the question of our humanity: is an inanimate living being just another resource, like water, coal, metal, fire, or oil? According to this film, yes, so the animated form will not succumb to any inanimate resource, natural or human, even if the human resource has the potential to become animated. And that leaves me ambivalent about this movie's message, if not its quality, a 10."
"CinematicInceptions","6","1","3","3 March 2017"," Good execution, but lacking in content.
","This will probably be better to watch the second time around. There is not that much external plot to be dealt with here, which makes it significantly harder to follow because the story is about Daniel Plainview rather than the oil business that he creates. I'm sure that I missed a lot of subtle things that would make me appreciate the story more especially in the first half of the movie. <br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is a good character, but there were a few blanks that I had to fill in to understand him. Most notably, his motivation for greed was either not exposed or else I missed it. A character's goal is what typically defines him or her throughout a story, which makes proper exposition of that goal an important point to address. I was also lost with Daniel's motivations for doing things like dissing Eli at the well blessing and covering his face with a napkin. Part of this confusion may come from Daniel not having any concrete desire that he's trying to achieve. His greed seems to only be for greed's sake. He has no real plans for the money he makes except to use it to make more money. I guess in that sense he's not much more than a tenacious workaholic, though that description doesn't do him justice. I had similar issues in understanding Eli Sunday. Even to the end of the movie, I couldn't decide whether his piety was legitimate or not. <br/><br/>The direction of the film was definitely artsy, and I think that partly accounts for the long run time. It was clear to me that the every shot was deliberate, but I could not tell how the directing choices contributed to the story being told. I don't know if this means that the talent was wasted on a bad story or if I just didn't watch it with the right thought process. Either way, this is something to be aware of if you're not sure whether you want to see it. People applaud Daniel Day-Lewis' acting ability and his performance in this movie on its own, and I can see why, but there seemed to be something missing from it in the character. In a nutshell, I think the sort of filmmaking displayed here is skillful, but it would have been better if it were applied to a better script and story.<br/><br/>For prospective viewers, I would recommend that you watch the first 30 minutes and see if you think it's right for you. I had problems with it because I couldn't figure out the purpose behind the characters' actions or the director's decisions. There are just a lot of blanks that the audience is left to fill in, which I know could be a problem for people. If you are looking to pursue a career in film production, you should watch all of this because there are a lot of unique techniques used that are worth studying. But if you're just looking for something to watch for the night, you may not want to choose this if you aren't fond of ""Oscar bait"" movies. Overall Rating: 7.1/10"

","First of all , I started to watch with a sort of enthusiasm , but when the movie goes by, it got diminished. Daniel performed great , screenplay and direction was good, but there is no great and gripping plot in the movie. The story is just a rough trail of life , of a person named Daniel Plainview, every scene in the movie was filmed perfectly, cast acted great , mainly Daniel day Lewis , but the backdrop is weak story. In the whole movie you only can see the greediness and selfish attitude of Daniel, the desire to become a oil tycoon washed away humanity in him . showing the lead character in a movie as a negative one is not always a good idea. Showing evilness and brutality in a movie is not a issue, but there should be a reasonable story around that violent character, because he ain't a psycho . less importance was given to some lead cast , though that is not a big-deal . in my rating of 7 , 6 goes to Lewis and 1 goes to thin and weak plot.

","There Will Be Blood Film Review<br/><br/>In There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson showcases his skills as a director and screenplay writer in this twisted tale of a man's ultimate downfall. The film is critically acclaimed and finished second for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 2008, only behind No Country for Old Men, respectively. Anderson is able to display his talent through intriguing dialogue, a carefully-selected cast, a brilliant score, and a dark plot that makes the viewer think.<br/><br/>The film takes place mostly in Southern California beginning in the late 1800's but eventually goes well into the early 20th century. A young silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day- Lewis) strikes oil while hunting for silver in New Mexico. While raising his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Plainview becomes rich and is considered ""the oil man"" throughout California. One night, a young man finds Daniel and informs him of land bountiful with oil near the town of Little Boston. Daniel hurries to the small town with his son in search of the sought-after land. When he strikes oil there, Daniel becomes even wealthier and his ""family business"" thrives. However, as Daniel's wealth soars, his life begins to change for the worst and he spirals down until he becomes the corrupted, hateful man he is by the end of the film. <br/><br/>While making the film, Anderson had to be careful when it came to choosing who would play Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the two main characters, but he makes a seemingly flawless decision by selecting Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano. Day-Lewis returns the favor by giving one of the best performances of the 2000's and creating a character that is not only believable, but also relatable to the audience. He brings intensity and passion to an opening twenty minutes of no dialogue that otherwise, would not be nearly as interesting. Audiences see the evolution of Plainview from beginning to end due to Day- Lewis simply owning his role throughout the film's entirety. Anderson is considered as above most screenplay writers and directors when it comes to delivering a solid script and it is easy to see why in the film. By avoiding dialogue in the first twenty minutes, the viewer is able to immediately connect with Plainview's physically grueling lifestyle. This is a bold move by Anderson but it ends up paying off in a big way. Throughout the rest of There Will Be Blood, the characters' dialogue is provoking and helps drive the plot by creating conflict between Plainview and the people involved in his life. To make the film more intense, a score, by Jonny Greenwood, and several cues are used to create a sense of heavy tension between Daniel and life itself while also providing foreshadowing. Some critics consider music to be a tool that can be used correctly or incorrectly in film. It can make a movie boom or bust. Greenwood's score is key to the success of the film and its strong influence on viewers. Anderson also touches on several key themes in the movie that almost everyone can identify with in one way or another. Audiences are able to see the struggle for power and wealth and what its consequences can be. Religion and its positive or negative influence on a man's life is also prevalent in both Daniel and Eli. Both men fight one another to become ""God"" in their own sense. Anderson's dark tale of a man's downfall reigns in critical acclaim and for good reason. The film is strong in many categories. However, one issue that was made apparent was the pacing. At times, certain scenes felt drawn out and overdone. One scene, in particular, where Daniel and his ""brother"" are in a bar late at night, offers little to drive the plot and could arguably be removed from the film. This and other small instances could lead to some audience members becoming bored or disinterested especially considering the fairly long length of the film itself. Nonetheless, this small issue certainly does not outweigh the many positives the movie offers from a filmmaking standpoint. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is certainly not for everyone. The film has limited action sequences while also containing dialogue that actually makes viewers think. Many will certainly not like the cold, abrupt ending. However, by looking at the movie critically, one can see the many strengths the movie contains from both a filmmaking standpoint and as a lesson on life. People that can catch on to key themes and also enjoy tragedies or quests will love this movie. There Will Be Blood is a hit and is worthy of a 9 out of 10 rating."

"midas-jacobs","9","1","3","16 August 2016"," Eye-candy, but with substance!
","""There will be blood"" is about Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is someone in the oil industry. In this movie we follow him as he is growing his oil-empire.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who has previously directed ""The Master"", a movie that I really wanted to see, and after this movie even more. If it wasn't clear yet, Paul Thomas Anderson did an amazing job at directing ""There will be blood"", he also wrote the screenplay for the movie, but more on that later. Anderson is not only a good director, but also a good visionary director. This went hand in hand with the cinematography, which created stunning shots, that showcased the gorgeous scenery. It was no surprise to me that the movie won an Oscar for the cinematography. The cinematography was done by Robert Elswit, just to give him some credit. The director is really good at showing set pieces in a cinematic way, for example the fire putting out scene. This was one fantastic scene, with beautiful cinematography and set design. But to only make this scene better, the soundtrack kicks in. The soundtrack was really extraordinary. It was original - not reused - and fitted the movie well. In the first place the soundtrack didn't really feel right for me, but after seeing the fire putting out scene, I was convinced that the soundtrack really fitted the movie well. I previously talked about the directing in wide, open spaces and sets, but the movie begins with a small set. A small thing I want to mention is that a big part of the first act is completely silent. This is a ballsy thing to do, but just by visual story-telling my attention was kept. Really impressive. Let's go back to the small set. In that set Anderson really makes you feel claustrophobic, and sucks you into the movie almost immediately. Weird that the director didn't get the Oscar, but I don't know the competition, so I can't really say.<br/><br/>The acting is by far one of the better trades this movie has to offer. This can also be seen by the Oscar that ""There will be blood"" has won. In case you're to lazy to check, I'll say it here. Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar for his role as Daniel Plainview. And, was it deserved? Yes, yes indeed. Daniel Day-Lewis is an amazing actor and proved that in ""Lincoln"" again. Also the fact that he has won three academy awards is a good argument to prove that he is a very good actor. In this movie he absolutely nailed the role of Daniel Plainview. He is convincing as the character and was able to show his emotions very well. Even in the end, when he has kind of lost his sanity, he still preforms very well. The other actor who had quite a big role was Paul Dano's character. Him I didn't like as much as Daniel Day-Lewis, but that's just maybe because Day-Lewis overshadowed him. I also found that Paul Dano over-acted a tiny bit, but this is not really a bad thing, as shown in the preaching scenes. More on these later. The last person I want to mention here is the actor of HW. He was not to great. I didn't really felt the ""power"" of his performance, and I will definitely not remember something of his performance.<br/><br/>The screenplay was, as said previously, written by the director himself. And was this part of the movie good? Well, you guessed it: yes. The Anderson has written fantastic monologues that were said brilliantly by the characters. which brings me to the characters. They were all interesting and multi-layered. Especially the character of Daniel Plainview. Plainview undergoes a lot of character progression and also has a character arc. His character has so much layers, that it is incredible that Daniel Day-Lewis was able to pull this role of, which is the more impressing. Plainview was also unpredictable, which made his character more engaging. Another thing I want to mention is how different the Plainview is from Eli. Eli is religious and Plainview is an atheist for one example. This only made the scene with the both of them interesting to watch, because you wanted to know how the scene would end, due to the unpredictability of Plainview. The story overall was solid and fun to watch. The ending, however, I found a bit odd, and not fitting. I liked that Plainview has lost his sanity, but where he kills Eli was just odd to me. I get his motivation, but it wasn't satisfying enough for me.<br/><br/>In the end ""There Will Be Blood"" was an excellent film. The movie was visually stunning, but it was more than eye-candy: It had substance. The story and characters were solid and the acting only helped to improve on this.<br/><br/>9.25/10"
"brianberta","8","1","3","26 July 2016"," Very intriguing
","The ""rise and fall"" archetype is often complimentary for gangster films. I wouldn't call ""There Will Be Blood"" a gangster movie. However, it was interesting how they implemented that archetype into this film. They did so with great results.<br/><br/>The rise of a miner named Daniel Plainview turned wealthy oilman is explored in this film from the years 1898 - 1927. The film shows how he becomes wealthy, and how he takes advantage of those around him in order to achieve his goals at all costs.<br/><br/>This movie is very depressing in many ways. After H.W.'s father dies in an accident when he's an infant, Daniel adopts him, and he pretends that he's his son. He uses him just so he can help him deceive the Sunday family more. Also, it's really hard to watch the scene where he becomes deaf in an accident. However, despite everything he experienced in the film, his character represents hope. He shows that even though Daniel used him as a ploy for better business and wealth, he is still able to break free of the chains he's held down with. Since he and Daniel Plainview are more educated than the Sunday family, he is easily able to see through all of it and know that what Daniel is doing is wrong.<br/><br/>After you think about the film a little bit, you start to realize how Daniel used every character he met in the film. After he becomes fed-up with H.W., he spares no time in finding an excuse to get rid of him by sending him to a school for deaf kids. He just works with his long-lost brother to keep deceiving his workers with the family image. If his brother leaves the film, he - only then - brings his son back. Daniel Plainview is a really memorable character, because he is able to expertly deceive those around him without them being able to notice nor do anything about it. At some points in the film, the viewer starts to be tricked into liking Daniel Plainview and it's very easy to forget about his true colors as a result.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is excellent. The shots of the desert are gorgeous to look at, and the shots of the ranch feel atmospheric. Every shot makes you feel like you're actually in the time period this movie takes place in. One of the shots that the movie does very well is how it shows you how insignificant the characters are. It shows you a shot of a character. Then, the camera would move up to make it seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. This technique is best utilized in the beginning. After Daniel falls into a mine and breaks his leg, he has to climb out and crawl back to his fellow miners. A shot is pointed at him crawling on his back. Then, the camera moves up and shows us how much he has to trek back. This is a powerful shot, and it's good that they made this technique clear by utilizing it very well in the beginning. That way, the viewer would continue to be immersed every time they did this in the film.<br/><br/>The acting was really good. Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview stole the show. He deserved that Oscar he won. Every single line he spoke was convincing. Near the beginning of the film, his voice continuously evoked a slight feeling of distrust. As he got more suspicious and as he made more enemies, his facial expressions gave the viewer a feeling that something bad was about to happen. The highlight of his performance was at the end of the film though. He gives reactions so convincing that they might as well by passed off as genuine. When he slowly goes insane, the viewer feels like the same is happening to them. I honestly can't decide who I liked more: Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men or Daniel Day-Lewis in this film. Both of them were about equally amazing. I liked most of the cast. They were pretty good. However, if I'd have to criticize one actor, it would have to be Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. His performance was good for the most part. However, I felt like he lost some of his believability during the scenes of him preaching at his church. He seemed a bit over-the-top in those scenes. Also, there were a few other parts in the film where when he was yelling, his voice got a bit high-pitched and that didn't fare too well with me. Overall, however, he gave a good performance. He just didn't balance out the impact that Daniel Day-Lewis left.<br/><br/>The soundtrack works very well in the movie. There are some songs which sound very haunting, and they do a very good job at representing the feelings of deception that the movie provides. An example of a really effective soundtrack comes in during the gas blowout scene. The striking minimalist soundtrack sets a feeling of urgency, and it makes the scene suspenseful as a result. While the soundtrack worked very well in the film, I found it a bit uninteresting and bland to listen to on my own. It was a soundtrack which was meant to be listened to in the movie. It was still pretty good, but I'm not going to be signing off on its praises anytime soon.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this was an amazing movie which was almost perfect. Daniel Plainview and the tension he had with other characters in the film was great and the cinematography was very well-done. For the most part, the acting was good and the soundtrack was still good despite its flaws. This movie is often compared to ""No Country for Old Men"" as the 2 were filmed in the same desert. I think that this was an amazing film. However, I liked ""No Country for Old Men"" a little more."

No, Daniel is a sincere and flawed man, he admits his ambition, he confronts his mistakes, and to a certain point is recognized as a ""sinner,"" and is always judged by that, which he admits is other fallible humans who do not take their mistakes and are well regarded for it is for this reason that Eli's character bothers you so much, because it is as sinful as Daniel, and yet is always well seen (this is clear in the train scene, to where Eli part for their mission), and this character shift socially acceptable pursues and makes you want to fix your way nothing methodical and obsessive, it is clear when he kills the false brother and the false prophet making them confess their faults before they died .<br/><br/>Forgive my English translator google."

","What a movie. This is one of the best technically made movies that I've seen in quite some time. I really liked it...until the end. The first two hours of the movie were a masterpiece level experience, but in the final twenty minutes or so, it all comes undone and unravels. (I kind of had a feeling this was too good to be true throughout the first two hours, and that's not a bad thing as it reveals just how good I thought it was throughout). This is a movie that if it had a great ending, it might have been one of the best movies of all time, but it falls into mediocrity in the final twenty minutes. I wanted a summary in the end, a round up of the purpose of the greatness that had come before it, something new that had yet to have been revealed, but instead it felt like a reiteration of everything that was already shown, which was that Plainview was an a-hole. It was good, but due to the disappointing ending, can't say I'm a big fan overall, but the first two hours of the movie were truly spectacular and some of the better filmmaking I've seen in a while."

","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a driven hard-scrabbled miner and prospector. In 1902, he discovers oil in California. A worker dies in an accident and he adopts the man's baby. He promotes himself as a family man with his son H.W. and a sincere oilman. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) sells him information about oil on his family's farm. Paul's twin Eli doesn't trust him and is driven for his church. Daniel acquires the rights from everybody except hold-out William Bandy. As the oil flows, Daniel and Eli become bitter rivals and blood starts to run.<br/><br/>This is a slow-moving epic driven by a relentlessly intense performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. This movie is infused with his sense of menace and a self-assured intensity. Paul Dano has his weird creepiness. Paul Thomas Anderson creates a completely immersive world filled with hard characters. It is absolutely beautiful and stark with its offkey scores. There are scenes of perfect beautiful ugliness. The movie explodes in intensity from time to time but mostly it has a tone of menace and stress. I like it but I would like it more if it moves faster.

","The only thing I have to say, which is contrary to other people, is that this story isn't about oil, or madness; it's a story about greed, and it's not the main character who is greedy... it's the others.<br/><br/>The main character works hard to earn money, and is forced to take any action possible to achieve his goals. He's cunning, and manipulative. But one thing he's not, and that is a parasite. It would seem that everyone else in the movie is either a moocher, or so stupid that they deserve to be in poverty.<br/><br/>Some people think the main character is a psychopath, but by definition a psychopath is charming, and a parasite, which doesn't apply to him. The main character also shows concern for other people from time to time, thus he only wants to see his opponents fail, not everyone. And when his son wanted to become his competitor, he let him know the truth, just to hurt him. The only true psychopath in the movie is the pastor, who uses religion to feed his social status.<br/><br/>So ironically, everyone says the main character is greedy, but he only negotiated his way to success, in addition to working very hard for it. The people who are truly greedy are the ones that tried to socially manipulate him into submission."

I, however, think these points are values that add up towards this films incredibly forceful climax. I think (as my title suggests) that this film quite happily goes against the flow of the more regularly sourced dramas which use the same techniques to get to the viewer and therefore seem quite insignificant. This film stands out by not trying to stand out.<br/><br/>Day Lewis carries this film forwards like a splenetic, incensed bull knocking over everything in his way and intimidating the hell out of the other cast. I struggle to think of another actor that could bear this film and all of its subtle character transformations. I also very much enjoyed the presence of Dano as the mislead but wilful priest who is Plainview's main antagonist. <br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson masterfully builds suspense in scene through scene of this film. He makes full use of the incredible surrounding landscape and of DDL's incredible talent for complete intimidation and overpowering presence.<br/><br/>All in all I think this film is undoubtedly an epic of character transformation, of deceit and of no substantial meaning without wanting or needing it.<br/><br/>95%"

Together they go around looking for oil prospects and having a small child helps Plainview buy land cheaply and he goes on to become an oil magnate.<br/><br/>When Day-Lewis is in full flow you will see two veins on his forehead that pump out and display his passion and ruthlessness. However Plainview has demons of his own, in his own words he dislikes other people succeeding and in his new oil field he takes a dislike to Eli the teenage preacher in a god fearing town. Later on he meets a man claiming to be his half brother and this upsets his son who has since become deaf in an accident.<br/><br/>The film strives to be an epic which spans many years but we never understand why Plainview dislikes Eli so much even though Plainview has no time for religion and suspects Eli might be a hypocrite, although his son has taken a shine to Eli's sister who he later marries. At each turn Plainview ignores or embarrasses Eli even when he promised that he would build a church which he does not leading to Eli embarrassing Plainview in a church ceremony.<br/><br/>Although Plainview sent his son away after the accident which made him deaf and later brought him back, its obvious he loves his son but later drives him away and not made clear why.

","Public opinion about this critically acclaimed movie seems rather dividedthere are people writing rave reviews about it, calling it one of the best movies ever and giving it full marksothers call it a vastly overrated movie and rate it 1 or 2 out of 10there are no in-betweens in this caseit is clearly a case of loved it or hated it One could argue then that such a film is the product of a genius mindthose intelligent enough to understand it are completely blown away by itand the others, the ones who fail to see the point ridicule it Having seen it, I tend to side with the latter group of people who found this movie a pseudo-intellectual product lacking any coherent purposeI felt the same about ""No country for old men""many other reviewers have also compared it to NCFOM for the same reasons Okay I understand that whole movie is about the lifelong conflict between two equally ambitious and morally corrupt individualsDaniel's character is one of the most reprehensible I have seen in movieshe swindles innocent people and even uses his small adopted son as a mask to disguise the utter contempt he has for other human beingsI normally am captivated by portrayals of such people, who are fascinating in their own right, but in this case, I did not engage with his characterI could not really feel the menace or evil emanating and the fault is with the script writer, not the actor Most of the movie felt disjointedas if vast portions were cut out and left on the editing flooryou fail to understand the motivations behind the actions of different charactersit is not even possible to fill in with our own interpretations as the characters themselves were not fully developed For example, why does Paul Sunday go behind the backs of his own father and twin brother when he would have gained as much (or more) if he had not betrayed his own family? Though the character of Eli Sunday came across as quite irritating and self-serving from the start, it does not explain Daniel's intense hatred for himand that physical assault on Eli by Daniel was very difficult to digest due to this reasonEli does not seem to possess the natural charisma or business acumen exhibited by Daniel, so why does Daniel regard him as a lifelong threat and rival? Why does the impostor give himself away so readily after having gone through all that trouble, especially when he realizes how dangerous an individual Daniel is? Somehow all these things and many more did not gel in together when I watched the movie On a more positive note, the acting by all the main players was excellentDaniel Day-Lewis has a tremendous screen presence and he makes acting look ridiculously easy, he is that good! Most of the scenes were very well executedthe whole movie has been directed with the easy confidence that comes from a man who knows what he is good atthis is a very ambitious venture – powerfully acted and excellently directedbut somehow the whole product does not go down properly in the endthat's the reason I have mixed feelings about this movie"
"aaron1510","6","1","3","8 February 2011"," A poor idea that is well executed.
","There Will Be Blood is an odd film. So many things about it are extraordinary, but the end product is not. The set piece, the vast landscape of Texas at the turn of the twentieth century is an amazing spectacle, helped by great cinematography. The soundtrack is strange and uncanny, and does greatly add to the atmosphere of the film. It is entirely deserved of its Academy Award. But not much else, from what I can see, is great about this film. It's not a bad film however. I watched this film in February 2011, roughly four years after it came out. When it did come out, it had an uproarious reception with several critics calling it the best movie of that year, even going so far as being deemed as classic. Just a quick look at its Wikipedia article shows the love it has had endowed upon it. This all meant I had very high expectations, and ultimately, it did not even nearly reach them.<br/><br/>Set over a thirty one year period, from 1896 to 1927, There Will Be Blood is a story about one man's lust for money. Daniel Plainview is an ambitious man. He is smart, and he is ruthless. He is self made. He has many associates, but he has no friends. Nor does he want any. His only companion is a son called H.W., but H.W. is more of a selling point to Plainview, who wins people over to his ideas by portraying himself as a family man. He uses this methodology when winning over the town of Little Boston to allow him to drill. He promises riches for the town, but all they get is corruption. A young religious pastor named Eli seems to be the only one willing to stand up for anything, but he too lets his lust and greed get to him.<br/><br/>This film to me, is an example of one with a poor idea that is well executed. The script isn't great. It's very much all over the place, jumping around back and forth but never really landing anywhere. It starts at the start, but never really ends at the end. Not in such a way as No Country for Old Men or A Serious Man, as both of those films leave you thinking very hard about what the film meant. There Will Be Blood doesn't. Another fault I would find with the script, and possibly a more inimical one, was the development of Plainview's character. The movie is practically a biopic of an imagined character, and he is very well portrayed as a greedy, ambitious, angry man. But that is all. The character never learns anything of his mistakes. Which is all fine and well, because some characters never learn, but when you're expected to invest so much in this one, you expect to be able to relate to him some bit. I couldn't, as Plainview had no soul. He has nobody in his life, and he doesn't yearn for anyone. He's not human. <br/><br/>The antidote to Plainview is Eli Sunday, but here is another character that's difficult to love, due to his love of his religion polarized with his own self corruption. Maybe if Plainview didn't need an antidotal character I'd enjoy Eli's character more, but it's sadly not the case.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson masked this poor script very well with above average direction. I cannot fault the direction and cinematography. The costume was wonderful also, I always was a fan of old timey American drab. Daniel Day-Lewis is an extremely good actor and he doesn't let up here, it's just hard to love his character. Which unfortunately is needed in this kind of film.<br/><br/>While I might disagree with him sometimes, the great Roger Ebert truly sums up my feelings on this film in the final paragraph of his review:<br/><br/>""""There Will Be Blood"" is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by ""No Country for Old Men,"" and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But ""There Will Be Blood"" is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp. Which is not a dishonorable thing.""<br/><br/>This movie is by no means bad, but it sought to be greater and more involving than it was."

","This is the first movie at which I laughed at the ending. I thought it was hilarious how the preacher got killed for hardly any reason and then Daniel Day-Lewis looked like he was thinking ""what the hell am I doing?"" <br/><br/>This is actually what happens during the whole movie. It's just random events happening and Daniel Day-Lewis dealing with them in very strange ways. For example when Daniel's son goes deaf he just decides to leave him and later in the movie they get back together as if nothing happened.<br/><br/>I think that this movie is just a product of hype. There is nothing about this movie that can be called a masterpiece. The story is boring and pointless, the characters aren't interesting, the music is dreadful and the acting isn't that good, especially from Paul Dano who I think should have won a Razzie for his terrible performance.

","Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a turn of the century oilman, driven to succeed no matter what the cost.<br/><br/>Let's take Day-Lewis' powerful performance as a given, even if it is a very close relative of his Butcher Bill from Gangs Of New York (a much better film, by the way).<br/><br/>There is an interesting story to be told here, but There Will Be Blood isn't it. The movie rambles, and the story is told very slowly with many asides which appear hardly relevant - it seems early on as if there is going to be a strong oil vs. evangelism plot thread, for instance, but this more or less disappears.<br/><br/>In the end the movie ends up a portrait of a man whose motivations and actions are driven, antisocial, sometimes incomprehensible, and almost always unpleasant. Day-Lewis is always magnetic to watch, but the movie didn't have enough to engage me without something else to offer beside his performance.<br/><br/>Many of the music cues appear intended to alienate to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine in what way they are intended to complement the narrative."
"johnqadamsiii","7","1","3","7 February 2010"," Daniel, the anti-hero
","It is a mistake to label Daniel, the main character of this film, as simply greedy and evil. He is as human as the rest of the characters in the story (who are less developed), but his main flaw is his competitive drive towards others, as well as his disdain for most in general, which he admits to in a candid moment with who we assume to be his brother. It is often directed towards the local religion, and primarily the object of this disdain becomes a local self-appointed prophet/young man named Eli, who, while perhaps considered innocent on the surface, is equally self-serving and passionate with his own visions of success in this small but developing town.<br/><br/>**Spoilers to follow** <br/><br/>Towards the beginning of the film, Daniel ""adopts"" a young boy whose father died in a tragedy during a primitive drill. Though it is later stated in the movie that he kept him 'as a face to help make money' this is not entirely true. It is evident throughout the film, but not at all times, that he sincerely cares for the boy and treats him like his own.<br/><br/>Daniel only slowly grows more viscous, cynical, and distrustful of others towards the end of the film. His paranoia proves accurate when someone posing as his brother comes to work alongside him at the oil site. The turning point is when he finds out about the betrayal and his dark-side takes form in physical reality.<br/><br/>The height of his paranoia and ugliness is revealed some years later as his son, perhaps the only person he has ever loved, sits down with him to inform him he has plans to move to Mexico with his wife and start his own company. Instead of embracing the move, he takes the opportunity to tell him the truth about their father-son relationship, along with every other mean thing he can muster with his imagination. And therein lies the most tragic aspect of the character and the movie. No doubt, he felt abandoned after his son grew older and married and now betrayed by his plans to move and set up a new drilling company. At this point he simply has not much else to live for, despite all the wealth he has accumulated. Sadly, his only trusted friend is his servant. He does take sincere pleasure in bashing, shall we say, the now older preacher, Eli. The end of the film comes and feels sudden and we are left feeling empty.<br/><br/>Daniel is an intelligent, intense character that was reliant only on himself, and at each step of the way he is personally involved in his work (in his unholy quest towards becoming rich). It is not disclosed why he never married or took on female companionship, and we can only venture a guess that it may involve trust or some intimacy issues, or perhaps he just didn't like others enough to allow them to get very close. When he perceives betrayal from those who do become closest with him (his brother - who is the impostor, and his son) he reacts with complete vengeance and no remorse. These two things drive him towards the edge and he becomes not only a drunk but psychopathic. The movie is a portrait of a flawed but not an altogether unlikable man--he did after all take on the boy as his own whom he protected and he stood up for the local young girl his son eventually married who was beaten by her dad for not praying--who finds the true success he seeks but sinks into despair and complete oblivion in the process.<br/><br/>There are perhaps other social implications to this but they are not readily visible. As a result, this is mostly a tragedy, sometimes slow moving at times, about the character Daniel amidst the reality of expansion in the west around the turn of the century leading to the wealth of our now heavily oil-based societies."

","What is the definition of 'masterpiece' films? ""There Will Be Blood"" is definitely a serious saga story based on the real history of the oil digging in the States. If I am asked if this film is thrilling or enjoyable, the answer is no. However, if asked if it is impressive or unforgettable, the answer is yes. Daniel Day-Lewis, who is famous for exhaustive preparations for roles, deserves the Academy Award, but his role this time is full of aggressive acting like shouting, exploding rages or revealing emotions, so it is a little tiring. In addition, some shots are meaninglessly too long and irritating.<br/><br/>This should be a story of a lonesome successful entrepreneur, who had never been able to love somebody or trusted others, rather than a story of human's lust. If you are interested in the history of oil excavation in the States, or if you want to see a heavily serious movie somehow, I would recommend this film, location shooting of which is something (vast desert sceneries).

""I have a competition on me, and I want no one else to succeed."" Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of his best performances, and Paul Thomas Anderson directs without compassion or conscience. He does not attempt to elicit sympathy for anyone, and he gives no excuse for the behavior of Lewis' character. The story simply unfolds. In many ways Paul Dano's character is as evil as Lewis', feigning purity and innocence, when in fact he is greedy himself. The movie was a bit slow, but I found myself so intrigued by the main characters that I was able to overlook the occasional slow parts. And as far as the ending goes, I will say this: with the wills of both the main characters refusing to bend, something had to give. And it was really the only way it could have ended.

He did not believe in God at all, completely realistic, and the desire to success deluges his mind. He deemed God to be superstition, and the priest sanctified God and pretended to be a sacred prophet; though they two look the opposite to each other from the viewpoint of religion or faith, actually they have the same belief in money, success. Jealousy, egoism, vanity, lubricity all these negative characteristics are controlled by self-discipline ; however, the protagonist- Daniel had no intention to manage them, instead, he surrendered himself to his aimless lust and gave in the prospect to love and contentment even though he had some affection to the orphaned boy.

Obviously many will disagree with this out-come as its so very popular, but I've got mixed reactions. Still one to look out for, that claimed to be ""rigged"" in the 2007 Academy Awards."

"Lucabrasisleeps","8","1","3","11 February 2009"," Good movie with a strange ending
","This movie has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time by various critics. Does it deserve all the praise? I don't know. The movie succeeds in creating memorable characters and has great performances but ultimately I felt that the ending ruined the movie somewhat.<br/><br/>I liked the focus on the business deals of the main character Daniel Plainview(Daniel day Lewis). It gave me an insight into the oil business in the early 20th century and the lengths that some people go in order to obtain them profits from the oil business. There is a scene in the movie in which Daniel is ready to be accepted into a Christian denomination which he doesn't believe in and whose leader he hates a lot, in order to obtain the land o build a pipeline. He is ready to be humiliated by the leader Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) if it means that he will get the land. That portrays perfectly the single minded greed of the people who want to cash in on the oil business. There is also the fact that there is not a single prominent female character in the movie. There is no love interest or any sort of female companion to Daniel. He seems like a guy who is too focused on his business that he forgets about the most important things in life. But it is fascinating to watch how he involves people in the small town where he sets up his drilling business even though he is known as a cold man. It is also interesting to note that he avoids any sort of questions regarding his son or the mother of the son. He is portrayed as a man who doesn't confide in anybody and doesn't talk about his inner feelings. The one person who he confides to turns out to be a fake. That hardens him even further thus making his lose faith in humanity.<br/><br/>The positive aspects would mainly concern the performance of Daniel Day Lewis. His intense performance is one of the best I have ever seen since the performance of De Niro in Raging Bull. He portrays a man who is weary of the world and who has a single minded obsession. One of my favourite scenes is the scene in the bar when he says vehemently to a man that he doesn't have the right to tell him how to raise a family. The scene in the church where he is ready to be baptised into the Christian denomination is also a great example where he perfectly portrays the intensity of the moment. Another positive aspect is the music which has a weird creepy feel to it. There are no flamboyant pieces which may distract people from the story, only an intense background score which complements the cynical mood of the movie. The direction is fabulous and the scene where the oil bursts through and some other scenes are nicely done.<br/><br/>The negatives? Well for one, the ending. I felt that the ending was totally out of place in the movie. It didn't really fit it in the intense feel of the movie. It seemed cartoonish and unrealistic. I know many people have praised the scene and the milkshake line has become famous but I wasn't impressed. Also the entertainment factor isn't much. I don't think there is much chance that I would watch it again. Basically it is a bit too slow and maybe too cynical for my liking.<br/><br/>Overall I would give it an 8/10 for the performance of Daniel Day Lewis and the general structure of the movie."
"blackburnj-1","8","1","3","3 January 2009"," Impressive but unsatisfying
","Paul Thomas Anderson's epic about oil and one man's struggle for riches and power has been greeted as a modern classic. Featuring an astonishing performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, numerous memorable sequences, magnificent photography and an incredible, iconic score, one can see that all of the ingredients are there. So, why is it that, having seen the film three times, it still doesn't seem to be a great film? The first viewing was bewildering. It was obvious that this is a hugely impressive film and one which should be seen. Day-Lewis is spectacular as Daniel Plainview and thoroughly deserved his second Oscar. Added to that, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson uses his epic canvas to full effect with stunning visuals. The film is too long, but quite engrossing and always seems to be able to draw out another fantastic sequence to keep your attention. Having said that, it was a somewhat baffling and distant experience.<br/><br/>The word was that this film was a spectacular metaphor for America where the twin forces of religion and capitalism are shown to be in a terrible and destructive conflict. This seemed to be a simplistic and inaccurate interpretation. The problem with it is the central religious character, Eli Sunday, brilliantly played by Paul Dano, is not a decent representation of Christianity (the final scene certainly shows him to be a poor representation). Indeed, any kind of grand message didn't seem to be there.<br/><br/>The second viewing presented an interesting character piece. It was an easier watch and, on a smaller screen, was still impressive. However, the film was still an enigma. It still seemed to have a lot and do little and still appeared to be a somewhat overrated film.<br/><br/>The third viewing did provide the most complete experience. Day-Lewis's Plainview remained a mesmerising presence in the film and the brilliance of Paul Dano's performance had also become more apparent. The thrilling moments (the Derrick fire, Plainview's baptism and the final scene) were still thrilling. However, it still didn't quite work.<br/><br/>Why not? Some of it may well be a matter of taste as I have little complaint with the film and have to admit that it is a really impressive piece of cinema but I still think there are problems with this film. It is very densely packed with themes, sub-plots and events. As such, some things seem superfluous. The relationship between Plainview and the adopted son, H.W., is important but underdeveloped. One never gets a decent look at H.W., whose actions become increasingly inexplicable and who, as a character, gets increasingly distant. As for Plainview, his feelings remain a mystery which is distracting rather than intriguing. This is symptomatic of the film as a whole. Anderson leaves a lot of loose ends and infuriating, unanswered questions.<br/><br/>There is one further problem. The film is, mostly, about the power struggle between the oil man Plainview and the zealot Eli Sunday. Plainview has to win over the town where Sunday rules supreme. Not only does Sunday resent this, but he tries to exploit Plainview's venture, apparently, for his church's benefit. Plainview's pride and greed generates further friction. A lot of the conflict is between the characters but the town of Little Boston caught in the middle of this disappears from view through the film and this seems to be a misstep from Anderson. How is the town affected by the sweeping changes around it? What do the ordinary men and women make of the events around them? Paul Thomas Anderson has never been a conventional or easy director and that shines through in this film. Some have taken to this style but I find it to be unsatisfying. ""There Will Be Blood"" is not a bad film. It is a very impressive piece of work and should be seen. The central performance demands to be seen. The problem is that with all of the elements there it shouldn't be the film it is. It should be a must-see, but it is rather less than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>4 Stars out of 5"

","In Paul Thomas Anderson's newest feature based off the Upton Sinclair novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) show us how the West and hearts of early Americans were really won. Not by the fairy-tale sweat and hard work of honest workers, but with the blood and deceit of those who possessed a hunger that drove them to succeed at any cost; whether it be the lives and land of those around them, or the hopes and faith of people just looking for something to believe in. Part way through the film, Daniel turns to his imposter brother Henry (played by the believably slimy Kevin J O'Connor), and says to him, ""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people."" It is at this moment that we realize we are looking into the eyes not of an American pioneer, but the devil himself, who feeds off oil like blood, and is frighteningly aware of exactly who he is.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a story of the American West, it is a story of the dark underbelly of capitalism, and it is a story of religious fanaticism. All interwoven into a tale about the insatiable oilman Daniel Plainview, and his son HW. Daniel encounters many obstacles to his success: HW's hearing loss, the religious fanaticism of Eli Sunday, the 100 miles of pipeline to the coast he needs to build, and the presence of Henry, the man pretending to be his brother. But through the evil-doing and toe-stepping, we are able to glimpse and remember the beauty of what America was, and still could be through the cinematography of Robert Elswit, who draws us in hypnotically to the energy-filled barren landscapes much like he did in Syriana. <br/><br/>This is a movie that is just as beautiful for its form and imagery, as it is for its clear allegories that ring too true for us as Americans in this infant of a country. Nearly the whole film takes place outside in the plains and hills of the American West at the turn of the century. We see expansive images of the land, all shot with natural light, as most of the film is outside. But what really brings the latitude and beauty of this natural light approach (up until the last scene in the film which is shot in the basement of Plainview's new mansion built from oil money) to the forefront is the opening scene of the film. We see Daniel down in a hole that he has dug as he is mining for precious metals. There is light delicately floating down from above, but for all intensive purposes he is working in the dark. Other than his dark figure chopping away with a pickax, all we see are the sparks flying off the wall from each hit into the earth. They are the sparks of his career, but also the sparks of the fire he is about to ignite on the country. This fire imagery picks up in possible the most beautiful shot of the movie when we see a silhouetted Plainview staring at a geyser of oil that is burning 80 feet high against a backdrop of a classic American sunset. The story is elegantly paced as it covers nearly 30 years in time, but gripping and intense on almost a shot by shot basis due as much to the presently pertinent subject matter as to Day Lewis' fearfully realistic performance. After humble beginnings as a lone silver miner, Daniel eventually makes his way to the oil industry. He makes his way to a town in California 100 miles from the coast called Little Boston. He is sent here by Paul Sunday (also Paul Dano) who is the brother of Eli, who leads a congregation in the town called the The Church of the 3rd Revelation. The dichotomy between these two bothers  one who sells out his family for money, and the other who is a false prophet, spreading the word of God  goes hand in hand with the dichotomy between Daniel and Eli. They counter each other on opposite sides of manipulation and extremism. One side makes no apologies for their pursuit of wealth; and the other makes the ultimate apology for his manipulation by claiming divine right by God. It all comes together in the last scene of the film where there is a confrontation between Daniel and Eli. This is 25 years, some lost faith, and millions of oil dollars later. When Eli comes to Daniel to ask him to buy a lease because he has no money, Daniel humiliates him by forcing him to yell that he is a false prophet and God is a superstition. This is eye for an eye vengeance from earlier in the film when Eli humiliates Daniel in front of his congregation by forcing him to yell that he has abandoned his son. Minutes later when Eli lies dead on the floor and Daniel likes exhausted and says, ""I'm finished"", we realize that they are the same person, and they are both dead. One conquered the West with the blood and manipulated sacrifice of others only to end up in a dystopia sess-pool of his ideals; while the other led countless astray only to end up broken, faith doubting (a line referring to the looks of a fellow parishioner bring up imagery of the modern catholic crisis), and miserably poor enough to come pleading to his arch nemesis. <br/><br/>The film is heavy, but rightfully so, and the relationship between Daniel and HW gives it balance. It is a modern look at the social underbelly that lies so deep in the creation of this country, and can be viewed just as much as an American historical epic, as it can a social and religious allegory of our time."
"mbd111488","4","1","3","12 November 2008"," Not much to like
","Other than DDL's performance, which was excellent, I didn't find much to like about this film. It was downright depressing and lacked any theme that I could tell. (Other than watch out for ruthless oil barons and false prophets). I rented this film because it was from a book by Upton Sinclair whom I remembered from his most famous work, ""The Jungle."" But I didn't like this one. Dano wasn't very compelling as the preacher and the movie didn't explore the reasons behind why Plainview was such a scumbag. Such as for instance flashing back to his childhood to explain how he turned out that way. He briefly mentioned at one point that he generally didn't like people - but there was no explanation as to why."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","1","3","10 November 2008"," It deserves its status as a sure-fire classic to come.
","My opinion of the film has remained consistent since I saw it in the cinema back in February. Despite the somewhat ridiculous context that does put me off often when I think of it, the commanding imagery is so engaging and inspiring that I love it. Even as a big fan of Jesse James I do think it deserved its cinematography win; not above Jesse James but still. I definitely nod Paul Thomas Anderson for his vision. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredibly strong but one note performance of a character, most effectively described as ""angry"". It's an extremely commanding performance, from his hateful rants, his glorified speeches and his painful confessions. The direction does hold on to a lot of moments with Day-Lewis and it's extremely effective, even if it does make the film stretch on with its pacing. Paul Dano gives an underrated performance, yet he completely embodies the role and almost manages to steal the show from Day-Lewis. The end wouldn't have worked as well without him. Thankfully, the screenplay adds comforting black comedy elements when it gets too contrived, almost making a joke of itself and redeeming that flaw just making me feel more engrossed. However, it is a film I struggle to truly feel involved and attached to, mostly because the characters are quite dislikeable. The score is wonderfully entwined with the images with the classical edge making it quite elaborate and almost disturbing of its intentions; however, it's almost unlistenable as a stand alone piece. My personal favourite of the 2007 Best Picture nominees. The film is my third favourite Paul Thomas Anderson film, a director I favour a lot and earns its spot on my top 100. Bravo.<br/><br/>9/10"
"robbie_stanleysmith","7","1","3","4 November 2008"," A film should not be a struggle to enjoy yourself.
","This is one of those films which you either love or you hate, maybe because it pivots around one character, like Taxi Driver. I think both films are overrated. Now i'm quite patient when it comes to films. but the editing made this one of the most infuriatingly slow paced films ever. the score was painful to listen to, very post-modern and dissonant, and although i like to hear something vaguely original as opposed to the fakely over-dramatic music you hear in trailers for commercialised action films (you know what I'm talking about), i felt it did nothing for the film (The Dark Knight, on the other hand, used jarring microtones briefly, right at the start of the film before the bank heist, to raise tension. I felt it was massively overused in There Will Be Blood). It was just noise which everyone was wishing would shut up. even if a film isn't sad or soppy, music is an essential part of cinema to aid the drama. it was such a relief when the Brahms violin concerto was used (i thought it was used to good effect, with a satirical edge to the 'giocoso'/joking style of the piece, especially at the end, reflecting Day-Lewis' state of mind). Anyway, the actual content of the film was essentially uninteresting, every scene was used purely to develop some character relationships and the story was incredibly basic. The cinematography was really nothing special; some wide landscape shots to give an epic effect but no beauty or symbolism. If you want great cinematography, watch Road to Perdition. I came out of the cinema feeling very bored, ripped off and disappointed and thinking this: you cannot make a film just out of one man's acting performance. Yes, Daniel Day-Lewis was great, but where was the drama? Watching a film is not just about assessing someone's acting ability. It has to mean something, to entertain, have an interesting and developed story and be dramatic. The technique of boring people with undeniably overlong shots and scenes and making them wish they'd brought a pair of earmuffs with the music simply does not make a good film in my opinion. Ending on a positive though unnecessary note: Day-Lewis gave a fantastic performance and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. His character was twisted, greedy and inhumane, possibly less shocking but more accessible and believable than his character Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. This film is probably worth seeing if you need confirmation of Day-Lewis' acting skills, but despite the final scene (an improvement on the rest of the film), you will not enjoy watching it. I would give this film a 7, because although I didn't enjoy it at all and thought it was overrated, on reconsideration I understand some of the praise it has received. There's no denying it delivers an important message about greed and human nature."
"johnnyboyz","8","1","3","28 September 2008"," There were Oscars and there will be future viewings.
","To watch There Will Be Blood is to experience There Will Be Blood. Such a film is long, but does not feel like it; such a film is broad in its studies and locales, but never feels like a blockbuster; such a film is highly interesting and demands a lot of attention; but could still be enjoyed even with a sit back and relax attitude. Such a film is There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film and recent Academy Award best picture nominee which is set amongst the vast, dusty hills of California at the turn of the Twentieth Century as it becomes apparent one man's work is about to boom.<br/><br/>I suppose for a film to predominantly centre around the conflict of interests to do with oil, There Will Be Blood's timing is somewhat significant given what's going on in the Middle East but this never veers too far into the realm of politics. Daniel Plainview, played by the Oscar winning Daniel Day-Lewis, is a man seeking territory and oil for his own profit and his methods of attaining the land and the oil is slippery and ruthless  he's the sort of towering professional that was just born to be a businessman. But there are no daft metaphors directed towards political leaders in this portrayal although the manner in which Plainview delivers his speeches about oil and such to the townsfolk, to me, looked like a President or a world leader delivering a speech to its delegates or citizens.<br/><br/>There is nothing really embedded in this film but greatness, and greatness on a grand scale. Similarly to Magnolia of 1999, Anderson has adopted a large canvas on which to decorate his ideas and themes but he has matured as a filmmaker in the sense he does not bite off more than he can chew this time round. If it were worth sitting through the painfully progressive Magnolia just so that I could see There Will Be Blood, then it was worth it. The difference is that Anderson focuses his attention on two to three characters in one setting at a designated point in time which aids the periodic, artistic piece he is trying to create in There Will Be Blood. Needless to say, it works. While Magnolia was all well and good on the surface with the best of intentions (ie; a large scale, 'revolves around nothing', urban drama with interlocking stories), the film fell flat through its lack of conflict and mass-character study.<br/><br/>Anderson tones things down here. He tones things down to the point that there is not one word of dialogue in the opening twenty or so minutes  not even when it is a necessity to warn someone of impending doom as a well support crashes down on top of an individual. In the opening, we get an explosion; the audience jumps; an on screen death and not a title card nor a rousing composed score in sight  this is exciting film-making but not of the blockbuster variety. When someone does speak, it is the man of the hour Daniel himself. The character just drips charisma; the sort of individual who could worm his way into a situation, out of the situation and then back into it if he really wanted to. He is told by a young man about certain owned land not too far away and the oil prospects it garners. Daniel ventures there with a young child he has raised as his own after the unfortunate opening events and the film unfolds from here on in.<br/><br/>At its centre, There Will Be Blood is a continuous conflict between the broad subject that is religion and one man's business ideas and reaping of the Earth of natural sources for his own personal gain; call it greed, call it business. The one individual that stands in Daniel's way is Eli Sunday (Dano), whose brother Paul (also Dano) gave the Plainview's the notion to go to the plot of land in the first place. Eli is a faith healer, a man of religion and acts as the lone person willing to stand up to Daniel. As a concentrated conflict, the two will exchange blows but not in a fighting sense more-so an egotistical one with feuds in smatterings of mud that do not adopt a violent sense as the fight is too one sided anyway. Daniel's dream and overall target flails and stutters in light of this religious presence, very much 'my church versus your oil rig'. Indeed, when one rig or extractor burns, Eli can only watch on as he gains another point amongst the chaos and burning.<br/><br/>The idea that the film at its core is a study of this conflict is emphasised in the final scenes when the two are face to face in a showdown scenario. But leading to this point, the film really works as a stone wall drama. There Will Be Blood is brilliant enough to actually sidestep its primary strand and focus on those around its protagonist, namely Daniel's adopted son H.W. and his antagonism towards Daniel with his deafness and the reason for it preceding this. These scenes work due to the prior hour and a half revolving around Daniel and what a ruthless and somewhat greedy individual he is meaning we cannot help but feel a certain amount towards a now grown up H.W. With stupendous acting and an impressive score as well as wonderful attention to detail, There Will Be Blood is a definite triumph."

But the main problem as I see it is that we are not allowed inside Plainview's mind. He keeps blocking us out. This is obviously intentional but what else are we left with?

I have watched There Will be Blood twice now, and the second time was even better. I now don't see a visually stunning film, I see a complex tale of an oil man whose lust for the black, squelchy stuff corrupted him till be destroyed himself. It is a tale of one man, but is also a tale of religion, ambition, political parallels, lust, greed and lies. It is so unbelievably multi-layered that you forget that you are watching celluloid strips being switched 25 times every second.

Sadly, some people probably still won't get it...oh well that's what makes good taste good...not everyone has it. I found it riveting from the first frame and I don't care if it doesn't follow the Sinclair book exactly- read The Shining sometime- none of what makes the film brilliant is in the book.

He is a greedy man who has his eyes set on one thing only, money. You follow through some years and see him start with a little oil company to being one or the biggest oiling company around.<br/><br/>The movie is directed finely with long beautiful shots executed perfectly by the actors. Daniel even won best actor for this movie in 2007. Daniel take this character by its head and takes it as his own, he controls all the lines and produces them with great tone.<br/><br/>The best thing for me in this movie was the score was fantastic. The music just controlled this movie the most for me, without it i don't think i would have got most of the creepy feelings. The score also reminded me of something from ""Lost.""

","By Bryce VanKooten <br/><br/>I want so much to dive headlong into the story with which I just dedicated a small portion of my weekend to, but despite my deepest desire to fully immerse myself in its layers of cold, hard reality; I feel as though I must explain. Not bluntly regurgitate my circumstances, but explainme. Explain what I felt coming into the movie, if only to allow you to see my shadowed impressions of the end.<br/><br/>Often, to a fairly new viewer like myself, this would be a common bore had it not been for one thing; Daniel Day Lewis. What a pleasure it is to watch a man that is in love with his profession. What a joy it becomes for the audience to relax backwards and never be fooled. Not fooled in the sense of a plot twist or a witty mantra that takes us out of the moment, but fooled by the reality they're watching. As the film opens, we're in a pit, and to be quite simple; we never get out. Surrounded by rough, silent circumstances, its early 1900's and we're digging for much more than oil. Greeted by Daniel Day-Lewis, it's encouraging to find that we're not watching Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting or Hawkeye (easily two of my favorite cinematic characters of all time), but rather, someone new. Someone rooted in evil, splendid nonetheless.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview cares about one and a half things: Pride and whatever it takes to get more of it. In many instances he finds himself replacing that half-ounce of space in his soul and 2 hours and 40 minutes later, he's where he started. It cannot be filled with any other morsel of sanity in so far as it would eat away at his other portion. Plainly speaking, There Must Be Blood.<br/><br/>The movie flows much like it should, whistling and washing its way through the dragged days of the early West. Its era-savvy fashion and slow and steady language enable the viewer to easily enter the world in which Paul Thomas Anderson so blissfully takes you. Coincidentally, There Will Be Blood is not a simple film. Its simplicity can only be found in the presentation. The words, much like cuts, are few and far between, with no words arriving till nearly the 30-minute mark. The long takes seem to walk you through as if you are watching from the standpoint of a character simply off screen. There are no frills, there are no breathtaking effects; its simple, imagined movie making, in its most pleasant form.<br/><br/>Each scene in the saga of Daniel Plainview is precisely placed, leaving no emotion unturned. There are few relationship formed in the movie, mostly because of Plainview's unwillingness to let anyone or anything in. Plainview's pride is overwhelming. Pride is not a theme depicted or an emotion sought after by the screenplay. It is the living breathing force by which the film finds life. Pride finds many competitors during its time on screen; Faith, Hope, Friendship, Family, Freedom and yet each time discovers a path to its destruction. Sometimes slowly, sometimes with the briskness of a bowling pin, it shatters its enemy and finds no joy in the outcome, simply turning its gaze forward, onto the next foe. As the film winds on (and as we find out later), Plainview has enlisted a young boy to be the face of the business. In great need a softer side; Plainview uses his wit to dupe each town into selling him their profits. No scene is more telling than the infamous night of the accident. While everyone is busy doing the chores and tasks at hand, H.W. (Daniel's son) is sitting above the oil well, watching the action below. As the well fills and pressure builds in both the pit as well as the audience nearby, it explodes. Upon impact, H.W. is thrown back, showered with debris lying motionless only feet away. Striking moments of silence bear down as we see Daniel carrying the boy to the shack, away from the wreckage. As Daniel runs, the music scampers along with him in a darkly, menacing dance. When he finally lays the boy down, H.W.'s words, joined with the fire from outside, ring out in the silence, ""Dad, I can't hear my voice."" It is in that moment where we see the real change in Plainview begin to surface. It is in that moment when his choice is made. His pain can only be seen in his hate for any obstacleand his seeming love for his son is soon revealed, when he chooses not to stay with himas a mere façade. As the camera stays on Daniel, we see him walk outside, gaze at the fountain of burning black gold, fall to his kneesand stare. Surrounded not by his friends, nor his family, but by the Prideembodied in black, that he so blissfully embraces.<br/><br/>After many long years Daniel's life wages on, with his Pride still well intact. We see time and time again its ability to save him. Even when honest transparency seems realistic; he is betrayed twice, by liars. Once by the self-proclaimed prophet Eli and once by his lonely self. What once was the man, who found a glimmer of hope in a hate-imposed prayer, now clings strong to means of survival, which he knew best.<br/><br/>I would wish for everyone to be able to sit down and enjoy the film like I did, while also realizing that the film is far from over upon its completion. I've discussed many of my favorite things about the film with many of my favorite people and have still only begun to unwrap all that is inside. Can it really be said that we are so different from Daniel? Surely, there is not a competition in any of us."
"Spaceygirl","8","1","3","18 August 2008"," Terrifyingly good!
","""There Will be Blood"" is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood recently. PT Anderson, who served up such delicious offerings as ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" once again delivers a tour-de-force. The storyline follows US Oilmen in the 1890's, although nothing we saw in ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" in the 80's prepared us for THESE oilmen! In a harsh landscape, people scrabbled to make a living and if you had an iota of business acumen and the penchant to use others for your own gain, you went far. (This is how I understood the storyline!) Daniel Day Lewis is scarily good in the main role, veering between showy salesman and brutal taskmaster, he delivers one of the scariest characters seen on screen recently. Paul Dano, in his preacher role, matches Day-Lewis scene for scene, which is surprising for one so young. I'm inclined to say that Mr Dano was robbed of an Oscar nom. The only detraction is the soundtrack, which is a bit of a distraction with such a good storyline, but thats a minor quibble in what is essentially a modern masterpiece!"
"colonel_green","10","1","3","16 August 2008"," A worthy period piece from Anderson.
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson does another period piece, skipping further back in time then he did with his famous 1997 work ""Boogie Nights"". This time, the destination is the United States in the early years of the 20th century, with a brief epilogue set some time after the Wall Street crash of 1929. The subject is the California oil industry, based (very, very loosely) on Upton Sinclair's famous book ""Oil!"". The character is Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in his second Oscar-winning role.<br/><br/>The story follows Plainview as he pursues his dream of earning enough money to separate himself forever from other people, who he despises as a general rule. He has a son, H.W., who he actually does care for, though at the same time he loves money; one is reminded of one analysis of Shylock that said that the most charitable thing to be said about his attitudes was that if he didn't put his daughter before his ducats, at least the reverse wasn't true. Plainview is given a hot tip by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) about huge amounts of oil in his home town, and hurries to buy up all the neighbouring areas. The major other character is Eli Sunday (also Dano), a would-be evangelical preacher and miracle-worker. If Plainview is brutal capitalism, Sunday is fundamentalist religion (recalling the huckster faith-healers of later decades). As business grows, the conflict between the two grows based on minor acts of spite and conflicting worldviews.<br/><br/>The character of Plainview is the movie, basically. As played by Day-Lewis, in a volcanic performance, he is a mass of contradictions and impulses: he genuinely cares for his son, but at the same time he is driven by greed for money. When his son becomes deafened in an accident, Plainview first cannot stay beside him because of the accident, and later, struggling to deal with it, sends him away to the city. In what I think Plainview regards as Sunday's most offensive act, he forces him to face up to this action and show genuine weakness and desperation to escape the possible wrath of God. Plainview later reenacts this scene at the climax, with the roles reversed, to remarkable effect. Occasionally, he explodes into violence, particularly when family is brought up; as he relates to one character who later falls victim to this violence, he doesn't like people, and at times he seems like he does want to reach out. Ultimately, though, he is a cynical, vengeful, black-hearted old man that Ebenezer Scrooge would be appalled by.<br/><br/>Anderson and his crew meticulously reconstruct the time period, conveying the many dangers faced by the pioneer workers in the early oil industry. More than one many dies a grisly death as a result, and blows sting the audience as sharply as the bolts from Anton Chigurh's airgun.<br/><br/>On another note, this is often called an adaptation of Sinclair's ""Oil!"", but it is not, really. Anderson takes one or two ideas from the novel, perhaps, but among other things, the names are all changed (Plainview and Sunday have been given Meaningful Names in lieu of the more ordinary Ross and Watkins), an the plot is different, focussing on the father character. Most significantly, the moral of the story is completely reversed: the tycoon in Sinclair's novel is a genuinely likable figure who is corrupt and brutal because the system is corrupt and brutal. Anderson remakes this to the story of a sociopath who is rotten because of his own nature, with the system itself apart from him seen much more benignly. There are mentions made of monopolies held by men like John D. Rockefeller, but all the other characters seem reasonable and cower in fear of Plainview. Not that it isn't a good movie, but it seems a strange adaptation that completely changes the meaning of one of the great social commentators of the 20th century.<br/><br/>All in all, I quite quite liked this movie; as a film, I felt it was much more wholistic than the Coens' ""No Country For Old Men"" (though my personal vote for the Oscar would have been ""Atonement"")."
"campbellz","10","1","3","15 August 2008"," Evil has never been so fun.
","If Heath Ledger's joker is the embodiment of demented Sadism, Day-Lewis' Plainview is the image of pure, cold-as-steel malevolence. This film is dripping in black brilliance and is purely contingent on the genius that Day-Lewis provides. And this film is not so much a statement of the times (though the connections are unavoidable) as it is a dark characterization of the human condition. Plainview embarks on a downward trek into moral and spiritual bankruptcy and the barren wasteland of the southwest, juxtaposed with the seething images of nighttime blazes and oceans of oil only add to the brooding sensation running amuck throughout the film. In addition to the flawless cinematography, Jonny Greenwood reinvents what a musical score can be, adding to the emphasis that this film is nothing but bare bones, unbridled sinister symphony. This is Citizen Kane from the bottom floor of Hell and I dare say one of the best lead performances in film history. Definitely one of the very best of the decade."
"derek-eynon","3","1","3","8 August 2008"," Impeccably acted drivel
","It start well enough with Daniel Day-Lewis' character Daniel Plainview staking early claims to oil rights in undeveloped places, whilst extolling family values to the locals, in a curious Cornish accent.<br/><br/>Unravelled , I think is the best way to describe the development of the character through the movie.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I felt strangely cheated, not only is plausibility stretched to breaking point, but we never see any consequences for the character's many misdeeds.<br/><br/>I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that the movie charts the rise and fall of the character in perhaps a similar way to Anderson's Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights. The way up, addictions, hangers on, the way down. Crash.<br/><br/>A very very long vehicle for an incomplete story."
"rhklwk-1","3","1","3","7 August 2008"," Be Honest -- It's a Mess
","Now that the hysteria has died down, it's time to revisit this movie.<br/><br/>First, Daniel Day-Lewis is playing the same role, movie after movie. I couldn't help but think of his performance in Gangs of New York (as Bill Cutting) as I watched this picture. He makes what he does appear so effortless that it is a pleasure to see him on screen, but giving him an Oscar for this picture is not too different from giving John Wayne an Oscar for True Grit.<br/><br/>Second, there is no character development. We don't know why Day-Lewis is in the desert, what started him prospecting, what got him interested in oil, or what happens to him during the years the movie glosses over.<br/><br/>There is no rational explanation for why he turns out the way he does. (Am trying to avoid spoilers.) The movie does not make sense. Sorry to disappoint you . . . .<br/><br/>One good thing: It is not a Coen Brothers film, and lacks the pretense of their films."
"pearl18","3","1","3","2 August 2008"," I Agree With gregeichelberger in San Diego
","I found this film so disappointing after all of the hype. The comments by gregeichelberger actually helped me better understand the plot which often wandered and was slow and boring. The first twenty minutes of the film without a single word spoken are dull. (I actually had attempted this movie on a recent flight but had fallen asleep!) Daniel Day Lewis' fake accent got to me and I could hear his British (irish?) pronunciation breaking through at times on certain words. He was almost like a caricature of someone rather than a real person. The other characters stay vague and underdeveloped. Eli's character was one of the best actually. At least his fervor, no matter how misdirected or fake, came though clearly. Lewis' motivation never does. Does he become rich, and does he care? Would he really have taken in a baby in his difficult and random treks around the west? I doubt that someone as selfish as he would have even considered this, despite the later benefit of having a ""cute face"" with him. I agree that the final scene was so unnecessary and unbelievable. Had it been played as some type of ""dream sequence"" where the viewer is not sure whether it's reality or not, it might have worked. Thumbs down from me. I'm glad that I did not pay for a ticket nor purchase this film."
"basrutten","5","1","3","1 August 2008"," There will be boredom, mostly
","For a while this movie did really great on the IMDb list, which urged me to go and see it. Right now, it seems to be in something of a free fall, and I have to say that I can understand why. ""There will be blood"" gained a lot of hype because of the supposedly phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and that probably hid the fact that this movie is not that special.<br/><br/>Well, to get the obvious points of out the way first: yes, the performance by DDL is indeed very very good. It's powerful, it's menacing, it's occasionally very funny and it procudes 2 or 3 really memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Such a shame that there really is not much of a movie to back up the acting. ""There will be blood"" is a movie that goes more for atmosphere and pretty pictures than for actual content, and that hurts.<br/><br/>The previews present this as an epic struggle between Plainview (Day-lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). This is not true. Instead it's 2.5 hours of watching to an extremely unpleasant, extremely unconscientious, extremely calculating and extremely violent person making short work of everybody that opposes him. There is no struggle here, or real plot. Plainview just disposes (either verbally or physically) of whomever he does not like.<br/><br/>Which could theoretically still have made for an interesting movie, but that's also not the case here. The characters are not developed well (we never find out why Plainview is so nasty or why he dislikes everything but the kitchen sink), the plot moves at a snail's pace and does not really go anywhere, the pictures are admittedly pretty but every shot lasts too long, and the music is pretty bad.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a mostly justified jab at religion/Christianity here: (Christian) religion was and is often abused to gain power and manipulate people. Then again his messenger is a character that abhors religion yet manipulates and schemes even more than the priests. what exactly is Andersen trying to say here? In the end ""There will be Blood"" is mostly art-house fluff I'm afraid: an interesting but poorly delivered message packed in two and a half hours of pretty pictures and annoying music. Day-Lewis's performance, no matter how great, is no way near enough to make up for that."
"jkd15-1","9","1","3","14 July 2008"," Excellent excellent movie.
","My theory about movies is if you don't think any of the actors are acting then chances are its an excellent movie. Well that theory holds up well here.<br/><br/>I think what frustrates some people who watch this movie and I must confess me to, is you get no clear line of whether Daniel is a good guy or a bad guy.<br/><br/>He does things that you like and agree with and then he takes such a vengeful stance on things you wonder. Should he have killed the fake brother or let him stay with him as a confidant? The guy sure seemed to be on his side.<br/><br/>I agreed that the priest needed a good butt-whooping as Daniel gave him. But should he have murdered him in the end or shown mercy? Lets face it the priest was a fake profit and general sleaze-bag but was murder the correct option. Though I do love the final line of the movie. What was it. ""I'm all done here."" <br/><br/>Did he guzzle booze at the movies end in his bowling room? Vodka? That was a gruesome scene. And watching him eat in that final scene with the priest was mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Alcoholism had set in and possibly brain damage. He had the gait that comes along with it.<br/><br/>Well the acting from the whole cast was superb.<br/><br/>Loved the movie.<br/><br/>Now if your looking for a true present day hall of fame actor look no further than Daniel Day Lewis. He is on par with Crowe and Phoenix."
"ibbymack10","10","1","3","14 July 2008"," Real Review
","Now what makes this film so special? why did this movie receive such rave reviews? why did Day Lewis receive an Oscar for this?The answer to these questions are all answered in the movie the only thing you have to do is watch it. When i watch a movie or anyone else watches a movie we have expectations. I had great expectations for this movie because in my eyes as it was released the director Mr Anderson was competing against the Coen brothers and Day lewis was competing against Denzel Washington in American Gangster. So already in the making we had No Country For Old Men vs There will Be blood, Paul Anderson vs Coen brothers and Day Lewis vs Denzel Washington. Now any reader of this post can see this is a huge task. There will be blood prevails in all categories. Now I'm not saying that this movie was directly in competition with these sources but at the time it was released it just so happened that these other movies and actors were around. What Anderson does in this movie was amazing. right from the beginning he creates a suspense which rises as the movie develops. Not for an instance is there a dull moment, but continually the suspense rises and rises to a point where u know that the character Daniel Planinview is going to snap. It is obvious to see that this movie is a character study as well as a movie about oil, greed and religion.<br/><br/>In order to make a great movie the director must NOT lose the interest of the viewer at any point. The opening scenes must create curiosity, suspense, hype and this must not be lost at any point. This is what separated this movie to the other movies released in its time. Anderson keeps that suspense and hype and he keeps it till the end. The ending could have ruined the movie if it was different because the curiosity of the viewer was so high at that point, that only a fitting ending to the rest of the movie could have made it a masterpiece and that is exactly what happens. The ending raises the suspense to an all time high leaving the audience breathless as they leave the theatre. If you don't understand this go watch American gangster and you will see how the opening scene in that movie (light cigar throw on man in oil and pump rounds into mans chest) creates too much hype and suspense for the director to carry on building upon whereas in TWBB the suspense starts well and doesn't stop. Last words, Day lewis has taken acting to a whole new level."
"DP-4","5","1","3","11 July 2008"," Over-Hyped Hero Worship for the Director
","In reading a lot of the comments on this film, people constantly mention how much they loved other films from the director of this movie. Their hero worship of the director has obviously skewed their assessment of this film. The movie was too long, had an annoying musical score and was just OK.<br/><br/>The movie is about a lonely, shrewd, relentless, power-driven man who finds success in oil in the late 1800s to early 1900s. The movie really centers on how greed rots this man to the core and ultimately denigrates his character to a pathetic, sinister state of being. It also explores how folks use money and power to fill certain voids in their life that are meant to be filled with family, friendship and intimate connection with others.<br/><br/>The movie has other characters in it like his son, a young small-town religious zealot and a few others. But clearly the ""oil man"" is the main character.<br/><br/>If you like long, dark movies that leave you wondering, then perhaps you too will think this was a masterpiece. Personally, I found this movie only moderately intriguing. It was well acted, but the directing was just OK as was the script. 6/10 stars at best, and a 4/10 for the musical score since I found it annoying and distracting. I like it when the score draws me into the movie, not when it draws attention to itself that draws me out of it."

","There Will Be Blood, praised by critics and award ceremonies alike, has had major buzz since it was released on the silver screen. I followed the buzz and I've looked longingly at the film, but with trepidation. I've been here before, this ain't my first rodeo, I know films of this ilk. Many times the praise of critic amounts to: much to do about nothing. I've enjoyed some, Brokeback Mountain for instance. Most of the time though films like The Hours, Lost in Translation, and About Schmidt, which were all critically acclaimed, fall flat on this viewer. There Will Be Blood, officially joins the ranks of those unremarkable films.<br/><br/>The film has some high points. The acting is superb, the characters are interesting if a little schizophrenic. The premise of the movie is sound and I enjoyed the cinematography and overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film falls into the genre of film that I am not easily impressed, the character study. Morality and greed are surely the topics of conversation in this picture. But, as with most character studies, the film devotes to much time to fleshing out the characters than furthering a coherent and meaningful plot. I'm not asking for back story to explain motivation, but I never got the feeling of any sort of direction in this film. Many events unfold made by the main character that seem to come from left field because you can never really understand what he is thinking or what type of person he truly is. This sentiment is shared with several characters in the film. I know that the complexities of human emotions cannot always be pegged into simple good or bad, but nonetheless the plot feels lacking. And the ending only exacerbates these feelings of schizophrenia and misdirection.<br/><br/>It isn't a terrible film, but definitely not of the caliber as other films in IMDBs top 250. I can only hope time will lower this bloated score."

","I was quite affected by ""There Will Be Blood."" Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the best actors of all time and his performance is absolutely revelatory. The fact that he can get audiences to both root for and revile Daniel Plainview is quite a feat. Day-Lewis doesn't play himself playing a character, he just IS his character. Not once do you ""catch"" him acting. This is the mark of a truly great actor. The thing I love about ""There Will Be Blood"" is that it seems quite simple on the surface, but underneath it is emotionally and morally complex. The film shows the pursuit of the American dream and the hardships that go along with it. We are meant to think that Daniel Plainview is a money-grubbing bastard, and he is, but he got that way because he's worked his whole life to become that way, and he's worked hard at the cost of sacrificing his sanity and whatever morals he may have once possessed. <br/><br/>While ""There Will Be Blood"" is a bit slower-moving than many of the other Best Picture nominees, it was quietly riveting. I was drawn into the story, and there were several moments I had tears in my eyes. The cinematography was lovely and Johnny Greenwood's score was just moving enough to add a bit of emotional punch. In my eyes, ""There Will Be Blood"" is going to become a modern masterpiece, and perhaps one of the most important films of our time.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a tried and true masterpiece.<br/><br/>Simply put: the Best Picture of 2007."

","OK, lets get this out of the way. I liked There Will Be Blood. It has a solid cast, great setting and great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, but is he ever anything other than great? So yeah, the first third is quite astonishing. But then it drops from astonishing to a slow simmer, and finally to a ""well time to get my jacket, I think this one is almost over."" There Will Be Blood is striking at times, old-fashioned at others. But for much of the film, i believe it is also a bit one note. Also, PT Anderson and DP Robert Elswitt need a better focus puller, either that or this digital projection i saw is out of calibration, it just seemed like there was a lot of missed focus.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a lot like The Godfather Part 2. For some people, that is all they need to hear. For some reason, many people think Godfather 2 is vastly superior to the original. I am not in that group of people. How can you possible think Godfather 2 is better than part 1? I mean really now? Back to my point...<br/><br/>So Godfather 2 is about the corruption of Michael Corleone. The film begins, and it isn't too long before we notice Michael is quite shrewd, in fact, he is corrupt. Save for the wonderful flashbacks, mostly of De NIro and Bruno Kirby, we watch for 3 hours on how corrupt Michael Corleone is, until the final image and find we are either bored to tears thinking ""Ok I get it, he is corrupt."" Or as some others think ""Oh my this is a profound study of corruption and power! What a masterpiece!""<br/><br/>Riiiiiight.<br/><br/>Well the same applies here in There Will Be Blood. The film begins and we are shown a hard- working business man and then all too quickly we find, he is not just hard working, he is greedy. For nearly three hours we see greed in one form or another. In the final scene we lean back and think one of two things. ""Ok I get it, he was greedy."" Or, as many critics or viewers may think, ""My god what a wonderful study on the depths of human greed!""<br/><br/>Riiiiiight.<br/><br/>Well much like Godfather 2 or Natural Born Killers, after a few minutes we get the point and then for another three hours, it just goes in circles until somebody is beat to a pulp and the credits roll.<br/><br/>Call that whatever you like, but brilliant isn't it.<br/><br/>I'm finished."

","What a disturbing, yet brilliant film! This story is certainly a bit overwhelming, and definitely not for the faint of heart! <br/><br/>There's one central theme that runs through the Daniel Day Lewis character's life: financial success at any cost! He wrecks every human relationship in his adult life. He destroys his health! He suppresses his sexuality. It's obvious he's a homosexual, he shows zero interest in women, but he can't let any intimate relationship get in the way of success! He rejects his only son over something so trivial it would be laughable under different circumstances. He admits he's full of hate but does nothing to rid himself of such feelings. He even rejects God and all religion - because he believes in nothing but himself, which in this case is recipe for disaster! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, he's a perfect example of the Protestant Work Ethic. He works hard, very hard. He has the single-minded determination to become successful. He's intelligent and knows how to manage people. He's well spoken and very clever. He successfully manipulates both church and the local community to do his bidding. But in the process he damages the natural environment in orders to make his wealth. He steals from others because he can get away with it. He uses an innocent child to gain leverage with those around him. Literally anything goes in order to be a financial success.<br/><br/>False religion is the other side of this story's coin. Again the Protestant Work ethic is portrayed as doing whatever it takes in order to succeed . This time it's a preacher who has his eye on the big time. He too knows how to manipulate people to get the wealth and power he wants. While he does not kill anyone like the self-made business man does, and certainly does not deserves his fate, all God means to him is a way of making great wealth. In the end, when that wealth fails him, he admits for the very first time what a foul human being he truly is!<br/><br/>This is a very dark cautionary tale about the destructive power of greed and believing that the ""ends justify the means!"" What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become corrupt. These two men did not have to become evil in the end! They could have used their success to the benefit of others - something they apparently never learned how to do! But all they cared about was themselves, which, in the end, led to their mutual destruction!"

","Easily the best film of 2007 - This film was flawless in every way.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime. He created a character inside and out.<br/><br/>No detail was spared.<br/><br/>P.T. Anderson showed mature restraint and crystal clear vision.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis was so good, he was almost too good, and tended to overshadow everyone else on screen.<br/><br/>It may have been a bit long, but it could have been no other way. Any shorter and the whole would've been compromised.<br/><br/>The music was staggeringly powerful.<br/><br/>15 minutes of silence... Brilliant! More film makers should take such risks.<br/><br/>Pure storytelling at its finest."
"fflatch","Null","2","12","30 December 2007"," PT Anderson proves himself.
","I am a huge PT Anderson fan. I love ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love."" And though many people hate it, I think ""Magnolia"" is one of the best films from the 90's. I've been looking forward to this movie more than anything film has ever thrown at me. I was expecting possibly one of the greatest films of all-time. And maybe even a new favorite film. Needless to say, I was hyping ""There Will Be Blood"" up so much for myself, I was starting to fear it was too much.<br/><br/>But no. As Anderson almost completely departs from the style of his last movies, he has created one of the best films ever made. Easily one of the greatest films in the past couple decades. I would go as far as to say maybe even the greatest American film ever...If not, one of. The last 15 minutes is some of the most intriguing, amazing acting I have ever seen. And also, one of the greatest endings to any film, ever. (And it reminded me of Kubrick, especially the last line.) Some say the ending is sudden, like in ""No Country For Old Men""(probably the second best film of 2007), but each have certain subtleties that hint at the film not ending in your typical Hollywood way. Thats what makes it so brilliant...And thats also one of the things that made some of Kubricks films so amazing. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since the minute I walked out of the theater. I want to watch it again and again and again.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best on-screen performance I have probably ever seen. His constant spiral to insanity seems so real, that I forgot I was watching an actor act. Not to mention, his subtle, and perhaps unintentional humor throughout the film gave it breathing room from the viewer seeing the character going insane. If he doesn't get an Oscar, it will be the biggest tragedy the Academy has ever let happen. Paul Dano, at the same time, gives an excellent performance, and proves that he has more potential than any other great up-and-coming actor working today. He too, deserves the Oscar.<br/><br/>Jonny Greenwoods score was haunting and put an emotion in me I cannot describe. It was very reminiscent of Kubrick. And on that topic, I feel this is be the ""Kubrick film"" of our time. I don't necessarily like saying it was an homage to Kubrick, because I think Anderson is much more original than say, Tarantino, but the parallels to ""2001"" cannot be ignored. From the first 20 minutes having no dialog, to the score, to the character-driven insanity it makes you feel, to the ""sudden"" explosive last scene with the great last line. I have heard Anderson did that on purpose, but I'm not sure if thats true or not. Either way, despite the parallels, it is wholly original.<br/><br/>I have no doubt many people will hate this film, but I for one, absolutely loved it. Every scene, every frame, every word. Because of this one epic film, PT Anderson has proved himself to be one of the greatest film directors of all-time. If I could give it 11 out of 10, I would."

","There Will Be Blood is the first movie that I leave behind a user comment. A movie this powerful is completely worth sharing to others and urging them to watch it. It is hard to compete with the Coen brother's masterpiece ""No Country for Old Men"", but this movie, without a doubt, is as incredible as this film, or even more. Much accolade has been given to Daniel Day Lewis's awesome performance, but the movie is in, all respects, a cinematic achievement. I was very skeptical that this movie was compared to Citizen Kane, but the character of Daniel Plainview made the comparison to Orson Welles's Kane more than appropriate. There Will Be Blood was a film that consumed the viewer. Above all, this film captured the emotional baggage of hatred. You feel consumed watching the development of Daniel Plainview's character. You see both the change in his demeanor but, more striking, his physical appearance. I told my friends who came to watch the sneak preview of this film that it felt theatrical but not in a bad way whatsoever. The experience of theatre is emotionally penetrating. Thus, to capture this element of theatrics in a non-live film is absolutely amazing. I have no other things to add that others have already said about the film. But you will regret if you hold out on watching this film. Truly an epic film."
"someokiedude","10","1","4","17 March 2020"," A masterpiece? Yes! Definitely! Absolutely!
","Whoever thought that a film that's basically about a squabble between a ruthless businessman and a charlatan pastor could ever be so complex and fascinating, yet somehow Paul Thomas Anderson managed to do it with this epic, and it is a film that certainly earns the title. If there ever was the 'Great American Film,' as there is the 'Great American Novel, this film would earn the epithet as well. There Will Be Blood is not simply a mere title, but a promise and your patience will be rewarded.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is an oilman, most likely the best in the business. He's a man of relentless contradictions. He's ruthless, determined to succeed no matter the cost, and driven in his journey to his goal. But he also has glimmers of compassion, he's a father who, despite shamelessly using his son to further his own interests, does genuinely love him, and there are glimpses of Daniel that show that there could be a good man within him. But most of those moments are quashed by the power hungry, egotistical man that he is. He rises and falls throughout the run time of the film, and by the end, he has both triumphed over his hated enemy and has been defeated, having alienated the only person that ever mattered to him and being left a sad, lonely, and bitter old man.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Daniel Day-Lewis gives his most accomplished performance as the ruthless oilman, but don't overlook the rest of the cast. Paul Dano certainly gives one of his finest performances as the slitherly priest Eli Sunday, most likely a nod to the former baseball player turned evangelist Billy Sunday, his character is proven to be no better than Daniel, a false prophet feeding off the adoration of his flock. Every time that he is on screen, you feel the urge to strangle him much like Daniel does. Daniel most likely hates him so because of the aspects of himself that he sees in Eli and, deep down, probably hates about himself as well. Jonny Greenwood, also known as the guitarist for the band Radiohead, gives one of the finest scores that have ever been put to film, and would later collaborate with Anderson on his later films such as The Master, Inherent Vice, and Phantom Thread (still haven't seen Inherent Vice). Many had also praised the cinematography, and while I agree that the film looks great, I would say that Roger Deakins had him beat with concurrent films at the time like No Country For Old Men or The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford.<br/><br/>Few films border on perfection, and There Will Be Blood comes close, though there are certain aspects that I still question. The child acting does seem stilted, though there are still moments that showcase the compassion that Daniel is capable of that are still strong, and the relationship between 'Henry' and Daniel does seem rushed, but with those little issues I can stack on them with dozens of other praises. The film, at the end of the day, leaves you feeling as Daniel does: alone and hollow.<br/><br/>Watching There Will Be Blood is almost like reading Lolita, it's shocking, vile, and utterly depraved, but also beautiful, irresistible, and rejuvenating. Few words can justify the tour de force that this film is."

","Wow. Just wow.<br/><br/>I've had that Anton Ego moment before when a film closes and I am just blown away by how amazing the film was, but I'm not sure I ever have been as much as I was when this film ended. I was transfixed to the screen and by the end of it I was reminded why I review films in the first place and why I love filmmaking!<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS THE THIRD REVELATION!<br/><br/>I am so speechless that I don't even know what to say. The acting, dear Neptune, the acting! Daniel Day-Lewis has provided us with not only one of if not the best performances of all time, but also one of the most thoroughly entertaining and memorable characters ever to be put on film, Daniel Plainview. An insane, but charismatic sociopath filled to the brim with determination and hatred, just so complex and interesting. Paul Dano was absolutely fantastic as well. This film was a period piece, but it also is one of the deepest and most interesting character studies I've ever seen! The score for this film is intense and epic. The cinematography is emasculate. The writing and directing are insanely perfect. Every single scene is interesting, entertaining, and just perfect.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute genius. He is a masterful writer and director. He crafts his films meticulously in a way that no one else could. He's become one of my favorite directors, and the way he writes his scripts and his dialogue is just so precise, energetic, and perfect. The ending of the film, wow. It might be one of my favorite endings to a film ever. I love No Country for Old Men (2007), but I think this should've won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Picture. This film has rocked me to my core.<br/><br/>Thank you, Paul Thomas Anderson, for gifting us with one of the most breathtaking masterpieces of all time. I need to let this film sit for a while, but this could now potentially be in my top 5 favorite films of all time."
"tonypeacock-1","6","1","4","27 April 2019"," Excellent casting raise the bar of this film
","I watched this film expecting some masterpiece by what I had read however I was left distinctly underwhelmed.<br/><br/>It is basically set in the early twentieth century as the vast land of the United States is mined for oil.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, a Cliff Barnes (Dallas, RIP) like character who is the big positive of this film.<br/><br/>He is a ruthless character. A capitalist who senses a quick few bucks and will do anything to achieve his aims it seems.<br/><br/>Day Lewis characterisation of Plainview reminded me of his performance as Bill The Butcher in Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>His ruthless streak is shown when he abandons his young son, HW.
He displays all the business skills of Donald Trump in promising ranch owners a future of paradise if they sell their oil fertile land to him to plunder for oil.<br/><br/>One such landowner is Abel Sunday who has two identical twin sons Paul and Eli Sunday both played by Paul Dano who I saw in the excellent 2014 biopic of Brian Wilson, Love & Mercy.<br/><br/>Eli is a self-proclaimed preacher/faith healer. The tension between Eli and Plainview explodes in several scenes throughout the film. Scenes that are tense and at times violent.<br/><br/>The performance of the cast are what raises the bar of this film. Director Paul Thomas Anderson can be praised for delivering excellent scenes between them.<br/><br/>However be warned. The film is quite lengthy and bleak."
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","10","1","4","28 October 2014"," I love Paul Thomas Anderson.
","I'm still in awe of this film. Just as The Master was a thoroughly involving character piece with a sado-masochistic drive, so too is There Will Be Blood, but with a stronger, more apparent narrative-drive that burns us up with more velocity, that leaves us immediately knowing we've been hit. Perhaps that's why people preferred this to The Master. That isn't to say this is less-subtle though. This is Anderson being Kubrickian in his cinematic ventures, letting the film unfold meticulously whilst planting seeds in your mind - seeds that don't grow with the film feeding them, but with you puzzling over them. <br/><br/>The sado-masochism affects the characters as much as it does the viewer. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) And Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) both voraciously feed and rely on substances that are easily exploitative yet are limited in their availability: Oil, yes, and the pain and gullibility of people who are waiting to answer to leaders like Plainview and Sunday. So their sadistic drive that allows them to take advantage of people is counter-balanced by the masochism of not being able to fulfil their greed and ambition, and we the audience who witness this epic narrative are delightfully tortured by the malice we witness, yet we begin to thrive on the destruction of the two characters, at least to a perceptible degree, because it is too fascinating not to.<br/><br/>And all these themes and ideas are explored subtly within the two-and- a-half-plus hours that I'm merely scratching the surface. I've presented the broad, vague ideas, but to crack them open would be like to endlessly try to reach the smallest Russian Doll; I don't think I could ever achieve some completely final and conclusive state of mind in regards to this film, I could never be satisfied and put it aside. And that in itself is satisfying. <br/><br/>The opening sequence is a master-stroke in establishing character and setting. Before we even get the opening title-card, the score (written and composed absolutely beautifully by Jonny Greenwood, of Radiohead fame) begins to rattle portentously until we are engulfed by an ominous drone. The location, a vast empty desert, is void of any life, except for Daniel Plainview, who laboriously mines away underground. It is just him and us. <br/><br/>And then he finds what he was looking for: Silver. Before he can gather his tools and his treasure and safely leave, he falls back down the mine on attempting to climb it. The narrative has already cornered itself in the first 10 minutes, but rather than a simply deus-ex-machina, we get an extraordinary feat of character in which Plainview drags himself the many miles (we're never quite sure how many, it's some unthinkable distance) back to town, with the silver safely in pocket. This has surely won the audience's admiration, for at this point in knowing almost nothing about this character, we want to know what drives him. Oh, how we'll regret this.<br/><br/>Still the film offers no dialogue, as we now see Plainview and a drilling crew who happen upon a mighty gush of Oil. An ominous drone, a worker's death and an adopted son later, and Plainview has begun his violent downward trajectory. The opening has been compared to The Dawn of Man prologue in 2001, and this would be quite accurate. Both offer glimpses into the beginnings of a drastic evolution; the bone wielded by the apes which subsequently allows them to assert enough power to become Mankind and dominate the natural world is like Plainview's piece of silver which allows all else to proceed. The Oil Derricks stand like mighty monoliths, always urging Plainview further into his descent.<br/><br/>One of the only times Daniel Plainview smiles is upon discovering his wealth of oil. His character is the antithesis of friendly; he offers no personal insight into his life, and whenever conversation heads in this direction, he sharply reprimands the other person. The adopted son H.W (Dillon Freasier) is used to create a welcoming faÃ§ade for this oil business, and Plainview is thus a 'family man'. He scuttles when he walks, like some twisted creature risen from the sea, and he is always brash and breathy, like he's impatiently waiting to move on to the next machination of his business. He doesn't even try to be subtle in his manipulations, rather he relies on rather domineering tactics, and he is never less than frightening and repulsive. <br/><br/>So how does Paul Dano hold himself alongside Daniel Day-Lewis? Magnificently. People seem to approach his performance with a scepticism almost in the same manner Adam Sandler received in Punch- Drunk Love. Dano is of course the better actor, but PTA uses his features and general demeanour to the advantage of the film as he did with Sandler. His benign and jelly-like face, with his young, weedy frame merge with the brash petulance of his character, a boy becoming a man who begins to domineer much in the way Plainview does. Except Eli Sunday is too naive, and in the final moments of the film I couldn't help but feel sympathetic. A life-long hatred is borne between the two characters that drives them as much as anything else, and I wonder if it was Sunday's ignorant competitiveness that caused his downfall. The (brilliant) poster suggests a conflict, or a marriage of religion and capitalism, and in the end we realise the two pursuits of these characters could have mutually benefited each other. <br/><br/>A friend described each frame of this film as like an oil painting, and that is entirely true. The cinematography captures the emptiness of the desert and these people's lives, and shows how PTA has eschewed the more lively style of his earlier work for something slower and (even more) precise."
"nickcyborggushue","10","1","4","15 October 2014"," A Masterpiece of Filmmaking
","Paul Thomas Andersen is one of the best directors currently in the business today. There Will Be Blood is his masterpiece. It follows Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector, though his experience with the oil business. The story is fantastic and quite disturbing at times. The acting in There Will Be Blood is superb as well. Paul Dano turns in a solid performance as Eli Sunday and his twin brother Paul, but the real star here is Daniel Day-Lewis's disturbing performance as Daniel Plainview. This movie is the best case as to why Daniel Day- Lewis is the best actor currently alive today. His performance is unbelievably lifelike. It is easy to forget that Daniel Plainview is not a real person. Day-Lewis manages to nail the complexities of the character, and it is safe to say that his performance makes this movie. Paul Thomas Andersen also deserves credit here as every shot in this movie is masterfully done. No other director could have done better than Andersen. There Will Be Blood is a haunting, complex, and disturbing movie that is often hailed as the greatest movie of the last decade, and there is a reason why. It is a stunning and though provoking movie that everyone should see."

","This is one of those movies that I really love, but can understand why some don't. It's slow, major things don't really happen all that much, and everything revolves around Daniel Day-Lewis. But god damn it, everything should revolve around him! The man is a genius! Truly brilliant from him. Everything is well-thought and executed. Every move, every tone of his voice. And the screenplay is worth mentioning, because rarely has there been a film that more perfectly watches a man lose his mind so effortlessly, so smoothly. The only thing I can think of, that compares, is Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>The score is, to me, perfect and I really enjoy the cinematography of the movie. It is beautiful. Paul Dano is unrighteously bashed for TWBB, even though he gave a stellar performance. I find it outrageous.<br/><br/>This is my #1 movie of all time.

","A strong story indeed this movie has. And it's also developed nicely. Focused about the oil business, the movie depicts just what a sly businessman would do to get his way. Yet in getting his way, and even after getting it, Daniel's dominant character of anger and easily offended get the best out of him all the time. This is not excluding persons dearest and closest to him. Unfortunately the 'all is fair' attitude is also shown by people he comes in contact with, including the townspeople stuck in blind faith and also especially the town's false prophet. I like Daniel Day Lewis's performance. He can really create a great distinction between all his roles. This shows that he is quite a master in the art of getting into character. Seeing Paul Dano giving the right balancing performance is also a great here. It's an entertainment good enough for men for a 7 out 10 score."
"matic-boh1","6","1","4","25 July 2014"," Daniel Day-Lewis shines in an otherwise unexceptional period drama
","It is mainly the ferocious and commanding performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that gives value to a film where themes of family, religion and greed intertwine in portraying the merciless nature of the turn of the century oil business. There Will Be Blood proves to be a fairly intriguing film and one that explores very complex ideas, with Day-Lewis's despicable and malicious character personifying the principle of the story, as he is propelled by an untamable and maddening thirst for wealth. However, despite having a very solid and captivating opening phase, the film then loses its strong momentum and later begins to feel rather empty and flat, with only Day-Lewis's impressive acting skills ultimately capturing one's attention and carrying the story forward. Although it cannot be argued that the cinematic visuals presented by director Paul Thomas Anderson are striking and that the film's soundtrack proves powerful, the narrative of There Will Be Blood seems fractured and is unimpressive, resulting in a film which is worth viewing for Daniel Day-Lewis's towering performance, but sadly not much else."
"BeMi21","10","1","4","19 June 2014"," Paul Thomas Anderson's Masterpiece
","Not everyone will like There Will Be Blood. Some will describe it as a boring movie without much story. I don't know if I'd say that there really is a story behind There Will Be Blood. I'd rather describe it as one of the most gripping, interesting portrayals I've ever seen. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a character study. It shows us a man full of greed and disgust for humanity. A hypocrite who pretends to care for other human beings but who, in fact, just drills for oil to enrich himself.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson wrote a magnificent screenplay and his direction is perfect. Jonny Greenwood's score contributes a lot to keep a dark atmosphere throughout the whole movie and the cinematography is breathtaking.<br/><br/>But what shines out the most in this amazing movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' astonishing portrayal of Daniel Plainview. I've seen some of the greatest male performances ever. De Niro in Raging Bull, Brando in On the Waterfront or A Streetcar Named Desire, Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. But if I had to pick the best performance of all time I'd pick Day- Lewis in There Will Be Blood. This isn't just a performance. It's an absolutely versatile transformation. Everyone who has seen Daniel Day-Lewis in another movie knows that he always transforms himself into his characters. But his Daniel Plainview is on another level. Its a character with many facets and its sometimes impossible to see through him or to know what's really going on in his mind.<br/><br/>The performance could have easily lead to nothing else than annoying overacting. But Daniel Day-Lewis knows when he has to scream and he knows when he has to be subtle. His manipulative voice is creepy and his staring, menacing look can be somehow ominous.<br/><br/>But we will learn that this is not a man without emotions although he doesn't want to admit that. Even if he isn't always the best father, he cares for his son. He wants to hide that, he doesn't want to confess to his feelings, but they exist.<br/><br/>It would be easy to fade next to this multi-faceted performance, but Paul Dano is a worthy opponent. He plays the religious Eli Sunday who seems to be the only one who questions Plainview's intentions what leads into a dangerous power game.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's shows us hauntingly to what greed can lead and which values some people abandon in order to be powerful and rich. This is one of the best movies of the 21st century and one of only few movies of this century which can call themselves a masterpiece."

The movie goes on and on and does at no point build up a climax. Secondly, it is indeed a dark and negative movie - which doesn't automatically make it bad, but in ""Blood"", there was just no compelling driver for the evil, no fight between good and bad. The movie lacked any sort of passion. Yes, I believe the acting by DDL was very good and yes, the visuals and camera were equally excellent.

Unfortunately, it's short of a masterpiece because of one element, and one alone: the writing. Paul Thomas Anderson is not alien to this problem. His idiosyncratic writing is what makes people, either love him or hate him. PTA tends to write high melodramas, rich on character but a bit too self- explanatory and forceful (like the other ""T""), as if he were writing the dialog thinking about how great it will sound in the TV ads. It does. <br/><br/>It's never realistic, but realism in film is always a tricky concept: a movie not being realistic doesn't make it bad per Se, but it doesn't necessarily make it great either. So here we are at what is undeniably Paul Thomas Anderson's greatest film thus far: he shows in the writing, up to a point, an incredible use of restraint, reigning in his tendencies to write modern Greek tragedy. <br/><br/>He has something in that relationship between the boy and Plainview; no surprises that this is the focus of the novel, since it's an element that feels like it belongs the most in this story. The airplane begins to experience turbulence around act two, where Plainview doesn't interact with any other characters verbally, except for his family member. He goes on extended soliloquies, including of course, the one about how much he doesn't like people. O'Connor's character stays silent and out of our perceptions completely until his untimely demise.<br/><br/>This protracted segment is well-played like the rest of the film, but fails to provide any insight into Plainview the man. He might as well be talking to himself. The natural ending to this segment reveals a diary which gives us a brief glimpse in to the ""Why"" for such a human monster. A movie about one-person's complex experience seen through their eyes alone is flop-sided. No one in Plainview's world is even afforded a personality. Such lack of emphasis on interaction, and such overemphasis on monologues make him a character in serious danger of becoming one-dimensional, a fate which Daniel Day-Lewis' talent prevents. The approach of Upton Sinclair's novel was to use the boy as naturally, a source of humanity for Plainview. The film almost gets there, but the boy of ""There Will Be Blood"" seems more like an element Anderson treats like a consolation prize to those critics who may call the Plainview character TOO enigmatic, and therefore a tad unbelievable (note the fact that he's carted out halfway in the film, as if, like Plainview, Anderson's use for him has run out). <br/><br/>The second mistake happens at about the same point: Anderson's use of the Boy Priest as a foil, and mirror image, to Plainview. Only until the end was I even sure of the Priest's intentions. Up until that point I didn't read the kind of craven greed that Anderson supposes the priest has. The exorcism scene purports that any holy man during the Great Revival was not simply a practicing charlatan, but one as knowingly deceitful as Plainview. Unfortunately, we are NOT provided with any the level exposition necessary to discern the Priest's character, making his function obsolete. Why is the religion parable even there? Just because Anderson was raised a Catholic and feels bitter about its hypocrisy? Does that mean it has to work in to every story of his?<br/><br/>Another personal element PTA sweeps under the rug in favor of the religion plot is the relationship between Plainview and H.W. I felt the resolution was fine enough. Though some of the lines bordered on self-parody, again Day-Lewis saved the day by being so amazingly gifted. I feel this is certainly where the movie should have ended. A non-conclusive series of shots showing Plainview wandering through his mansion alone would have served the story of a greedy oil man quite well. Not in America, however. Even our greatest directors, perhaps because of being raised on manufactured stories, find existential endings unsatisfying. They struggle to end a movie at all; look at Spike Lee, for example.<br/><br/>Anderson has been also plagued by the ""Curse of the Ending"". Why a penis? Why drinks? For that matter, why frogs? Because it's hip and garish. Because it provides college students with something to chat about back at the dorm, and recall again when high. We are served to an ending that is so uncharacteristic that it does not serve the movie at all. Losing his previous restraint, Anderson allows his movie to end with a selfish, buffoonish piece of writing that almost causes the entire thing to implode, nearly reducing his master stroke to a T-shirt slogan. What is ultimately missing from this movie is a sense of full rounded purpose: of events, of Plainview's existence. A frustrating truth is that the boy was a potential key lost in favor of an undeveloped religion plot. Is Plainview a force that wrecks like a ship at the end? And is that disaster, one that has been mocked to death, a great one or merely...a disaster. Did Anderson give up? Was he unsure of how to end a life as complex as Plainview's? I think Welles had something with that sled."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","4","24 May 2008"," Can there be development and survival without vampires?
","The film has well earned its prizes, awards and other distinctions. But beyond these labels on the sleeve of the DVD or the poster of the film, the film will remain a milestone in the cinema that tries to show the real world and the ruthlessness of its survival instinct.<br/><br/>The first element I will point out is that it gives the lie to Hubbard and his survival in scientology. In the real world there is no survival without development and development is first: no development then extinction. Ask Neanderthals when he was to share Europe with Cro-Magnon. The poor Neanderthals could not even fish and ran like mammoths. The real survival is in the power of man, as a species and as an individual, to develop. Survival that does not bring and presuppose development is just a fake, a false prophecy. I say that for two reasons.<br/><br/>The first reason is that without the oil industry, there would have been no car industry (and other inner combustion engine industry), no gas station networks, no highway networks, no suburban development. That's the most clear and brutal side of the film. The oil industry brings a new phase in the industrial revolution of its own on which we are still living and polluting. Millions of people got jobs, millions of people got income, millions of people got a present and a future. Survival in development. But this development is also violent and it is the fitter who can develop most and fastest. So on the starting line there might be many people but on the arrival line there will only be a few if not only one. It is easier to make a camel get through the eye of a needle than to bring many winners on the winning line of industrial competition.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely ugly and gruesome about it and it makes so many people, in the film, completely sick and disturbed. A man is ready to assume the identity of another provided this new identity is that of the main character's brother for an obvious profit. Don't forget that prophet and profit are homonyms. A child is ready to set the hut in which he is sleeping with his father and fake uncle ablaze just to mark his territory and his resistance and his dissatisfaction. And there are so many other cases.<br/><br/>Then, my second reason, in any fast developing situation like this one there are some people who will take advantage of it to mentally control the change, that is to say to gather people behind them and then pressurize the industrialists so that the gurus can get what they want, which is worldly power and money. These are the second type of false prophets of the industrial age. They can be religious and affiliated to any church, most of them being purely opportunistic about the rich provided they give money to the various churches, temples, synagogues or mosques, and of course other good benefacting (I mean bringing a profit to the prophet) organizations. The religious organizations and their prophets, false most of them, are the typical form of that vampiristic money sucking leeches in the USA who can only survive if God blesses the child and America.<br/><br/>But there are other forms that are just as deadly and life-sucking. You can see Hitler and the Nazi party, and all other fascistic movements, as exactly the same ambition: take advantage of the developing industrial revolution to line your pockets with power and money. But on the other side you can have all the socialistic and communistic preaching that is exactly the same thing. And the military forces can decide to use their weapons to become the false prophets of this industrial development. The worst concoction is when one of these political movements takes the control of the armed forces, or vice versa, and then they establish a totally irreversible dictatorship.<br/><br/>Irreversible, well, maybe not.<br/><br/>The film suggests that you can always become deaf to these and run away and start your own development in some other country or state. It also suggests that the industrialists and the prophesizing profiteers may get into a fight to the death and then some others will come and pick up the pieces and recuperate the whole treasure chest. The film does not allude to the political mode of democratic management of this development. Just be the prophet that will win an election till a new prophet comes and wins it against you and gets you out. But be sure this intruder will not last long and will be out of the job when another one comes and claim victory. Democracy is a permanent rotation of false prophets.<br/><br/>Alleluia <br/><br/>Jacques COULARDEAU"

","While prospecting for silver Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), finds oil and starts to build his empire.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with Daniel Day-Lewis so I must ask, does he always sound like he is imitating Sean Connery's speech? Well, anyway, it worked; I enjoyed that part of him. He does capture the Best Actor Award and I have no problem with that. His character is driven to succeed to the point he trusts no one. Problem is we don't know why he is that way, no background was given to provide any clue. He claims his wife died in childbirth, and later says he found the baby and kept it to show to others he has a softer side and maybe they would feel sorry for him and give in to him. That worked too. But, the more successful he becomes, the meaner he becomes. Again, we do not know why this progression. We just accept it and Daniel Day-Lewis walks off with the Oscar. Ah! So the key to the Award is not explaining oneself? Ah! <br/><br/>The movie holds you because you do not know what mean thing Plainview will throw at others, and this continues all the way to the very end. Very Clever. It's not that we do not like Plainview, we just don't understand him at all and we look for a softer side, and end up in a dry well. Sorry. <br/><br/>For a movie to behave like an epic-in-the-making, there are no women in here to help us discover who this man is. No humor. And, absolutely no give and many lines by this man are like they come from a shotgun. Ooops, he does show a softer side when he talks about what he will do for the community so he can rake in the oil profits. He needs to do that to get what he wants, and that, of course, is: everything. Yes, he is a good salesman (person) when he needs to be. Ah!<br/><br/>Since this movie seemed to be nominated for just about everything, I was surprised there was no nomination for the Music Oscar. The music was outstanding, and yet, no nomination for that. Maybe, it's just me. <br/><br/>Let's see: struggle to find silver, find oil instead, trust no one, get baby, use baby, build empire, trust no one, get religion to get more oil, steal oil (oh, oh!) to make bigger empire, trust no one, blood spilled. Yes, everything is there but no women, no trust, no humor, no humanity. Ah!<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No"

","An epic film. There will be blood deals with the turn of the century petroleum boom. Daniel Plainview started off as a down and out silver miner raising a son of his own and makes it big as a self made oil tycoon. Plainview gets a suspicious looking tip off at some point about a little town far off where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, and off he goes to check it out with his son. They get there, its a pretty barren place if you ask me. All the excitement in this small Boston town is centered around the church of the far out and heavy young preacher. Daniel and his son make the lucky strike, but as there fortunes escalate, all else collapses, literally. Every human value such as love, hope, community, belief, ambition and even the Bond between Father and son, all is imperiled by corruption, absolutely everything. Lots of deception as the oil flows on. A good film."
"tastyhotdogs","Null","1","4","28 March 2008"," There was blood, eventually
","""There Will Be Blood"" is an epic, based upon the 1927 book ""Oil!"". I didn't know much about it going in, except that it had Daniel Day Lewis playing an oil tycoon. For me, that was enough of a sell. If Darren picked a movie to go and see called ""There Will Be Blood"", I probably would have declined, but to his credit I picked it and he agreed, knowing full well it wasn't going to be up to his normal gory standards.<br/><br/>I'd been wanting to see this for a while and knew an Adelaide visit presented a good opportunity. I checked out session times and it was only still being shown in 2 cinemas, very infrequently. I pre-booked some tickets online for the first time, meaning I'd get to experience what they show in the movie ads where you stroll straight up to get your tickets,lights shining on you and all the suckers who are waiting in line go ""man, we should have booked online. We're such losers"". Sadly it wasn't like this at all. The funny thing was when I booked they encouraged you to collect your ""pre-booked, allocated seating"" ticket 30mins prior to the movie, which seems ridiculous. Luckily I ignored there I advice as when we got there there were only a handful of people in any lines, plus the cinema only had 2 other people in it.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the movie. It starts with Daniel Plainview (Day Lewis) down a hole digging about. Then we skip forward a few years and he discovers the first of many oil wells. All of this (about 20mins in screen time) is done with no dialogue. Weird. Luckily I still followed what was happening. Soon Plainview has a small portfolio of oil wells and is doing very nicely. He starts to build a little empire, working with his adopted son HW, whom he became guardian for after his father died in a digging accident. One day while trying to gain some more land he gets an offer from a young guy about a likely potential boom area where he has seen oil seeping through the land. the kid asks for some money to advise where it is and Plainview agrees. He goes to check it out and discovers an absolute gold mine (in an oil sense). Plainview buys the land from the ignorant family, part of the deal being the establishment of a church on the lands so the son can start his own ministry. The rig is soon underway and the community is greatly enriched. From the moment the rig starts digging however, trouble upon trouble comes Plainview's way. Plainview starts to get a more sever mean streak, majorly affecting his relationships with the church, business associates and his family.<br/><br/>I wont go on much more from here as it will ruin many of the subplots. Now to the review.<br/><br/>First of all, your ""Fast and the Furious"" types will probably hate it. It's set in the early 1900's and the story is slow at times. The story is rather intriguing and leaves a fair bit of food for thought. It's not what i expected, I had in my mind much more boardroom dealings and a fiercer pace, but the story just rolled on. The cast was outstanding, most notably Day Lewis as Plainview in one of the truly great performances of cinema, Paul Dano as Eli Sunday and Kevin O'Connor as Henry. A good story, perhaps a modern day ""Dances With Wolves"", just a lot better. I didn't want to review it straight after as I was still a little bewildered, and three days later still am unsure how I felt about it. Certainly worth seeing though, probably not a great chick flick though.<br/><br/>*As far as the violence, it's pretty moderate. For example, about half way through Gary whispered to me ""there's been no blood yet"", to which I replied ""yeh, but I'm pretty sure there will be blood""."
"dougandwin","8","1","4","2 March 2008"," Daniel Day-Lewis is world's best actor
","If I was rating ""There will be Blood"" on acting alone, then a 10 would still not do the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis justice - I cannot recall ever seeing a better performance, and if ever an Academy Award was merited, it is his - the other worthy nominees were very unlucky to come against him. The supporting cast was brilliant particularly the actors who played Eli/Paul and the small son. As to the movie, it was brilliantly made, starkly realistic in every way (although I did have a problem with some of the musical background), and photographed superbly BUT the story was a bit too over the top in several places and I felt left a bit to be desired. It will not appeal to everyone - at the screening I attended a number of people left halfway through. I could never do that when Day-Lewis is on the screen - he truly is a majestic performer."

The casting was absolutely perfect, the writing flawless, the cinematography beyond compare, the soundtrack engaging, and it all came together to deliver one of the few films that hook, grab, and pull you until you are watching everything so closely you feel as if you are right there with the characters. You gasp, you cry, you smile, you flinch, you jump, and your heart might even skip a beat or two.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview brilliantly - a frightening, truthful performance that leaves you shivering. Paul Dano is absolutely incredible as Eli Sunday, a young evangelic priest who is corrupted by the wealth of the oil business. His sermons were so intense and so real that I did in fact believe it was actually happening right in front of me for a few minutes. An amazing debut by Dillon Freasier as Plainview's son, H.W. Plainview - this kid is more than a natural; he was born for it.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop now before I begin to rant.

"michael_the_nermal","7","1","4","13 February 2008"," Inconsistent Profile of a Wildcatter
","Warning! Major spoilers ahead<br/><br/>""There Will be Blood"" is an interesting character study of a California oil wildcatter and speculator that is sustained by excellent acting and fervent analysis of the main character's decay as he grows wealthy. The movie's main flaws, though, are some of the inexplicable plot turns and odd behaviors by the characters; for instance, Plainview's murder of a man claiming to be his brother is never satisfactorily explained, nor are Plainview's violent threats and mood swings towards the evangelical preacher, who is the antagonist of the film, or other characters, such as the representatives of a major oil conglomerate who wish to buy Plainview out. Plainview's shift from calmness to madness seems strange. This keeps the movie from being fully satisfying or coherent. Still, Daniel Day-Lewis holds his own as the enigmatic character. This movie tries desperately to be like ""Citizen Kane"", and the main character does seem to have a real-life counterpart to Orson Welles' Kane (Kane is a thinly-veiled depiction of William Randolph Hearst, and some sources argue that Plainview represents California oilman Edward Doheney, though J. Paul Getty may also be a likely suspect). The characters' strange inconsistencies, as well as his vague antagonism towards preacher Eli Sunday (a caricature of Aimee Semple McPherson, also a contemporary with fellow Californian Doheney?), make this movie more difficult to understand than ""Kane."" C.F. Kane's alienation from family and friends are clearly defined by his actions, and thus more coherent in the story; Plainview's relationship with his son, Sunday, his so-called half-brother, and oil rivals are rather opaque, and we cannot feel either sympathy or disgust with his character. In other words, I just didn't get what this film was trying to say or what it was trying to convey through Plainview's character (ironic, given the character's surname).<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie because I have an interest in the history of the Old West, and I didn't know much about the oil wildcatters of the early 20th century. This movie was not too satisfying in that regard either. Still, I do recommend this movie if only for the impassioned acting of all the characters involved. You certainly cannot criticize the actors for being lethargic or uninvolved in their roles. Give this film a view, and try to glean anything I obviously missed.<br/><br/>P.S. I loved ""DRRRRAAAINNNNAAAGGGGEEEE!!!!"" It's a scene right up there with William Shatner's ""KHHAAANNNN!!!"""

","Do not be discouraged by the title of this film - despite its ominous poster and trailer it is a fascinating film. I think the cinematography and score complement each other so well that certain scenes haunt you after seeing it. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance reminds me of a Robert de Niro meets Sean Connery or John Huston. He is so powerful on screen that it seems the other characters move only in accordance with him.<br/><br/>In a sense this film is about oil, but it is also about the human condition and its effect on the environment and the people who are near it. Despite the solid performance from Paul Dano and Daniel Plainview's son, Lewis' performance is like a demigod's on screen and it is hard to forget it. Even if he doesn't receive an Oscar, it will be compared to O'Toole's in Lawrence of Arabia or Pacino's in Scarface. Irresistible yet repulsive simultaneously."
"Chris_Docker","9","1","4","5 February 2008"," They don't make movies like they used to . . . except occasionally
","At a time when oil in movies is usually about modern day strife  Syriana, Total Denial, A Crude Awakening  cinema-goers are maybe ready for a good old fashioned epic about the pioneering days of the industry.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). A man of the earth in 1898. In a few years, he goes from precious metals to the black stuff. Plainview pits himself against the elements and always triumphs. And expects no less when people enter the equation.<br/><br/>Plainview embodies the spirit of capitalism. Minus redeeming features. He digs. He conquers. He spits out blood and oil. And generally hates people. They have nothing that he can respect and God fares not much better. He can perfectly enunciate the necessary lip-service to appease either the Almighty or the Common Weal if business demands it, but only as a last resort.<br/><br/>On the day that he opens a big new well, the local pastor (Abel) comes along to bless it. Plainview adapts the words and blesses it himself, leaving Abel speechless.<br/><br/>Having bought up most of the land, or leases to drill oil, only one man  an old-timer named Bandy - stands in his way. Bandy will sell only on condition that Plainview is baptised. The humiliation at the hands of Abel is a grudge that will one day be settled.<br/><br/>Various subplots involve a son who goes deaf and the seeming appearance of Plainview's brother. Both are beautifully woven into the story to examine the oil patriarch's human emotions - and lack of them.<br/><br/>In some ways, There Will Be Blood recalls the 1956 James Dean film, Giant. Giant was based on the life of a Texas oilman, Glenn McCarthy. Daniel Day-Lewis' oil character reminds me somewhat of George W Bush. But I have to admit that the greedy win-at-any-cost picture is a little too black-and-white for me, even though I am no fan of profiteers who mix business with politics. Whatever human faults are triggered by the oil business, it is also the major enabler of our modern western society. Should the oil man not get some credit for the riches brought to the world, even if they were brought through selfish motives? In the demonization of Plainview, this is entirely ignored.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a superb achievement in film-making. A story from a traditional mould told with immense skill and gigantic performances. It grips from beginning to end and covers an important period of history. It is a great work easily accessible by every cinemagoer. Which puts it in a different category to director Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier works. I loved his Magnolia, but frogs falling from the sky are not everyone's idea of a good ending to an elaborate soap drama. There Will Be Blood is the film that will probably survive him and be looked back on with near universal respect.<br/><br/>If I have one quibble, it is that the Christ and anti-Christ theme (or its Old Testament equivalent) is a little too simplistic, given too much emphasis, and submerges a plot that could easily raise the themes to a more nuanced and uplifting worldview. But don't let that put you off going to see it. This is a towering adventure not to be missed!"

","Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" is a classic, there is no denying, a movie that people should still see 100 years from now and a lot of this is due to Daniel Day-Lewis' mesmerizing performance during these 2.5 hours. It's not a problem at all that none of the other actors in here are known really. For Dano, it was a bit of a breakthrough film, even if opinions differ about his turn here. It is possibly Day-Lewis' career-defining performance and every scene with him is mesmerizing to watch, especially in the second half when every scene is a winner, also contents-wise and it doesn't matter if we are talking about the restaurant/pub scenes, the ones with his brother, the final scene with his son (including the confession), the milk shake scene or eventually the grand finale. One amazing sequence after the next. And while I do think that Day-Lewis is the best thing about the movie, I still think it should have won more Oscars, but ""No Country for Old Men"" is pretty great too, so I can bear with it.<br/><br/>In terms of the subjects here, it is what you'd expect for a 2-hour film. It is never boring because there is so much in it, in terms of quantity as well as quality. God/Religion is a recurring theme, but it is also about much more personal issues, like fatherhood, family and a general sense of belonging. It's also interesting how love or sexual relationships are missing entirely in terms of Plainview's character. Another thing that should definitely be mentioned is the visual side. A movie about the early 20th century could hardly look any better in terms of cinematography etc. This film here is a true experience. I think it may be an even better watch if you don't know about the contents and what happens on several occasions, also especially the scenes in which Plainview proves a ruthless criminal, but it's still really good on rewatch. It's possible to write a 10,000 word examination on the character of Daniel Plainview (probably more as he is still a contender for most memorable film character of the 21st century) and the story itself as well, or even about his relationship with his son, about the initial motivation to take him and how his perception may have changed, the moment when he leaves his son when he needs him the most to run to the derrick for example. But there are many many other scenes to be honest and you will recognize them if you see them. This film is an experience that you have to make yourself and while I am usually more interested in the historic context of 20th century films that take place a little later, this film is evidence how I can also appreciate a work from very early 20th century, even if admittedly politics don't play a role in here at all and the time is pretty irrelevant if we neglect the professional background of DDL's character here.<br/><br/>So overall, this film is one of the rare occasions of the 21st century where I am not shy of using the term masterpiece. PTA and DDL are masters of their craft and they prove that they are among the very best existing right now in their respective fields. My description of this review already sums up perfectly how I see it and yes it is a must-see, even for people with not much of an interest in the admittedly sterile and bleak subjects of oil production and very early 20th century life, maybe also because it is only in theory about these topics. It is much more a character study, a biopic of what greed can do to you and how it can go against values like family, religion and sense of belonging if you make the wrong decisions because of your emotional state and because of who you are. Daniel Day-Lewis hits all the right notes here and even nails the scenes that could easily have gone over the top in bad way. Go see it now. What are you waiting for. A 150-minute movie (or even slightly longer) that never drags, you don't get that really often, do you?"

This is where the term ""dork"" came in, to describe the TV characters like Ted Baxter of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and Herb of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", men who tried so hard to be ""cool"" that they looked ...dorky.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis does what he is always stereotyped to do, play a control freak. One can't say it's a good acting job, because any person, anyone who has any experience at all in Theater, knows that playing the control freak is simple. The real acting comes from those who react and allow the control freak to speak his lines and get away with it. That's nothing against Daniel Day. It isn't his fault that he is stereotyped into roles that require no more acting than a walk on can do.<br/><br/>It does give credit to the acting talents of the rest of the cast, and clearly Daniel Day did his job, too.<br/><br/>If one is simply wanting to see theatrical work done by actors, one will be rewarded. If one wants to see a clever story, one will be very disappointed. If one wants to be amused, one will be disappointed for most of the movie.<br/><br/>We're never sure what is going on, due to the poor directing. It looks like the character of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis), begins as a gold miner, switches to oil when he finds it, and lucks into being a huge success. It is also clear from the start that he is going to be another of the cliché psychopaths we are expected to like, but only other psychopaths could possibly care about.<br/><br/>We see a character betray his family and townspeople, selling out like a quisling to Plainview, and he never resurfaces, but all through the movie we wonder where he is. We know he'll be important at the end. We wonder why he is a quisling, and more on that later.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Plainview is another of the control freaks we are constantly bludgeoned with by hack writers. Yes, it does make him the most stereotypical of dull clichés, and we have a hard time staying awake. The background characters are clearly more interesting, if only because they aren't as stereotypical as the leads.<br/><br/>The other main character is the religious fanatic that hack writers want to believe exist, but which you never meet in real life, and in fact are so easy to spot and so easy for journalists to capitalize on, that every single one who has existed since the printing press has been headline news. Their very nature makes them too easy to find and reveal. Yet, by some miracle, we only find a handful. And by an even bigger miracle, hack writers have sold this handful to the public as a believable stereotype. Real religious leaders have to watch every single word they utter. Even a cough condemns them because of hate mongering hack writers like Anderson. ""Easy target"" is what dorks like Anderson look for, and he humiliated himself to any intelligent viewer.<br/><br/>The movie is probably a comedy, but if so, it is very slow in building up jokes. It is a very dull, dry comedy. Anderson continues in his ""dork"" persona by trying for the most acceptable of dark comedy. Again, he is too obvious.<br/><br/>The entire movie looks to be written out of rabid hatred. The object of the hatred here is a cliché that only exists in feeble hate filled minds.<br/><br/>Back to the quisling, whom Anderson seems to want to justify. He fails miserably. Anderson seems to have lived a remarkably sheltered life if he thinks this quisling character suffered persecution from family and committee. If Anderson ever met with persecution, he'd know this.<br/><br/>Anderson is not subtle one bit, and it's sad that scripts and ideas of better writers are passed over to produce such one dimensional drivel of a man who thinks of nothing but hate, who worships nothing but hate, and who makes movies that can only be enjoyed by fellow control freaks filled with hate. Pathetic."

He's so cruel he'll even go as far as beating the town's bishop in public not caring what others will say or think about him, sending his deaf son away because he can't accept his disability anymore and killing anyone who's going to deceive him or trick him with cold blood. He even ends up murdering the Bishop by beating him senseless while his servant just stands up watching him near by, I Hated his character ! True Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing in playing the jerk and this role totally fits him but I hated this character ! I wanted him to die or at least finds redemption and feel guilty but he didn't he just didn't he kept on killing and murdering and doing all those things and he got away with it !<br/><br/>That's why I rated this a 6 which I did mostly for the acting and the filmography the story itself was lacking and so was the ending."

Daniel Day-Lewis delivers one of the most incredible performances in film history. His portrayal of Daniel Plainview is as deep as an actor can submerge himself into the subconscious of a character.

Daniel Day Lewis does give a great performance in this but even his talent can save the film from being a disappointment. The rest of the cast including Paul Dano, Cirian Hinds, and Kevin J. Oconnor are okay as the supporting characters but they lack screen time and development because most of the focus is on Day Lewis. The movie does have an interesting premise but the slow pace at least to me is what hurt it the most. If Anderson had made it shorter and faster paced somehow it would've been better. I was disappointed with movie because I hear so many good things about this one but I ended up hating it. Overall There Will Blood does have a compelling story with a knock out performance by Daniel Day Lewis but after watching this movie I felt disappointed because it could have been a lot better."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","5","1 May 2009"," The kind of movie I thought that didn't got made anymore.
","'They don't make them like this anymore' is a much uses expression when saying something about a classy '40's epic. ""There Will Be Blood"" however is just a movie like that. Appearantly there are still directors around with the talent to bring back the old feeling of a brilliant epic from the early days of cinema, with the same style and approach of things, that might seem slow and old fashioned for some people but are a real treat for the lovers of cinema.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is a slow but real intriguing and very detailed portrayed of a man. It's like an autobiographic movie without being based on an actual person (well, not 100% fully). Just like in real life he faces some extreme ups and downs, of which the downs are of course the real interesting aspects of the movie. It's a real powerful movie to watch, even when there is actually very little happening. It's a movie made with such an eye for detail that this becomes a subtly brilliant movie.<br/><br/>'When ambition meets faith' is a great tag-line for the movie. It really describes what the movie is about. It's main character is a real driven one that has aspiring ambitions but countless times he's being pulled down by events and people around him, even when things are going really well for him. He basically sacrifices his entire life, without giving his actual life, for reaching his goal. When he has eventually reached that goal life is also empty for him. The movie is a great character study of a greedy man, who of course also still has an heart and soul.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is almost completely being driven by Daniel Day-Lewis. He for 90% basically makes this entire movie. Without him there also truly wouldn't had been ""There Will Be Blood"". Like always he really becomes the character, which is perhaps even a bit scary at times to see him get into his role so deeply. As expected he also won an Oscar for his role. Whenever Daniel Day-Lewis plays a role like this one there simply is no other competition for him. Most of the time he also completely plays all of his fellow actor from the screen in this movie, which perhaps sounds as a compliment but actually is more a bit of a complaint. He lets some of the other fine actors look bad, of which the movie doesn't benefit. Luckily though the movie is purely about Daniel Day-Lewis for 90% of the time, making the complaint not much of a complaint anyway.<br/><br/>But of course Paul Thomas Anderson shouldn't be forgotten. After all he is the man that had the guts to directed this movie, that isn't exactly mainstream in its core but nevertheless became a modest box office hit due to his professional skills. The movie won lots of awards, which of course wasn't just due to Daniel Day-Lewis his performance. Paul Thomas Anderson is a real talented director who really knows how to tell a story powerful, effective and intriguing, even when in its core the story might seem far from any of that. He proved this before with movies such as ""Magnolia"" and ""Boogie Nights"". ""There Will Be Blood"" however still remains his most grand and epic production as of yet.<br/><br/>It's also a real beautiful looking. The movie does a very good job at creating a very authentic look and atmosphere for the story that is set at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. The movie is gritty and dark and has a depressing look without ever giving you a depressing feeling. The movie also really deserved its Oscar which it won for its cinematography. The movie was nominated for a total of 8 Oscar's, making it one of the big movies of 2007. It won only 2 Oscar's though and lost out its most important awards to the hit-movie ""No Country for Old Man"". <br/><br/>A great unique movie made in the style and tradition of the movies from the 'good old days'.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","People will probably shoot me down for this, but honestly this movie was VERY over-hyped. It seemed as though the director simply made this movie for the very purpose of exploiting the sheer acting power of Daniel Day Lewis. His performance was phenomenal, however the movie itself was very lacking. The overall themes and plot-lines were very interesting and could have made an excellent movie, one that could have rivaled The Godfather, or one that could have rocked America. However the director crapped out. Many of the scenes are way too prolonged to the extent where the overall message of the scenes were shadowed by the length of the scenes. Also it was way to subliminal. I was talking to my friends father one day about the movie, saying that it was too subliminal. He assumed that I just wasn't ""intellectual enough"" or ""too young"" to understand the themes. However that was not the case, the themes are fairly easy too understand, however it is obvious that the director tried too hard to make this an ""intellectual"" movie, what with the overly subliminal ways of conveying the messages that almost ruined them, and the overly contrived dialogue. Overall I'd give this movie a 6/10, but because of Daniel Day Lewis and the rest of the incredible cast, I'd give it a 7/10. Really, the acting is this films saving grace."

"rmax304823","8","1","5","11 June 2008"," Well executed, highly original tale of oil.
","Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, an outwardly normal man who sees oil drilling, the exploitation of land and people, and the accumulation of riches as a moral calling. He's as Calvinistically devoted to his work as the zealous preacher of the Third Evangelical Church, whom and which he hates passionately. The story begins with Lewis working alone, chipping away at the bottom of a pit, and ends with him bashing someone's brains out in the bowling alley of his Citizen-Kane-like mansion.<br/><br/>The whole movie is weird, something along the lines of Terence Malick, without the narration. The musical score, for instance, by Jonnny Greenwood is not what any sane viewer would expect. Except for a dash of Brahm's violin concerto in celebration of the drilling of the first well in New Boston, it skitters all over the place, full of dissonant strings and, during an action sequence, out-of-synch percussion exclusively.<br/><br/>The loopy story covers 30 years in the early development of the petroleum industry and Lewis is one of the first Seneca oil salesmen. He cheats churches out of money he promised them. He adopts an orphaned boy because having a sweet child along might help him in swindling people out of their oil-rich land for ""quail prices, not for oil prices."" In his dealings with others, he sounds polite and practical but inside that shell of practiced convention, there isn't much except anger, loneliness, and a twisted connection to the child that isn't his.<br/><br/>The movie hangs almost entirely on the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis -- and does he deliver! Wow. He comes from the British tradition of technical actors who don't delve into their own emotions for a role. That well will turn up dry. Instead they adopt the tics, mannerisms, and voice of the characters they are playing. In Lewis's case it's always interesting to see what he'll come up with next. What a villainous New Yorker he was in ""Gangs of New York."" His character here is originally from Wisconsin, but his voice doesn't sound particularly Midwestern. Instead, if you can imagine this, it sounds like a cross between John Huston and Sean Connery, with intimations of Jack Palance.<br/><br/>He outdoes himself in the climactic bowling alley scene. He's waked up by his nemesis from the Evangelical Church, a pasty faced, youthful demagogue from the pulpit who casts out devils -- his own brand of snake oil. (The novel was written by Upton Sinclair, a faded writer who may now be more relevant than ever.) Anyway, Lewis has fallen asleep drunk, in the middle of a bowling alley, a half-eaten plate of food beside him, snoring away on the hardwood floor. It takes forever to rouse him, and it's a mistake to do so. He climbs unsteadily to his feet, shaking his leg that has fallen asleep, still half drunk, and after tormenting his would-be savior, hobbles around clumsily after him, throwing bowling balls and ninepins at him, until he finally flattens and brains him. (Not his first murder.) <br/><br/>When the butler appears and inquires, ""Mister Plainview?"", Lewis is sitting on the floor, legs akimbo, and shouts, ""I'm FINISHED."" It has the resonance of, ""Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?"" Oh, the movie is slow here and there. And some of the ambiguity is perhaps too ambiguous without intending to be so. But the film as a whole overcomes its own weaknesses with a more-than-able assist from Lewis. Watch him in the scene in the primitive church, when he confesses what a sinner he is and must beg to be washed in the blood of the lamb (in order to have access to another tract of land). The preacher hectors him with accusations of having abandoned his child, something Lewis earlier threatened to cut someone's throat for, and Lewis is bursting with rage and humiliation -- sputtering, ""Oh, Lord, I have SINNED! Let me get out of here!"" <br/><br/>It's a rare film. It's aimed at adults rather than teens impatient to see heads wrenched off. It's aimed at people capable of patience and curiosity about others. There are two murders but not a drop of blood is seen -- and no phony sex. No sex at all. Plainview doesn't want to be loved. He wants to be feared."

","I think this movie should have won best picture. The Cohen Brothers made a good film, but this is an excellent woven epic that you can watch over and over again. It makes me think of Giant with James Dean, but a deeper vision into the rotted core of human existence, manipulation and greed. I have to say I favor Daniel Plainview, because his honesty is to the point. The cinematography won an Oscar, and reminded me a lot of the clarity found in Days Of Heaven: Brooke Adams, Richard Gere, Sam Shepard. The soundtrack is a great combination of Native American meeting industrial banging and drilling. If you have not seen it yet, pay very close attention. If on DVD, you will probably watch it more than once. I have seen it four times."

He arouses all the emotions including pity, admiration, and hatred.

"richardvincelli","10","1","5","8 April 2008"," The Daniel Day Lewis Show
","As in his previous Oscar Winning endeavor, My Left Foot, there would be no There Will be Blood without Mr. Lewis. His multi-layered portrayal of the main character, obsessed oilman Daniel Plainview, is nothing less than a revelation. The Academy got it right this time, for a change.<br/><br/>As the seemingly mad oilman, Lewis shows us what great performances are truly made of. While not historically factual, or based on fact, it would be impossible not to imagine such a man doing exactly what he did, when he did it, and how he did it.<br/><br/>His character outwardly appears to be nothing more than an evil, greedy, controlling, self-loathing, self-possessed salesman, but hidden beneath the veneer is a man that has buried his sadness as deep as the oil he so desperately seeks. What we see on the surface is only rage, anger and ravenous avarice. But burrowed deep in the marrow of this soul is a man harboring so much sadness it defies belief.<br/><br/>I can fully understand why so many people did not like this film. It's Kubrick-like, stolidly deliberate pacing will no doubt be disappointing to the casual movie-goer. The closest film I have seen in terms of pacing and overall effect would be Kubrick equally challenging Barry Lyndon. At times interminable and wholly frustrating, this is a film that must be experienced with the understanding that it is NOT a conventional Hollywood movie. It needs to be soaked up slowly like a sponge...simultaneously absorbing and draining, it takes a great deal of patience to enjoy. So be forewarned. And NEVER has there been such a misleading title. I would imagine many people thought they were going to see Saw Part V, but this is not a slasher flick by any stretch of the imagination...and surprisingly, a movie with very little bloodshed. In fact, the majority of the violence is off-screen and left to the imagination.<br/><br/>I will not reveal any details at all, but the direction is startling. PT Anderson, whom I always felt was highly overrated, does his Kubrick thing with as much bravura as any filmmaker in modern times. The cinematography is breathtaking. The minimalist soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is equally absorbing. But this film belongs to it's star, a man that so fully disappears into his role it's hard to imagine he could ever crawl back out from under the character's skin.<br/><br/>And Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) deserves nearly as much credit as Lewis. Expect to see more of this talented young man as the years pass. The entire cast is first rate, even the child actors, who will undoubtedly see this film (under their parent's supervision) and be shocked that they were a part of such a deep, dark product, which, by comparison, makes No Country for Old Men look like a Disney charmer.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is an unnerving masterpiece of epic proportion."

Yet, this is a completely satisfying experience from start to finish and I'd be more than happy to go back and watch it again. My only complaint is that the unsuitable score kept intruding upon my enjoyment. In the grand scheme of things, however, that's a minor complaint.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview, a hardworking solitary man, strikes oil in 1898. We follow his story in the years that follow, as he gets richer and richer. We meet his son, his brother, his rival and his enemy along the way. How he treats each one tells us a lot about Daniel Plainview. His ""enemy"" - by the way - is a minister in a small town that Plainview wants to own. They clash repeatedly over the years, some battles are humorous and some are vicious, and viewers might be tempted to read the film as a study in Power vs. Revigion. But, truthfully, it's not a story that's that easy to categorize.<br/><br/>While there is still a lot left unclear, when the the movie draws to a close in 1927, the viewer is left with vivid picture of who this man was and what sort of world he lived in.

","Even though there's been a lot of publicity about this film throughout the award season, I managed to avoid any spoilers before the film finally turned up at our local flea-pit. It was certainly well worth the wait and it was great to see a craftsman practising their art. In terms of the current crop of directors (PT)Anderson must be my favourite and I adore both Magnolia and Boogie Nights.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether there is much comment about this, but the opening sequence of the film has no dialogue. You can almost sense that Anderson is playing with the audience and my guess is that it must be about 15 minutes before the first dialogue. I've no doubt I'll be able to check that somewhere on the net.<br/><br/>Whereas with Magnolia and Boogie Nights had brilliant performances from several members of the cast There Will Be Blood is very much the Daniel Day-Lewis show. Fortunately Day-Lewis is certainly up to carrying the film and he fully deserved the best actor Oscar. I've no doubt ANderson and Day-Lewis got on well because they are not the most prolific of people in the movies. It's certainly quality rather than quantity for both.<br/><br/>In case anybody doesn't know the film follows an oil prospector from the early part of the 20th century. The film is tough going at times and the lead character is not the most sympathetic of characters, but as with most of Anderson's work there are times at the film when you get totally immersed in it. Well worthy of all the praise and lets hope it isn't Anderson's and Day-Lewis' last work of the decade ... Some hope!"
"Buddy-51","7","1","5","8 March 2008"," audacious but uneven film
","""There Will Be Blood"" - Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, ""Oil"" - runs for a good fifteen minutes before a single word is ever spoken. Yet, that prolonged reticence is probably the least peculiar aspect of a movie that becomes progressively more bizarre the longer it goes on.<br/><br/>In the role that won him an Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis - who, with his stentorian tones. sounds as if he's channeling John Huston for large portions of the film - plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil man in turn-of-the-century California who, in his ruthless quest for money and success, finds he has no room left over in his heart for either God or his fellow man. Plainview's main antagonist is Eli Sunday, a fire-and-brimstone faith-healer who turns out to be every bit as opportunistic and empty-souled as the godless Plainview (and considerably more hypocritical).<br/><br/>With two such unsavory and unsympathetic lead characters, Anderson really didn't have much choice but to go for the abstract in his approach, turning Sinclair's tale into an exercise in art house style that is as liable to alienate ""general audience"" viewers as pull them in. Anderson is dealing with some mighty resonant themes here - greed, deception, abandonment, religion, filial relationships, Man's place in the universe - and he brings an appropriately ""grand opera"" sensibility to the film. He lets Day-Lewis swing for the fences in his performance, resulting in a mesmerizing admixture of over-the-top histrionics and soul-searing subtlety. Anderson has mounted the film in such a way as to make the visuals and the landscape as integral to the storyline as the characters - at times even more so, as the script frequently fails to sufficiently clarify the motives for why the characters do what they do. Their actions often feel so arbitrary and inexplicable that we begin to wonder if crucial portions of the film might not have actually ended up on the cutting-room floor. This is particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.<br/><br/>Paul Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine"") and Dillon Freasier are both excellent as the callow preacher and Plainview's young son, H.W., respectively; and Robert Elswit's award-winning cinematography evokes the beauty of the setting without ever downplaying its bleakness. Finally, Jonny Greenwood's haunting score nicely underlines the purple-prose nature of the piece.<br/><br/>Alternately visionary and pretentious, ""There Will Be Blood"" may not be for all tastes and audience demographics, but its uniqueness, daring and style remind us of why many of us enjoy going to the movies in the first place."

My only real complaint was that there were some scenes that were either too long or completely unnecessary. I went and saw this with my 16 year old cousin and he was not only not impressed he was very bored. I don't think I would have liked this having been that age 14 years ago either. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that likes crappy movies like ""Fools Gold"" or the god-awful movies that Martin Lawerence, Eddie Murphy and even the used to be funny Steve Martin movies those men are making now. So if you like movies that don't make you think...at all, or you have to have instant gratification with the movies you see, don't bother because you won't like it. However if you like a movie that has interesting characters, fantastic music, great cinematography, and an almost perfect screenplay then please rush to a theater to see this now! This isn't really one of those movies that you might want to see over and over but it is one of those you should at least see once.

"NirvanaNaslund","9","1","5","1 March 2008"," One of the best films of the decade
","Arguably the best contemporary actor and director team up for There Will Be Blood, Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson. Based on the 1927 novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair the story centers around Daniel Plainview played by Day-Lewis, an early oil prospector beginning the in the late 19th century. Little Miss Sunshine star, Paul Dano plays the charming minister of the new area Plainview wishes to drill. The rivalry between them grows and the whole film will have the viewer itching to find out what happens next between them. Despite oil being the center point of the film's plot, as the story progresses, it becomes clear it is about far more than just oil.<br/><br/>To call Daniel Day-Lewis phenomenal would be to insult him, it is quite possibly the greatest acting achievement of the decade. Though it is very similar to the character Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting he played in Gangs of New York, this role has more depth and the transformation of the character was shocking. The incredible thing of all of Day-Lewis's performances is how much he embodies the character. He often becomes so involved that he has needed therapy to detach himself from the character after filming is over, particularly the unlikable ones like the greedy, manipulative Daniel Plainview.<br/><br/>The script, which was written by director, P.T. Anderson is to die for. It creates a stirring mix of dark comedy and tense drama and it is structured in such a way that the films most tense moments will follow the most comedic, so as to invoke a powerful immediate reaction that will cut the laughter abruptly and make the viewer feel guilty for laughing in the first place. The sheer genius of the dialogue that is used to help Plainview's slip from sanity is heart pounding. It's an excellent combination between director and actor when a simple line like, ""I can't keep doing this on my own with these people"" becomes bone chilling and terrifying. To boot, there is a line near the conclusion, that I shan't say for fear of spoiling it, that is poised to become one of the great lines in film history.<br/><br/>P.T. Anderson's directorial influences are heavy throughout the film. As Martin Scorsese's influencing hand was evident in Boogie Nights, Stanley Kubrick's is in There Will Be Blood. The first twenty minutes contain next to no dialogue with short shots of desert surroundings, joined only by strange noises and Ligeti heard over the soundtrack (which was mostly composed by Radiohead star, Johnny Greenwood). Of course, this is akin to the opening act of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey where we see primitive man in awe exploring a black monolith proceeded by the discovery of tools, leaping man into the next stage of evolution. In this case the anti-hero, Plainview, is in search of another black substance that will cause a different substantial leap for man. Not only that, the main character's self-destructive pattern resembles Redmond Barry's in Stanley Kubrick's historical drama, Barry Lyndon. It even contains a comparable shot of the lead assaulting the young male antagonist. Less concrete are the black comedy elements of A Clockwork Orange, and a score similar to The Shining.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick isn't the only one to have a noticeable influential impact; the thematic exploration of greed and wealth is almost identical to John Huston's The Treasure of Sierra Madre. This isn't to say P.T. Anderson copied or stole from these great directors; if that were true, almost every director working today would be accused of copying Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles (who was probably also a big influence of There Will Be Blood).<br/><br/>The cinematography played a large part in the eeriness of the film. Short shots of desert and oil derricks enhance the feeling of being there among the workers and villagers. Perhaps most amazing of all being a shot of a derrick before rumbling is heard and oil bursts from the ground and shoots dozens of feet into the air before setting on fire and crashing to the desert ground, presumably killing some workers. This is very creepily followed by Plainview exclaiming in joy, ""There's a whole ocean of oil under our feet!"" <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is everything one could want in a film. Day-Lewis so good he can make one root for a character one would otherwise despise. It is clearly the vision of an auteur director, it has moments that will make you take the view to the edge of his or her seat, or glue them to the back of it. Complexity of theme is present as it explores greed; religion, karma, ambition, and vengeance. Each are thought-provoking and moving. ****/4."
"bigbull_430","10","1","5","28 February 2008"," A most annoying yet masterful movie
","WARNING! THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. Truly, Paul Thomas Anderson has gone over the top with this one. This movie was enthralling and masterfully done, but it still is the most annoying piece of art I have ever seen. Have you ever seen one of Picasso's paintings? You somehow know there is great genius behind it, and most people love it more than anything in the world, but it disturbs you in such a way that you just want to get the hell out of the art gallery. This movie was like that. Combined with Jonny Greenwood's most horrific and annoying music which unfortunately suited the movie, and its slow yet bold shooting style, ""There Will Be Blood"" no doubt successfully sent the message through. Heck, it spoon feeds you the black oil, it fills you up with darkness, no matter you want it or not. It is the very portrait of hell, of evil. Some religious people may think that the film was about the lord, about how God's son (Eli) fought the devil (Daniel), it is not. It is the devil vs. the other devil. They are both self-centered, profit seeking, cold-blooded and undeniably evil. I think the director tries to show how feeble the concept of ""God"" might be when taken up by a person with a smart mouth and great dramatic skills. But the movie only touches upon this subject, not seeking complete attention with the subject because he knows that a movie too obviously about religion will unsettle the masses. He touches it, then seemingly directs attention away from it, yet is still talking about the subject throughout the movie. The Bible references are deeply hidden in the movie. Some critics have said that the movie lacks concentration, I think it is their own benevolence that they did not notice that the director was concentrated on one single subject throughout. Overall, masterfully done, but annoying as hell (pardon the pun). If you have a faint heart, do not watch this movie."

It raises more questions than it answers, but it makes some beautiful statements visually. There is a story and there is character development. Though slowly paced, it pays off. Lewis is in just about every scene, he really makes the movie. <br/><br/>There is a powerful Kubrick influence in this film. I remember how folks reacted to 2001: a Space Odyssey, too slow, not enough dialog, yeah what a crappy movie. And Anderson treats that influence with respect. I want to see it again.

"Biglebowski1","10","1","5","24 February 2008"," Close to perfect
","I had very big expectations going into this film, being a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, and it absolutely met them. First off, Daniel-Day Lewis is as good as advertised, and he absolutely deserved to win best actor at the Oscars. For 98% of the film, he controls every scene, handling a challenging role with the superb confidence only a spectacular actor like him could. Also, I felt Paul Dano did a very good job as Eli Sunday, especially considering that he's going up against Daniel-Day Lewis, and he only had four days to prepare for the role. As always, Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is great, as he sets the tone for the entire film very well. The script is also very well done, and handles its themes carefully without upstaging the rest of the film, like some politically-conscious films of the past few years have (Crash, Babel, etc.). All in all, There Will Be Blood is a spectacular film."
"seaview1","8","1","5","20 February 2008"," Oil and Family in THERE WILL BE BLOOD
","Having been praised for his Altmanesque work on such multi-character and interweaving storyline films as Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson has set out for completely new territory, and the results, while not necessarily commercially palatable for mainstream audiences, is a unique tale of greed, power, and the loss of one's soul in There Will Be Blood. Adapted loosely from Upton Sinclair's novel, Oil, this is truly a labor of love by Anderson, who has elicited a stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>A struggling oil miner in 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), slaves away on a dig until it begins to yield oil. Years later, he raises a child as his son amid the rural setting and buys oil fields while paying little or nothing for them. One day a stranger, Paul, offers to sell his family's land knowing there is some oil. Plainview sets forth to this property in the guise of a hunter and makes an offer to the religious family. The elder son, Paul's brother Eli (Paul Dano), is mistrustful. Eventually Plainview gets his land, begins to pump oil, and coddles the locals in a public relations sleight of hand. Although not a religious man, he subjugates his convictions to secure needed land rights. As Eli becomes a rising force of religious zeal, Daniel becomes a wealthy oil baron. Enter a mysterious man who has family ties to Plainview, and the quest for money and power takes on another aspect that complicates matters. Plainview's thirst for oil will stop at nothing until he is eaten away to a vindictive, monstrous self, setting the stage for a macabre reunion with an old face.<br/><br/>This is a slice of the industrial revolution and the horrors of quality control in keeping with author Sinclair's The Jungle. The period setting, with its raw, forbidding environment and dangerous existence, is vividly realized. This was a time where greedy men dealt with their own kind for personal gain, and women stood their place. Its antecedents are other similarly themed films like Giant, Greed, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, while it's lack of warmth and stark visuals would have impressed director Stanley Kubrick. It was a time where future billionaire's were in the making. As such it is a fascinating history and culture lesson all at once. Is this how the West was really won? Is this the darker side to Manifest Destiny? Aside from watching Plainview's amassing of wealth, the core relationship he has with his son, who witnesses much of his machinations, is an interesting one. Plainview at times shows paternal affection only to betray any semblance of loyalties and love for the prospect of oil. In fact, the film is filled with betrayals such as the way Plainview cheats families out of their potential wealth and a gut wrenching scene with his son on a train. It is a bleak film, but you've got to admire the singular vision with which Anderson and Lewis convey this character. We are fascinated by Plainview, but we don't have to like him.<br/><br/>There is a scene that illustrates Plainview's willingness to sacrifice his beliefs (or non-beliefs) in order to gain more oil fields. Set in a small church, this baptism scene is the highlight of the film and goes so over the top that it is a hoot. Further, when Plainview makes a play for land rights among sellers, his pitch becomes canned and rehearsed like a well 'oiled' commercial. He is a selfish con man, a liar, and a cheat. As much as you want to find something redeeming about him, it never fully emerges. He is also a most unforgiving and vengeful man in the worst way.<br/><br/>Former Oscar winner (My Left Foot) Lewis, like legendary actor Paul Muni, has limited his film output over the years. That he chose to do this based on Anderson's script speaks highly of the attraction of other high profile stars (e.g. Tom Cruise in Magnolia or Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love). Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) is pretty compelling as Eli, quite a weird, and ominous figure. The cinematography (Robert Elswit) recalls Days of Heaven. The minimalist score (Jonny Greenwood) is a bit unusual as it almost becomes an accompanying sound effect than theme.<br/><br/>The movie does have some impressive, opening minutes that are visual without talking. Some of the dialogue has a sadistic bite to it while the staging of scenes lends itself to a strong theatricality; despite its wide expanse of land setting, it has a claustrophobic feel. The pace of the film, which may test the audience's patience, is quite deliberate and almost slows to a halt, but Lewis surprises and fascinates at every turn. Watch out for the bizarre ending which may perplex some viewers. Although some may not appreciate it, others will simply relish this informal history lesson in the making of a turn-of-the-century mogul as personified by an acting giant who is about to add another gold statuette to his collection."
"addicott","8","1","5","14 February 2008"," A bit self-indulgent but quite engrossing at times.
","In his director commentary track on Boogie Nights (still his masterpiece in my books) Paul Thomas Anderson talked about making the movie for himself. No pandering - no compromises. I applaud that approach from any artist, but it seems that Paul gets WAY more ""into"" certain scenes, & sub-plots than I ever will be! I would usually pick a ""director's cut"" in a heartbeat, but with this director, maybe a ""studio-mandated cut"" could be a good thing.<br/><br/>PTA always gets off to a roaring start and this film is no exception! I found the first three quarters to be utterly fascinating. The silver mining scenes established a sense of toil like nothing else I've ever seen. The desert landscape becomes a potent if silent character. And the score was very refreshing (in a bleak, psychotic sort of way). For 2 hours, I was transported.<br/><br/>HERE""S THE SPOILER I really didn't care for the epilogue. It seemed disjointed, melodramatic and redundant. Daniel beating Eli to death seemed to me like a metaphor for the storyteller beating this story to death. OKAY, Danny's a sociopath, WE GET IT!!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I'm still a Paul Thomas Anderson fan and Daniel Day-Lewis was undeniably superb. The film was exceptional but not iconic in the way so many reviewers would have one believe."

","There have been assertions made that this deeply disturbing and powerful film, directed by the great Paul Thomas Anderson ("" Boogie Nights"" ""Magnolias""), somehow parallels Modern America because it involves an American Oil Baron and greed. However it it is set at a time when the Saudi Oil family a was monstrous, uncivilized warlike and brutal regime far worse than America. It maybe that The problem lies that Australians and similar western societies are immersed into this populist and mindless antipathy toward America that the subject of Oil barons ignites preposterous and ignorant theories that consume the sophist conspiracies of contemporary youth. This film is begins in 1898 with the arduous struggle of a silver and gold miner Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Daniel develops the mine and employs men to help him including a widowed father with a baby who subsequently dies in a mining accident. Daniel adopts the baby boy and names him H.W.. Daniel then strikes oil then ruthless expands his oil drilling empire at great speed. During this rapid rise in power and wealth Daniel use his boy to project a family image even though he secretly yearns his real long lost family.

"nobbytatoes","10","1","5","9 February 2008"," epic masterpiece
","If not from his previous works, There Will Be Blood will finally give credit where due, and announce Paul Thomas Anderson as one of the best American story tellers working in film. Magnolia, a cinematic experience like no other, and a bold statement to come from Anderson, Blood is a further honing of his craft, and catapulting him to another level of mastery. Based upon the novel Oil!, Blood has something to say, but this isn’t a very uplifting message. The main foes, Plainview and Sunday, each are not lost souls, they are demonic creatures, crawled out for the black oil that surrounds them. Not so much about the oil boom in the turn of the century California, Capitalism and Religious Zealots are butting heads, each possessing their vessels, yet both are kneeling at the alter of greed. Man’s soul is at risk here, but way of redeeming it is a bigger question.<br/><br/>Standing at the heart of this monster and screaming ‘I’ is Daniel Day-Lewis. A villainous monster, equally repulsive and eerily inspiring, Day-Lewis possesses Daniel Plainview with such demonic fever. Plainview is charming and charismatic, a likable man with his small limp and smile, and family man exterior. Behind the squint of his eye, evil deeds await for all who fall prey to him and his conquest. ‘There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.’ Plainview is a monster; with such content towards man, people are nothing more than meat to discard once he’s dried the land, yet he also carries that wonder and excitement that comes with discovery in industrialism, and a man that sticks to his ideals and principles, even if they rest in the extreme. You can’t call Day-Lewis’s performance a performance, he is Plainview. Standing beside Plainview with his cherub face and innocent demeanour is Eli Sunday, with Paul Dano leaving an impressive mark. The smoky veil of evangelical religion, the empty rapture and redemption he offers, as Sunday looks to control his minions and his self fulfilment as a prophet and vessel of God. <br/><br/>Conjuring Kubrick through his direction, from the wordless opening and extended scenes, dramatic shifts, it all goes with a purpose. Anderson makes a dramatic and epic statement every scene, as there is always interaction, verbally or non verbal, or through the piercing stares between characters. Jonny Greenwood’s discordant score cuts through the landscape and characters, raising the tension to blood boiling levels, before dropping it in an instant. Robert Elswit’s cinematography captures the Western landscape magnificently. <br/><br/>If the long wordless opening made some viewers wondering where will this all end, the yang to this are the two final gut wrenching conversation, and the bone crushing final moments (diabolical with its odd humour, many will be talking about this than the layers of themes, allegories and mythology to dig through) that will permeate and linger long after leaving the cinema. There Will Be Blood is an epic masterpiece from a master story teller."

"matt_man_22","10","1","5","7 February 2008"," The Greatest film I have ever seen...
","From the start, the music... was mind blowing, haunting if you will. The cinematography of the landscape was beautiful. Everything was perfect. It starts off Showing a younger Plainview digging for gold without and dialog or talking. The scene where he falls was shot perfectly, the direction of him waking up in agony, was done flawlessly. Plainview dragging himself to sell the silver, caring more about money than his injury, shows the kind of person Plainview is. <br/><br/>It then skips 5 years, and he is now digging for oil. Once again amazing cinematography, done perfectly. The death scene in the shaft was so realistic it was intense. When it skips to the train and you finally hear Plainview's voice, u know this movie is going to be something else. The movie is a slow buildup of hate, greed, envy, and vengeance. Everything works perfectly. The relationship between Plainview and Eli was so intense, they were very similar people, both wanting power. The scene where Plainview slaps Eli was perfect, it fit perfectly. Eli gets his revenge on Plainview later in the film, and it is just mesmerizing to watch, because you know that Plainview is going to get his revenge, you can tell by Eli's reaction after Plainview whispers to him. <br/><br/>When the movie skips ahead 15 years, and you see what Plainview has turned into, you just knew that this would happen, he has nothing, he becomes a raging alcoholic, and hates his life he created. Hes became psychotic if you will. The scene where he talks to his then 26 year old son, was truly unbelievable. <br/><br/>This movie makes you feel no empathy for any character, Eli is just as worse as Plainview, if not worse, because he is a hypocrite, at least Plainview knows what he is. The final scene of this movie, is quite possibly the greatest scene of acting I have ever seen. This scene alone makes Daniel Day-Lewis deserve the Oscar. People say it was over the top, but no, It was perfect. The bowling alley was the hell that Plainview created, and he knew that Eli would eventually come crawling to him, because that was the kind of person Eli was. <br/><br/>All I have to say in the end, is that this film deserves Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Actor, and Best Cinematography. I know it won't because everyone is in love with No country which I really don't understand... Don't get me wrong it was a great film, but its just not on the same level of There will be Blood. Everyone needs to see this movie just for the Performance alone, which in my book is the greatest performance of all time. Well done Mr.Anderson."

","This is my high-school movie review. It contains no true spoilers, only hints.<br/><br/>""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed.""<br/><br/>Training a fight dog is simple: give it no love or support. If something is never loved, it does not know how to love, and the outlet for a lack of love is the instinct to eliminate all others on a quest for success. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Daniel Plainview, played to perfection by Daniel Day-Lewis, is seen as a hard-working, self-employed oil digger who soon finds himself single with a baby boy. As Plainview's business proliferates, he and his boy, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), catch a lucky break and end up striking the mother lode in a small town, named Little Boston. Once an oil accident suddenly occurs, H.W.'s hearing is lost and Daniel's ""family man"" role starts to shrink. Daniel is becoming richer by the second, and he starts to picture his future home on the beach. Greed dominates Daniel. At one point, he looks at his map and yells, ""What's this? Why don't I own this? WHY DON'T I OWN THIS?"" His overall frustration can be attributed to his inability to appreciate what he has. Daniel always wants more. Wealth has become Daniel's number one priority, leaving H.W. as an afterthought. <br/><br/>Daniel enters a small town with the expectation of taking complete control, but he soon finds that gaining the full attention of the people will not be easy. Paul Dano plays the role of two identical twins: Paul Sunday, who points Daniel towards Little Boston on his quest for oil, and Eli Sunday, the vessel for the Holy Spirit in Little Boston's Church of the 3rd Revelation. Throughout the entire movie, Daniel and Eli butt heads in a competition for power in the town. They represent a common conflict of their time at the turn of the century: Capitalism vs. Faith. Anderson exploits the weakness of both, portraying Daniel as an over-powerful and heartless tycoon, and Eli as a weak and phony healer. Both characters fail to find the quintessential source of happiness. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie shows Daniel with everything he strived for, yet without happiness. A stunning ending ties the knot to ""finish"" the struggling relationships that existed in the film. Daniel starts the film with oil on his hands and ends with blood on his hands. His hands: symbols of his willingness to sacrifice anything for money and power.<br/><br/>The tragic ending to this film is followed by a cheery symphony that conveys the message - what seems meaningful is truly meaningless."

","There Will Be Blood is a sprawling, 158 minute epic period drama about a ruthless Texas oil-man who cares about nothing but his own fortunes.<br/><br/>If there are any knocks on this movie, I'd have to point out that it seems to be a little slow-paced in parts - but if you're someone who gives a ton of credit to character development, then the lulls of this movie definitely set up the climactic payout at the end of the film. I went to this movie with some friends who didn't like it as much as I did, and they're entitled to their opinions  but I have a strongly distinguish movies that are simply entertaining and ones that are ""good"" movies, which typically tend to be well-crafted and clever. All in all, this movie definitely accomplishes the status of a ""great"" movie, for me. In fact, of all the movies I've seen that are nominated for Best Picture, this is my favorite.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to address this film's greatest asset, Daniel Day Lewis. The character he plays, Daniel Plainview, is arguably the most conniving, jaw-dropping, and outright chilling character I've ever seen. I'm already mad at the Academy for not giving Into the Wild a nomination for Best Picture, but if they snub Lewis again, then the Oscars are a complete sham.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I think everyone should witness the greatness of Daniel Day Lewis' acting in this film. Even if you for some reason can't appreciate how good the movie is, I challenge you to honestly disagree with me about him winning Best Actor."

"jeffrey-burman","10","1","5","22 January 2008"," A New Heart of Darkness
","""There Will Be Blood"" is an implied promise. Going into the screening there is an anticipation of excess and a near-biblical pressing of the limits. And for all of its extremes, Paul Anderson's epic story of ambition and other masculine appetites, shows considerable reserve. It's language is, when it needs to be, restrained. In something of a trope, key phrases are repeated. Not just for emphasis or even for shading, but to infuse the moment with an intimacy that's rare in recent film-making.<br/><br/>In a film nominally ABOUT excess, there are several different strands of spectacle, one dwarfing the next. Daniel Day-Lewis' character, Daniel Plainview, is a study in ambition. Paul Dano, playing evangelical Eli Sunday, is a counterforce, drilling the inner depths. One a trusting healer, the other, Plainview, a ""stealer."" One seeks intimacy with cosmic mysteries with an out-sized faith, the other by taking god-like liberties as he pleases. The ""blood"" in the title is not just the blood of violence (which is actually used sparingly in the film), but is also the blood of Jesus, invoked by Eli Sunday. Another strand of spectacle is the bone-breaking and ground-wrenching drama of pulling wealth from the ground. The actual work of digging and drilling shown by Anderson is dangerous, rewarding and a remarkable -- even sensual -- spectacle.<br/><br/>It even dwarfs the demi-god Plainview himself.<br/><br/>And the film keeps topping itself. Plainview takes a meeting with a business rival and uses the moment as an opportunity to reveal an ambition (and an anguish) that is limitless. Dano tops his brilliant performance earlier in the film by continually reinventing himself as the story barrels along. The music, by Jonny Greenwood, tops one's expectations. In the very first scene the music tips the viewer off: This is no ordinary film! The sets, brilliantly evocative of the period, never overpower the narrative, but constantly buttresses the hand-wrought feeling of the early twentieth century.<br/><br/>What is left for Plainview's insatiable appetite for dominance in the end? Go see it and see..."
"ikanboy","9","1","5","21 January 2008"," A tour de force for Day Lewis
","I remember well the dark and gritty novels of Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis that explored the belly of the American beast in the early 1900's. This movie reawakens the mood of those novels with it's unflinching look at the hard scrabble heart of the capitalist manifesto: ""buy, produce, and sell, and to hell with whoever gets in your way."" Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing and truly awesome. I cannot think of another actor who could have done this role in quite this way. As usual he inhabits the character so that immediately one forgets the actor and becomes immersed in the man and his being. In a voice and cadence reminiscent of, if not an outright imitation of, John Huston's, Lewis's presence expands on screen into a Dickensian/Shakespearean grand guignol for the ages. Lewis specializes in recreating these humans who are forces of nature; unstoppable, unrepentant, builders and destroyers, and ultimately the seed that sprouted into America, like it or not.<br/><br/>Just as ""No country for old men"" the movie is clearly the work of genius. One can see the staging and thought behind every scene, and the blessed pauses to let it all sink in. The dialog is key, and Lewis a master of enunciating every line for affect. The landscape is California bleak, wind swept and desolate, and even at the end in Daniel Plainview's mansion the imagery is of emptiness and soulessness.<br/><br/>Also to be commended is Paul Dano as both twins; the boy who sicks Plainview onto his father's oil and his brother the preacher who strives to tame the beast in Plainview but ends up unable to tame the beast in himself, whose character, while as ambitious and amoral as Plainview's is no match for his antagonist, in spite of besting him in one of the movie's few comedic moments."

","There will be numerous mastery achievements for you when you view the P.T. Anderson masterpiece ""There Will Be Blood"". Let's take a look:<br/><br/>There will be an exceptional screenplay- Master Anderson struck oil when he loosely adapted Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"" into ""There Will Be Blood"". Anderson extended Sinclair's fable into a deeper obsession piece. Anderson's scribe focuses on Daniel Plainview, a coalman turned oilman in the early 1900's who is obsessively determined to drill oil lands and richly succeed at whatever humane price. Plainview travels with his child named H.W. who he also considers his business partner. Plainview encounters a proposition to drill for oil in the hill lands occupied by the Sunday family. Plainview's nemesis in the film comes in the form of Eli Sunday, the preacher Sunday son who is suspicious of Plainview's antics. The questions are: How intense does this rivalry lurks itself into? Is there going to be a ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" in ""There Will Be Blood""? I will not spoil it for you or else there will be blood from the author of this review by its readers. Speaking of authoring, Anderson's script is articulately creative and intuitive. I am confident there will be a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination for P.T.'s libretto effort of ""There Will Be Blood"". <br/><br/>There will be breathtaking cinematography and art direction- The picturesque cinematography and exquisite art direction of ""There Will Be Blood"" efficiently signifies in epic proportions the oil lands of America as being tranquil fertile grounds of potential richness and self-indulgence. Kudos goes out to Blood's ""witty"" cinematographer Robert Elswitt and ""uncranky"" art director David Crank for their supreme visions. There will be Oscar nominations for these two in their respected categories and hopefully also wins. <br/><br/>There will be auditory brilliance in the film's music- Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is definitely not no airhead. His powerful score of ""There Will Be Blood"" profoundly guides the film and is an integral part of the storytelling process. There will be an Oscar win for Greenwood for Best Score. Are you keeping score? <br/><br/>There will be precise film editing- Long-time Anderson collaborator Dylan Tichenor's design and cuts of Blood was bloody perfecto. I will have a tick if Tichenor is not nominated for a Best Editing Oscar nom. However, I am confident that there will be one for Dylan. <br/><br/>There will be crème-a-la-crop acting ensemble thespian efforts- Let's lead with the lead= Mr. Daniel Day-Lewis! His performance as Daniel Plainview was not of plain material. It ranks as one of the best of all time. The power, greed, ego, charisma, and darkness he invokes in the character were of tour-de-force quality. There will be another Best Actor Oscar boy in Mr. Day-Lewis residence! Day-Lewis also won a bald golden boy back in 1996 for his touching performance in ""My Left Foot"". But I will give my left foot or my right one for that matter and guarantee that Daniel will be prized with another Best Actor Oscar for his startling performance in ""There Will Be Blood"". Paul Dano, who played the angst mute teenage son in ""Little Miss Sunshine"", performance as young preacher Eli Sunday spoke volumes. I did ""dunno"" know that Dano had it in him. Paulie, want an Oscar? Hopefully, there will be a Best Supporting Actor nomination for him. Other worthy bloody acting players included Kevin J. O' Connor as Daniel Plainview's ""brother from another mother"" Henry, Ciaran Hinds as Plainview's right hand man Fletcher Hamilton, and of course Dillon Freasier as Mini-Plainview or in other words Daniel's son H.W. Plainview. <br/><br/>There will be prototypical idiosyncratic Paul Thomas Anderson direction- And there is nothing wrong with that! P.T. Anderson is one of the mastermind directors of our generation and he incorporates his typical P.T. directorial themes also in ""There Will Be Blood"". He cerebrally integrates such themes which have been typical of P.T. Anderson films as obsession, egocentricity, dysfunction, greed, love, and plight for freedom in ""There Will Be Blood"" just as he has in his past masterpieces ""Magnolia"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Punch Drunk Love"", and ""Hard Eight"". P.T.'s direction of blood was its centrifugal force of separating the aforementioned themes in the film's various narrative elements. P.T. definitely does not give it p.t. (part-time) to his devotion in directing films. He is the best in the business! There will be a well-deserved Best Director Oscar for the man! <br/><br/>There will be a Best Picture Oscar for ""There Will Be Blood""- Hopefully, that will occur! But obviously there is stiff competition from other selected worthy films that were released in 2007. But there will be prayers that ""There Will Be Blood"" slices up to being selected as the best of the clan! <br/><br/>***** Excellent"
"Ndirsch11","10","1","5","16 January 2008"," ""There Will Be Blood"" is a Masterpiece!
","The first shot we see is that of a barren landscape punctuated by three small hills. There are no trees to be seen anywhere, only grassland. Suddenly, the soundtrack kicks in with the sound of violins reaching a loud crescendo. The sound is creepy and disturbing and just as you can't bear it any longer the music quiets down and then stops. The next few scenes contain almost no dialogue and it's quite some time before the plot kicks in to high gear.<br/><br/>In these first few scenes of ""There Will Be Blood"" great emphasis is placed on creating a feeling of isolation and a sense that madness lies just around the corner. Insanity seems to lurk beneath the surface of every shot and every scene. While watching the film I was reminded of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" which also used creepy violins to create a sense of dread and menace. This uncompromising tone, which is maintained throughout the film, is the key to the film's great success. It's a perfect example of how style can serve to enhance a film's subject matter rather than merely provide a distraction.<br/><br/>At the end of every year one film always pops up out of nowhere and catches me by surprise. ""There Will Be Blood"" is such a film and I'll be frank: this is the best new film I've seen in about four years. It was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who is most famous for directing ""Boogie Nights,"" a film about the porn industry, and ""Magnolia,"" a three hour long epic starring Tom Cruise. Anderson is highly regarded among critics and film fans but has yet to really break out into the mainstream. ""There Will Be Blood"" may change that as it's very likely to do well at the Academy Awards. It will most certainly be talked about for years to come.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" is a big and ambitious film about a man named Daniel Plainview who strikes it big in the oil industry in the first couple of decades of the twentieth century. The story is a very loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel, Oil!, and takes place in California. This is not your standard rags to riches story, however. ""There Will Be Blood"" is essentially a character study, a story about an obsession and how that obsession comes to consume a man's entire life to the point where he's essentially lost his soul in the process.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film we see how Daniel Plainview engages in a desperate quest to find oil deep within the earth's soil. These scenes are appropriately shot with gritty detail. We see Plainview and his men, for instance, crawl down deep man-made chasms in the ground risking their lives in the process. Life at the bottom of these holes is unbearable: all sunlight is blocked out, dirt and grime is everywhere, and the feeling of claustrophobia is enough to drive one crazy. Later, as Plainview strikes oil and begins to build his oil empire, we witness with horror as one of the wells catches on fire. Great streams of fire and smoke reach for the heavens as the sky turns black. These scenes have an intoxicating pull: we're drawn in by the mad quest to find and manage the oil at any cost.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview is played by Daniel Day-Lewis in a truly great performance that is the best I've seen this year. It's no surprise to see that he just won a golden globe award for his performance. Day-Lewis plays the character as a man who always wears a poker face and always guards his speech. He walks with a hunched back and always seems to keep a certain distance from other people. In a rare moment of revelation that takes place about halfway through the film, Plainview reveals the motive behind his demeanor: he hates people. People, as it turns out, always want something from him and he has neither the inclination nor the willpower to help them. He's only interested in himself, his oil, and his money.<br/><br/>There's a fascinating parallel plot here, too, that involves a religious fanatic living on the farm where Plainview is drilling for oil. Paul Dano plays the preacher, Eli Sunday, and his twin brother Paul. Eli Sunday and Daniel Plainview just about hate each other from the moment they first meet. Much of the film is devoted to the nature of their relationship which mostly involves intense jealousy: each one desires what the other has. It's with this secondary plot that the themes of the film really shine through. ""There Will Be Blood"" is essentially about competition and greed.<br/><br/>The narrative arc of ""There Will Be Blood"" deserves comparison with ""Citizen Kane."" Both films are about ambitious men who crave success and money, achieve it, and then realize their success comes at the cost of their humanity. The ending of ""There Will Be Blood"" is likely to generate a great deal of debate. I found it to be brilliant and there's a great monologue delivered by Daniel Day-Lewis that involves a milkshake which I'm sure will be quoted by people for years to come. Don't miss this film. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterpiece."

","The searing score and the character development stick to my head. This movie is a reminder of how easy it is to lose sight of irreplaceable personal assets and relationships. It took me 8 hours to decide if i loved or hated this movie. Summarizing the climaxes and even talking with one stranger, after it was over, about his confusion towards the movies' reason. Going over each scene to give merit to its finale. Profiling protagonists with their inner driven aspirations of godly prospects. Its definitely not for everyone. Some movies hit you with your feelings or wishes of lost and found love stories. Others have a dramatic pull and enthrall you to die and cry. Or the comedic demography they mostly all seek. some try to scare you with your pent up phobic scenarios. Or they entice you with gaudy luxuries and fabricated appeal...no this one...this one knows you. this movie knows what you don't let anyone know or want to know. it hits upon something else inside all of us. That extra mile we sacrifice but pay for in hidden attributes waiting to be unleashed in future references. <br/><br/>TWBB shows all the good it can squeeze out of each character and their lust for the strategic game of life. Persuasion, evangelism, capitalism, settlement, greed, resent, wealth and madness all peak their dirty little heads out and say ""we are here to flourish"". this movie is not for anti capitalism or anti religion, it just show the vigorous process of its mobilization....when i came out i knew i never saw anything like that before. The atmosphere and acting are untouchable. too unique and stamped with question. It's only how you take all the hardboiled messages and interpret its desired meanings. I hated this movie so much that...im going to see it again out of bewildered spite."

","After going to see this film for the second time today, I have changed my verdict from ""Good, not great"" to ""Great, and brilliant."" When I first saw it, I think my expectations were far too high. I was expecting the greatest film of all-time. It's a tremendous film, but it's not that. However, I fully realized its brilliance this second time round.<br/><br/>The score is incredible. This score, along with Atonement, are two of the best I've heard in a long, long time. It completely enhanced the film, and was incredibly engrossing. The cinematography is top-notch, and the direction by PT Anderson is completely unlike anything we've ever seen from him, but it is definitely Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>However, the greatest redeeming quality about this film is the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. In my opinion, it ranks right up there with Gregory Peck, Marlon Brando, and Robert DeNiro. It's almost too difficult to put into words how astonishing he is. He is so engrossing and goes through a dramatic transformation with so much ease and believability. An absolutely unforgettable performance. If he doesn't win the Oscar, it may be the biggest snub of all-time.<br/><br/>This film is epic. I'm not entirely sure if it will go down as a classic, because it may not appeal to enough people to be dubbed as a classic. However, it's without a doubt one of the best films of the year, if not THE best."
"fafilms-1","10","1","5","12 January 2008"," Amazed
","I went to go see this film on a whim. It was playing right down the street, I was bored, I had $10, I decided to go see it. I had heard of ""There Will Be Blood"", but nothing more than a short trailer on TV. The first 15 minutes of the film made me realize this was something special. There is an unexplainable air around this film, it slowly brings you in little by little. The shots, the acting, the feel of the film is simply unique. Honestly I do not know what else to write, I am still in Anderson's trance. All I can say is ""go see it, just go, now!"" I have been on the fence whether or not to continue pursuing a degree in film, asking myself if I have what it takes, if I have the right voice. This film reminded me that amazing and original movies still exist. ""There Will Be Blood"" is definitely one of them."

"drystyx","7","1","6","28 October 2018"," Change of point of view
","There are three major components in this drama about a sadistic oil tycoon who wants to play God with other people's lives.<br/><br/>It begins with the future tycoon (Daniel) surviving a disaster, crawling to safety. From that point onward, he becomes a worshiper of the Devil, not so much in name, but in his worship of Evil. He believes he is a god by virtue of his good fortune.<br/><br/>His sadistic character, which this dark age of Psychiatry likes to pretend is actually a lack of empathy, is actually just pure Sadistic evil in a desire to play God with other people. That is what psychopaths do. We're in the darkest age of Psychiatry and Science that has ever existed among humans.<br/><br/>It's proven when he just arbitrarily decides to treat one twin boy with fairness, and the other with absolute evil, for absolutely no reason. That's the second component of this film. When the second boy greets him with friendship, Daniel immediately sneers the sort of demonic hatred that many of us have found in such people in real life.<br/><br/>The hatred is totally unprovoked. That happens in real life. Daniel just decides to torment this young man and satisfy his devil worshiping lust.<br/><br/>The third component is the point of view. It becomes obvious about two thirds of the way through the film, or at least I thought it was obvious, that the movie was an experiment in point of view, changed from the Disney sort of POV from the fifties.<br/><br/>By that, I mean the usual heroes are never seen. The ""holdout"" family of heroes, who are the film's biggest winners, represent what were once the Swiss Family Robinson, the McCahans, the space family Robinson, all the usual heroic groups.<br/><br/>But we never see them. Instead, we see the other components, from outside their world. However, this is also exactly what the heroic family sees, and it does enable them to be able to combat the evil of Daniel and his demonic force.<br/><br/>One character gets to see all of this, and learn from it. Daniel's adopted son. He becomes a helpless character early on, helpless against the evil of Daniel, and at first tries to fight fire with fire, quite literally. He learns the passive approach. One could say this is a fourth component of the film, but I think of it more as a product of the first three components."
"daren_dressler2008","10","1","6","22 March 2008"," Possibly Greatest Performance Ever?
","Going to see this movie I was a little bit worried. I was worried because I knew how long this movie was and the day before were the Oscar awards, and There Will Be Blood did not win best movie, and instead No Country For Old Men won. I went to see There will Be Blood and I must say that this was the greatest performance every by Daniel Day Lewis. This was an amazing film. It is an emotional roller coaster of a film and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a movie with great acting and a great story line. There are very few problems with this movie except for the fact that it is nearly 3 hours. Even though it is very long it is very good, it is a little bit slow and you have to like that sort of film, but it you do I would recommend seeing it right away."
"Scars_Remain","10","1","6","1 March 2008"," Completely Deserves its Recognition
","This was definitely one of 2007's best films and one of the best in recent years. Though I liked No Country for Old men a bit better, this was still amazing. Anyone who says this film is overrated or just plain bad should really look again because this was completely brilliant and well thought out. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis deserves his Oscar for best actor 100% but all of the other actors were amazing as well. My other two favorites were Dillon Freasier and Paul Dano. The story is very well crafted and has a lot of very good messages hidden. Had No Country for Old Men not been in the running, I think this should have won best picture.<br/><br/>Anyone who loves movies owes it to themselves to see this piece of brilliance. You won't be disappointed if you look hard enough."
"Eumenides_0","10","1","6","25 February 2008"," Best Movie of 2007
","I write this review rejoicing over the fact Daniel Day-Lewis has received the 2007 Oscar for Best Leading Actor. I wish the movie had won more: not having seen No Country For Old Men yet, I rooted for There Will Be Blood all the way. There hasn't been in recent memory a movie that has excelled on so many levels: the writing, acting, editing, cinematography, score, and art direction are just perfect. And on top of technical perfection, this movie is infinitely enjoyable.<br/><br/>With a runtime of 160 minutes, it's incredible how two hours and a half pass by just like that. There Will Be Blood is violent, funny, heartwarming, and absurd. It grabs you and doesn't let go; there are just too many things to hold your attention: Day-Lewis' superb acting as Daniel Plainview, a self-made, ruthless oilman determined to have everything. Helping Day-Lewis was an enviable cast, including Ciarán Hinds, Dillon Freasier and Kevin J. O'Connor. Emphasis goes to Paul Dano, who delivers a performance on par with the one in Little Miss Sunshine. His role as Eli Sunday, an evangelist who struggles to manipulate Plainview for his divine crusade, is great! The conflict between Plainview and Eli throughout the movie is a treat to watch: two equally ruthless men with a craving for power, each trying to have the upper hand over the other. Needless to say the conclusion is bloody.<br/><br/>Then there's the dialogue: I savored every line, every conversation, every speech, every outburst by Plainview. There are entire dialogues that you'll never forget. If Paul Thomas Anderson deserved an Oscar for this movie, it was for the screenplay.<br/><br/>Helping the movie is also Jonny Greenwood's eerie score: I don't know how to explain it, but every time one of his tunes was played, it just took the movie to another level. And then we have Robert Elswit's Oscar-winning cinematography. His work impressed me for its use of unusual angles and long takes, turning small scenes in the movie suspenseful and unique.<br/><br/>The Academy wasn't kind to There Will Be Blood. However I don't think Anderson's movie will need many Oscars to stand the test of time. Day-Lewis' performance is enough to grant it a place in history. But this is a cinematic masterpiece, on the same league as Letters of Iwo Jima and City of God, to be enjoyed in the years to come by millions of film lovers."
"Johnny279","10","1","6","25 February 2008"," One of the best films I've ever seen
","I decided to see There Will Be Blood for a few reasons. For one, it was nominated for 8 Oscars, secondly it ranked #23 on the IMDb top 250, and thirdly, the type of film was something completely different from the types I normally see, and I was keen to try it out.<br/><br/>The entire film was surprisingly easy to follow, with the help of the brilliant acting of the cast as well as the great storyline. Paul Dano's performance as a young priest in the powerful church scenes was superb, keeping me literally pinned to my seat! Dillon Freasier played the character H.W. Plainview very well also, especially considering this was his first ever t.v/cinema performance. But Daniel Day-Lewis' performance was just unforgettable and each scene he was in enthralled me.<br/><br/>Overall, it's one of the best films I've ever seen, and considering I'm one for thrillers and comedies usually, it just goes to show how incredible this movie is. Not a minute of this 2½ hour masterpiece was wasted.<br/><br/>Also, I'm very pleased that Daniel Day-Lewis won Best Actor at the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and The Academy Awards, as it was probably the greatest acting performance I've ever seen. Whilst I haven't seen No Country For Old Men, I think that There Will Be Blood would've been a worthy winner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards."
"jpongin-bf3","10","1","6","25 February 2008"," Oh My God!
","There Will Be Blood was by far the best film I've seen in the past five years.<br/><br/>Most of my opinions were echoed by other comments here, but the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis was so brilliant, so raw, and so captivating that I just have to say it again here. They say that Daniel prepared a year for this role, and it has paid off. Daniel nurtured and grew his character scene by scene to what would ultimately become a grotesque, ugly, angry, paranoid, and border-line psychopathic old man. The entire transformation or growing of Daniel Plainview was done with such perfection of acting skill and talent that an Oscar win must be immanent, and it will be a performance referenced to for decades if not centuries to come. Daniel Day-Lewis literally gave a ""perfect"" performance.<br/><br/>Another aspect I'd like to comment on is the soundtrack. Some people say the soundtrack was ""uncomfortable"" and ""unusual"", but I felt that the soundtrack was more accurate and fitting. Every time Daniel Plainview realized why he hated humanity when he felt he was being lied to, betrayed, swindled, or threatened by competition you can FEEL it in the soundtrack. You can feel the seed of his hatred grow with each moment he interacted with his sellers and partners through the music. It was absolutely beautiful in my opinion.<br/><br/>For any actor out there, this film, and more importantly, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance must be dissected and studied carefully.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a master-piece, and you must watch it if you enjoy great films."
"Shoola","10","1","6","24 February 2008"," Powerful stuff.
","Powerful stuff. A disturbing performance from Daniel Day Lewis, uncomfortable to watch and hard to forget. At the end of the film I felt that I knew this character and was glad that actually I didn't. All the other actors offered good support but it was the central performance that makes this. Even without speaking he so totally conveys the character of Plainview with his expressions and body language,that the long sections without speech are just as strong as the carefully delivered words.<br/><br/>Excellently paced, I read one critic who felt that this dragged in the middle but I found even the slowness of the action absorbing, and the length gave it a kind of epic build to the act that the title suggest. The guy who played Ely Sunday was just perfect too, just irritating enough so that you knew where this was going. Great film."

","Somebody out there in Hollywood is getting the message that we, as a movie going audience, have had enough of comic book characters on the big screen. At least I hope so anyway. This is movie making magic right here. A compelling story, Oscar caliber acting and all the other bells and whistles that make for great motion pictures. Daniel Day Lewis does an amazing job of bringing the character Daniel Plainview to life. His performance was so intense that you can tell that he immersed himself in the idea of being this man on the screen. I have heard some complaints about the musical score, but I found it to be perfect. The haunting and almost alien sounds that were coming out of the speakers created the perfect mood to go along with the mind blowing movie. I actually said out loud to myself a few times ""Oh man, that music is f'd up, I love it!"" Don't miss this one folks, it's terrific and gives me renewed hope that Hollywood is on the right track."
"reini-2","10","1","6","23 February 2008"," References to Eureka and 2001
","Similar to epic storyline of Nicholas Roeg's ""Eureka"" (1982-84), this is one of the most interesting epics in the last decades. In the first speechless quarter I waited for the ""2001""-like jump-cut to something referring to the famous bone being thrown into the air, merging to the spaceship with the Richard Strauss music. Well, ""There will be blood""'s music is more effective, and its story doesn't need such artificial separations into three different parts. The magic is the same. The raising oil-blood is even more effective than the bone scene.<br/><br/>Finally we are over the realism of the last 20 years, 60-80's overpowering film rhetorics always influenced P.T. Anderson more than contemporary colleagues. Scorsese might be a Coppola Wannabe, Anderson is the real master. And Anderson thankfully didn't made any references to the dreadful 50-style epics, which other critics always refer to."

The presence of Arvo Part's 'Fratres' on the soundtrack was also a joyful surprise. Its epic scope of storytelling is of biblical scale and whispers 'rosebud, rosebud!' and I urge you with with every cinema loving bone in my body to see this film and fall in love with its genius.

","Don't go out for popcorn when watching this movie, every scene is important. The movie is slow at times but uses that time to develop the characters. Daniel Day Lewis character is very apparent, but it's the supposed ""good"" that is far more evil than what is apparent. I really don't want to make any more comments because the movie should be seen with out any additional information. I saw this movie with 6 people and the reactions were from 10 to zero. Some people took offense because of their beliefs and others just wanted more action. The evil that is portrayed is very sad because of the affect on the people who the evil is directed toward. One of our viewers wanted resolution and was disappointed because he felt that there wasn't any. I think he was looking for the good and evil and in this movie it's only evil."

The directing is superb. The landscape is breathtaking. You see the dark side of the human soul, hypocrisy, greed etc. and what they do just to survive in the movie.

I actually expected to see a lot more blood in TWBB, yet there were two murders.

"jon.h.ochiai","9","1","6","14 February 2008"," Uncompromising ""Blood""
","In a telling confession Daniel Day-Lewis's Daniel Plainview says, ""I see the worst in people"" The paradox is that you can't fool a man immersed in his own darkness. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazingly powerful as oilman Plainview in Director and Screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson's stark and unforgiving ""There Will Be Blood"". Day-Lewis is uncompromising as a man, who forfeits his very soul for wealth and power, with his eyes wide-open. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis will win the Oscar. Based on the novel ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair, ""There Will Be Blood"" tells the story of oilman Daniel Plainview at the turn of the 20th century. Daniel and his son H.W. (Dillion Freasier) forge an oil empire in California, but at the greatest of costs.<br/><br/>Running at almost 2 hours and 40 minutes ""There Will Be Blood"" is engrossing storytelling. ""There Will Be Blood"" runs too long, dragging on in the middle. It is easy to despise and dismiss Daniel as an inhumane beast; however, it is the vestiges of humanity from Day-Lewis's performance and Paul Thomas Anderson's layered narrative that makes his decline into the abyss profoundly sad. There is an electrifying moment when Daniel screams, ""I've abandoned my boy!"" You may have heard that the ending is brutally shockingwell, it is. However, it is strangely in context with character. Thomas Hardy said character is fate.<br/><br/>A weird integrity is at play: Daniel Plainview is enraged and ruthless throughout. However, he is the only character that remains true to himself. Daniel also can spot a liar a mile away. This dynamic fuels the force of wills between Daniel and local church prophet Eli Sunday (insufferably pious and duplicitous Paul Dano). Director Anderson brilliantly disguises the surface as the conflict of faith, but is really about avarice. Robert Elswit's cinematography is breathtaking. Johnny Greenwood's musical score is almost a character itself evoking tension and grating nerves.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" evolves the story of Daniel and his son H.W. as they acquire land leases and drill for oil in ""Little Boston"" in turn of the century California. There Daniel begins his empire, and clashes with evangelical Eli Sunday (Dano), whose motives may not be so transparent. Daniel also apparently reunites with his long lost half-brother Henry (good Kevin J. O'Connor). Daniel strikes oil and personal tragedy. Day-Lewis as Daniel is unnervingly chilling in a scene where he leaves the local train station. ""There Will Be Blood"" explores the aftermath of the tragedy, and more poignantly the choices Daniel makes as he gradually relinquishes his very soul. There is blood, and more blood.<br/><br/>Aside from some welcome brevity, Paul Thomas Anderson direction and narrative are nearly masterful. However, none of this would work without the commanding performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It seems that Daniel Day-Lewis revives from movie hibernation every 4 or 5 years to submit a stunning Oscar performance. He is powerful. Day-Lewis as Daniel is no saint nor is he a good man deep down. However, as portrayed by Day-Lewis we can never dismiss him as a monster, because we see his humanity gradually get beaten of him partly from circumstance and mostly by his own doing. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance absolutely compels, and ultimately provokes a profound sadness. ""There Will Be Blood"" is disturbing and uncompromising work that is well worth watching."
"faraaj-1","10","1","6","12 February 2008"," Flawed masterpiece
","There Will Be Blood was a memorable viewing experience and like Apocalypse Now, I'll remember this as a classic epic but ultimately a flawed masterpiece. A gripping film from the start although the first words aren't spoken until 12-15 minutes into the film, this is essentially a character study of a greedy prospector sacrificing everything for money and power and in the process losing any vestige of love or humanity that may have existed in some dark recess of his soul.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning. The attention to period detail in the dusty oil towns, the clothes, the oil derrick is perfect. Daniel Day-Lewis, great actor that he is, gives his career best performance as Daniel Plainview - a charismatic, conniving and determined man who we find at the start of the film (1898) working alone in a silver mine. The film charts his rise (and fall) over the next 29 years and his many clashes with Eli Sunday, a evangelical preacher who to Plainview is simply a false prophet, God being merely a superstition for the materialistic oil-man. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance holds the film together and the closest film I could compare it to is DeNiro in Taxi Driver, another fascinating character study.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood has its fair share of violence and amorality with lives lost in oil wells, a blow-out deafening Plainview's son, and of course Plainview's clashes with Sunday. The first physical clash is completely unexpected and shocking as Plainview becomes increasingly drunk and nasty through the course of the film. The second is almost comical and Lewis' best piece of acting in the film - when practicality has to bow before the church. The last, in the end, is what destroys the authenticity and gripping power of the preceding two and a half hours. Plainview's coldness towards his helpless, damaged child is one of the most affecting and disturbing things I've ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>There were many ways to end the film. The one chosen by Anderson was perhaps the weakest. Throughout the lead up to the film, its obvious that the craftsman of the film is a genius. Why he chose to end such a magnificent film this way is a mystery to me. However, I think comparisons to Citizen Kane and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre are valid, because this is a film that will be remembered for a long time."

","...greed,duplicity,soul-killing,revenge and VOLUME. Not all in that order,of course.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson's been somewhat of an odd duck when it comes to film subjects. Here is the order of what he's assayed so far: gambling addiciton(HArd Eight),the pornography industry,circa the late 1970s and early 1980s(Boogie Nights),the LA middle class scene(Magnolia)and the odd,inward social awkwardness of romance between two people who have major issues(Punch-Drunk Love). And now we have...the Oil prospecting trade of turn of the 20th century California,cribbed at least in spirit from Upton Sinclair's muckraking book ""Oil!"". So much for discernible patterns in film-making,huh?<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis,in only his third movie role since 1997,and breathing fire through much of this,as usual)is very much the model of the ""robber baron"" capitalist of his era:shrew,savvy,driven and maybe more than a little sociopathic. He has no life outside of work,and he works very hard,first as a gritty prospector then,as he is able to stake his fortune on land claims,as a salesman toward developing untapped oil fields through much of the western United States. When he lands down in New Boston,a dusty rural community in central California,he is able to sell a religiously devout community on drilling up their arid,unfertile fields,primarily getting the rights from the pious(and possibly brutal)Sunday family,led by the charismatic Eli(Paul Dano,in an awesome breakthrough role!). A deal is brokered to set the wheels in motion for Plainview's drilling,but figuring the nature of this business and Plainview's very skewed,removed persona,that deal is ripe for being dishonored.<br/><br/>A two-and-a-half hour film that uses probably only 2/3 of it for dialog(including the nearly mute opening twenty minutes),Anderson's film--which he also wrote--is a test in patience as much as it is a template for acting and character study. Since the action in this movie is at a steady,almost monotonous pace(not to mention the sexual element of this film is nearly nil),and the characters take a while to reach emotional crescendo,some viewers will be turned off by this very casual journey to discovery. DAy-Lewis is as good as advertised as the central figure,but save for him,Dano,Kevin O'Connor(as someone who may or may not be from PLainview's past) and,perhaps,PLainview's adopted son(Dillon Freasier,a quiet study in unforced presence),this show is mostly full of ancillary characters who fill out necessary scenes but have little development. Bottom line:as unique and well-realized as this story and film is,it is a demanding movie that expects the viewer to come prepared to want what it has to offer,just as badly as the viewer is going to expect the movie to give it entertainment(if not more so). <br/><br/>I give this movie high marks for the individuality and intelligence it offers,but would hold back on it as a whole movie because,for all it offers on artistic merit,it still feels just a tad hollow. Maybe that was intentional,but then that would make this offering much more for the discriminating tastes than for the casual viewer. THere's a lot this film has to offer,and much of it comes from the product of actions as much as motivations(hence my summary line). Lewis' performance ranks among his best,and if one can appreciate fully that AND the meditation being offered,then one will feel truly rewarded by ""There Will be Blood"". A strong nine(or perhaps a weak ten)out of ten stars."

","Horrific movie. VERY hard to watch. I almost walked out three times during the film. The film is boring. It has basically no story line. I could sum up the entire movie in a three minute conversation and not miss anything. However, with that being said - the film is a masterpiece. Daniel Day-Lewis was... how can I put this... well I think he might be the greatest actor that ever lived. As much as I would like to see Johnny Depp take home an Oscar I think that he will have tough competition in Daniel Day-Lewis. Paul Dano who I've seen in a few movies and thought he was pretty good did an AMAZING job in this film. I would have liked to have seen his name on the Oscar nomination ballot for supporting actor for this one. The directing and the acting was absolutely superb and flawless. The movie was amazing but there is NO WAY I will ever watch this movie again - I suffered enough the first time!"

I can understand why people may feel that way as it is a long movie, but cutting it down by even 5 minutes could have ruined what is a captivating story. You will be pulled into every scene and every moment and when the truly powerful scenes come you will be blown away. The direction and cinematography stand out and everything is delivered very well.

","Oil, oil, oil. That black, sticky liquid. That liquid that we love and hate. Oil is our girlfriend, our boyfriend, our mother, our father. Oil is us. Is as important as the water we drink, as the air we breath. As our blood. Oil is, in this case, our blood. Set in the middle of the XXI century, the film centers on the commercial war of ""oilmen"" trying to find their own peace of the underground pie of the US. One of this men is Daniel Plainview, who comes to a small town on the middle of nowhere to do his drilling and selling, along with his 9 year old son, H.W. Plainview. Soon, he faces to his enemy: Eli Sunday, the local preacher, whose only intention is to extract as much money out of Plainview as possible to build up his church. That's about the story. Actually, the film's tang line says it all: ""When Ambition meets Faith"" And that's apparently it, the fight of two very different yet equal at the end men to win the heart of million people. And just for this we give an 8.7 and 8 Oscars? Not quite yet... It has been known that Paul Thomas Anderson has been influenced by other great directors, like Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. I have seen almost all PTA films, and I don't feel a flash black to these two. Except in this one. There are just some scenes in this film, that, somehow, connect with The Last Temptation of Christ!! And then we go to the really big thing: like it happens in all his films, the important is not so much the story, but the CHARACTERS in the story. I can't explain yet the Dirk Digler/Amber Waves relationship in Boogie Nights, Magnolia has really big up and downs, and Punch Drunk Love doesn't exist if it's not for Barry Egan. And this one... How can we define Daniel Plainview? Is he ""good"" or ""bad"" How can we define Eli Sunday? What is evil? Under the Oscar awarded performance of Daniel Day Lewis, Daniel Plainview is a man with a lot of hate in his bones, who hates everyone including him. However, he manages to cover that hate under a blanket of ambition, that could initially represent a monster, but... is he? To explain this factors, there is not a better solution that to see the film. See it. Just do. And when you do, you will get this."
"kjewitt","8","1","7","28 February 2008"," Great but occasionally not good
","A difficult film to watch and difficult to sum up. Daniel Day-Lewis is as great as the Oscar suggests, portraying greed and lust for power in a way that I don't think I've ever seen before. I hated the character, but the writing gave him just enough vulnerability to make sure that he didn't cease to be human. The weirdest thing about the rich and powerful is their inability to stop when they've got enough and this was perfectly brought to life. I felt Paul Dano was a bit overrated - he looked great but I felt his performance was just what I would expect from any competent actor. Ciaran Hinds and the rest of the cast were underused and never really came to life. The music was great in parts, but occasionally overdone. The first part of the film was perhaps the most daunting I've ever seen - an extraordinary sense of foreboding - a feeling of the fragility and awfulness of life. I haven't put that very well but watch and you'll know what I mean. My main niggles are the lack of any real characters other than DDL, and the overuse of the religious subplot. I felt that the preacher was given too big a role. The overwriting of this aspect suggested that the story was about commerce v religion, which it wasn't really. Nonetheless, I'm glad that people can still make films like this - Hollywood needs to be reminded that it's not just about money. The monstrous greed of Daniel Plainview could serve as a metaphor for a Hollywood bigshot's worldview, as well an oilman, a dictator etc etc."
"meriden_ct","10","1","7","28 February 2008"," A masterpiece!
","Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is an act of genius and one for the ages. He shows us so much in this character who changes, gradually, from a hardworking everyman that one roots for, to a villain one is repulsed by. How does he do it? I simply don't know. The behavior is all so believable and integrated.<br/><br/>What strikes me as especially brilliant about Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is the way in which he has combined slowly moving, drawn-out, sparse scenes and notes of music, barely creeping camera movements, and frequently black, silhouetted figures, all of which serve to build tension and support the imagery of oil seeping underground everywhere.<br/><br/>Of course, the oil is a perfect symbol of the blackness that seeps into Daniel Plainview's heart inexorably, over the years, until finally it is saturated. When it is finished, there is no humanity left in Plainview because the two substances cannot occupy the same space.<br/><br/>It's a story to brood over, as difficult to get off your mind as it would be to clean the oil out of the dirt, or the blackness out of Plainview's heart. One wonders, how it could have been avoided. It seems so inevitable. I guess it would take a saint to combat the ferocity of a Daniel Plainview. The naive, and ultimately, weak-willed, country preacher, Eli Sunday, beautifully portrayed by Paul Dano, was not an equal match, according to the author. Although, indirectly, you might say that Sunday contributes to Plainview's downfall more than anyone, except for Plainview himself."

","I have a lot of desires to watch this film since i knew that PTA was working in it. The last Friday was finally released in Mexico City due to the Oscars but i was pretty surprised that is only in about 10 theaters in all the city. To make a comparison, the film ""Vantage Point"" is in about 50 theaters, it's a real shame. Anyway, today i finally have the chance to watch this film in the an art theater and i love it.<br/><br/>Set in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the film follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an oil man who finds the success in the oil business in California by 1911. When Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) tells Daniel that his family's property in Little Boston have oil, Daniel decide to go to Little Boston to buy the property and the rest of the houses near to ensure the manage of the oil in Little Boston. So we are going to see the change of Daniel when finally finds the total success and how he must deal with universal themes as family, religion and his own greed.<br/><br/>The script of this brilliant film was based upon the 1927 novel ""Oil!"" by Upton Sincalir and is a great story of a man who change everything for money. First he is a normal man who has a partner a kid named H.W. who was helped by Daniel after the dead of his father. They reminds the 1921 film ""The Kid"" in which Chaplin have an orphan kid as a partner of his work. They try to sell the American Dream to the people but, in accordance of Daniel's rise, he is has a total different personality of at least he can act as he wants and yes, there will be blood. The rest of the characters represents universal themes as religion or family. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano too) is the represent of religion as a prophet who plays with people's faith and doesn't support his own father when and says to him: ""God doesn't save stupid people."" In the end that same phrase can resume Eli. And the family plays another important role in the film, Danile finds the son he doesn't have in H.W. and they become real family. Later when his half-brother Henry appears, he feel remorse because of his past with his real family. But actually during the film we can't see any real member of Daniel's family and he loose for money those who replace his real family.<br/><br/>And all with a beautiful cinematography with some very dark scenes and others with the sunshine. The recreation of the period is amazing just as the superb cast. Daniel Day-Lewis is memorable like his character and in his case that Oscar really means what it supposed to mean, yes Day-Lewis has the best performance of the year. For me he is just like in ""Gangs of New York"" as Bill the Butcher. And the other main role is played in a superb way by the young Paul Dano. I have only seen Dano in ""Little Miss Sunshine"", in which he was good but he really grow up a lot in acting to make this very difficult role.<br/><br/>Conclusion: i love this film, i haven't watch all the films of PTA but by now this is my third favourite and one of my favourites of 2007. A memorable story with epic sizes filmed in a perfect way. It's long, 158 minutes, but it doesn't feels to be that long. Well i'm going to drink a milkshake. 10 out of 10<br/><br/>PS: the Mexican title is ""Petroleo Sangriento"", that means ""Bloody Oil."""

"mrtimlarabee","10","1","7","28 January 2008"," An excellent study of greed, corruption, and pure evil
","On the surface, There Will Be Blood looks like a historical account of the cutthroat oil business at the turn of the 20th century. However, one needs to remember that this is a work of fiction with a historical backdrop. Then you need to remember that this is the work of Paul Thomas Anderson.<br/><br/>The opening sequence sets the tone for the film, as a lone oil man drills for oil. It's a physically laborious task and Anderson carefully takes the time to show us what it is these men do. A good amount of the first reel has no dialogue, just showing the work, set to a haunting score. We now know we aren't watching a typical historical film.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Daniel Plainview and his son. Daniel has received a tip about land on the Sunday ranch which may contain vast amounts of oil. He goes up with his son to investigate and once he has found the tip was worth its weight in gold, he relentlessly pursues every piece of land nearby, cutting questionable deals left and right. His relentlessness will result in tragedies, and yes, as the title implies, there will be blood.<br/><br/>Anderson is not doing a film about oil. The oil stands for something much greater. It's much like gold and in essence greed. What is one man willing to set aside in order to be successful. About halfway through the film, Daniel shares a conversation with his alleged brother that gets to the core of Daniel.<br/><br/>Anderson's direction is excellent, though varied from his other works. He usually relies on a good sized ensemble cast, but this film rests primarily on the shoulders of Daniel Day Lewis, who has got the hustle and bustle dealing of an oil man down so well, you might be misled by some of the things he says. He's perfect and his performance is definitely Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Equally noteworthy is Paul Dano, who plays an older child on the Sunday ranch named Eli, who seeks just payment for the land to help build his church where he is considered a spiritual healer. He is looked upon questionably by Daniel, who many times shows his disdain for Eli.<br/><br/>The universal themes in this film transcend the historical context of the film. In many ways now and in the past, oil is a symbol for greed. Anderson uses Daniel to explore this concept with great detail. The careful study of greed and evil comes to a dramatic conclusion that is quintessential Paul Thomas Anderson. The closing of this film sets this film apart from other works of historical fiction in that Anderson has no qualms about showing the (sometimes ugly)nature of his characters."
"Daberglar10","10","1","7","27 January 2008"," Disturbingly Good
","I just saw this movie and I have to say it was incredible. Daniel Day Lewis gives I think the best performance of his life. Better than My Left Foot. In my opinion one of the greatest performances of all time and definitely the best of this century so far. He fully embraced this role and completely transformed into the awful, despicable and just plain evil character that was Daniel Plainview. The score was so haunting and created such an eerie feeling that you knew some terrible things were to come. The direction was superb in the fact that you never lost that uncomfortable feeling when day lewis was on screen. Anderson created a world that embodied a man's ruthless pursuit of money, power and control of what he thought was rightfully his. The opening scene was great because you didn't get any sense of Plainview's true character. He seemed like a normal person who did a selfless thing in taking in the child of a dead man. I think this is where the score was so key because it prevented you from feeling calm or at ease with this man or his situation. I loved the progression of Plainview's character throughout the movie. He became more soulless and kept on getting glimpses of his true ruthless nature. The secondary characters were great as well. Dano as the evangelic preacher and Plainview's son did a fantastic job as well. I expect great things from Dano as he matures as an actor. You could just feel his cowardice every time he was near Day Lewis's character. I could go on and on about this movie it was fantastic. Very disturbing and not a movie you can just flop in the DVD player, but truly brilliant."
"MulhollandRob","10","1","7","25 January 2008"," The Best Film of 2007
","Bold, ambitious, and macabre, Paul Thomas Anderson's, There Will Be Blood is a unique and unforgettable experience. A terrifying character study of one man's greed and ego, and played with immense and uncanny intensity by the amazing and brilliant Daniel Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood is a masterful and allegorical study of capitalism, oil, power, and faith at the turn of the 20th century. In the astonishing opening, we see nothing but a series of gorgeous shots of an uninviting landscape. There is no dialog, just ominous images of a landscape. On the soundtrack (scored by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood) we hear a discord getting higher and higher until we see the wordless quest by Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis in a Oscar winning performance), who's inside a hole in the lower ground of the landscape looking for silver. <br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a masterful American character study, as Daneil Plan view, Day-Lewis brings the madness of a ruthless, egomaniac oil tycoon. <br/><br/>With a innovative narrative structure like The Assassination of Jesse James, There Will Be Blood has a sprawling narrative structure that chronicles three decades, begging at the end of the 19th century and ending in the 1920's. In the beginning of the film Plainview's quest for silver leads him to a huge discovery and fortune of oil. He's obsessed with wealth and prosperity, and his vision can only be understood and pieced together hours after seeing the movie. He has son named H.W. (Dillon Freasier) that he uses as a disguise to convince people that he's a family man so he can drill wherever he wants. He even lets his son ear in the business meetings. <br/><br/>In one of the meetings Daniel Plainview and his right hand man Fletcher (Hinds) encounters a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano from Little Miss Sunshine), who informs Daniel about a huge chunk of land that sits on top of an enormous sea of oil. Majority of the film's running time depicts Plainview conquest for triumph and wealth, and Paul's frequent feud with Paul's identical twin brother Eli, a preacher in the towns local church called the Church of the Third Revelation. <br/><br/>This type of turmoil between the two men leads to a psychological standoff, and raises ambiguous questions if Paul and Eli are really identical twins or the same person because Eli becomes a two-faced enemy and rival to Planview. Their stand-off defines the rich themes and ideas of There Will Be Blood, one of a greedy and ruthless entrepreneur, and a self-serving, maniacal evangelical. Both men are obsessed, both are egotistic, both want to be on top. <br/><br/>In the midst of their problems, Planviews son H.W. suffers a tragedy that alters their relationship forever. A man, Henri (Kevin J O'Connor) arrives into town claiming to be Plainview's long, lost half-brother, and Plainview begins to up to his brother in a mesmerizing monologue stating ""I have a competition in me; I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people. There are times I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I've built up my hatreds over the years little by little. I see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I want to earn enough money so I can get away from everyone I can't keep doing this on my own, with these people."" <br/><br/>Henri becomes the only person that Planview begins to open up to, only for it to be revealed that Henri is a fraud. The betrayal leads Planview to a downward spiral and he lives a life of an isolated misanthrope, he has disdain for humanity, and he lives on and gets rich enough to accomplish his goal of getting away from everyone. <br/><br/>As for There Will Be Blood technically, its beautifully and brilliantly crafted, its a true work of art. The production design by Jack Fisk, who's worked on all of Terrence Malick's films and David Lynch movies, is rich, meticulous, and ravishing. Robert Elswit's widescreen cinematography is sweeping and well-composed. Anderson's trademark tracking shots and long takes are awe-inspiring, and the framing and composition are all beautifully composed. <br/><br/>There's a dark majesty to There Will Be Blood, and the conclusion will leave many scratching their heads like they did with No Country For Old Men. The conclusion is a bit over-the-top and theatrical, but its one o those endings that works thematically, yet execution will leave many baffled and perplexed. <br/><br/>Still there's no denying There Will Be Blood works as a rich piece of art, it disturbs, provokes, and challenges. In the finale Planview has alone last stand off with Eli, and its highly theatrical, but probable. Its the finale that's going to divide many, as for myself i;m in the middle about and I really want to see this movie again and reevaluate it. <br/><br/>In the end , There Will Blood profoundly suggests how individualism is what built this country, yet now its no longer embraced in our society. Plainview's ambitions and greed led to self-destruction. He lost all fundamentals of human values like hope, love, and community. His greed dissolved into something destructive and self-serving. <br/><br/>That's what makes Blood such a terrifying and fascinating experience is Anderson's refusal to rationalize Plainview. In the end There Will Be Blood will baffle and disturb many, and like all great works of art this film intruded my consciousness like my favorite movie of last year INLAND EMPIRE, and There Will Be Like like INLAND EMPIRE is a rare, gripping, and masterful movie that doesn't come around to often. <br/><br/>Rating **** out of **** A Masterpiece!!!"

"nycmec","9","1","7","7 January 2008"," An American Epic
","This film pulls together three key elements of American mythology--the West, capitalism, and religion. It is an incredibly ambitious film, which doesn't operate by making statements about these elements, but juxtaposes them to provide the audience with a chance to ponder their relationship--that is, until the end, where an over-the-top, and overly simplified final scene brings the movie to an unsatisfying end.<br/><br/>But, up until the last 15 minutes, the film takes one's breath away. And it could not be so without Daniel Day-Lewis' fine portrayal of a misanthropic oil man. He is both hero (for holding out against the monopoly of Standard Oil) and villain (for his treatment of his son, and the townspeople). He is not wholly bad, but one realizes that his good deeds ultimately are in service of his greed, and, paradoxically, are a function of his hatred of others and his desire to ultimately be alone.<br/><br/>The other acting is good as well, especially Dillon Freasier in the role of Day-Lewis's son, H.W. I felt that Paul Dano was outmatched by Day-Lewis (who wouldn't be?). Whereas Day-Lewis played magnificently the juxtaposition of irony and sincerity in his ""conversion"" scene, I felt Dano tilted too much towards an ironic portrayal in his early scenes as an evangelical preacher. Yes, we do find out in the end that he was a charlatan, but, in order for him to gain a following, he would have had to come across as more charismatic in his preaching scenes. And there is the problem of his looking and acting the same as an older man in the problematic final scene.<br/><br/>The score was amazing. Many film scores just linger in the background, having more of an unconscious effect. This score constantly intruded, sometimes contradicting the action, sometimes reaching a climax before the filmed image did, which helps to heighten the uneasy feeling of danger one must have felt working on an oil rig at the time. The use of silence, especially in the opening scene, where we just observe Day-Lewis alone as a prospector, was very effective. The cinematography was beautiful, and the film was a pleasure to watch."

The problem is that I could have just gone for a walk or something, which would have been exactly like real life, only far less annoying.<br/><br/>A note on the music: I think the reason that they used a horror film soundtrack for this movie is that it keeps giving the viewer the subconscious idea that something really eventful is about to happen. Every time I started getting so bored that I was ready to turn it off, suddenly this obnoxious noise would blare out of the speakers, planting me in my seat, making me wait for something to happen. Two hours later, I was still waiting, but I figured I might as well just finish it on the off chance that, perhaps, that two and a half hours really was building up to something spectacular.

"Presumptuous","10","1","8","18 March 2008"," ""There Will Be Blood"", a Cinematic Epic
","Paul Thomas Anderson's ingenious breathtaking thrill ride ""There Will be Blood"", is a gorgeous, thought provoking piece of cinematic beauty for all to cherish and enjoy. Although there have been many brilliant films and performances to have come out in 2007, ""There Will be Blood"" has out shined them all with its deep heart wrenching plot and bleak outlook on the early 20th century oil industry and production. Adapted from Upton Sinclair's masterpiece novel ""Oil!"" Anderson colorfully illustrates greed, religion, corruption, and ambition that the novel so desperately tried to communicate to its reader's decades ago. <br/><br/>What made this powerful story come together so beautifully was the superb performance by Daniel Day-Lewis who portrays the ruthless money making knave, Daniel Plainview. At first you feel compassion for Plainview's agonizing attempts for success in such a rough and risky business. But as the story unfolds you begin to see how truly selfish and cold-hearted this man is and what horrors he is capable of. Other dazzling performances are delivered from ""Little Miss Sunshine's"" Paul Dano who zestfully conjures up one of the most charismatic religious fanatics you'll ever witness as he teeters on the brink of insanity and religious obsession. Even Dillon Freasier who is only the age of 12, gives a fantastic performance as Plainview's son, H.W. who is neglected and mistreated by his cruel and psychotic Father. <br/><br/>What brings such a powerful and exquisitely intimate atmosphere to the film were the chilling cinematography and the realism that embraces this powerful epic. The films pragmatism is something so strong; you can almost taste the dusty wind from the arid, vast landscapes and feel the mud on your face and in your fingertips. It vividly describes with flawlessness the gritty, harsh, and lonely life of men desperately trying to make a living in something so raw and real. The scenes sculptures infinite beauty and utter fascination that paints richness that words cannot describe but causes you to stare in a breathless state of wonder. <br/><br/>The substance that really makes this film so beautiful is not just the breathtaking scenes alone for they're only a backdrop. It's the holy roller show down between Eli Sunday (Dano) and Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) that makes this shining star spectacular. The scenes between these two driving individuals will make you squirm in your seat as you watch them battle it out in shouting matches or through glares and stares in complete unsettling silence that stiffens the air. The film also has some of the most memorable quotes, having everyone constantly saying; ""Idrink your milkshake!"" is making this phrase become a pop culture phenomena. <br/><br/>""There will be Blood"" is 2007's film of the year. It's beautiful, it's brilliant, it's breathtaking beyond compare, and most of all its deep in ways most films can only scratch the surface of and lack in. Although the film missed out on best picture at the Oscars, this movie has won my heart. But take note this film is an intense, emotionally draining experience that means its tag line; ""there will be greed, there will be vengeance"" to its full potential."
"albert-wayne","10","1","8","13 March 2008"," To quote Vincent Vega: Damn, that's a pretty bleep good milkshake
","This is without a doubt the best movie of 2007, it's not only a movie with one of the best male performances of all time, but it's just a complete masterpiece, Paul Thomas Anderson has created a time less epic, the sorts we've not seen in a long time...(read more), it's right up there with such pillars as Citizen Kane, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Raging Bull.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is such a complex story, about greed, morality, family, religion and hate. The adaptation of the novel Oil! by Paul Thomas Anderson is a force to be reckon with, it's clearly one of the best screenplays written in the past 20 years. The story holds similarities with such great titles as Citizen Kane, Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Raging Bull. When I started hearing critics compare the film to these, especially to Citizen Kane, I was intrigued, what film could deserve such comparison, but then I saw it, and immediately agreed, this film is destined to become a classic.<br/><br/>The other incredible element of the film is the direction of again, Paul Thomas Anderson, the man behind Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch Drunk-Love. I used to consider him a director that was in the brink of a massive out burst of greatness. Boogie Nights was a fantastic head turner, but ultimately the Martin Scorsese cover direction became a much to great a shadow to overcome. Magnolia and Punch Drunk-Love were definitely great, off beat films that revealed his other interest in classic cinema, such as Jonathan Demme, and Robert Altman. But here, with There Will Be Blood, Anderson has created a massive work of art that exceeds in originality and unrelenting passion for film making that is translated into every single frame. The movie's tone, atmosphere, epic canvass, the story telling, everything is just an example of what a great director with encyclopedic knowledge of film can accomplish, it ranks with the works of Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles & Martin Scorsese. The direction is so sober, so patient, yet so determined and unyielding, it does not compromise anything for the sake of audience enjoyment, every single element is in the service of the story.<br/><br/>As for the performances, despite it being a very rich film with lots of characters, it really ends up being a Daniel Day-Lewis vehicle to show all of what he can accomplish as an actor, and probably, everything that an actor can accomplish. The performance is just so commanding, so overwhelming, is one of those performances that creates legends, like Brando's Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire and Vito Corleone in The Godfather, like Bogart's Rick Blaine in Casablanca, like Gable's Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind, like De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, like Pacino's Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Tony Montana in Scarface and Col. Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman, Day-Lewis performance is the stuff of legends. After we thought he had done such a performance in Scorsese's Gangs of New York, which he did, he comes here and tops himself, in every which way possible. His character is one of the most puzzling, challenging characters since probably Orson Welles Charles Foster Kane, and even though he is not an enigma as Kane, he is just as complex and mesmerizing, and such a commanding screen presence due to the numerous mannerisms and speech patterns, the performance is just magnificent. However, Day-Lewis is not the only actor of the show, Little Miss Sunshine's Paul Dano is also exceptional, managing to stand toe to toe against Day-Lewis, something that as DiCaprio proved in Gangs of New York, is a very difficult feat to pull off, but Dano manages to create such an interesting and twisted character, that still puzzles probably as much as Day-Lewis character.<br/><br/>The production value of the film is certainly without question, the gargantuan work of cinematographer Robert Elswit is palpable on every scene, the intense use of low lighting, using only fire as source of light, as well as the use of the sun, the natural lighting, and the special 43mm Pathe Lenses for color shifting at corners, it's the stuff we have not seen since movies by David Lean, George Stevens's Giant, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Warren Beatty's Reds. The subtle yet sprawling Production Design by by Jack Fisk and Jim Erickson is also extremely effective, and also reminiscent of classic Hollywood.<br/><br/>This film is virtuoso film making from the opening scene to the end, is one great, fascinating story that captures you from the start, due to the incredible array of talents that just erupts from the screen like an oil tower. There Will Be Blood is certainly the most interesting work from a young film maker since American Beauty, and puts Paul Thomas Anderson in the same league as Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, Orson Welles, the list can go on, and on. I cannot recommend this film further, my only final piece of advice is see it, I took precautions not to reveal any plot details, cause even though you might think you have the story down from the trailers, trust me, you have no idea what you are in for. This movie is to be seen, and seen again. That's pretty much all I have to say about it, see the film immediately if you haven't....""I'm finished."""

","They are few and far between (epic westerns), but they crop up now an' agin. THERE WILL BE BLOOD (for OIL!) (sounds like a Republican slogan, does it not?) will go down as one of the truly great epic westerns, thanks in equal parts to both Lewis and Anderson. Absorbing viewing for the most part (though, being a second-guesser, I would've done away with the second doing-away with, ending instead with the revelation that the two were not related). The ruthlessness that the prospect of big money engenders is given about as thorough a scrutiny as is cinematically possible. Put this one right up there alongside the likes of HEAVEN'S GATE, where it belongs."
"pisanond","10","1","8","25 February 2008"," One of the greatest films of all time
","""There Will Be Blood"" is a movie written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book ""Oil"", which itself was based on the Harding Administration's Teapot Dome Scandal. That being said it is quickly apparent that the movie is about the life of one man, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in the most powerful performance of his distinguished career. Plainview is ambition, greed and the desire for power incarnate. He pursues silver and by accident finds oil on his claims. One of his partners is accidentally killed during an oil extraction operation and he takes the orphaned child of the man as his own, naming him H.W., and uses the boy as a device to establish himself as a family man as he obtains claims from poor farmers, making himself one of the wealthiest oilmen in California. H.W. is played by several child and one adult actor over the course of the movie but during most of its course by Dillon Freasier in an effectively understated role. Soon he is approached by a man named Paul Sunday, played by Paul Dano, who informs Plainview of oil on his family's land in Little Boston, California, information for which he obtains a bribe. Plainview goes to Little Boston and finds evidence of an ""ocean of oil"" under the land while under the pretense of a quail hunting trip with his son, H.W., at the Sunday farm. In obtaining the rights to the oil under the Sunday farm Plainview pays the family $5,000 in advance and promises another $5,000 to Eli Sunday to establish a church, of which he imagines himself pastor. Plainview then takes steps to ensure that he can monopolize the oil under Little Boston against all competitors.<br/><br/>The plot is thus established so that the characters may play out their lives in what is to be a tragedy of epic proportions. The film explores Plainview's exploitation of the farmers of the poor community, his false concern for his workers, his manipulation of H.W., of which he seems only vaguely aware until later in life and the love-hate relationship with Eli Sunday and his church; a complicated dance of death that eventually plays itself out with the inevitable murder of one of the characters.<br/><br/>What Anderson has created is a story of our time. Plainview is rapacious Capitalism and greed while Eli Sunday is both Plainview's agent and antagonist, simultaneously using religious fervor to assist in the exploitation of his flock while living off of Plainview's largess. Were it only a polemic, however, the film would have failed as many polemics do. Instead the writer has created his characters as living, breathing people: people who change their stripes in front of different audiences, who themselves act within worlds of their own making; people who are only vaguely aware of their own motivations and blind to the motivations of others. All of this is laid out before the viewer who is forced to be a participant in the drama, to take sides as the story plays itself out, only to be surprised by each twist and turn of the plot and the surprising and disturbing ending.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the film is outstanding, the editing and writing first rate. The first 20 minutes of the film is absent dialog, making the imagery that much more important, forcing the focus of the film, Daniel Day-Lewis as Plainview, to embody the character in movement and nuance--a talent more attuned to the silent era than the modern era of film. The camera moves with the characters and participates with them carrying the audience with the characters and the action, challenging the viewer's perceptions and understanding of events at every turn, just as the characters themselves are confused and manipulated by those same events.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is a film at the level of Citizen Kane and Casablanca. I believe it will continue to enthrall audiences for many years. Its snubbing at the Oscars will only imbue it with greater artistic credibility. This is a film meant to challenge the viewer, the society, the powerful and conventionality. As such it is high art. Bravo."
"jpschapira","8","1","8","21 February 2008"," ""I drink your milkshake!"" It's a classic...
","The title of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest adventure sounds like one of those taglines or announcements you would normally see in a movie trailer ""There Will Be Blood"". Well, there is an upside for those going to see the film in a movie theatre; the title is definitely a promise that won't be broken. Anderson, a gifted filmmaker and an expert when it comes to uncommon titles, achieves with ""There Will Be Blood"" not his best picture, but his most recognized one. <br/><br/>It's a shame though, that this praise comes so late in his short career, because there's no difference between ""There Will Be Blood"" and his previous pieces. Whatever the length time, the characteristics of an Anderson film remain: unexpected endings, classic, focused cinematography and editing, well drawn characters courtesy of the director's sharp writing, chaotic score (I've got to admit Jonny Greenwood's work here takes it too far), characters that are always mature and relatively old and usually live desperate situations that require desperate measures. <br/><br/>A few years ago, Anderson reduced his typical ensembles into a smaller cast for the effective and weird ""Punch-Drunk-Love"". Now, he puts a risky number of three or less main characters but stays true to the rest of the things that define his signature. Is ""There Will Be Blood"" weird? You can bet it is, in its own way. It's a movie that can't be compared to any other; it's so different from everything you're used to watch that it naturally stands out.<br/><br/>No, it's not better than ""Atonement"" or ""Juno""; but that's not the point. The point is that if you found a movie of ""There Will Be Blood's"" proportions, you probably wouldn't think about comparing them. It deals with business; the oil business, and with an oil man who says he can't do anything but speak frankly and is actually full of crap. Besides, he uses his little cute son to convince people into selling him lands. <br/><br/>This is Daniel Plainview, portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis as a man truly possessed by the devil. The second main character, Eli, a somekind of a priest played wonderfully by the on growing Paul Dano, is represented as Plainview's karma; his obvious opposite, and it's a comparison that Anderson keeps throughout the long, slow paced movie that deals with a big part of the characters' lives. <br/><br/>One of the film's best scenes consists of a confession that Eli gets out of Plainview, that's supposed to be serious, but during a few moments, the audience was laughing out loud. This scene is important because it marks the beginning of Plainview's decline, and the ongoing increase of Day Lewis' tour-de-force. Better than Clooney's lack of effort in ""Michael Clayton""; better than Depp's ambivalent eccentricity; better than Mortensen's precise silence; Day Lewis' works covers every side of every era of Daniel Plainview's pathetic life.<br/><br/>If that's not enough for you, both Anderson and Day Lewis create a human being that we can feel not the slightest empathy for. We want nothing good for this oil man; we fear him and his eyes make us want to look the other way."
"MissMovieLuver88","10","1","8","15 February 2008"," Brilliant depiction of the Early Oil Industry in America
","Well, first things first, I didn't think that I would come across a film that would have the same impact on me when i watched Atonement. Boy was I wrong! Everything in this film is pure genius on Anderson's part. Stunning cinematography,acting,score,editing....everything that I want in a film and more. An absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood contains some interesting ideologies about suburban America. Most notably an incredibly isolated one. But two that come to mind are this Anti-Religious theme and Ant-capitalism. We see the character of Plaintiff, who feels uncomfortable around Eli Sunday in relation to his evangelical preaching. Daniel Day-Lewis' character is one of a seriously repressed man, who wants no more than to own every oil enterprise in the land.<br/><br/>What was so brilliant about this film, which I will probably say again was just absolutely bloody everything. The score I will begin with. Made by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, who for some strange reason did not get an Academy award nomination for this, produces a score which perfectly relates to the time period. The whole eeriness of it and the detuning of the score, adds to the bleak, corrupt atmosphere that we see on screen. Abolutly mesmerising. Something which I have to buy very soon. Still have it in my head. So brilliant"" The film also contains huge Christian like imagery. For instance Plaintiff, is seen as deriving from hell, ie- we first seen him down in the pit looking for oil. From there we can see he is a violent, selfish man, who is determined to get what h wants. From there on, when he takes the son of another man and poses him as his own-also symbolises this. There are loads more but I dodn't want to give too much away as it's just blown me away! Talking of ""blowing me away"" the cinematography. WOW oh Wow! again I didn't think I would see should sensational cinematography since I watched Atonement back in September. Again I was seriously wrong. Throughout the film, the colour on the screen changes from dark to seriously light. Again, possibly signifies the changing of mood. One incredible piece of imagery is that scene where the oil place is on fire is unbelievably. The colours, is set up perfectly for something spectacular. I don't have the words to describe it but once you see it you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Being a Scorsese fan, I can see hell of a lot of trademarks in here that he uses. For instance the jump cuts in here, that he often uses. These, as I can see from reviews have put people off and confused them a little. For me this is is beauty of the film. It has certainly made be think about how much I take for granted everything told to me in the film. I mean Anderson takes a chunk of vita narrative information and doesn't tells us anymore. I loved this. Seriouslyy people is a good thing you know. It's something that is original and not often used. People wake up! Anyway, I loved some of the tracking shots in this, not quite beating Atonement but still some unbelievable scenes in it.<br/><br/>The acting...well just outstanding. Daniel Day Lewis seriously possess the inner-body of his character so well. The John Huston like voice, mannerisms, e.t.c is just mind-blowing. If he doesn't win best actor at this year's Oscars-I'l eat my own hat!! I have to say Paul Dano is seriously under-rated in this role. He brilliantly plays the twin-brothers Eli and Paul so so well. I love his crazy preaching moment...but I can't go into that much. Both actors, Dano and Day-Lewis have brilliant chemistry on screen which shows. I can't understand why Dano hasn't been credited more with his role-only a BAFTA nomination. I guess his is slightly over-shadowed by Day Lewis's performance.<br/><br/>Overall, the length of the film DOES NOT matter, the jump cuts, DOES NOT matter, acting, score cinematography all contribute to a sensational, outsanding film which words can't not express. I couldn't keep my eyes of it all the way through, just annoyed me that I picked a crappy version but I will get it on DVD soon.<br/><br/>Go out and see it when you can, you wont be disappointed. Ignore the negative comments here because they're wrong!! There Will Be Blood gave me the same experience as I had with the brilliant Atonement. One of utter admiration for the director and just all around Wownes...a word I made up right there! Oh and one quote I will never forget. A great metaphor oil.<br/><br/>I drink you're milkshake.........I drink it up! 10/10 There Will Be Blood left me utterly speechless and I'm sure you might feel the same.<br/><br/>Mangnificent film!"

People will talk about this film for years to come in the same way as they do with Citizen Kane. It is a brutal but beautiful portrait of one man. All of the the characters are just by-standers to the protagonist.<br/><br/>This is also an important film - it clearly demonstrates that greed and religion are not happy bed fellows and personally I can't wait to see it again, just so I can decide if it as good as I think it is right now or even better. 10/10"

","I didn't think a movie like this could even be possible. It is an indescribable feeling like when you see a new born child, or when you get the first smell of the see air, or when you see someone you've missed for a long time. Emotions mix and mangle throughout the movie giving it a certain quality only few movies have achieved in all the years of cinema. Movies like The Godfather and Starwars have not even began to touch on the basic human emotions you experience while watching this movie. The way the character goes through the changes of the people around him, and in himself are truly what make this movie captivating. Daniel Day-Lewis plays a tormented soul like no other giving the character something that even Marlon Brando would have a difficult time achieving. I've never felt so strongly about a movie like what I felt after watching this. How the character went through the nice, giving, charismatic person into the drunk, tortured person that he eventually becomes is marvelous...and yet heart breaking at the same time. I didn't actually know exactly what I felt after seeing the movie...I couldn't quite place the emotion until now, it is content. I don't feel like I have to keep searching for a certain painting, or a stanza of poetry that touches my inner being because I have found this movie, this...work of art, this...masterpiece. It kept me on the edge of my seat both physically and emotionally until the very end. So I do hope you get out and see something that will be held in regard as one of the greatest pictures in human history."
"Tassie91","10","1","8","9 February 2008"," Bloody Brilliant
","I saw There Will Be Blood the day it came out in Australia (9th of February, 2008), and of course, I booked in the very first session of the day, at exactly 12:00pm. Believe me when I say that I will never forget that date and the cinema in which I viewed it in, for I had just seen a truly dark masterpiece.<br/><br/>It was possibly my most anticipated movie of this decade so far, for Daniel Day-Lewis is my favourite and most respected actor. He is a well educated, brilliant performer with a modest personality. On top of all that he refuses to go commercial/mainstream (again, why I respect him so much) and remains a true gentleman. So it is very hard to believe that someone so nice could play a character so full of hatred, greed, competition, cruelness and be scarier then most other horror movie serial killers. Day-Lewis is able to pull off a character with more personality levels than ever before, from a hard working man trying to make a living while loving and caring for his young son, to a greedy, selfish, anti-social entrepreneur who would do anything to stop someone getting in the way of his wealth, and believe me, boy does he do some cruel things. One of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a movie, up there with Hannibal Lecter(Anthony Hopkins), Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), R.P. McMurphy(Jack Nicholson) and even Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando).<br/><br/>The movie is set between the years 1898-1927, and accurately shows how some of the oil tycoons of the early 20th Century made their wealth. Some people might not like the fact that the movie goes for a little over 2 and a half hours, but I say those people have no patience in them. That just means that the plot is a lot more complex and the movie doesn't fail to keep you intrigued from the very first opening scene, which, might I add, was one of my most interesting first 20 minutes of an opening scene ever. It just goes to show that you don't need a single word of dialogue to set the mood of the rest of the movie and to show how Daniel Plainview reached his wealth, through hard work and resilience. So, if someone complains to you about the length of the movie, well just give them a few examples of the greatest movies ever... The Godfather(175 mins), Shawshank Redemption(142 mins), Pulp Fiction(154 mins) and Schindler's List(195 mins). If they don't like any of these movies, well just kick them in the head a few times to knock some sense into them. :)<br/><br/>When the movie finished, my older brother and I walked out of the cinema without saying a word to each other. Once we were outside, he finally asked me ""So what did you think?"". It took me a while to come up with an answer, I had to think back about the original storyline, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, Paul Dano's surprisingly good performance, the conflict between religion and superstition (which I liked because it is hardly ever done in a movie) and of course, the ever so powerful final scene which no doubt shocked the entire audience and will remain in their minds for a VERY long time. Hell, I'm still thinking about the final scene in my dreams. I also thought how brave Paul Thomas Anderson and the producers must have been. They obviously didn't care what Hollywood would've thought about the movie. It goes against what most (if not all) Hollywood movies consider to be entertaining; the happy ending, the compulsory infrequent 'funny' moments and the lively atmosphere. Finally, I turned to my brother after I came up with an answer and simply replied...""Bloody Brilliant""."

"Polaris_DiB","8","1","8","26 January 2008"," There will be even more rave reviews, but for the meantime here's yet another one.
","Released to immediate critical and audience acclaim, There Will Be Blood has quickly affixed itself to be the film of the year. Viewing this movie leaves no doubt in my mind that it will pretty much sweep the Oscars (though I prefer No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood has some of those key topics that Hollywood just lo-o-oves to care about), and personal feelings aside it certainly deserves it. In fact, running as it is alongside such fare as Cloverfield, it's nice to actually have an event movie that's worth something, much less so dramatically compelling.<br/><br/>Now, Daniel Day-Lewis is the star and, as pretty much every review of this movie in the world mentions, eats up his role and picks his teeth gleefully afterward. But there are other people in this movie, too, and they are likewise amazing. Paul Dano plays Eli Sunday, a priest who at first sets contrast to Plainview's greed, but who eventually comes to become Day-Lewis' strongest doppelganger (in a weird way), and major props should be given to him for his role. Sunday's somewhat caricature aspect (he's pretty much the forerunner of a televangelist) can be controversial for what it says about religion, but of course Anderson writes and directs with more subtlety than that, and the brilliance of There Will Be Blood is not only the fascination behind the character of Daniel Plainview, but the equal-and-opposite (but not quite really opposite if you think about it) character of Eli Sunday. Even keeping in mind that a) Upton Sinclair was a raging muckraker who wrote books pretty much to condemn his characters, and b) current sympathies are very cynical and touchy around subjects of oil barons and priests, Plainview and Sunday come across as some of the strongest characters written for the screen in decades.<br/><br/>And, of course, what review of excellence would this be without mentioning the skill of PT Anderson? Sure, he's mostly known for his assembly dramas, which is somewhat unfair because Magnolia and Boogie Nights are only 2 of his 5 widely-released movies. A lot of people are talking about There Will Be Blood as surprising because Anderson was capable of focusing so much attention and detail to a single character. If those people had paid more attention to Magnolia and Boogie Nights, they'd notice that their success depends upon him being able to attend and express characters fully with as much detail as possible. This is why I think other assembly dramas such as Crash and 21 Grams, no matter how popular, still suck. PT Anderson is an almost old-school director: one whose attention to detail goes over every aspect of the character's presentation from the actor as much as it's singularly aware of everything that is going on visually. Yes, the Anderson long take is featured in There Will Be Blood. Often, in fact! And yes, they're amazing takes in the way that they block and choreograph imagery, as well as create dramatic tension, while not calling much attention to the fact that they are single takes except to people like me who tend to ruin my own movie experiences to paying wayyy too much attention to that.<br/><br/>I do think the ending was slightly a let down not because of the actions that took place, but because the mood changed a lot and suddenly the movie was comedic. However, I can't think of a better way to end it myself, so who am I to speak on the matter? At any rate, this movie is great, and hopefully if you're not convinced to see it by all the other millions of rave reviews from people even more and even less technically credible than me, then this review may put even more weight onto the ""Oh, I might need to see this, and soon,"" side of the scale.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","As a cinema junkie and Paul Thomas Anderson disciple, THERE WILL BE BLOOD was likely the most anticipated motion picture experience ofwell, my entire life (thus far). I read Upton Sinclair's OIL! in early 2007. Paul's decision to adapt a novel written in the 1920s had me pretty curious. It was a great read, a massive tale and educational as well, but it was hard to visualize it as a PT Anderson picture. I've never been much of a period movie guy myself. Sometimes, the period drama can end up being a filmmaker's wrong turn down a path of boredom. TWBB is Anderson's slowest picture yet, but it is far from boring. For me, the joy of watching it comes from the way the story takes its sweet time. We creep along as the plot slowly cooks away and seeps under your skin, into your subconscious. I've always felt Paul's films had a dreamlike quality, and TWBB is his most surreal film yet. I dreamt of it all night long after my first viewing. It was a strange feeling to wake up the next morning and realize I'd spent my slumber in Little Boston with Daniel Plainview. A movie has never had that effect on me before. TWBB is likely the most important, revolutionary, and all around best motion picture of this decade. Pretty much what PULP FICTION was for the 90s. How do I know this? Why do I feel this way? It's hard to put into words. I think you can watch the film and either you get it or you don't, and I'm not trying to be condescending when I say something like that. It doesn't mean you're a stupid idiot if you don't get it, but I do feel bad for you, because you're missing out on the great experience I've had, a completely original experience, and that's why it's challenging to write/talk about this film. There's really nothing to compare it to. It's an unprecedented work of art. I've honestly never seen anything like it. For all its uniqueness, it's not that far out there structurally. It follows the traditional, film school principle of the three act framework, and by breaking down TWBB into its three acts, it becomes clear that the heart of this epic tale revolves around the tragic story of a father and son. Act one is the dialogue free prologue. Daniel's character is introduced and fully formed without a single word spoken. People get hurt and killed in holes, and these incidents lock the rest of the movie in a constant state of dread. In one of my favorite scenes, Daniel attempts to calm a crying baby, and the baby is fantastic, best baby acting I've ever seen, and perhaps these scenes spilled out of Paul as he wrote, a result of his own new found role as 'Dad' (or maybe not. I imagine he might despise comments like that, and I don't blame him). The film moves into its second act with both Daniel's decision to keep the baby as his son and the jump forward in time about nine years. The first half of Act two builds and builds as this story of finding oil in Little Boston is set up. The halfway point of the film comes with HW's ear drums being blasted away by the pressure of an exploding oil well. Daniel makes the decision to send his son away, and it's all down hill from there. The story gets darker and darker, until finally, we jump ahead about 15 years to HW's wedding and the beginning of the third act, and oh, what a final act it is. I've already warned of spoilers, so I wouldn't feel too bad revealing the details, but I don't think there's much more to say about the end of this film other than it's hilarious, perplexing, and, well, perfect. As a lover of all things PTA, this film has once again reaffirmed that he's only capable of the greatest of cinematic accomplishments. Many say TWBB is nothing like other PTA works. I agree and disagree. Like all his films, it's an incredible experience and is at its best seen on the big screen with great sound quality. For how drastically different a direction TWBB is for Paul, I could also say it's a culmination of the rest of his career. The beginning is really just another version of the first scene of PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. A man works alone, going back and forth from inside, in the darkness, to the outside, in the light. Jump to the ending, and we get another version of the grand finale from BOOGIE NIGHTS (Long Way Down). Like MAGNOLIA, the music of TWBB builds the momentum of the story. Like all of Paul's films, TWBB gets to the point where it overflows with nervous energy. He makes edge-of-your-seat, popcorn movies without resorting to butcher knifes and masks or machine guns and helicopters. The fun, quirky PTA dialogue is here too. ""So"" ""so"" ""so-sothis is what we do."" Maybe the one thing missing from TWBB, in comparison with Paul's other films, is a great female role. There are none, just a handful of bit parts, and there may have been more, but for some reason, great scenes in the script such as Daniel with a prostitute and another with a woman breast feeding baby HW were not included in the final film. One of my favorite PTA trademarks is his powerful closing images and lines with the final shot, the last five seconds of all his films: blood on the cuff of a killer is covered up, a large penis is finally revealed, she looks at us and smiles, she wraps her arms around him and says ""Here we go,"" and he looks back and claims, ""I'm finished."""
"stone8393","10","1","8","25 January 2008"," A masterpiece. THIS is powerful film-making.
","From the first frame, where Jonny Greenwood's powerful score is married to the stark, barren beauty of the desert landscape of southern California, to the very last, in a blood soaked bowling alley, this film grabbed me hard, and never let me go.<br/><br/>No film has ever effected me quite the way There Will Be Blood did. After the film was over I sat there and stared at the credits as they rolled by, then when they were over I got up and walked out of the auditorium. I felt like I was drifting, disconnected from reality. I can not explain it better than that. I didn't know what to think, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to say, I didn't even know if I wanted to move. The first time I saw Magnolia I wept through the credits, after There Will Be Blood, I watched the credits as filled with rage. This feeling of rage I can not explain either, I wasn't mad at the film, I knew I loved the film from the first fifteen minutes of it, I have no idea why I was so filled with rage, however, slowly over the duration of the credits, my rage subsided into nothing. Like I said, no other film has ever effected me like that, and confused my very emotions. THIS is powerful film-making.<br/><br/>After Magnolia and There Will Be Blood, and his other films which were great in different ways (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love) I have no problem with putting Paul Thomas Anderson up there with Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and D.W. Griffith. As one of the people who have changed American cinema. There Will Be Blood is ahead of it's time. I have never seen another film quiet like There Will Be Blood, and I do believe that it will have a profound effect on cinema. Paul Thomas Anderson is the best writer around today, not to mention the best director. There Will Be Blood is perfect down to every single tiny detail. He is a genius.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a performance that is nothing short of the best performance I have ever seen on screen. He is a powerhouse. The subtle nuances of his performance are so natural and minute, that they are easy to miss at times. Daniel Plainview is not only an absolute, but a very rich character. Daniel Day-Lewis nails every scene, every line, every word. His performance in this film is nothing short of an evolution of acting. You can now imagine what kind of pressure this put on Paul Dano to perform in the supporting role, and perform he did. I thought his performance would be good, but not that good. Eli Sunday is a snake and Paul Dano embodies it perfectly, from his screaming, screeching sermons, to his disturbingly innocent smile, Paul Dano nails it. Dillon Freasier is as good as child actors come. Most child actors are pretty shitty, so I was naturally apprehensive, but pleasantly surprised in the end. He is very quiet as HW Plainview, but his emotions are still portrayed with the clarity of a veteran actor. Kevin J O'Connor is also great as Henry Plainview. The rest of the cast is tremendous as well. There is not a single weak performance in this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Robert Elswit and Paul Thomas Anderson is beautiful. The best cinematography in a film since American Beauty. Enough said. The editing by Dylan Tichenor is great. He knows when to linger on a shot that is particularly beautiful, and it never seems slow-paced. The score by Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead) is powerful, unsettling, and beautiful all at the same time. The best score in a film since Thomas Newman's score for American Beauty. Once again, enough said. One of the most amazing things about this film is the Production Design by Jack Fisk every single set is a work of art. One of my favorite things about this film is the color. Ninety-nine percent of the color in the film is very bland blacks, browns, and the like. The only things that stand out in great contrast are the blood and the oil fire. Brilliant.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a triumph of modern film-making. It is perfect in every single conceivable way, especially the ending. It is a masterpiece. I am sure that even if it doesn't win the Oscars it deserves this year, it will someday be recognized by many people to be one of the greatest films ever made, which would only increase it's likenesses to Citizen Kane. In short: There Will Be Blood is the best film I have ever seen."
"auschwito","10","1","8","25 January 2008"," Review: There Will Be Blood
","There are those who will ""get"" Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood and those who won't. The film is beyond comparison to anything in contemporary cinema and will likely confuse those expecting a formulaic movie experience. There Will Be Blood is more akin to the strict visual representation of a novel - rather than a mere adaptation for screen. Unlike most modern films, there is virtually no dialogue in the first thirty minutes; no heroes per se; no singular narrative pervasive among its many scenes that could be called the central plot; etc. It's this abandonment of convention that is one of There Will Be Blood's greatest strengths and likely the main reason this author witnessed many movie-goers walking out of the movie and/or complaining that they ""hated it"" afterwards. If you're willing to forgo convention and simply appreciate an honest story about disparate individuals behaving in sincere accordance with their motivations, then you'll assuredly love the epic that is There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is the story of primarily three people: Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) - an entrepreneur whose competitive streak is unbridled; Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) - an evangelical faith-healer with harrowing zeal; and H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier) - an unsettled child striving to make sense of his station. The film is a saga of their aspirations and the unexpected places their distinct personalities take them.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1898 with Daniel Plainview working in solitude at a remote, silver mine. This (mostly) silent time spent alone with Daniel Day-Lewis' character affectingly brings the viewer to an intimate sympathy for his passion and his drive to said passion. Several years pass within the first 30 minutes of the film. The audience witnesses Plainview's hard-earned ascension from lowly prospector to an aspiring oil baron who cunningly swindles oil-ignorant settlers out of huge fortunes in exchange for his expertise. Always at Plainview's side is his son H.W. - a silent puppet used to demonstrate to potential clients that ""Daniel Plainview is a family man."" In their time spent alone however, one can almost see Daniel's love for H.W. manifest within the twinkle of his eye - Daniel just doesn't know how to express this sentiment to H.W.<br/><br/>The fate of the Plainviews' family business is inexorably changed when Daniel is sold a tip by a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) that there is an ocean of oil seeping throughout the territory of Little Boston, California. Daniel and H.W. engage on a pseudo-hunting trip to scout the land that is owned by the Sunday family. H.W. discovers oil seepage and proudly shows his father. Without divulging his true intentions, Daniel attempts to buy the property from the Sundays as a place for H.W. and him to hunt quail. Abel Sunday (David Willis) is more than happy to oblige before his self-proclaimed, faith-healer son (Paul's twin) Eli (also played by Paul Dano) protests and exposes Plainview's oil-drilling ambitions. Daniel eventually acquires the Sunday property (albeit at a much higher price) and proceeds to buy all surrounding properties throughout the community (except one that becomes a key part of the story later on). Plainview promises to give the bought-out residents schools, irrigation and wealth - although through Day-Lewis' superb acting, the audience can perceive that Plainview's greedy lust for oil is his singular goal. Once the stage is set, the tale of a clamorous capitalist unfurls - his triumphs and tribulations (both equally gripping).<br/><br/>What makes this story so captivating, is witnessing the motivations of these robust characters play out. Daniel Day-Lewis' masterful portrayal of Daniel Plainview is stunning. He is both charismatic and detestable; There Will Be Blood is essentially his story and as such, the film itself contains sentiments of both charisma and detestability. In essence, Daniel Day-Lewis takes There Will Be Blood from being merely good to the level of classic cinema. Lewis deserves every bit of media praise that he has received for this role - one would be hard-pressed to find a more memorable character than Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>One would be remiss however, to not acknowledge the other excellent actors in There Will Be Blood. Paul Dano is frightening in his portrayal of berserk evangelical Eli Sunday. Eli's outrageous behavior and impenetrable hold over the residents of Little Boston perpetually fuels the contest of convictions between himself and Daniel Plainview. In spite of this, it is unfortunate that Paul Dano was also cast as his brother Paul as this leads to quite a bit of unintended confusion as to whether they are in actuality, brothers or multiple personalities of the same being.<br/><br/>Credit must also be given to Dillon Freasier as H.W. The role Dillon plays in There Will Be Blood compliments Day-Lewis perfectly as the catalyst which exposes Daniel Plainview's most repugnant as well as most admirable attributes.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a film which deserves recognition of classic caliber. It is a compelling epic and to some degree, a telling tragedy of unhindered lust for human contrivances. There Will Be Blood will not be appreciated by everyone - its uniqueness as a film precludes comparison to anything previously seen in film. It is this profound distinctiveness however, that demands everyone's attention; love it or hate it, There Will Be Blood is a pre-eminent slice of cinematic art!"
"jesse_olson","10","1","8","24 January 2008"," Day-Lewis arguably gives one of the greatest on-screen performances of all time.
","""I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!"" Two days after watching Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"", I'm still finding myself replaying Daniel Day-Lewis bellowing out the aforementioned lines over and over in my head. Day-Lewis is absolutely riveting as a self-made oil tycoon in Anderson's gritty tale of greed, hatred and madness.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but draw comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Shining"" while watching this piece. From the terrifyingly unsettling score by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood, to the prominent theme of extreme isolation, PTA may have officially established himself as the modern day Kubrick.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is captivating in his portrayal of ruthless, greed obsessed oil tycoon Daniel Plainview. In Plainview you see subtle glimpses of Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs from ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and the disturbing intensity of Nicholson's Jack Torrance from ""The Shining"". The crescendo of madness seeps through the Plainview's facial expressions through each progressing scene, culminating in the destruction and breakdown of any sense of humanity he might have once had. Javier Bardem's performance this year in ""No Country for Old Men"" may go down as the most insane, unstable character since Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lector in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but Day-Lewis' Plainview is certainly the most despicable, uncompromising character of the year. WGA strike or not, the Academy should consider trimming the Best Actor nominations from the traditional five, down to just one. Day-Lewis' performance is remarkable and untouchable, and may very well be one of the greatest on-screen performances of all time.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't as much plot driven as it is a character study, but that does not take away from the fact that Anderson's vision is near genius. Each shot is as delicate and intricate as the next, reminding us of the beautiful cinematography he achieved just over five year ago in ""Punch Drunk Love."" The movie's haunting score is both beautiful and strategic, leaving the viewer with an intense, unsettling feeling throughout. Even though Anderson usually works with ensemble pieces, he has proved yet again that he can bring the best out of almost any actor he works with. (Not that Daniel Day-Lewis needs to be any more brilliant than he already is.) Though the film is not flawless, what Anderson lacks in perfection he makes up for with a well-thought out vision, stunning camera technique, and brilliant performances all around, including Paul Dano as Eli and Paul Sunday.<br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" may not end up getting the awards or critical recognition of movies like ""Atonement"", ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Juno"", but I strongly believe that over the next few years it will develop the type of cult following that previous PTA movies like ""Magnolia"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"" have cultivated in the past.<br/><br/>Jesse Olson"
"shaamus","10","1","8","9 January 2008"," Only once every few years are we blessed with this type of film...
","Once every few years arrives a film that breaks through the every-day barrage of media mediocrity to reach greatness; a cinematic event that you will one day nostalgically tell your kids ""I remember the first time I saw"" As a 17-year-old, my parents had many of these moments. They love recalling their first viewings of films like ""The Godfather,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and ""Psycho."" Film-lovers of my generation have had far too few of them in our lifetimes. Sure, we've witnessed some fantastic movies in the Clinton-Bush years, but when is the last time you sat in a theater with wide-eyes, knowing that you were witnessing history-in-the-making? That time has come around again. <br/><br/>""There Will Be Blood"" opens with stillness and ends with a bang. It is one of the few films I've ever seen that I actually have a difficult time talking aboutit speaks not with words but bombastic images and sounds, flashes of countryside and jolts of strings (composed by the master Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood). In the most complete way I can and want to summarize it, the film tells the tale of an Oil-prospector and the those he forms relationships (if one can call them that) in the Southwest from the early 1900's to the late 20's. <br/><br/>Based on the novel ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair, ""Blood"" comes at the apex of both director P.T. Anderson's and actor Daniel-Day Lewis's careers. Anderson, at 37 and with four actual wide-release films under his belt, is already one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever come out of the United States. It is no question that this film will cement him into that golden pathway with the likes of Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman and Francis-Ford Coppola. <br/><br/>Each shot is composed masterfully, and Anderson uses the vast, arid, other-worldly look of the American frontier as haunting backdrop for the plight of his central character, played by Daniel-Day Lewis. Each time Day-Lewis speaks, he incites fear. His character, Daniel Plainview, is a miracle of transformationwhen you see the actor himself in an interview; it is difficult to believe that it is the same person speaking. So rarely does this type of performance grace the screen that it would be sinful for the academy not to reward Day-Lewis with an Oscar, even though he's won one before. <br/><br/>The movie takes on huge themesgreed, religion and the American way are all put majestically on trialbut the beautiful thing is that the film could be seen simply as small character drama about the decline of one man, and still be a masterpiece. If you look through the thick air of dread that seems to coat every scene, a much deeper and even more troubling grave lays undiscovered, revealing itself a bit more on each viewing. It is this depth that makes this film one of the best I've been lucky enough to see in theaters this year, and possibly even during my lifetime. If that's not enough to get you to go see this movie, P.T. Anderson's filmography and Day-Lewis's proved skill should be. What are you waiting for? Make the pilgrimage. The oil's almost gone!"

In that sense it is especially akin to Kubrick's work.<br/><br/>For me, it was the final scene between Eli Sunday and Plainview when I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my seat, my jaw literally agape and half-grinning with awe at what I was taking in. It was both the intensity of the acting and the culmination of the currents of the whole tale from the beginning - who's the more greedy, who's the worse liar, who's the survivor and who's the victim - neither, actually, and who wins out when it's hypocrisy disguised as religious fanaticism vs the lust for oil, people and the Earth be damned? I think the final moments give an answer to that last question, and it ought to scare the britches off any fundamentalist preacher who thinks he can play politics with the money boys."

"Agent10","10","1","10","24 January 2008"," A grand old Epic with modern touches
","Call it socialist, anti-religion, anti-capitalist----whatever. There Will Be Blood is truly the best movie to come out in a long time. Its a rarity to see a film take a huge leap with such a stunning indictment on not one, but two relevant institutions in current society. And it is done so in a solid and deliberate manner which fully illustrates the madness that is created by hate and greed.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood hardly pulls any punches. Greed consumes all. The hopeful heart is easily manipulated. The quest for pomposity blackens the heart. Family is only relevant in comparison to the mighty dollar. There are all lessons that humanity must battle everyday, and Paul Thomas Anderson throws all of these struggles onto the shoulders of two men, Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday. Both are manipulative, both talk of grander, more majestic worlds that stir the imagination, and both would seek untold riches at any cost. Its an interesting battle that the pair have for much of the film, fighting to gain a leg up on each other but also playing with the hearts and minds of those they directly affect. Some might call this a direct attack on the oil industry and Evangelical Christians, but the movie merely depicts both areas for what they truly---corruptible, just like everything else. Its a relatively fair statement, considering both Palinview and Sunday are much different and far more idealistic in their earlier depictions in the film.<br/><br/>Anderson's visual work was also quite astonishing, making the bleak landscapes a character unto themselves. He also made the movie work with a relatively unknown cast of actors, which gave the film so much more depth in its characters because you could believe them. Paul Dano's whiny Eli Sunday was a perfect juxtaposition to Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview. One uses his anger and hatred for power while the other uses manipulation and ignorance. And the even more interesting thing is that both statements could apply to either character.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is easily the best movie of 2007, much less of any decade. Go and watch it."

","Discovering oil and the toil behind it was a dirty work that created our leisured modern age; it's a dictum that seems so defining that we still reel under its spell. The title of the movie though is way nuanced than what one might be nudged to think or as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian puts it in his review: Blood only makes its appearance in the very last, operatic scene. Before that, the wounds are internal, or covered by another liquid, gushing from the ground as from a slashed artery. The leading character is often to be seen darkly smothered in it, like a voodoo priest after a spectacular sacrifice. Oil is greasy and it has made so, our age; that so rests on the unitary principle of consumerism and ferocious extractivism. Or as The Atlantic muses over the movie in its review: The film has a carnal intensity, nowhere more evident than in its treatment of the early oil business, its danger and mystery and near-limitless possibility. Far from instigating shadows over human race, verging on the premises of climate change; our devour of everything naturally-draped to an extent of being dubbed as barbaric and callous: shows our descent over the account of being humane. There Will Be Blood is a movie that very much brings us to a flash of pouncing upon the very trenches of nature and downing everything that seems as granted. It touches upon how faith with all its stomp over bullying the profanity off from everything that doesn't drench its torso in sacredness and beatitude of the Divine; can go off extreme and make its own way into becoming a stepping stone for someone; for something. How faith and its adherence could seem to be pushed by a certain sanctimonious proclivity; wavering into becoming a mess in its own self and only becoming a stratagem, for wider influence or for a competing one?. Everything seems intertwined into who gets what; against one's respective preferences. One seems to run off into casting himself up as an oil-wriggler and jamming every hustle to block him off his way into flocking everything out there and the other gets on with a religious undertaking and goes into making a place for himself, by projection of a spiritual overtness. Both go extreme. Both vie for a push on the back of their particular tendencies: one going by an unfettered booze off the Californian troves of oil and the other goes by an edgy evangelism, pulling in everyone at his Church of the Third Revelation. A dialogue from the novel would be apt to contextualize the sacred-profane collusion over deciphering the reasons for earthquakes. (Sundays in the movie). ""Bunny knew that her whole soul was hanging on his story; she fairly worshiped her brother. ""And you never seen him again?"" she whispered. ""I never really saw him at all,"" said Bunny; ""I wouldn't know him now, if I was to meet him. You don't know where he is?"" ""I've had three letters. Always it's a new place, and he says he ain't stayin' there. Some day, he says, he'll come to see me-jest me. He's scairt o' Pap."" ""What would Pap do?"" ""Pap would whale him. He's terrible set agin him. He says he's a limb of Satan. Paul says he don't believe what's in the Book? Do you believe it?"" Bunny hesitated, remembering Dad and his ""True Word."" He decided he could trust Ruth that far, so he told her he didn't think he believed quite everything. And Ruth, gazing into his eyes with intense concern, inquired: ""What is it makes yearthquakes?"" So Bunny told what Mr. Eaton had taught him about the earth's crust and its shrinking, and the faults in the strata, that were the first to yield to the strain. He judged by the wondering look on her face that this was the first hint of natural science that had ever come to her mind. ""So you don't have to be scairt!"" she said.""
The Watkins or the Sundays snugged into living their lives oThe Watkins or the Sundays snugged into living their lives off the brook in their ranch and follow in highly religious lives. Paul Watkins - who had come off to H.W around his aunt's home (depicted only in the novel) - seems to be driven by a material pursuit; and thus he vanishes off into obscure plains rendering all unable to decipher his whereabouts. His twin or as some believe his alter ego, Eli - goes on a highly religious pursuit and seems to run off certain stringent superstitions - becomes a bitter enemy of Daniel, over his biting disregard of religious cult. But then we have him going for the material pursuit too, as he skirmishes with his dad at the dinner and admonishes him with a delirious tilt: over skidding the land off to Daniel without much thought. He shoots: You've let someone come in here and walk all over us. You let him in and do his work here and you're an awful man for what we could have had. These words roll out of man, too tough on building up a church and professing the Word of God. These words seem to pave for the frustration of a man, who seems better conditioned to take in the boons off the oil money more than building up an edifice of religious strength in the community. The stakes seem to be put somewhere else. Daniel cajoles everyone through his CSR channeling and Eli seems to build upon the religious sentiments that everyone so shares. The sacred-profane collusion remains embedded into the movie's very character. Eli treads on a pursuit - sham and wretched - and Daniel gets on with a self-aggrandizing motif, in which oil seems to be the only color. Religion seems to have a biting disregard in the eyes of Daniel very much because it brings in an impassioned rebuke to everything that Daniel stands for or might stand for. The over-arching influence of religion in countering anything material and the baggage that it brings in with it, is something Daniel contests with throughout. One seems to get on with a community on the grounds of his interest; the other seems to go quite in contrast, with condemning the people off for an abode stationed alone. Or as Empire Online puts it, in its review: These two represent the wider forces of religion and capitalism and the role they've played in America's development, then the picture that Anderson paints of his nation's soul is bleak indeed. Both Plainview and Eli are corrupt, out primarily to consolidate their own power; both sell their snake-oil schemes with promises to better those who follow them; both ultimately betray those who choose to believe in them. Plainview at least is approaching honest about his perfidy, but the rot runs deeper in him than anyone - there are no depths to which he will not stoop in pursuit of more land, more money, more oil. It's a chilling portrait, and one which, while bafflingly evil, somehow never strays from believability. The movie seems to get on with rawness, gushing off onto the screen, with every snap of the scene. It starts with Daniel Plainview shoveling out silver meters down from a pit and incidentally falling roughshod on his peg, in a later retreat into it. Being bruised with a minor fracture, he still ventures into picking out silver with the same ferocity. His bitsy money-making hits take a haul into a biting realization; when he goes out into the Sunday Ranch - having been invited by Paul Sunday for oil-bound prospects - and goes quail-hunting, under the guise of prospecting whether this dry piece of land, streams with greasy blood underneath the sandy drape or not? He then talks Abel Sunday, Paul's father, into buying the land rather than leasing it: and thus making a wild turn to fiddling for oil: the dwindling lifeblood of our 21st-century prosperity. The film is a pressing tale of the unbridled push for more: that more consists in gaining more land; gaining more money through a proper channeling of oil as a penny-rigging gimmick; exploiting more and more the tenderness in others, mainly by superseding it all by a consummate disregard for anything with a soul (I look at people and I see nothing worth-liking, says Daniel sitting on the porch). The film centers on psychological rushes for exploiting with an unbridled vie, for everything that seems to be definitive before one. His adopted son H.W Plainview seems to be a bridging link with the world, that he so seems to botch. Dillon Freasier plays a reticent child even before being deafened by being blown onto the shack's roof by a gassy outburst in the oil well. His silence seems to have been impinged on him by the intimidating stature of his father, who only seems to talk to him on issues relating to business. An excerpt from the Oil! would suffice for it: ""Dad had explained it-money had done it. Men of money had said the word, and surveyors and engineers had come, and diggers by the thousand, swarming Mexicans and Indians, bronze of skin, armed with picks and shovels; and great steam shovels with long hanging lobster-claws of steel; derricks with wide swinging arms, scrapers and grading machines, steel drills and blasting men with dynamite, rock-crushers, and concrete mixers that ate sacks of cement by the thousand, and drank water from a flour-stained hose, and had round steel bellies that turned all day with a grinding noise. All these had come, and for a year or two they had toiled, and yard by yard they had unrolled the magic ribbon. Thus, day by day, Bunny got his oil lessons. He wandered about the field with Dad and the geologist and the boss driller, while they laid out the sites for future wells; and Dad took an envelope and pencil, and explained to Bunny why you place your wells on the four corners of a diamond, and not on the four corners of a square. You may try that out for yourself, drawing a circle about each well, to indicate the territory from which the oil is drained; you will see that the diamond shape covers the ground with less overlapping. Wherever you overlap, you are drilling two holes to get the same barrel of oil; and only a dub would do that"""

","There were three times of blood in the film, the first time under the initial small-scale oil well. At the beginning, all the participants were similar. Daniel was also a passionate young man at that time, and he did everything in his own hands and went deep into the danger line. Some film introductions say that Daniel used H.W to deceive the villagers. I think this is an irresponsible statement. The mine friend had an accident with him and left a child. Daniel may not have worried too much at that time. He was also lonely and unmarried for a long time. When he was not developed, he also tried his best to treat his son. Many efforts have been made for his son's deafness. Of course, it was full of reluctance to send his son to the train. The blood at this time symbolizes the young man's initial heart of striving for progress, even willing to risk his life for a better and happy life. But his son's deafness was also a watershed. Daniel rescued H.W. and went to the so-called fire fighting, but people with common sense knew that water could not save the fire of oil, let alone his professional household. He just wanted to appreciate and protect his wealth. Before the huge oil field unprecedented, Daniel began to walk away from his family.<br/><br/>The second time Daniel shot the fake brother. Just as Daniel judged himself, his sense of competition is superior to ordinary people, and he also isolates himself from ordinary people, so he can also identify fake brothers through details. Looking back at H.W 's arson, I wonder if the clues were discovered by looking at the photos in my brother 's diary, and all the originals also disappeared in H.W. 's silence. Daniel has achieved great success, subjectively and objectively overriding others, and the poor Mr. Tief (the person who originally wanted to acquire Daniel's land) is only a cannon fodder. It is attacked by Daniel's speculation on family education. How is Daniel possible Give up your hard-won wealth? Religious ugliness broke out at the same time. Father Bandy discovered Daniel 's murder, but he just wanted him to be baptized. What 's even more ridiculous is that the content of baptism confession was to abandon his son. Ugly showed a new height in the newly built church.<br/><br/>The third time was of course Daniel's mansion. Daniel pronounced Eli's death in Eli's way. He played the role of God himself, causing the fierce Eli to kneel down to the ground completely. Recalling Eli slapped Daniel as a priest in the church, this magical contrast makes drama and reality a perfect combination, and also a series of Eli's ugly faces: Negotiations on the dining table when Daniel first arrived at Sand Ranch, Daniel 's request before the drilling began, the bizarre performance of the devil in the church, and the madness of going home after being defeated by Daniel ... Daniel also completed one of his previous visions-leaving the crowd, he drove away the only relatives and stuck to himself Castle. Without having to go down the oil well again, he quietly transformed the young blood into oil in the thirty-year period, so that others could not take away his wealth, and his son was no exception. Eventually, he and the oil merged into one, regardless of each other.<br/><br/>In general, this strange (music) and dark (picture) film has gone slanted, criticizing and criticizing everything it brings, and talking about the oil of the last century, but it is all in line with the present.<br/><br/>All people have faith, some people believe that others give, and some people believe that they created. Think about how the farmers of Sand Ranch with low knowledge and limited knowledge can live the good life Daniel promised them. Or not convinced by Eli 's ecstatic exorcism? In ancient China, if there is no faith, give you faith, and Confucianism or the call to action is a very contagious shackle or weapon. In modern times, there are a lot of Chinese people who believe in Buddhism in statistics, but I think this kind of letter is a kind of request letter: look at the usual burning incense to pray to the Buddha to pray for peace, but rarely hear the use of Buddhism Moral standards self-requirement; those who charge the incense and ring the bell, and the master opens the light to ask for help, is the money also collected for the Buddha; Rather than preaching for meditation ... Whether inside the temple or in the dust and hustle and bustle, the door was opened to ask for help, and the hermit almost became an addict. This knows no boundaries, and the godfathers revealed in ""Focus"" even use the faith and tolerance of the masses to secretly desire! Of course, there must be very devout believers, but it is destined to be less and less, because the living conditions are good, the candlestick in ""Miserable World"" seems to be extinct, and the rich material conditions have diverted the attention of ordinary people. There is no exception whether it is the core of film and television works used for ridicule, or the focus of talk in the intestinal path. The injection of capital makes the original rustic style no longer. Now more faith and trust are gathered on the material wealth. You would never emphasize how to buckle in front of a group of people who have already buckled the first button of their life? The weakened religious system that emerged in China (even if it is lively, kowtows to the RMB) gives me reason to believe that in the communist society described by Marx, religious beliefs will disappear and the prophecies will disappear (it is certainly not a complementary relationship with material desire). Admittedly, I cannot deny the positive role and influence of religion in today's world. Doesn't capitalism make the United States temporarily a brother of the world?<br/><br/>Desire must live longer than religion. There is no doubt that religion is also born of people, and people are afraid of growing up in desire. Conversely, I do n't want to go to the extremes of Daniel. I do n't know if Paul is a method or greed, but who can guarantee his future path?"

The only connection there was to the book was maybe three or four minutes worth around getting the land and starting the first well. The rest of the movie (Including the beginning) was nothing at all like the book. In the book the oil man and his actual son were a team because he wanted his son to take over the business. Actually the book is based around the son and it is also based around real historic events in the early 1900's. This story was very disappointing.

","Daniel Plainview is the worst character I've watched in cinema. There will be Blood is maybe the best film I've seen in this new century. There's not many years gone by. A little less than two decades, but it's still a stunning achievement for this film to standout higher than the rest.<br/><br/>Daniel-Day-Lewis produces another incredible performance. It reminds me of his work on The Crucible, but its even better here. In fact There will Be Blood must rank as one of the best films ever. It feels like a film made even a century ago. What an achievement! <br/><br/>It's the film that marks PT Anderson as indeed one of the best living directors... and maybe the best from the a generation of filmmakers who still have many more films to come.<br/><br/>What is so good about this film? Long sections without dialogue remind me of 2001. But simply being inspired by a great film doesn't make you good. The way it was done was amazing here. The soundtrack by Johnny Greenwood was marvelous, but then Anderson's other films also had a very unusual soundtrack with strange noises jumping around. <br/><br/>The cinematography here was superb. Night scenes in the oil fields are as good as anything from Days of Heaven by Malick. There's some epic acting scenes. There's those between father and son, and then with the preacher, that milkshake scene. <br/><br/>But what stood out for me was when Plainview talks to his brother about how he can't stand his wealth and other wealthy people, you see a man that can never be pleased, you see him in all his ugliness because of his loathing of others. That was more ugly to me and than several of the other obvious terrible things he did to other characters. <br/><br/>And when I say here's the worst character I've seen, the film has to be so good for me to rate it so highly, despite not liking the lead character at all."

"dromasca","8","0","2","26 March 2017"," Faust without Satan
","I have somehow avoided seeing There Will Be Blood for ten years despite its success, and despite having as lead actor Daniel Day-Lewis who got his second Academy Award for this role. The reason is that I was under the impression that this is one of those Big American Sagas which make great impression at the Oscars but seldom have convinced me to jump on their ship of emotions. This is true to some extent, as the film deals with the period of the beginning of oil drilling in the United States, the very important difference being that this saga has not an American Hero but and American Anti-Hero as main character. Which probably makes the film even more interesting.<br/><br/>The story takes starts before the turn of the 19th to the 20th century and ends in the late 1920s, following the raising of an oil magnate from his first discovery of one oil pit to his taking over a small empire of oil fields and the building of the pipes that ensure the transportation. Daniel Plainview, the character played by Day-Lewis seems to come from nowhere and grows from being nothing to the status of a millionaire. Achieving this takes not only luck and a complete lack of any scruples in dealing with competitors, friends or his very close ones - it also takes his soul. The story is kind of Faustian, it's just that Satan never shows up, or maybe he is there during the whole story under the form of the black gold. The script is loosely based on a novel by Upton Sinclair, with the difference that while in the Socialist writer novel the emphasis is on the social aspects with a critical view of the Capitalist system, in this adaptation it's the moral aspects that prevail, with Planview's character finding a counterpart and nemesis in preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). It's the material world faced with the possible spiritual salvation, another Faustian theme if you wish, but the preacher character eventually proves to be as corrupt and empty in substance as its arch-rival, which makes it unable to fulfill its goal. The destinies of the two are interleaved and they both end in damnation. Director Paul Thomas Anderson opens here a theme which he will continue in his next great picture The Master which offered Philip Seymour Hoffman the opportunity of incarnating one of his last greatest roles.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, telling the story of an American hero or of an American anti-hero does not look that different. It is still one of these sagas starting in the days of the rush for gold and ending when the rush for the black gold - the oil - stabilizes into the big corporations consolidations. The lead hero does not seem to have real roots in history or a specific place, and he needs none as most of the attention is focused on its deeds, mostly evil, with the exception of the personal survival story that is being told in the first 15 minutes. As any saga that respects itself it's long, which in cinema today means more that two and a half hours, which according to tastes and attention pass more or less easy. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is superb, he fills the screen with his personality to the point that the balance between his character and the one played by Paul Dano is broken in his favor. Dano acts well but he just cannot raise to the height and intensity of Day-Lewis. There Will Be Blood is one of those movies which cannot be really placed in a specific box, or in more than one - they just build to themselves a category and a name of their own."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","2","8 March 2017"," Oil is thicker than blood
","Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" tells the story of an unscrupulous oil prospector (Daniel Day-Lewis) in the early days of the twentieth century. Already a modest success, he purchases the land that he hopes will lead to even greater fortune. This places him in a long-running battle of wills with a local preacher (Paul Dano).<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis won an Oscar for his portrayal of ruthless oil man Daniel Plainview. While perhaps a bit too mannered for my preference, I have to admit that he immersed himself completely in the role. I was actually more drawn to Paul Dano as the sometimes explosive religious zealot, Eli Sunday. In any case, the palpable friction between these two actors provides us with the best illustration of Plainview's relentless character.<br/><br/>The script, which was loosely based on an Upton Sinclair novel, is thought-provoking and fairly interesting even though it is perhaps a bit sparse. There's not much of a character arc for Plainview; rather the film showcases a dogged determination on his part and an unwillingness to change. The ending may be a little out-of-the-blue for some viewers but I thought that it was fitting.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the best part about the film is the artistry with which it is presented. Anderson's direction is stellar throughout, making it easy to forgive that his script sometimes lacks momentum. Jonny Greenwood's score has some memorable motifs, such as the piercing, dissonant violins that open the picture. However, there were a few times when I found the music at odds with the visuals, which wouldn't have been as noticeable if the score wasn't so prominent.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is well worth watching even though I prefer the audacious scope of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"". Less reminiscent of Robert Altman's sprawling ensemble pieces like ""Nashville"" & ""Short Cuts"", ""There Will Be Blood"" instead has similarities to the much more intimate ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"". Regardless, the film probably represents Anderson's most potent effort from an artistic standpoint (at least to date)."

","There Will Be Blood is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a sprawling (at two and half hours long) spectacle of a film, exploring the lives of two very different and yet very similar men at the turn of the twentieth century. Directed and written by Paul Thomas Anderson, this doesn't just tell a simple story and leave it there. Like oil drilling, Anderson slowly breaks the surface and then everything that was underneath comes out to see the sun in a massive spurt.<br/><br/>Starring Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, this was a phenomenal showcase for both leading men. But Lewis gave one of the best performances of all time as a sociopathic, charismatic, egocentric, and ultimately pathetic man. Truly mesmerising and formidable. The direction and screenplay was rich and dense, creating an entire world in only two separate places. The dialogue was always solid. <br/><br/>The score, led by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, is haunting and gorgeous, and sometimes juxtaposes the scenes it's in to remind the audience that while something may not seem exactly bad on screen, what is happening might lead to something awful later on. The cinematography is just exquisite. <br/><br/>An American epic of the twenty first century is the ultimate take away from this film. It's bold, ambitious, and perhaps obnoxious for some, but at the end of the day, it is a near perfect character analysis of someone most won't relate to at all, but someone we can't there eyes off.

It's plot and screenplay were adjusted to comfortably pave way for the one man show and he didn't disappoint at all. <br/><br/>It's story follows the overly rated concept of American dream and one man dead set to achieve it no matter what. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) hits an oil well independently with his expertise on engineering and determination which rouses the entrepreneur in him. During this encounter, one of his partner falls to death leaving behind his infant son who later goes under the care of Daniel who raises him as his own. He starts acquiring, collaborating or forcibly taking off oil wells across the area with his influence and wealth and so does his name starts getting a reputation. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) approaches Daniel with information of an undiscovered oil well near his place for a little monetary price. Daniel goes to explore this place along with his son where he encounters Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano) who is a local preacher/healer. From here, it is just a step above ploys by both to take control of the people of the area. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis gives a chilling performance of a man obsessed with power and ego. This can well be expected of him. What comes as a surprise package is the performance of Paul Dano as the preacher with equal amount of ego as Daniel but always waiting for an opportunity to bring it out. Apart from the performances, I found nothing amusing in the movie as the plot and screenplay were pretty standard. <br/><br/>If excellent performances drive you nuts, I advice you to watch this right away."

","The protagonist spends his life dedicated to making money. Nothing else is important to him nor has any value. Not family, not education, not love, not music, literature, nor art. At the end of his life he is a wealthy man but he lives an empty existence. The film graphically shows us how hollow capitalism is as a way of life. The economy is nothing more than a tool to make money, not an end in itself. The goal of our lives should be to build a stronger and more vibrant society; to produce great art, strong families, and intelligent citizens dedicated to making the world a better place. Just money without quality of life is a bleak prospect. The movie is a damning indictment of the current political idea of slashing budgets to make the economy stronger at the expense of education, art, and family support. Riches without culture is no worthy goal."

","""There Will Be Blood"" is a suspenseful masterpiece. Thanks to suspenseful violins, an amazing performance by Daniel Day Lewis, an interesting story, and great camera work, ""There Will Be Blood"" earns the great 10/10 from yours truly. ""There Will Be Blood"" follows a miner turned oil man, Daniel Day Lewis. After a coworkers of his dies, he takes in his son, renames him HW, and raises him. One day a stranger comes to Daniel claiming that his town has large amounts of oil. Daniel goes to the town where he finds that the stranger's words are true. In this town he encounters a troublesome young preacher. He immediately begins drilling, getting a lot of oil. One day, an explosion happens at one of the drills causing his son to go deaf.

Daniel returns home to meet his son who has returned from deaf school. Years pass and he is living alone in a mansion going crazy. His son comes to tell him that he will be starting his own oil company which infuriates Daniel. Daniel calls him his competitor and a bastard from a basket. Later that day the troublesome priest, Eli, comes to meet with Daniel. After embarrassing Eli, Eli begs Daniel for money. Daniel replies to this by bashing his head in with a bowling pin. Wow! Throughout the whole movie, Daniel gets a little crazier and crazier every scene, an interesting journey to watch. The movie is filled with non-diegetic music of an orchestra. The simplest scenes such as simple conversations have audiences sitting on the edge of their seats because of the crazy suspenseful violins that seem to always be playing. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a bloody good movie."

","This movie is not what I expected it to be. It is a long movie about 2 and a half hours long, this allows Paul Thomas Anderson to go in depth with the characters that Upton Sinclair created. Daniel Day Lewis's character, Daniel Plainview, is the main character in this story. He can defiantly be called the antagonist of the film. You may also argue that the society in which the movie is placed is the main antagonist. Some may even venture to say that Lewis's character has many anti-hero characteristics. What makes movies like this great is that the character arc is subjective to the viewer. I would say that Daniel's journey through the movie displays what he really was the whole time. Even though most viewers could have been surprised by the ending, the events leading up to the end show the way Plainview expresses his feelings with no filter. I do not like saying movies have turning points, climaxes, or general shifts, but there are many points in this film when the morals and ethics of Daniel are shown. Movies like this are very rarely are done so well, but this does the job. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the director, or the period it is set in."

","There Will Be Blood develops along a plot involving a man slowly but surely slipping into madness whilst vying for the goal of becoming the worlds most renown oil-field driller. Performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano immediately reel the viewer in with the true and gritty personalities that they convey during the oil boom. Particularly the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis which one the nobleman his second Academy Award.<br/><br/>The plot of There Will Be Blood is absolutely perfect and correctly lays out a visual time-line of advancing in the oil industry, whether it be through agreements that didn't work out, or other individuals becoming unhinged by the demise of their own corrupt successes and the prosperity of their adversary's. This movie also does an amazing job with portraying the evangelicals against the corporate business man. The rivalry between the two reveals weaknesses of each other and the unexpected immorality of the church and it's ability to manipulate others to receive what it needs or wants. These revelations can bring strange thoughts into the viewers' minds as they ponder about the the possibilities of these happenings that are shown throughout the movie. That is what makes this movie stand out among-st the movies attempting to portray the madness that the oil industry creates; the capability of the film and it's plot and characters to raise alarms in the minds of the moviegoers when thinking of corruptness in our world and how it has consumed everyone. <br/><br/>The cruelness of Day-Lewis's character combined with the suffering and loss each protagonist and antagonist seems to be going through, easily overshadows a majority of the positive impacts, like the fame, recognition, and acceptance. Money always seems to trump the heartbreak of the characters, which once again raises the question ""How corrupt and greedy is our world?"" Overall, though, the movie is thought-provoking and treats the viewer with intense dialogue and interesting character developments."

","This film tells the story of an oil prospector who finds a huge deposit in unpromising region. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which also provides the script, the film stars Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano.<br/><br/>This is one of the most pessimistic films I've seen. The whole film's atmosphere is dark and negative, showing the saga of Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), who enriches after discovering oil in the lands next to a farm which belongs to Eli (Paul Dano), one wanabe- pastor with baby face from an evangelical cult. This film has no good guys or bad guys, is a vast gray area and wickedness is on everyone's mind. Plainview is obsessed with profits; Eli is a fanatical who mistreats the family and controls a congregation with an iron fist. Its the confrontation between these two men, with antagonistic visions and wills, which justifies the film title.<br/><br/>The two main actors did an exceptional job. Both are odious in their roles, the way they show to be bad people trying to look a certain hypocritical seriousness in their daily actions. Day-Lewis, however, is too similar with some characters who have starred in past films like ""Gangs of New York"" (and I refer to physical likeness and make- up, of course). Dillon Freasier also made a good performance in the role of HW, the little deaf child of Plainview. The costumes and sets goes well in the context of time and place of the action. The cinematography, dark and misty, combines harmoniously with the gloomy atmosphere of the film, and a deeply depressed soundtrack (written by Jonny Greenwood), very atonal, who perfectly embodies the visible (or implied) cruelty of this film."

","I was initially drawn to this film after watching Gangs of New York for the first time (yes I know I was late to the party.) Daniel Day-Lewis breathes authenticity into every role he plays and I couldn't wait to see him at the centre of this oil drilling story. Set from 1898 through to 1927 the film follows the tale successful business Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis). Day-Lewis gives one of the greatest performances I have seen by bringing the maleficent, manipulative and complex character to life. There are two relationships that are integral to the story. The first is between Daniel and his adopted son HW. Everything is all good in the early days until an explosion leaves HW deaf and Daniel not quite knowing how to deal with it. When the explosion happens Daniel is thrilled with the amount of oil discovered and the money he can make from it, while not really fussed by his son's serious condition. The brilliance of this shows the true purpose of Daniel life and his psychopathic characteristics. His true feelings are further emphasized towards the end of the film where he confronts his son and informs him of his adoption.<br/><br/>The second relationship is between Daniel and Eli, a preacher who is trying to do what he sees best for his church. This spawns a conflict which intensifies and leads to the greatest scene in this film. ""I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE"" has become an immortal line for me and the scene was brilliantly directed to show the victorious Daniel Plainview's maliciousness.<br/><br/>Clocking in at 2 hours 38 minutes, it's hardly an easy watch. The film modulates between edge of seat intensity and casual conversation in a beautiful way which add gravity to the more memorable scenes. There Will Be Blood is a great film and a phenomenal showcase of Daniel Day-Lewis' acting ability."

","There Will Be Blood is not a simple biopic about a man who got himself driven by greed and power.

"Screen_Blitz","10","0","2","18 May 2016"," Daniel Day Lewis shines in this astounding masterpiece
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson, the innovative mind behind the critically acclaimed 'Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', and 'The Master', shows off his blissful talent to the silver screen in this somber cinematic adaption of Upton Sinclair's 1920s novel Oil!. There Will Be Blood is an ingenious effort that simply can't be ignored, regardless if you have grown in the Paul Thomas Anderson fanfare or not, or adored the arresting talent of three-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day Lewis. Anderson comprises together a powerful narrative inspired by Upton Sinclair's Classic literary work and irresistible performances to put together what can easily be called a true cinematic gem. Set in the early 1900s, Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil driller working for an oil rig in rural New Mexico community. Plainview is indeed a hard worker but also crucially demanding when it comes to reaching his goals in the oil company and providing for him and his adopted son H.W. (played by Dillon Freasier). Sprawling across the deserted community, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (played by Paul Dano), son of a farming family who informs him of an oil supply in California. Plainview makes a deal with Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano), an evangelist church pastor to sell their property to provide for their church. As they begin to pump off the oil from the property, Daniel becomes consumed with greed and hatred that contributes to a bizarre relationship between him and Eli. <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis has boasted an astonishing acting talent over the past two decades, and much can be proved by this triumphant appearances such as in Jim Sheridan's 'My Left foot, Martin Scorses's 'Gangs of New York', and Steven Spielberg biopic drama 'Lincoln'. Though his filmography runs somewhat infrequent filmography, he's elevated the ladder to become what many consider one of the finest Hollywood actors of this generation. This method actor portrays the main character of Daniel Plainview, a devoted father with deep care of his oil business as well as his young son but leaves himself swallowed in greediness and cold-hearted personality. Lewis fuels this role with what is possibly his most astounding performance he's given in his career. He delivers such a captivating portrayal in this role it allows viewers feel the heat of the character's emotionality. The Oscar acquired by his performance definitely comes to no surprise. Paul Dano takes on the often challenging task of playing dual roles, portraying twin brothers Paul and Eli, the latter which is a church pastor. Like Lewis, Dano knocks the ball out of park with his performances. He makes a pretty interesting character in the story, a God-loving farmer who is caught in an enigmatic relationship with Daniel Plainview. He gets his best time to shine during the scenes in which he preaches sermons and baptisms, his portrayal stand strong, if a little off-putting by the emotional tension played in these scenes.<br/><br/>Paul Thomas Anderson is shown to have a gift in not only directing but powerful storytelling. While the film is based on Upton Sinclair's novel, this film takes some notable liberties from the book to show that Anderson has something more interesting in mind. Boasting a story of the main character's desperation to rise to the top, the film explores themes of hate, greed, religion, family relationships, and capitalism; and the writing by Anderson makes just enough for the story to explore each of them almost evenly. Religion plays a significant factor in the story as Paul Dano's character Eli Sunday is a church pastor who pleads for nothing more than his godly relationship. In one scene, he tries to help Daniel redeem himself from his greed and hateful behavior by inviting him to be baptized and recover from his past mistakes including his treatment of his son. Another intriguing (though less significant) is his son H.W's friendship with Eli's little sister Mary who is mentioned to be beaten by her father if she doesn't pray. The biggest and most gripping factor however, comes from the complex relationship between Daniel and Eli which faces a radical twists and surprises throughout the course of the film. The film moves a rather slow pace but at the same time, presents a gripping atmosphere and Anderson's screenplay. And let's not forget the engaging music score by Jonny Greenwood.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is certainly what I call a true cinematic masterpiece. Blessed by the astounding direction and writing by Paul Thomas Anderson, and the arresting performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, this film is an endearing piece of work that is bound to go down as a classic possibly within the next decade."

","I feel hyperbolic calling this film perfect but I'm inevitably going to do it anyway.<br/><br/>There will be blood is a snapshot into the equal parts, toxic and the prosperous start of capitalism in the industrialized west, and lays out all the hideous notes it bears. This foray into greed is wonderfully personified by Daniel day lewis' aptly named ""Daniel Plainview"", who leaves no scenery unchewed.<br/><br/>Whilst I've seen plenty of deconstructions of the systems we live in and capitalism in a number of movies; in varying degrees of subtly, TWBB remarkably manages to take a nuanced look at this old theme. The film pits capitalism and organized (cultish) religion against one another illustrating the uncanny similarities between one another.<br/><br/>It's difficult to summarize this film in a few short words, better suited to a long form writing and in-depth discussion. However, I can say the film's themes of family, corruption, and greed is sound and all the acting is tremendous, although day lewis certainly outperforms Paul Dano, but that's to be expected, It's Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>Amazing character study of the psychology of the oil tycoons of the early 20th century.

When summoned to a small community by a young preacher he sets forth preparing for an oil drill. Complications arise when his son loses his hearing during a freak accident. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson whose vision of the Christian evangelism may offend despite its somewhat honest viewpoint. This continues Anderson's fantastic directional career, which includes Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love. Powerful performance by Day-Lewis who portrays a hard working man hindered by brokenness and disappointment. Paul Dano is effective as a wayward preacher whom attempts to persuade Lewis to join his Church but ultimately forced into a blunt revelation in the conclusion. Lewis's son is first played by Dillon Freasier whose dedication is hindered by his eventual handicap. He will marry and part ways with his ruthless father. Kevin J.

","Find the more complete and elaborate review in the ""external reviews"" section under ""The Steve Pulaski Message Board.""<br/><br/>The opening scene of Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood focuses on rebelling against the conventions of verbocentrism, which places dialog and conversation in the forefront of what is occurring on screen. As a result, it places most of its emphasis on the delightful musicality of the environment into which we are plunged. The effect is minimalist and unsettling, as we, the audience, are somewhat used to information dumps in the openings of films, where we're given background information on characters and situations. There Will Be Blood focuses on the sounds of this region and, in turn, creates a decided emphasis on brief sounds that interject themselves in the mix of long term silence.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an ambitious prospector at the turn of the 1900's, working to turn a small Californian village into an industrialized boomtown by constructing an enormous and profitable oil rig to assure financial security for him and his young boy. The only soul that somewhat stands in his way for making that a reality is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), who owns the land in the location of which he is mining in. Eli is a theatrical pastor for a church, where he is renowned in the community for extracting the devil from the souls of people.<br/><br/>Because the characters of Daniel and Eli are often very thinly developed, known only by the descriptions of a select few adjectives, one is more inclined to view them allegorically than as characters, even though we spend over two and a half hours with them. There Will Be Blood largely positions itself to be a big parable on the prolonged result of greed and self-interest in American capitalist business, a certain pessimistic inevitability, as this film views it as. In that case, Daniel is clearly representative of the greed side where he'll do anything to make a quick buck, as many of us, ourselves, can perhaps recall doing. His desperation is almost cloaked because of his unbridled ambition and persistency, even when almost irreparable drawbacks come in his way, such as a catastrophic explosion of one of his oil rigs.<br/><br/>With that, Eli comes with the dual side of the capitalist business, which is religion or morality, specifically personal integrity. Whether or not Eli, himself, is an ethical and honest pastor is moot; he represents the morally just, ethical, and fair part many capitalist businessmen claim to incorporate in their business decisions, though the end result results in largely questionable accounts for how much ethics played apart into such a decision. Throughout the film, the two sides pose an intriguing dichotomy that, in turn, makes up the larger part of American business - the constant struggle to remain profitable, ambitious, and ever-changing whilst choosing to stick to, or simply refuse, the guidance via a moral compass.<br/><br/>Moreover, Anderson, and the immensely talented crew in the sound editing department, clearly present themselves as a fan of layered sound, juggling various audiotracks at once. This, in turn, provides the audience with a cacophony to go along with the visual decadence.<br/><br/>The soundtrack enhances the film greatly, speaking from a musical perspective, largely because it's not concerned with cheap pathos nor affirmation of the occurrences on screen, but because it adds to the film so nonchalantly that you might even forget it's there. Consider the scene where Daniel rides horseback and scouts the endless amounts of pure virgin land that he wants to use for another unionized oil rigging pipeline. During this montage, the score is more playful than it ever has been, playing layered and eclectic sounds that match the events on screen because, much like they are, it's bouncy and moves incredibly quickly. It almost makes you, if for a moment, forget how immersive Robert Elswit's cinematography is throughout the entire film, as it's most captured with beautiful wide-angles that soak in the luscious, if desolate, Californian scenery.<br/><br/>Finally, there are the equally unforgettable aspects of the performances, particularly by Day-Lewis, who proves his ability to emerge from being a total recluse in the often public eye of Hollywood, take a curiously layered role filled with intrigue and human complexities, knock it out of the park on every level, and quickly descend into the realm of obscurity from which he emerged. Anderson gives Day-Lewis the best material to work with in terms of being a direct, yet ambiguous, character, and there's Day-Lewis unbelievably natural talent of method acting. Words almost fail to describe and accurately pinpoint how convincing he is; you simply need to witness it.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean Paul Dano's work should go unnoticed either. Dano is an actor that, for years, to this day, has been involved in fascinating, low-key films that emphasize character-weirdness and emotionally complexities and vapidness all in one role, and it's criminal to see him never get Academy Award-level recognition for any of his work. To hold your ground alongside arguably the greatest, most involved actor of this generation is no easy thing to do, and the fact Dano, somebody who is far from a household name in American cinema, does so in a manner that channels Day-Lewis's level of conviction in a surprisingly strong manner is astonishing.<br/><br/>At two and half hours, it's easy to miss all that There Will Be Blood has to offer, though I think I can break down the basics fairly easily. The film gets us to analyze the often dichotomous relationship between devout faith and gritty business that places itself precariously on the idea of American capitalist business and, through the use of sound and cinematography, keeps the audience in an discomforting position as it proposes discomforting questions and points."
"eabakkum","6","0","1","8 September 2015"," Based on the book??
","In fact, my interest in the film ""There will be blood"" was aroused because they announce (fellow-foreigners, this is one-sixteenth of a pound), that it is based on the book Oil by Upton Sinclair. And I should add in the same breath, that this claim is misleading. In this review I want to compare the film and its professed source of inspiration, the book. The film tells the story of an oilman, who is smart enough to succeed in business, but who also suffers from a uncontrollable rage. He is adamant (the very first insect). He murders a subordinate, and disposes of the body. At the end of the film, he also murders a priest. Requital is near, for hell is torrid. Unfortunately, I don't see the point. The story does not contain any mental challenges. To be fair, the film deserves credit with inciting me to read Oil, in a Dutch translation from 1937. Joke to make this text more palatable: a man visits his psychiatrist. He complains: ""Each night I dream about English films. But what really irritates me are those Dutch subtitles"". The book of Sinclair does better than the film. In the book the oilman is a straightforward business man, who loves his work. The main purpose of the narrative is to show the adverse influence of capitalism on society. For it separates the people into two camps, the haves and the have-nots. The mutual relations polarize (=what penguins see with). The oilman and other rich people bribe the state, so that it will serve their interests. And the workers receive a miserable wage. This creates hostility, and brings the oilman into conflict with the emerging trade unions. Sinclair tries to show that everybody suffers from this system. The poor live in destitute conditions, and above all lack leisure time. The rich lead meaningless lives, while trying to impress each other with their luxury. Joke: a millionaire summons his servant: ""James, drive the fish under the bridge. It starts to rain"". Sinclair also describes how the social-democrats and the Leninists try to oppose the system. I don't know if Sinclair supported the socialist ideology, but I find his narrative fairly objective. In fact Sinclair portrays the oilman in such a way, that I like him. His character is not bad by nature. It is the system, that forces him to use harsh and even illegal methods. I believe that this message is worth reflecting upon, for it contains an element of truth. American never liked socialism, and they were right. But still capitalism needs to be reformed. Riddle: do you know a book with a sad ending? My deposit book. Perhaps now you understand why I dislike the film makers, who fooled me into buying their DVD. If there are merits in the film that justify its recommendation, I don't see them. Don't hesitate to leave a comment. I love it."

","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a man of competition, greed, family, and of course oil. Daniel starts off as an ordinary prospector and ends up a millionaire. This movie shows his greedy evolution as he buys land uses it and becomes more and more greedy, while at the same time becoming more and more wealthy. The end of this movie was particularly powerful. I won't spoil it but wow. This really had me thinking for a long time. All the other actors of course do great and make the movie what it is, but by far the biggest thing about the movie is Daniel. It's his movie, and he's in almost every scene. It shows his evolution as well as the evolution of those around him. Not to mention Day-Lewis gives a monumental performance in this movie. The movie also contains lot's of long moments without dialog and work to put the atmosphere of the movie together. The movie is epic. It's an amazing narrative into the rise of a 1910s oil man."

","A stunningly original piece of film-making punctuated by two of modern day cinemas most explosive and intense performances, There Will Be Blood is the crowning moment in famed director Paul Thomas Anderson's career and an epic that rewards multiple re-watches due to its weighty and potent subject matters from oil, religion and perhaps most importantly the art of seepage explained in layman terms.<br/><br/>TWBB is almost unclassifiable as it's a film overflowing with ideas and possibilities, a sea of brain oil just bubbling below the surface. It's a dramatic epic that sees the rise of oil man Daniel Plainview in the early beginnings of the industry in the United States, yet it's also a film filled with personal pain and angst, a meditation of religion and faith and a showcase for the incredible flair Anderson has as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Watched in a high definition format it's undeniable that Anderson and D.O.P Robert Elswit created a film with images that live long in the memory, capturing a barren landscape that starts to brim to life with a living breathing oil lead economy. Whether it be stunning night time captured oil field fires, the beautiful surrounds of the California coastline or the sight of preacher Eli Sunday being dragged through the oil slicks by the scruff of his neck, TWBB's images accompanied by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood's criminally underrated score create a vibe unlike anything seen before or since in cinema, that's only heightened by powerhouse acting turns.<br/><br/>In the role that rightfully saw him claim the Best Actor Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis delivers one of cinemas most rounded and fully formed acting turns as driven by the lure of success Daniel Plainview. Plainview is an at times despicable creation that slowly morphs into a human being we can no longer justifiably support and his journey to the darkness of regret and anger is something to behold. While Lewis is and always will be the biggest star of this show, what elevates TWBB even further to its near perfect status is that of the star making turn of Paul Dano, who possesses an immense amount of energy into his religious zealot Eli Sunday, a man of faith who clashes with Daniel's morals and plans more than once, in turn allowing one of cinemas great and unlikely rivalries to flourish. Taking nothing from Lewis's performance, Dano is unquestionably a support that only but heightened an already great central turn.<br/><br/>TWBB is a film that will alienate some viewers with its uneasy and unnerving tone but for all those that get swept away in the grand tale of the American Dream told in a way we'll never see again, TWBB will act as an unforgettable and much talked about all-time favourite.

"bryce80100","10","0","1","19 May 2015"," A partial analysis of There Will Be Blood
","Paul Thomas Anderson's film ""There Will Be Blood"" has a lot to offer for filmmakers looking to improve their craft. Even after 5 views over the last year, I still don't think I have a handle on everything this film has to offer. We all know Daniel Day-Lewis won an Academy Award for his performance as Daniel Plainview, an ""oil man"" hell-bent on striking oil and ensuring the failure of his competitors. It also won awards for it's original score and phenomenal sound design. I'm not going to review this film from a critic's standpoint but rather I am going to dissect it and find out all I can to make me a better filmmaker.<br/><br/>The film opens with a wide-angle shot of the desert accompanied by a sinister tone that lets us know this ""world"" is an unfriendly and dangerous world. This is California, 1898, Anderson makes us curious about a man who is in a deep well chipping away at the bedrock. Why is he alone? What is he looking for? Subconsciously we ask these questions to ourselves and this pulls us in deeper into the world of the play. What are the rules of this world? This is an unsafe world, it is a sinister world where friends are hard to come by. It is a dirty, dry world. Nobody is clean, everybody is guilty of something on some level. This is a hostile world.<br/><br/>The use of dynamite and the subsequent explosion are major ""plantings"" which will be paid off later. Plainview breaks his leg and manages to pull himself and as we soon learn he drags himself all the way back to town (Quentin Tarantino commented on this as a brilliant use of ""ellipses"", meaning we are told something vastly important without the filmmaker needing to show us i.e. Daniel Plainview made it all the way back to town, crawling, and that tells us we are dealing with someone whose determination transcends that of most people). The sequence comes to a close with a return to the beginning wide shot of the desert and we are reminded that this world is unsafe and sinister through the use of sound.<br/><br/>In the next sequence we are introduced again to the main character by seeing his name being written ""Daniel Plainview"". Again this creates curiosity in us, we are still yet to see him close up and we are still making assumptions and decisions about this man. Anderson was brilliant in making oil seem like a character in its own right. All these human-beings are servants to it. It's like the wicked king that rules with an iron fist and shows mercy to know one (more on this theme later). This is where the brilliant use of sound comes in. The machinery is accompanied by a low tone which creates a feeling of drudgery and danger...as if something bad is about to happen (think Jaws). Brilliantly, Anderson places a rope being lowered into the ground, it looks just like a noose, and is a simple foreshadow that something bad is indeed about to happen. The rope was not placed where it was and found itself in the final cut of the film for no reason. A man is killed and we are introduced to his baby, whom Daniel adopts and names him H.W. One of the major plantings of the film happens here. H.W. is sitting in a basket as Daniel stares at him hesitantly. In our progression of cathexis with the main character, we begin to have a more positive feeling towards him because look, he's taking that child under his wing, he has some redeemable qualities about him. Our cathexis with the character at this point has some negative and some positive. Who is the main Character? It is Daniel Plainview."

","**LITTLE TO NO SPOILERS** <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007)<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson .<br/><br/>Saw this for the first time yesterday.......Jesus Christ. .<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is the story of Daniel Plainview, an Oil Man, and his rise to power. He drills oil, is great at speaking, is far from religious, hates people, loves to succeed, loves to watch others fail, and is incredibly manipulative. .<br/><br/>This is gonna be an odd comparison so bare with me: this felt similar, for me, to Boyhood. Not necessarily the film itself, but the feeling I had watching this was exact to the feeling I had watching Boyhood. I thought with both, this movie is a masterpiece, that I'll probably never watch again. It's nearly 3hrs long and its very noticeable while watching. But when you look at it as a whole, Its absolutely incredible. Daniel Day Lewis is a god of an actor. He, as Daniel Plainview, I think is, or at least one of, the best performances of all time. Paul Dano is extremely creepy in this. Dillon Freasier, who played Daniel Plainview's son, was SO good and his story in this was so heartbreaking. From the head hit his life starts going downhill and when the train scene happens and abandonment happens is when I started to hate Daniel Plainview. Which if your supposed to by the end, and I think you are, the movie made you slowly disagree, then dislike, then truly hate Daniel Plainview by the end and it did a great job at it. Although I did love him in that final bowling alley shot and that confrontation with Eli was perfection. ""I am a false prophet and God is a superstition!"" I also loved the score so much, and It just gives the feel of the insidious slow turn to crazy. The cinematography was great and especially the scene of the burning oil site was complete eye porn. I knew from the first 15 minutes of no dialogue as Daniel Plainview climbs out that oil well after falling and breaking his leg, that this movie was gonna be great. Overall, Daniel Day Lewis. .<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood gets an: A+ <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Follow me on Instagram @KillFillM for more Movie Reviews! Thanks for reading:)"

Many reviews do already cover the plot and the praise or the critic.<br/><br/>Therefore I won't go into details.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie simply is that it requires multiple viewings! When I first saw this movie in German (bad idea since it is dubbed) with a friend I was bored as hell.<br/><br/>In the end I thought that the costumes and locations where great, everything really looked like from that period but that there was no story and an annoying score.<br/><br/>How does it come I rate this with 10 and why should I tell you that this is probably the best movie I have ever seen together with Raging Bull, The Thin Red Line, Barry Lyndon etc.?<br/><br/>Like these movies it is very slow and requires you to love movies that much that you don't want to see a generic movie with a predictable boring story but rather have a realistic, emotional experience in a unique way.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie again and in original language please since Daniel's accent is one of the most important aspects of this movie (and quite balanced not like in Lincoln or Gangs of New York - no offense) you will find yourself wondering how the hell did they do it?<br/><br/>How the hell fits everything together, is believable and covers the problems of the current society and also of the human history that well without forcing it too much?

","Daniel Day-Lewis managed to leave me gaping after checking the most magnificent cinematic performances that I could expected to see. Was stunning, a unique film, a so great acting that gave Daniel Plainview life, a strong personality, lovely, admirable.<br/><br/>There is a long time that I get so admired in a movie by such beautiful performances, completely real, able to take us into the story, we can penetrate into the soul of the projection and we feel alongside both Daniels, feeling the moments of drama,and comedies lived by him, that is presented to us in this wonderful film.<br/><br/>Let me highlight here three scenes that i won't never forget, and say that I had never seen anything like it in any other movie, in time line, the first scene is when Eli ask for Plainview for his promised $ 5,000 and Daniel gives a lesson in Eli in that moment of so much frustration and problems. After that, comes the unforgettable Daniel's baptism scene, and the final scene of the meeting of Plainview with Eli, the performances was magnificent, both actors (Lewis and P. Dano) gave their characters real feelings that prove how fantastic actors they are, and how they must be admired as such.<br/><br/>The film is a masterpiece, an adaptation of the books that marked the cinema and that should be checked by all movie lovers. In the film as well, we can understand the history of oil exploration in the United States in the beginning of twentieth century, we can understand how the prospectors of that time had interests that often exceeded the limits of reason, the film makes this clear with the scene where Plainview tells his fake brother of the hatred in his soul, and the competitive spirit that he has, a fantastic scene. Who hasn't seen yet, are wasting time!"

","If you want to understand what real acting is, watch this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis is scary good. Paul Dano is outstanding. The relation between their characters is captivating. It makes you wonder who will win over the other one. The father and son relationship between Daniel and his son is something I haven't seen before. The photography is total perfection. It's breathtaking. Paul Thomas Anderson did a fabulous directing job. All the slow travellings make the decors seem infinite. The time period is very interesting. It's a good movie to learn more about the oil prospecting and life at the turn of the century. I was so scared of this movie, but I'm glad I watched it. It's now one of my favourite of all time. If you have the DVD, take a look at the extras, it's very interesting. You won't want to blink. Fasten your seat belt and enjoy."
"aciessi","10","0","2","7 February 2015"," You Will Be Amazed.
","Many people consider this the magnum opus of P.T.A. Many others call it the greatest film of the 2000's. Has it stood the test of time? Are they right? Well, lets face it, P.T.A. is one of the most incredible directors of the last 50 years, in my opinion. Considering most of his early films were overlooked, I'm content with how much respect this one has. Because, simply put, it's a masterpiece. An American epic, of the same caliber as Citizen Kane. It's a study on the effects of greed, and how the rise to power can sometimes completely corrupt and demonize the human spirit. Daniel Day Lewis.. it goes without saying, but this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano is also equally amazing, but unfortunately stands in the shadows of DDL. It's also, filmed so masterfully, as if Kubrick rose from the grave. In fact, the whole thing really reminded me of an Orson Wells/Stanley Kubrick hybrid. As different as his films remain in retrospect, expect nothing but the absolute best from a P.T.A film."

"rajatdahiyax","7","0","2","27 August 2014"," There was blood, indeed!!!!
","Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson steps outside his contemporary world of dysfunctional Angelenos to explore a very different dysfunctional man -- an oil pioneer whose trailblazing spirit is equaled only by his murderous ambition. There Will Be Blood is Anderson's loose adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair, and it focuses its attentions on Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a miner who happens upon black gold during a disastrous excavation that ends in a broken leg. Pulling himself up from the bowels of the earth, both literally and metaphorically, Plainview embarks on a systematic and steadfast approach to mastering the oil business. Using plain-spoken and straightforward language, Plainview launches a campaign to convince small-town property owners they should let him drill their land. Without him, they won't have the equipment to access the profit beneath their feet. He builds an empire this way - - and gradually becomes obsessed with the intrinsic value of power, growing increasingly irascible and paranoid in the process. Plainview meets his match in Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a teenage preacher in the small California town of Little Boston, whose brother tipped Plainview off to the town's plentiful supply of untapped oil. To fully reap the benefits of the land, Plainview must suffer the opposing whims of this ""prophet,"" whose legitimacy is questionable at best. And it's unclear if either man is prepared to pay the humiliating price the other wants to exact. There Will Be Blood features an anachronistic soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, and it was shot in the same town where the James Dean epic Giant was filmed."

","One of the best films in decades is a film about an oilman and the transformation he experiences. Daniel-Day Lewis gives perhaps the greatest performance by an actor in a leading role of all time as Daniel Plainview, an oil man who in the late 1800's adopts a boy who is the son of his deceased oil partner, and goes to a vast land in California owned by a bizarre Christian family who make a business deal with Daniel in order for him to drill oil. The man in charge of the deal is Eli Sunday, an insanely crazy preacher played brilliantly by Paul Dano. Plainview deals with many natural resources as well. The procedure to extract oil off the land doesn't go as planned. Many problems occur and the relationship between Daniel and Eli is very rough. Through the drilling and work Daniel experiences, he becomes very greedy, vengeful, and dark. The honest and caring businessman we see in the beginning transforms into a unique character from the brilliant mind of Paul Thomas Anderson. Anderson's story is so unique and focuses on one character the whole time mainly. With a story that has very few characters and a plot taking place form the late 1800's to the early 1900's he does a perfect job intriguing us to see how Daniel Plainview becomes a monster. What's interesting is that you'll root for him to succeed and become as vengeful as possible. I know I did. The reasoning behind this is that Daniel Plainview is such a brilliant character and is acted superbly and eccentrically by Daniel-Day Lewis. The brilliant story and fantastic directing by Paul Thomas Anderson is just a set-up for one of the best acting jobs in the history of art to be unleashed like a dog on rabies. DDL's outgoing anger, loud yelling, running, and daunting facial expressions come at you like a train and there's no way to resit his amazement. 'There Will Be Blood' is one of the decades strongest films due to how it succeeds in every category. The scenery and cinematography capture the film's beauty and show the time period it's in to deliver a visual appeal to this monumental work of art. PTA gives his finest film yet with amazing directing and writing and gives us one of cinema's all- time greatest hits. There will be blood in the story, but there will be history from this classic film."

","I have only recently found Paul Thomas Andersons movies and at first no matter what movie you start with it makes you start question yourself after the credits. Paul Thomas Anderson is great at letting his characters speak for themselves. Its as if they command his directing and not him commanding their acting but of course that isn't the case which is why he is so well respected in the film industry.<br/><br/>There will be blood would not disappoint a movie fan but to someone who catches it on TV or rents it at their local DVD store will be deeply disappointed as it is not an easy movie to watch. Just like all Paul Thomas Andersons movies its not all as appears and it seems complicated but in actual fact its very simple if you think. Paul Thomas Anderson always focuses on a small group of people and a certain point in the lives. To us in the real world their situation may seem irrelevant in the grand scheme of things or just ordinary but Paul Thomas Anderson makes their situation stand out and that's why movie fans love him.<br/><br/>The acting talents in there will be blood were incredible. One of the best performances iv ever seen by Daniel Day Lewis he was very convincing and Paul Dano was mind-blowing as well.<br/><br/>So If you like a light hearted comedy then you've probably guessed this isn't for you but if you like a bit of challenge in your movie viewing then watch this!"
"willcundallreview","8","0","1","22 April 2014"," Fine piece led by a fine actor
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is an excellent drama about an oil tycoon who's ruthless business dealings and constant family troubles make him go well, kind of insane. Fantastically portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis it brings out a whole new type of drama that can be fast when it wants too, and then goes into complete silence just like that. The story is Great and below I will say why I think this not only great, but also why it deserves all it's acclaim.<br/><br/>The story is a fine one and also one you wouldn't just make up quickly, It blends dark tones into parts of the film where they are all smiles, but behind the smiles lay's death and deceit and all the other vices in a late 19th century/early 20th century. I think although it is quite slow as a movie it kind of doesn't matter as drama seeps through and makes this an excellent watch for anyone who enjoys a thrilling dramatic piece. Sometimes the endless dialogue can get slightly repetitive and maybe just maybe ever so boring but as the film goes on the words can mean so much more.<br/><br/>I felt the strong hand the director Paul Thomas Anderson used to guide this project was a fine grip indeed and he makes this film glide along smoothly and as if it was a live documentary. We also see his smart screenplay abilities and what he can do and well, it is plain to see he is one of those special director/screenwriter people who just know when a film is this good. I even loved how the film looked with it's vast sets and beautiful western USA like town, the supporting cast's makeup is brilliant too and I think more shout outs need to be given to makeup and hairstylists in cinema.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is just at his best and for a man with 3 Oscars(for this film being one of them) he breathes everything an aspiring actor should want to be, changing his emotions at the flick of a button and speaking with a soft but strict tone in this film makes him one of the best ever. I loved Paul Dano as the evangelical priest who is against all of Day- Lewis's ventures and even forces him at one point to repent, the cast then behind these two are fairly basic and just Day-Lewis steals the show. I would have liked to have seen more of Ciaran Hinds in this as his skills are under seen and he appears very rarely.<br/><br/>With any film that is this highly rated it is hard to say anything that is wrong with it as yes, it is slow and most people complaining simply found it boring. The film is dramatic as I have said and indeed is slow as I also said but what makes this a so very very good is the beautiful way in which Little Boston the main town in the film is transformed from an average little town to a dark place nearly even run solely by the oil companies. I do think some parts are possibly unnecessary and could be why I don't think this film was near flawless by any mean.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film if not just for the fantastic acting performance from Daniel and is a must for all aspiring actors. Seeing it also to see Anderson's fine touch is a reason to watch it and if you like straight up Drama's then you will enjoy this, or more be amazed by it and it's complex view on greed and anger, and then trying to deal with the repercussions. One last compliment is the way in which you have no idea what will happen next and is a wholly unpredictable epic of a film.<br/><br/>A Great film I give it a rating of 8/10 of which I felt it was just about a Great and Excellent film, well worth a watch and don't read too many reviews because this film is all about how you found it, not How I or any other reviewer's did, yes it is 158 minutes but that fly's be if you are truly enjoying this fine piece of cinema."

"zdog26","6","0","3","31 July 2013"," What?
","During my viewing of this film, I didn't know exactly what to make of it. The first hour and a half are fantastic. Loved it. The last hour is what killed the film for me. Paul Thomas Anderson's films seem to run far too long on scripts that play sort of like old Scorsese films; movies where the characters live life, not progress through a plot. While it is totally OK to do this, the film has to be able to hold the interest of the audience. Taxi Driver and Raging Bull both achieved this, There Will Be Blood did not. The last hour was full of confusing scenes that didn't match the tone of the first part of the movie. The conversation at the end between Eli and Daniel left me scratching my head. Why did Daniel act so strangely? Another little issue I had was that the music wasn't used in a way that added to the film. Instead, it left me wondering why it was being used in scenes that would have benefited from dead silence and the music itself wasn't that good either. Day- Lewis most definitely deserved the Oscar but the movie is hardly the best film of the decade. Too long, tonally inconsistent, and, quite frankly, a bit pretentious. Maybe it will get better on repeat viewings?"
"PimpinAinttEasy","5","0","8","15 July 2013"," A trivial film ....
","This film is laughable. The dialogs are puerile (Bastard in a basket, I drink your milkshake). And to make things worse, Paul Dano who plays one of the principal characters in the movie is just plain awful. My god, here is an actor who is worse than Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar. Dano came across as a young American yuppie trying hard to look like a fundamentalist. Dano is not helped by his very slight frame which he fails to use to his advantage. Pacino had a very slight frame in Dog Day Afternoon which he used to his advantage and turned in a powerhouse performance. It was just painful after a while with Dano and Daniel Day Lewis shouting at the top of their voices.<br/><br/>The whole film could have been over in 90 minutes. But instead, PTA made a lot of extras get down knee deep in mud and roll around in it to show what greed could do to a human being. He blew a lot of stuff up to show how humans abuse the earth. I mean, if you want to make a grand American movie, go the whole distance like Coppola did. A director should know the right actors to cast in his film. Paul Dano is just another De Caprio.<br/><br/>It is a nice film to look at. But PTA was rubbing it in all the time, what with the sinister sounding music and the epic visuals. He had to resort to such gimmickry to create effect because he is a poor writer who cannot write one good line of dialog to save his life.<br/><br/>(1/10)"

But, you know PTA!<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic, but I really think he over-acted towards the end. Paul Dano is better, although his character was ill-conceived. Dillon Freasier fails to impress.<br/><br/>Music is very good & ingenious. I loved the melodious & instrumental music. Mainly when it catches up during some intense scenes. Very good. Wonderful setup, rhetoric dialogs & fervid acting - that is what this aggressive film is all about. Some sequences will take you by surprise & will stay with you forever. A good 6.3/10!<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: I will not recommend this to a casual cinema-holic, as I do of all PTA films. But, if you are serious & want to experience a bold plot, narration, direction & performance, There Will Be Blood is available in Blu-Ray & DVD.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

However, even though I liked the film, it was not the masterpiece I expected it to be.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the +'s. Indeed, Day-Lewis was excellent, while Dano was also a good supporter. The cinematography was impressive and I think I quite liked Anderson's style (it's his first movie I've seen). And of course the last scene was incredible.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the worst thing about ""There Will be Blood"" is the lack of a compact story.

","Like so many great ideas for movies that have come about, once they turn into screen written form, they fall apart. I won't spoil the ending here, but the building conflict between the two main characters came to an unsatisfying ending for me. More importantly, the worst part about this movie was its musical score. I cannot think of another movie, including B-movies and spoofs, that included background music that was so distracting to watching and listening to the actors on screen. The drama and mood that the score's composer tried to create was simply not a match for the accompanying story line to which it was associated. Not only that, but the sound editors on this movie should be sent back to film school, because the volume of the music was consistently too loud to hear what the actors were saying. All in all, this was a very disjointed effort, and a shameful waste of Daniel Day Lewis's immense talents."

","One of the most boring films I have ever seen. I honestly fail to see why this won anything.<br/><br/>Some films are long because they have a lot to say. Some films are long because so much happens in the story that to shorten it would be criminal.<br/><br/>This film is long because it lacks editing. It seems that on every occasion in which there was a dramatic pause in conversation or some intense close up on Daniel Day Lewis' moustache... it went on for about twice as long as was necessary to convey the point. If I was describing this film to a blind man in real time it would sound like this: 'nothing's happening nothing's happening nothing's happening nothing's happening oh, his son's deaf now'...<br/><br/>The film was just in no rush to tell its story, yet for one so long it didn't seem to have much to actually tell. As a book the story would be done within a hundred pages.<br/><br/>This was the first indication that the direction was not to my taste. The second was the massively repetitive music. I genuinely had to mute it at one point because it was just a 2 second drum loop which had me grinding my teeth for five minutes. Why anyone would choose to put that music in a serious film is beyond me.<br/><br/>The description of the film was that it portrayed a self made businessman. At no point did it say he was a moron. Every time something went wrong I was left thinking... why? Most of it just didn't seem even remotely logical. 'Yes... I'll light the fuse on the high explosives and then attempt to retrieve my tools.' Maybe if Mr Moron had just made a second trip down to light it he wouldn't have nearly killed himself.<br/><br/>I'd call it a comedy of errors but... it wasn't funny."

We waited outside in the cold and rain for a good two hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestly say, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me.

","There Will be Blood is a film that has an outstanding reputation, one that perhaps it deserves in some respects, but not in others. It's certainly a great film - well acted, well directed, good plot. But at times there are a few problems with it. <br/><br/>TWBB tells the story of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a prospector who will stop at nothing and destroy anything in his way in the pursuit of money. Initially, he starts as a mineral prospector who finds Gold. At the same time, he has an accident and breaks his leg in the middle of nowhere. Not a man to be stopped, he hauls himself into a town to collect the money and put his name to the mine. We know immediately that nothing will stop him. <br/><br/>Just a few years later, we see that he has moved on from gold to oil, in a fine cut that shows how quickly times changed between the late 1800's and the early 1900's. In another accident, Daniel acquires a step son that he raises to be his own. <br/><br/>Again, years later, and Daniel is now very successful. He finds a huge oil field on a ranch and leases it. But, it's almost too big for him and slowly greed and madness start to take over. We watch as this businessman turns into a relentless, unforgiving monster who turns on everyone in the end. <br/><br/>This film is another example of the American Dream gone wrong. But, instead of providing us with a hero, it just presents Plainview as he is - a monster who no one is supposed to like. I think that was a good way to go with the plot. You often hear people saying that they need to like a person or empathise with them for a film to be watchable. I prefer to just have a character that you can focus on, good or bad. Plainview is bad, and the film's dark plot works far more because he never gets redemption, and is never good. And there is no doubt in my mind that Daniel Day-Lewis acts Plainview to perfection. He starts as a soft spoken man and winds up a ruthless monster, and no one could have done better than Lewis. <br/><br/>The film also works because of its first rate location, and some very good directing. The opening shots of the film do set the standard, and throughout there are good shots and vast, open locations. <br/><br/>There are a few downsides to this film that prevent it from achieving total greatness. Firstly, the plot is almost too much about Plainview. We see his character through and through, but at the expense of every other character in the film. We never really know much about the son. We don't know anything about those who work with Plainview. And we never really know the true motives of the man who pretends to be Plainview's brother. Also, no questions are asked about the brother's death, even though his disappearance would be entirely noticeable. <br/><br/>Secondly, the Church and people in it are a bit too clichéd. I think Anderson was trying to make Eli (the religious leader) into a match for Plainview. But instead, it's just too clichéd, too fake. It would have worked more if the Church had been entirely normal. <br/><br/>Fortunately though, any problems with this film are hidden by Daniel Day Lewis, who is totally compelling and believable as the ruthless oil man. The overall message of the film isn't lost at all, and what we have here is a relentless story of greed and madness. <br/><br/>A film that borders on greatness."

","IMO, this film deals with the destructive mindset of someone determined to succeed at any cost. Nothing and no one that stands in way of the success is spared, himself included. It's the raw mindset of industrial revolution. It's the relentless driving force but also a destructive force. It could be argued that success demands such mindset since for one person to rise, he has to find ways of exploiting others. To do that he has to let go of human emotions. Yet his success has no goal. It's success for sake of success of one person at cost of many.

","Assignment 5-4 Film Appreciation Akofa Sikpe. Professor Omar Olamari 40-25-11<br/><br/>The theme of the movie ""There will be blood"" story is about greed. The movie ""there will be blood"" is loosely based on the Upton Sinclair novel, oil. This movie tells the story of a silver miner-turned-oilman on a ruthless quest for wealth during Southern California's oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ""The movie there will be blood"" is about ruthless charismatic oil prospector. He was driven to succeed by his extreme dislike of others and psychological need to see any and all competitors fail. The major Actor in the movie ""There will be blood ""was Paul Dano as faithful Eli Sunday and Dillon Freaser as Daniel Plainview. Daniel Plainview moves his operation to California and begins manipulating and exploiting the local landowners into selling him their property of oil-rich land for cheap price. Daniel Plainview also used his young adopted son H.W. to project the image of a caring family man. He gains the cooperation of almost all the locals with lofty promises to build schools and cultivate the land to make their community thrive. Daniel Plainview is an oil man. He spends his days harvesting the money from discovered oil. Dillon Freaser did a very good job with this movie. He was very into his character and was also very natural. One of the interesting parts in this story is the challenge Daniel Plainview faces embarking on his latest oil prospect. Dillon fraeser transforms into a character that simply dominates the film from beginning to end. I think this movie was an absolute masterpiece. The movie ""There will be blood"" shows me just how involving character acting can be. I believe this movie was made for those of us who appreciate a good artistic approach to movie making. Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano were Phenomenal in this movie. For the lighting in this film the director was able and did a good job on controlling the source and the direction of lighting for the purpose of expanding the limits of the film and it flat lighting serves to minimize the sense of depth. For example when the man was digging the hole in the movie the lighting was very clear and natural I felt like I was presence. Also they did very well in employing different camera angles to add variety and to create the sense visual between the shot. The camera angle in this film was able to communicate special kinds of emotional attitudes and dramatic information."

","Daniel Day-Lewis was just phenomenal in this movie in fact without him there will be a lot of sleeping audiences. As a matter of fact this actor basically made the movie, he played the role of the very greedy and rotten man with a lot of ambitions flawlessly. This is a epic movie but a boring one as well, but thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis this film really is but to some degree still pretty darn engrossing. This is one of those films that isn't for everyone, but it does have it's target audiences. The premise of this movie is greed and greed spreads in this film, starting from Daniel Day-Lewis's character who is a oil tycoon. Now I praised Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in this, it's time to move onto Paul Dano who plays the preacher kid. Now this guy was very intriguing to watch and entertaining as well, besides Day-Lewis he put on a performance that really made this boring movie watchable. This movie is about acting and Paul Dano can act, he was really incredible in this. Just make sure to be fully awake when watching this cause it can put you to sleep, but it's a film worth watching. Daniel manipulates the town's people with prosperity while Eli counters that with manipulation of faith and the clash between these two characters drives the film as well. This is a actors movie, and if you want to see amazing acting with a slightly entertaining and yet engrossing plot, like I said this film is worth watching.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

But as a stand alone, I really can't complain about this movie because it's intriguing.<br/><br/>This is about an oil tycoon who is very greedy and is a liar as well. He uses a young boy H.W to help him push his point through. He also has to go against a preacher who opposes his work.<br/><br/>The acting is probably the best thing about this movie.

There is no tension in the movie, no real storyline, we don't care about the central character, or what happens to him.<br/><br/>How this was thought to be Oscar material tells you a lot about the Oscar process.

","I have never written a review on IMDb before. I consider myself a well rounded movie fan, if perhaps a product of my generation (i'm 28). I like movies like No Country for Old Men and Schindlers list but I also enjoy Arnie and Star Wars. There Will Be Blood annoyed me so much I felt the need to write a review.<br/><br/>I went into There Will Be Blood not knowing much, I knew it was about greed and oil, it had Daniel Day Lewis, and good reviews. I foolishly thought that it would have more of a frontier/western feel to it with a power struggle that maybe ended with a gun fight, but that's my own fault for not doing my research and not the movies.I won't go over the plot or story as many others have already.<br/><br/>What I liked was DDL and seeing the 1900s oil drilling etc, but thats honestly about it. What I didn't like was the title's promise of 'blood', now i'm not expecting a horror and I don't hold the opinion of blood making a good film, what I mean is that the title suggests a ramping up of tension and violence that is A) intrinsic to the plot and B)a major theme. It is neither, yes there WILL be blood but you're going to have to sit through 2+ hours of boring fixed camera angles, pointless horror movie music (cut over scenes of walking around or hammering posts), a confusing cast choice where one guy plays two people (I thought this was for plot reasons, but no its just because one actor backed out and casting couldn't be bothered to find another actor), a main character whose motivations and personality are a mystery (but not in an interesting mysterious way). I was expecting the tension to build and build, even toward the last 40 mins I thought it was going to happen, but it doesn't, as I said above they employ music that suggests impending violence or catastrophe, but this never matches up with what we're seeing (a montage of dull activities) and then dies as randomly as it is starts.<br/><br/>There are accidents and a bit of random violence in the middle but it will leave you questioning why its there. DDL tells his 'brother' that he is essentially a bitter angry man who hates everyone else and by default is slightly mental...which is weird because that wasn't brought to our attention in the first hour and a half and I was under the impression that he was just a successful hard working man who loved his adopted son. Yes he's going to be a little money grabbing but then we wouldn't expect anything else from someone in the oil business would we? To suddenly reveal his mental state or in fact his personality disorder that far in the movie in a casual conversation seems like they realised they had written a boring movie and in order to change gears they decided he would be a little bit mental. This results in not caring about what happens to him. If his dark side was countered by the priest whose angelic mission to build his church and save DDL from his selfish ways was the yang to DDLs Ying then it would be a balanced struggle of wills perhaps. However the priest is just as shallow and see through as Daniel so we're left with a bit of tension between two unlikable guys whose odd power struggle doesn't really have a source or a reason to it.<br/><br/>A very convoluted, overly long, boring, and confusing movie that is neither clever or artistic."

","Overall, There Will Be Blood is a film with a good opening, a few good potential moments and scenes (as with the faux brother), but it ends in near disaster. Its ending would rank as one of the worst in history (think Akira Kurosawa's Rashomom) if only the rest of the film had been stronger. Also, in no way, shape, nor form is the film an 'epic.' Other than the word 'surreal' the term epic may be the most overused and misused word in the arts. An epic is a tale that covers a great deal of history, time, and place. It also delves deeply into the characters and plot. There Will Be Blood is a series of cursory sketches that are meager and often poorly connected. I spoke of the hit and miss cinematography, but the musical scoring to this film is even worse. And, even if one were to put aside the technical lack, and the script problems, there's the acting. It's simply not good. The two main characters, Lewis and Dano have no chemistry, in the sense that their hatred of each other never seems genuine. And, while Dano is a cipher emotionally, Lewis chews scenery even more than he did as Bill The Butcher In Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. Granted, while not a great film, that film was better written than this one, but there is a certain cartoonishness in Lewis's portrayal that neuters all attempt at real drama. One cares not a damn for any of the mannekin-like characters- save perhaps for the faux brother, whose very fakeness was designed merely to show of Lewis's character's rage and psychopathy, but did nothing of the sort. It only made the faux brother's character seem slighter by his casual dismissal from Daniel's life. Also, the tale is both too linear and too sparse in development to have any real poesy. It relies not on characterization but grotesques- they aren't even caricatures. And, after the first fifteen minutes, I kept wondering what a real visionary director like Theo Angelopoulos or Michelangelo Antonioni would have done with this film's premise- even its footage, for quality editing could have severely tightened the film up, and made it less dependent upon overwrought theatrics. In essence, one can tell this was a Hollywood film, even from the first minutes of silence.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood attempts to be epic, great, and tie in with the current political zeitgeist by showing viewers the beginnings of what caused global warming. Instead, it is a meandering tale that relies on soap operatic tricks (such as Bandy's blackmailing Daniel into Eli's church- why?) that don't even have a payoff, however cheap; as well as being dull and poor in almost every filmic aspect (not unlike its twinned, wildly overpraised critical cousin, the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men). That this film got so raved over as a great piece of cinema shows how little critics and filmgoers today understand real art and/or care about it. Which scenario is worse is open for debate. This film's quality isn't."

Even a Hollywood movie requires a certain amount of plausibility. This man is so angry and maladjusted that it is hard to imagine how he could get it together to do business and make money.

I did not enjoy one minute of this film, and I'm not necessarily the type of person that dislikes this type of film. From the beginning, it does not, and cannot, grab our attention. The plot deals with a series of events that cause oil man Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to care more and more about his fortune and less about the people around him. His character, although played well, is nowhere near Day-Lewis' best work. The film is too real and hard to watch, and it drags on because there is not a single character we are really able to feel sorry for or care about. By the end, I found myself fast-forwarding just to get to the credits so I would be done with it. The ending, without spoiling, is terrible and not edifying. I couldn't believe it just ended there.

But this really isn't anything to write about.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor, but I felt he was just re-hashing his Gangs of New York role, but with a slightly smaller hat.

There was no real character development, you are just meant to follow and accept his decent in to madness and greed (not that you really saw any decent, he was just mad and greedy). Oh yeah there are other people around him somewhere, not too sure where I don't think any of them other than Eli and his brother had more than about 10 lines throughout the whole film. By the end you just didn't care what happened to any of them, but you would be surprised by the fact he was still alive at whatever age he was meant to be. I thought that at the start of the film he was in his mid 30's, but then by 1927 he would have been a very old man. There was no real sense of time in that way. One minute you're in 1901, then it's 1911 for what seems like 5 years and then your in 1927. Again the book must have large ""unfilmable"" chunks in it, but I'm not about to find out.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was the only thing of real note. I really liked it, but felt it belonged in some horror/stalk 'n' slash film.<br/><br/>This film really just goes to show how many bad films have been made of late when films like this are critically acclaimed. To me this is another ""Ryan's Daughter"" a long pointless film where nothing really happens and you don't really care either. You are just left wondering just what else you could have done with those few hours of your life you lost."
"btm1","3","0","2","25 March 2009"," Lacked explanation of the changes in the lead character's personality.
","I saw this on a large screen HDTV on Showtime. Even with a large screen TV the screen is minuscule compared to a movie theater's. Thus I could appreciate the huge vistas that must have been awesome in a theater, although on TV the effect is greatly diminished. There were some additional good things about the film, including some unusual closeups of the Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) oil man character using a pickax. Also there are a great many highly dramatic scenes that are staged and acted well.<br/><br/>The negatives, on the other hand, included a style so minimal that it was difficult to comprehend the changes in the Daniel Day Lewis character. In the initial scenes I could view the oil man as a sympathetic and even heroic character. But when his character changes drastically, we are given no explanation. It is hard to care about any of the roles in the film, except perhaps for the oil man's son, H.W.<br/><br/>Apparently, according to other reviews, the earliest scene showing Daniel in a deep hole using a pickax was to indicate he was looking for silver, and perhaps accidentally found oil just bubbling up in the deep hole he made. That was not clear to me at all.<br/><br/>Neither was his character development. The film offers no explanation or clarification of the changes he undergoes, except at one point he says that he never really liked people. When he says that, I couldn't tell whether he is being truthful or not. If we accept that explanation for his character defect (and there is no explanation of why he doesn't really like people), then that means his earlier friendly attitude and the interest he showed in his child were just put-ons to fool the suckers he was taking advantage of. But some of that earlier behavior was when no one else was around. Perhaps what the movie is trying to illustrate is that as people get wealthier they get nastier, a corollary perhaps to ""power tends to corrupt."" I really couldn't tell from the story development.<br/><br/>Despite the cutting out any explanation of the character development, the film is a bit long (2 hrs and 38 minutes). Why didn't they cut instead some of the lengthy scenes showing nothing but a character walking from one location to another?"

","I am writing without reading other comments. This movie I very much wanted to see, as the moments in 2007 quickly passed, and now in March of 2009 it is on Cable! The technical delivery of this movie to me was by way of time warner cable which offers it ""on demand"" in a cropped 4x3 condition. They broadcast it elsewhere, I think, in its full frame version, and I have seen portions of it then, including the ending conversation which I was disappointed to discover was not to occur outdoors, but in a windowless hell. ""God damn hell of a show"" figures prominently in my memory. It is not clear the level of silliness we're dealing with here. It could be very deep. I found distraction from my own flashback of when I discovered a little bowling alley in the cellar of a nondescript building in the beautiful Austrian Alps! Mr. Anderson also made Boogie Nights, which was impressively delivered cinema... I think he made magnolia, which apocalyptically delivered Aimee Mann's beautiful music. There Will Be Blood contained minimum surprises, when you come down to what the locals can expect from entrepreneurs, and preachers. The maverick's self-interest predominates and is suicidal. He needs a real family to keep him in reality. As the ending explodes into dignified music reprising that annoyingly used string quartet, after the clattering radiohead score, Daniel has just announced, ""I'm finished."" Will he in fact be held accountable for murder? Will standard oil get his pipeline? This movie could have been more educational, in case we actually want to start our own oil rig. Prospectors go mad... I'm reminded of Eureka, a Nicholas Roeg film, which was able to include women, that made a meta-medical analysis of the gold strike. I'm trying to think what I liked about this film. It may be the relationship between Paul and Daniel, the actors. The emotions neutralized in this film include love, hatred, ambition, and empathy. To witness more of how indelibly frightening Daniel Day Lewis can be, try Gangs of New York. Paul has quite a range as well, especially the way he pretended he actually had a brother."

","I knew it was about the oil business, I knew the lead actor won awards, and I vaguely remembered it was directed by Oscar BAFTA nominated Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), I just needed to see it. The film follows the rise to power for charismatic and ruthless oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Daniel Day-Lewis), driven to succeed by intense hatred of others and a psychological need to see competitors fail. Daniel is told by Paul Sunday (BAFTA nominated Paul Dano) that he lives on land where oil-rich land in Little Boston, California, so he goes to investigate, and quickly buys property by manipulating people, and sets up a well. He uses adopted son H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier) to project the image he is a family man, promising to build schools and make the community flourish. There is the point when H.W. is deafened by a oil eruption, and Daniel just gets him to see a teacher and translator, quickly solving the problem, and also showing his lack of care for anyone but himself. Greed becomes more apparent, and Daniel builds tension towards preacher Eli Sunday (also Dano), and years later, an older H.W. (Russell Harvard) has been alienated, and the film ends with Daniel's big outburst, murdering Eli. Also starring Kevin J. O'Connor as Henry, Ciarán Hinds as Fletcher, Sydney McCallister as Young Mary Sunday, David Warshofsky as H.M. Tilford, Colton Woodward as William Bandy and Colleen Foy as Adult Mary Sunday. I will be honest, for a film being two and a half hours long, I preferred the first hour to the rest, after it goes a little less interesting (well, apart from the ending), this is why I have taken away a star from the rating. Never-the-less, a brilliant story with a compelling Oscar worthy performance from Day-Lewis, with great direction by Anderson, and some good moments to catch your eye, definitely one to see. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Editing, BestSound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated BAFTA Film Award Best Cinematography, Best Music for Jonny Greenwood, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"

","As usual, I thought Daniel Day Lewis was intense and on top of his game. Unfortunately, I think the movie itself was just OK. I guess it was a shoe in with the academy because it portrayed an evil greedy oil baron and a false preacher who both more or less renounce the existence of God. Sort of parable where Dick Cheney meets some fallen televangelist. Hollywood loves stuff which portrays all corporate titans as greedy, heartless monsters, and all 'people of faith' as phony swindlers in a world without God. On a brighter note, it was very well acted and was a fairly well crafted movie. To this day, I believe Daniel Day Lewis is a superb actor. Without his intensity and talent, it would have been a much lesser movie. It's a good movie and worth seeing, and well acted. I just think the storyline and plot came up a bit short and it is a bit overrated."

The ONLY complaint I have is the score to the film doesn't see to fit.. Including the level of sound. The volume of the music was louder than most movies.

","This movie captures the ruthlessness and greed of a period in American history that is hard to imagine in this day and age. Day Lewis plays an 'Oil Man' who will stop at nothing to make his fortune. His portrayal of Daniel Plainview is mesmerising; the man is seemingly without morality when it comes to his need to win in his ambitions - and not just win, but to ensure that nobody else succeeds in the process and to point out that he has won. His mannerisms and emotions seem iron-hard and harsh and you feel that just below the surface is a constant rage. We are never enlightened as to what made this man so deeply bitter and filled with hatred and although there are occasions where he appears to fleetingly feel remorse or sadness he quickly shakes them off. His nemesis throughout the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a self-congratulating and egotistical young lay preacher and faith healer. He dogs Plainview at every turn under the guise of his church but clearly for his own financial gain and self-aggrandisement.<br/><br/>To my mind, the slow and often quiet pace of this film only enhance the insight we get into the characters and harshness of those times. Both main characters are in essence morally corrupt and despicable in their own way and it is the niave, rustic and self-inflated manipulations of Eli Sunday contrasted against the worldly-wise, devious and brutal Daniel Plainveiw that gives this film a powerful underlying feeling of menace and the eventual spiritual destruction of both men."

","I think that this movie surpassed a lot of films on a symbolic level, and Daniel Day Lewis did a great job portraying a psychotic oil man, but the plot did not make that much sense to me. And the music was too much like Dvorak for my taste. Not really avant, but just as disturbing. Actually that would be an insult to Dvorak. So, it just sort of ground along, providing disturbance to the point that I became bored with the disturbance. In the end, the man who pretended to be a born again to advance his monetary gain, killed the church, which was not so very deep and moving by the end. By the time the end came, it seemed almost cliché or even comical.<br/><br/>So, I am glad that I didn't pay to see this in the theater, because I would have been upset. At least now I can say that I have seen it, in case I go to a party full of pretentious people who think that it was deep and moving.<br/><br/>And I love Daniel Day Lewis, so it pains me to say this stuff."

","Runtime is about 160 minutes, so ""There Will Be Blood"" won't probably be a movie for everyone but it's really a greatly depicted story about oil, of course, faith, deception, greed, madness and cynicism. Daniel Day Lewis has delivered a truly amazing performance, but everything seems in place, starting from vivid visuals, suitable locations and a fitting background. The lead is a man teetering on the edge of insanity and the story seems at a point a study about insanity but it's much more.Nothing is lacking in the film, even in moments when words are very very few I never got bored.

"velkjent","10","0","3","8 September 2008"," The tragedy of a realist
","Daniel Plainview is not, as some have suggested, a monster, a vampire or some sort of representation of capitalism. He represents a side of many of us, a side that looks at the Stepford Wives of society, the people who will mindlessly worship prophets who are not only false, but represents barbarism, and wants to escape. As society gets dumbed down by discussions around the most mundane issues, like lynch-mobs wanting to ban homosexual marriage or to DRILL! NOW!, it is easy to look at this man and see why, in a time that was equally silly, as all times probably are when you're part of them, a smart man like Plainview would want to escape. His means to do so is to make a fortune and run his own life without the presence of ""these... people"". He views himself as better than others, which is not a commendable character trait, but understandable in the context presented, and reflected, in different ways, in almost all other characters in the film. As is expected, isolation is a greater tragedy, and as the rage keeps boiling, we see what a blind alley he has headed down. To live in any society requires the patience of a saint, and in a way we should view ourselves as heroes for keeping our cool amidst amidst the constant pressure to become slaves of ideals that almost never reflect reality as we see it. To me, There Will Be Blood is a cautionary tale, yes, but mainly a call to arms for togetherness. We don't need a kumbayah-moment for that to register. Presenting the alternative in such a compelling fashion, with such a committed performer, director, soundtrack artist and director of photography, should be enough to make us hug a stranger during the credit sequence and give our wallet to the first drug addict we meet, the latter having their own tragic Plainview obsession. We won't, of course. After all, we're all tragically human."

There will be blood"", the epic about oil, money, and religion as defining powers of American history, should've been a powerhouse of passion and gut-wrenching emotion. Alas, this movie is slow, aloof and clinically cold. Its characters don't seem to this viewer as larger than life figures as they had to be to survive the conditions they lived in. They seem more like timid lab rats awaiting next horror that life might impose upon them.Things happen to them instead of making things happen for them. And that is when it all loses its allure.

"rsa5387","8","0","3","17 August 2008"," Uneven
","I have mixed feeling for this one. The first act starts off brilliantly, showing Daniel Plainview's (Daniel Day Lewis) plight in finding and extracting oil, a brilliant 15 minutes, sans dialogue! Once Plainview does speak, we do not like him. A truly...(read more) sinister person, his greed for money and power is driven by his hatred for others. He is willing to manipulate anyone to gain what he desires, and he does. Once Plainview learns of the oil rich land in Little Boston, California, the rest of the film is devoted to Plainviews manipulation of the townspeople, his battles with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (played brilliantly by Paul Dano), his alienation from his family, and eventual downfall into a bizarre third act. With that being said, this film is very uneven. Though I found the 1st and 3rd acts to be wonderful, with the latter being a bit strange, the 2nd act was far too slow. From Plainviews arrival in Little Boston, up until the last 20 minutes, there was far too much filler in those 90 or so in between minutes. Sure, there were a lot of absolutely brilliant moments, and some jaw-dropping amazingly perfect dialogue (Plainview is very quotable), but a lot of those 90 minutes drag. The film could have easily been cut by 30 minutes. The whole side plot with Plainview's brother from another mother felt contrived and a bit unnecessary. Moreover, Plainview's battle with Eli Sunday felt very undeveloped. On the other hand, the films main story about Plainview's rise and the effect it has on both him and his family is brilliantly done. The film would have benefited from devoting as much screen time fleshing out the secondary characters in the story, especially Eli Sunday's character, than the ending would have been more coherent. Aside from that, I though the film was wonderful. The story was interesting, the dialogue was absolutely brilliant, and the cinematography was at times, mesmerizingly beautiful. The wide landscape shots and oil drilling scenes are highlights. Jonny Greenwoods (Radioheads lead guitarist) score is creepy and tension filled, it complimented the eerie edgy tone of the film wonderfully. Overall, I would have to say this is a flawed masterpiece, its a film of many brilliant moments interlaced with some pacing and characterization issues. If the characters were fleshed out a little more, and the film spent a little more time in the editing room, I would say it was perfect."

We have no idea what happens to Daniel Day Lewis's character - nor his son, nor anyone else. Lewis's character utters a stupid comment and then we roll credits. I was very disappointed and felt like I had been cheated. Did the Director suddenly get bored and quit? Did the producers suddenly run out of money??? Was the script's ending really that bad? I really needed about another 10 to 15 minutes of screen time for resolution. It's hard to believe that Daniel Day Lewis would permit the film to end in this manner. C'mon, he's got the final words in the script. What should have been a ""9"" on a scale of 1 to 10, get's reduced to a ""7."""

I could show this movie to a ten year old, and they would not be terrified. However I doubt they would appreciate it. The most grotesque thing was his character, which I doubt would effect a child. The movie has a slow pace, but it only adds to the movie, setting the stage of a quiet town being over-run by a maniac. The movie is really good for about 98% of it, but the end scene seems really random, and strange.

"pwoodring","7","0","1","25 July 2008"," Fine movie with flaws
","A few short comments. I found TWBB to be compelling and fascinating. Many of the objections I've read here don't make a lot of sense to me. The pacing, for example, is slow to be sure, but seems calculated to take us back to an era when, in fact, everything happened much more slowly than we are used to today. I thought the pacing was used beautifully to project a time scale and to promote slowly building tension. The musical score has garnered a huge amount of negative reaction, but I enjoyed it with a few exceptions. The ""THX"" sound effect was overused a bit, but the other original contributions to the score were very effective, and on my rented DVD not overly loud. The ""borrowed"" music from Brahms, Pärt and others seemed to be very unusual choices, but in retrospect, amazingly apt. I had no problems whatsoever with Dano's acting -- having a kind of milquetoast who slowly reveals himself to be something else entirely was a major aspect of the film's progress. I guess I would have to say that TWBB is not so much a plot-driven story as a character study of two seemingly opposite but equally troubled individuals who come together, inevitably, for a final showdown. A great Western tradition given a very quirky twist. In a fine character study, you don't have to know any of the ""whys"" of a person's present actions. You observe, interpolate and draw your own conclusions. I would agree that there are some elements which defy logic, but they are fairly minor. Brother Henry was a necessity. He allowed us to have the only real glimpses into Daniel's deeper thoughts, and showed graphically how Daniel reacts to perceived betrayal. With such a private character as Daniel, how else could have even this small amount of personal information been revealed -- through a diary?! Many of the other objections such as the lack of significant female characters and the lack of follow-through on the title seem insignificant in light of the many assets of this fine, but perhaps not great movie."

I can see why one would say that and it's kind of how I felt about another part of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm talking about the music of course. While I heard many people praise it afterwards, I can only say that I was annoyed by it. As I came to understand, music (score for a movie) is meant to be subtle and you shouldn't really notice it. If you stop watching the movie and start listen to the music, than something is off (in my book). In this movie I often noticed the music and although the intention was/is clear (underline the emotion of the characters), it just came off as over the top most of the time. And while that might have worked (or not depending on your angle on it) on some classics such as Ben Hur, I never really was a big fan of it.<br/><br/>Anyhow, apart from the music thing and the slow moving plot (although there is not much of clear storyline, it's more like a ""life-story"" of some sorts, not that that's a bad thing, just bare it in mind) it delivers a good movie overall ..."
"hall895","7","0","4","9 July 2008"," Doesn't quite hit the heights it could have
","A tale of two films. There Will Be Blood begins with tremendous promise. Throughout the first half of the film you get the sense this may be something rather special. But as the second half plays out the film fails to live up to the great promise it seemingly had. It's a potentially exceptional film which somewhere along the line lost its way and ended up being not exceptional but merely good. Well worth seeing but in the end it is a film which comes with a touch of disappointment. So much promise but it kind of peters out. It's a good film but you know it could have been better.<br/><br/>The movie sets up as a Daniel Day-Lewis showcase and his performance as early 1900s oilman Daniel Plainview is indeed remarkable. Perhaps a bit of overacting here and there but all in all a terrific job. The character of Plainview is cold, ruthless, almost entirely unsympathetic and perhaps a bit off his rocker. Seeing this man go about his business, cheaply buying up incredibly valuable oil-rich land, is a perverse treat. When Plainview buys up one particular ranch and his massive drilling operation sets up shop in this small California community the film reaches its tipping point. The ranch in question belongs to the Sunday family, whose most notable member is young preacher Eli who seeks some of Plainview's money to allow him to do the only thing which seems to matter to him, expand his church. Suffice to say Plainview and Eli do not exactly hit it off. There are mishaps, there are complications and there is seemingly quite the platform built for a fascinating second half of the film. And then the whole thing falls a little bit flat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story in the film's second half doesn't really engage. There's just not a whole lot of interest going on and the movie begins to drag as it strains to reach its conclusion. This movie belongs to Day-Lewis all the way and his character of Plainview is a fascinating one. But as the film plays out it is as if there's nothing left to do with the character. We've established that he's cold and ruthless, that he pretty much hates everybody, that he can't stand to see anyone else succeed. Where do we go from there? Apparently nowhere as there's really nothing new for Plainview to do. The movie just kind of sits there as we watch Plainview be a mean, miserable louse. When we finally reach the end, a rather unsatisfying and peculiar end at that, there is a sense of disappointment. Day-Lewis is great, overshadowing pretty much everyone and everything around him. Playing Eli, the other key character in the film, Paul Dano was always going to suffer by comparison and his character too often comes across as weak and ineffectual. It's a Day-Lewis tour de force and in the conflict between Plainview and Eli, it is Day-Lewis who dominates. It's his movie, nobody else was ever going to measure up to his performance. But outstanding as his performance may be the film still never hits the heights it could have. The film certainly looks nice, with some truly wonderful cinematography. And Day-Lewis is indeed terrific. But in the end this is a film which could have been great but will have to settle for being merely good. Worth watching but not remarkable."

Most importantly, he ""beats"" Eli. Eli is portrayed, not too subtly, as a homosexual philanderer (""I sank into sins I didn't think I was capable of"") who squanders his church's money and is disgraced. (Plainview is also hinted at as either homosexual or asexual) Plainview gets his revenge against the only man who got one over on him: he recreates Eli's shaming Baptism, gets him to renounce everything, then bludgeons him to death. but this is portrayed as being righteous and tough and All-American. The little supporting characters who always get sacrificed to the big leading man in the ""Big Movie/Academy Award-winning Violence"" altars are like the poor Star Trek ensigns wearing the wrong color shirts. YOU NEVER see a leading man get his brains slowly beat in, lose his life and any dignity. Eli is a snively character, who after being emasculated and humiliated by Plainview at the site, then acts the same way to his own old father and the young girls at his home: you would never see Brad Pitt or Daniel Day Lewis or even Bruce Willis take a role that requires being made someone's bitch. This is just like Chigurh's situation. he retains all dignity, gets the real audience's (20-40 yr old males) approval, scores all the cool lines and action, but the directors put up a horseshit argument that they are somehow against violence (while profiting mightily on making it cool) sorry: good movie, but really hypocritical at the same time. That bugs me.<br/><br/>BUT I say this all with one BIG caveat: if it is true, as some people on this board have suggested (and I tend to agree), that the whole bowling alley scene is ""imaginary"", or just the elderly, abandoned alcoholic Plainview's hallucinatory dream (after his son leaves), then the murder is just a fantasy: the one thing left undone, the thing he dreamed of all these years, Then it is a cool, poignant (pathetic moment (this would be why the butler doesn't freak at all, or why Eli looks the same 20 years later and why Plainview can stuill run and whip a bowling ball, etc. Then, all of a sudden, it would be much more true to Sinclair and Fitzgerald.

","This is a character-based film. A lot of people have issues with plot points etc. and that's all fair, but I think in the end this is a superbly produced look at a hard-edged man who is, over the long course of his life, steadily corrupted by capitalist greed. A truly rich adaptation of a complex protagonist - we at once love and hate him. While his innate businessman charisma charms us all, we all the while feel a strange lingering sympathy for this man plagued by a deep-rooted hatred for the world. The source of his loathing and the story of his past is never concretely explained, (perhaps this is what alienates some viewers) but we are meeting Plainview as though we are meeting him in real life, never to surely know what happened in his past to create the man we are meeting now. This adds intrigue and mystery to his story. What the film masters in Plainview's characterization, it often lacks in the development of subplot and neighboring characters that could easily have been made more faceted and interesting. But in the end, it's all about Plainview, his rise and demise."

","I have to say that this is the most powerful performance I have seen from a man. Daniel Day Lewis was just about the most evil, heartless, opportunistic sociopath that I ever hope to come across. His performance was mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this film was also very good. It was a real pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Well, that's it. Even though the film spanned several decades, it was too long. It felt like decades before it finished. The final scene was pointless. Plainview had beaten everyone, that should have been satisfaction enough. The final act showed him to really be a madman.<br/><br/>The remaining characters in the film were just props for Plainview. They added nothing. They were the straight-men to his insanity.<br/><br/>The opportunity to see the outstanding performance of Lewis was enough to recommend the movie. Those that were bored or fell asleep - I can see where you are coming from, because there was not enough to add."
"GrigoryGirl","5","0","4","22 May 2008"," I will gum you!! Another uneven PT Anderson picture...
","To me, this is a typical PT Anderson film. It has great sequences in it. It also has incredibly bad ones. It's overlong (and I love long films). It has great performances, and it has bad ones. Its dialogue is awful. It has great cinematography and production design, but thematically it's a mess. In other words, There Will Be Blood is an incredibly uneven film, which is consistent with all of PT Anderson's work. <br/><br/>PT Anderson is an anomaly in his age bracket. He's a Gen X director, but has no real sense of Gen X ""irony"" or smugness. He has ambition coming out of every pore of his body. You have to admire the hell out of him for that. He wants to make the great, grand picture. Most of his peers make very shallow films (Tarantino's Grindhouse is a good example). I can't imagine PT Anderson watching Switchblade Sisters and saying ""this is a great film"". I can see him saying ""that chick is hot, but I still shouldn't be watching this garbage"". Having said that, he just can't make a really consistent film. This was his first film in nearly 6 years (the last one was Punch Drunk Love in 2001), and overall, There Will Be Blood is a mess. <br/><br/>There is a lot of good here. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a while. The production design is fantastic (by Jack Fisk, one of the best in the business). The acting by Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing. Lewis's face, eyes, and voice are so expressive that you forget some of the bad dialogue that you can't take your eyes off of him. There are some downright surreal, intense scenes. When Daniel Day Lewis kills his ""brother"", it's one of the most effective scenes in the film. Music, look, acting, it all gels. The next scene (in a church) is purposely overlit, and continues the surrealism. It's very good. The rest of the film continues the haunted look, which I really liked. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, these good things are undone by many bad things. The dialogue here has to be some of the worst I've heard in a long time. Andreson has never been able to write really good dialogue, and here it's really bad. Lewis's monologues are really obvious, and the infamous line ""I drink your milkshake"" has entered into movie folklore, but not for the majesticness of the speech, but for the camp value. There's also a really, really bad line in one of Paul Dano's (Eli Sunday is the name of the character. Rather obvious for a preacher, eh?) where he says ""I will gum you!"". The townspeople are portrayed as simpletons, something that seems to always happen in period pieces like this. There is no real motivation for Lewis's character other than he is greedy. Thematically, his desertion of his son (he does it twice in the film) makes no sense. One scene he is playing with the boy, then the boy goes deaf, then Lewis puts him on a train. Then he comes back. Then later in the film, Lewis tells his son he's an orphan who Lewis just used as a prop to get people to go along with his plans. This is obviously not true, but there is no explanation, narratively or artistically, as to why there's such inconsistency. PT Anderson seems to be stuck between a straightforward narrative and a surreal tone, and it doesn't work. And the final scene, while beautifully shot and designed, is unintentionally funny, much like the frogs finale in Magnolia. <br/><br/>Dano's character is poorly drawn. Many have said he was miscast, but I would argue that he just didn't have a good character to build on. He's the clichéd preacher. The rest of the character are caricatures. The music score is another problem. Sometimes it's perfect (like in the brother's death scene), other times it's so out of place. Anderson was trying to do something different obviously, but it just doesn't work overall. The score is reminiscent of Stravinsky and Mozart, and sounds more like a symphony than a film score. Many have said that Johnny Greenwood's score would make a good listening experience in itself, away from the film. They're right. <br/><br/>Many have said that PT Anderson borrows (or steals) from Kubrick here. He does. The leaps in time recall the abrupt time changes in 2001 and Full Metal Jacket, the madness of Lewis recalls The Shining, and the eerie, deliberately uttered dialogue in the final scene is reminiscent of the billiard room scene in Eyes Wide Shut. Anderson also said in interviews he wanted to emulate the Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 in the opening of the film (which has minimal dialogue). Regardless of whether Anderson is ripping off Kubrick or simply being influenced by him (there is a difference between the two), the whole film still doesn't flow, like 2001, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut do. <br/><br/>So, overall, this film has enough great moments in it to view it. It is not as good as Citizen Kane or Giant. Those films had a lot of depth and character that this one simply lacks. See There Will Be Blood (great title, by the way) for Daniel Day Lewis, the cinematography, production design, and, if you're into that sort of thing, laugh at the unintentionally funny scenes."
"RJGodin2","7","0","5","13 May 2008"," strong out of the gate, fades at finish
","Like many movies, TWBB develops a very complex and detailed character story over the first three quarters of the run time, but seems to suddenly realize that the end is near and wraps things up too hastily.<br/><br/>The story is an examination of the capitalistic competition of the America experience. The embodiment of this is Daniel Plainview, who by his own admission is consumed by competition to the point that he sees every other person as an enemy. He has essentially no empathy with any other person. All his relationships are subordinate to his competitive drive for oil, money, power.<br/><br/>This is revealed directly in a moment of drunken weakness when he confides in his impostor brother that he ""can't do it alone anymore"".<br/><br/>The inner conflict and pain his dog-eat-dog ethos is presented in the glimmers of feelings with the adopted son HW. The moments around the campfire, riding the train etc. show the potential for emotional connection. However, this is damaged when the well blow out makes Planview chose between HWs well being and the biggest strike of his life. Naturally, he chooses the material over the emotional.<br/><br/>The pain of this decision haunts him ever after. In his subjugation at the evangelist meeting through to his flashback to happier times after he has his final break with HW.<br/><br/>What is missing in the finish is a more complete de-volution of the Plainview/HW relationship between HW return from deaf school until the showdown at the mansion. Clearly, a lot of bad water has passed under the bridge by the time HW asks to be allowed to forge his own way in Mexico.<br/><br/>All in all a very solid picture. For any father, the tenderness and tension in the relationship between Plainview and HW is certain to leave a strong impression. While the moment of decision may not be a dramatic as an oil well blow out, the fear of deciding between family or career casts a dark cloud of uncertainty over many fathers.<br/><br/>As far as Day Lewis performance goes, a very outstanding effort even though it seems to be a re-cycle of Bill the Butcher in many respects. Let's hope Mr. Day-Lewis' next project provides a big change of pace - maybe more heroic in the My Left Foot or Last of Mohicans vein or even a romantic comedy?"

","Upton Sinclair is famous for his novels dealing with the heavy social injustices brought on with the industrial revolution. The essence of ""There Will be Blood"" is a social critique -- highlighting how man's greed and thirst for power ruins not only those around them, but also the individual. Current movies rarely provide such a powerful subtext, partially for fear of being preachy and turning off the audience. But, this movie succeeds on this front. The cinematography made this movie, while the soundtrack was an important vehicle for enhancing the visual -- even if it sounded at times borrowed from the hit TV show ""Lost"" with its dissonance chords.<br/><br/>The movie fell short, however, on a number of fronts for what I would deem a truly great movie. While Daniel Day Lewis' performance won him ""Best Actor,"" did we not essentially see the same type of character and performance in ""Gangs of New York?"" The movie was way too long -- pushing three hours -- which inevitably leads to questions regarding editing. For an ""A-team"" delivered product, there is no excuse for slow spells. Most importantly -- the underlying story, related conflict, and main character development was weak for a best-picture nominee. There was little meaningful change in any of the characters. The plot was predictable and at times slow moving. The storyline generated little empathy or emotional engagement, despite the powerful underlying message."

","The acting is exceptional, the direction and production are fantastic, and even the soundtrack is notable. While Daniel Day Lewis' character resembles characters he's already played before, his performance is even more convincing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most enjoyable thing about this film is that although it deals with two issues that are highly politicized in America today --- the oil industry and evangelical Christianity--- it does not stoop to the heavy-handed preaching that it quite easily could. It's about characters, not ideology. The story sustains itself, and in truth there's very little to this film but the story, which is strong enough it doesn't require the CGI, the gratuitous one-liners, nor the (at this point far overdone) non-linear story telling that so many films today do rely on.<br/><br/>Just a solid film, a representation of how simple and direct a story can be. Refreshing, in a time when everything else seems to rely on gimmick. A show of talent, rather than novelty."

","A very realistic set-up, a very good story, and an outstanding performance of Day-Lewis, which I will not easily forget. Captivating music, very good dialogs, a great depth in the analysis of characters and situations. The rudeness of far West life is back in the screen: again, the basic human instincts come out... survival instinct, competition, fear, love, generosity, egoism... The tenderness of the relationship Plainview - son is remarkable. The only real criticism comes in relation with the, in my view, totally superfluous last 25 minutes, which degrade the overall quality of the movie: unnecessary, slow, boring despite the good dialogs and performances, they make the film lose a bit of its spectacular consistency."
"ennyman","10","0","4","11 April 2008"," A True Achievement by both Anderson and Day-Lewis
","2007 was, in my opinion, a weak year for Hollywood. At some point in late spring it seemed that the summer movie season had been set up to be especially uninteresting. Despite featuring everybody's hero Johnny D., Pirates III failed to entice me to part with anything green. Bourne III also came and went with the same effect.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, while commuting to the office, I thoroughly enjoyed two really engrossing audio books: Mr. Wilson's War and No Country For Old Men.<br/><br/>The fall movie fare was equally dismal, though as a family we did go and take in that most unusual Sixties reprise, Across the Universe. As we tiptoed toward the year's Christmas culmination, it was with great exhilaration that I learned that both audio books which I so thoroughly enjoyed had been made into films, and I knew that I'd find a way to see each of them.<br/><br/>For some reason this film, There Will Be Blood, never crossed my radar. I have been a strong admirer of some of the work Daniel Day-Lewis has produced, beginning with My Left Foot, the film I believe put him on the map for me.<br/><br/>As Oscar season approached Day-Lewis buzz was all the rage. This film, written, directed and produced by Paul Thomas Anderson, had created a phenomenal opportunity for Day-Lewis to shine, if you call being a very dark-hearted character shining. Anderson came to our attention as director of Magnolia, a film populated by mostly tragic characters.<br/><br/>There Will Be Blood is a character study of one character, the singular Daniel Plainview, as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis. It could be argued that Eli Sunday is also a major character in the story, but his role seems more as a foil for Plainview. It's a very sad story about a man whose ambition and social isolation make him worse than cruel.<br/><br/>Anderson's achievement here has him being compared to Kubrick, which is saying plenty. Some say he has stylistically mimicked Kubrick intentionally. The manner in which the story is told, the impassive eye of the camera as all, exemplifies the preeminent rule of storytelling: show, don't tell.<br/><br/>For this reason we are never ""told"" the motivations of characters. We extrapolate motivations by the behaviors revealed by the camera lens. At one point Daniel Plainview states outright, ""I don't like to explain myself."" This style of film making is much like life. People seldom explain the why of their behaviors. Often they do not even understand themselves the why of what they do. Yet we can see who they are by what they do. Sort of. Every picture tells a story, but it takes a lifetime of pictures to fill out the full orb. This film strings together the key pictures of a man's life, the hardening of a very hardscrabble man.<br/><br/>Another site pointed out several comparisons to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, beginning with the desolate opening scene with is off-setting music score to the final clubbing in the bowling alley, which seems so much a shadow of the ape with the bone clubbing a beast. Many more echoes can be heard.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of this film exacerbates the tensions whirling about inside its central character. The strings, rhythms, syncopated percussion, create a disconcerting, grating feeling. The irresolution and intensity of the strings is most effective in leaving viewers unsettled and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The film does have its critics. It is not a pleasant experience. But it's a powerful film, and Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible to the very end. When he says, ""I'm finished,"" the meanings are many. The film is through, his mission is complete, his life is ruined. His desolation is absolute."
"gradyharp","8","0","4","10 April 2008"," A Long, Dark Journey in the Soul of Greed and Power
","Upton Sinclair's epic novel OIL! has been successfully transformed to a film by screen writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson ('Magnolia','Boogie Nights', etc). The film is a long song (158 minutes), covering a fascinating span of time in turn of the century California when oil gained the lure of gold and transformed the land and the people into creatures of capitalism and greed and lust, and were it not for the presence of Daniel Day-Lewis' powerful performance as the man who makes it all happen, the story itself would become tiresome. It doesn't.<br/><br/>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a silver miner in 1898, but soon discovers oil and begins on a mission to become wealthy, owning most of the oil fields from the mountains of central California to the Pacific Ocean. With his medicine man manner of getting people to do what he wants he pursues his greed relentlessly, disrupting small sleepy towns like Little Boston as he gains access to the wealth of the black gold. There are odd characters along the way, such as the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who become crushable clods beneath Plainview's boots. The progress of the story is well known to most: it is the telling of the tale in the hands of wholly credible, completely physically immersed Daniel Day-Lewis that makes the story seem new.<br/><br/>The film's grimy atmosphere is well presented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and the odd musical score by Jonny Greenwood is as ominous as the vantage of Plainview. Greenwood elects to weave classical works into the fabric of the film: when young HW falls deaf after an explosion the silence is partnered by one of Arvö Pärt's 'Fratres', and the film's credits are displayed over the Anne Sophie Mutter/von Karajan recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Strange bedfellows, yes, but entirely appropriate to the overall mood of the film. The journey is long and depressing, but the power of Day-Lewis' performance is magic. Grady Harp"
"AmenAlmighty","8","0","4","10 April 2008"," Did no one really watch the movie?
","I read 4 pages of comments with people slamming the film, and criticizing Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as being one dimensional. Yes, he was manipulative and cold, but did no one truly feel his half-hearted attempts at compassion? Is it not appreciated how difficult that was to pull off? He may have never truly trusted anyone, but he appreciated the company of people who were loyal to him either out of fear, or respect. The man that posed as his brother got to remain in his company simply because Plainview appreciated some familiarity. Someone compared Plainview's character to a Picasso, and I think that was a perfect description. However, the reference was made negatively, where I see it as a quality to the film.<br/><br/>""I have abandoned my child,"" may have been in a scene where he was attempting to win over the church goers, but DDL still showed us pain in his eyes. The child may have never been his, but he raised him as his own. So for him to wait until H.W. was married and in his 20's to maliciously tell him the truth is a kind of evil that I can't really recall seeing on film. And it's a beautiful contradiction when he welcomed H.W. back after abandoning him and continuing to raise him as his own.<br/><br/>Paul Dano is a firecracker on screen. As spectacular as DDL is in everything he touches, Paul Dano was excellent beside him. At no point do I feel like he was acted clear off the screen."
"sir-montag","8","0","4","10 April 2008"," Excellent movie, but not for the squeamish or easily bored
","So after months of failed attempts to see this movie, I finally got around to it. I'd seen No Country for Old Men and it amazed me beyond words. Hearing some of the same sort of talk about There Will Be Blood, I figured it'd be worth seeing. It's an... Interesting movie. Let's put it that way.<br/><br/>One sentence review: ""Did you know that this was based on an Upton Sinclair novel? We'll remind you! Again! And Again! (oh, and we've got the totally kick-ass Daniel Day-Lewis in here too, by the way)"" <br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't been forced to read an Upton Sinclair novel in high school, I'll sum up his style in short: ""Did you know that there are horrible things going on in otherwise innocuous areas? How horrible you ask? Let me tell you! In graphic detail, at length! If you don't feel the urge to vomit by the first chapter, then I've failed as a writer! (oh yeah, and that phrase about 'beating a dead horse'? They were thinking of me when they coined it)"" <br/><br/>The fact that it's based on an Upton Sinclair novel is brought up first because the entire existence of the movie is oriented around his style of writing - a graphic and brutal exploration of an area previously viewed by the common folk as fairly hum-drum. The meat packing industry is just food right? Wrong! *People* get ground up at meat packing plants and put into your food! And I'm not talking about that fictional Charlton Heston flick either!<br/><br/>The plot more or less goes like this: ""Daniel Plainview is a complete and utter asshole and misanthrope. He's also a talented oil man. If Ayn Rand had a personal hero, he would be it. He goes to Texas.. er, California to find oil, bilk the locals, gets rich doing so, becomes the poster boy for 'creative child neglect', 'shooting your brother from another mother' and finds that once he has it all, he isn't any happier than he was before. Which was 'very much not at all'. Oh yeah, and there's crazy fundamentalists around these here parts. Did we mention that Daniel Plainview absolutely hates religion? This will be funny! Oh wait, Upton Sinclair novel, right. No, it won't be funny in the least."" <br/><br/>If I haven't scared you away yet, it's actually a darn good movie. Not for the squeamish, the easily bored or people that think that Shakespeare is crap, to be certain, but a darn good movie all the same. A friend mentioned that it wasn't quite as good as ""No Country for Old Men"". That movie, at the end, was *more* than just the sum of its parts. This movie? It's somewhat less than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Still, 'not *quite* as good as the best movie in the last five years' is impressive. It's worth seeing to be sure."
"Ava_L","8","0","4","6 April 2008"," Deserving, just like the past works of Anderson
","There Will Be Blood is a good film deserving of the many accolades, awards and reviews; however, I do not think it is the pinnacle of recent American cinema nor that of PT Anderson's career. After all having a Best Director Award from Cannes and a film nominated for a Golden Palm on any director's resume should not ignored nor forgotten. His past work, while may not be as epic, boast astounding performances. For example, Boogie Nights, Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love: a pretty amazing list even without Blood.I just hate to think that Blood alone will be Anderson's only work included in future overviews of American cinema. A young director with an impressive list of films already, I am eager to continue following his career. While I did enjoy this film, I agree that the film could have been equally epic less a half hour. All comments singling out the performance of Daniel Day Lewis are obvious. Of course, Daniel Day Lewis was remarkable in the film; after all, he is Daniel Day Lewis. Has he ever not been amazing? But what should also be observed, is that casting Day Lewis is another testament of Anderson's solid vision for his characters, just as in his past work. Anderson is a director to be followed, observed and I am sure his films will be talked about for a long time. Conversations that I hope will include Blood not begin with it."
"liuruiorp","8","0","5","1 April 2008"," A critique of America
","From my position as an outside to American culture, for me Paul Thomas Anderson's main message in 'There Will be Blood' is a critique of the American dream of making money and of the falsehoods of religion. Daniel Plainview is shown to be constantly striving for more and more profits in the film, but we never see him enjoying his wealth until the end of the film, where he seems to be an emotional wreck. This representation for me is summed up in the scene where Daniel takes H.W. to the restaurant and he says 'what you need is a nice, expensive meal'. For Plainview wealth is merely a trophy of him beating his competition, and he seems to gain little personal enjoyment from it. Whereas Eli is a slimy and unnerving character who runs his church like a business and beats his father as he deems him to have sold his land for insufficient money."

"cbowden27","8","0","4","27 March 2008"," Immense Piece of Cinema
","There Will Be Blood is the story of one man, Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector, and a successful one at that. His success is achieved at a cost - initially to himself in the hours/days/weeks of solitary searching, and the shattered leg that we see in the lengthy introductory sequence, but also and primarily to others. <br/><br/>There are other well-drawn characters in the film, notably Eli Sunday the local pastor and nemesis of Plainview, but all, even Plainview's adopted son, are meted various degrees of brutal treatment - physical and/or emotional - and the story sees all crushed beneath this juggernaut of near-psychotic ruthlessness. There is indeed blood, and there is absolutely no redemption. <br/><br/>TWTB is a raw cinematic experience, and made great by a number of factors. Daniel Day Lewis's performance as Plainview is simply immense; he is a worthy Oscar winner for such a frighteningly unsympathetic role. I find it hard to recall another movie so in thrall to a central character so human yet so irredeemable (in the truest amoral sense). Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is magnificent to my untrained eyes, matching the immense landscape and endeavour on show with the immense personal ambition visible in Plainview's near-mystical visage. His pacing of the film is masterful, allowing the character of Plainview to grow yet darken steadily through shades of deepening gloom to final blackness. The cinematography is excellent and Jonny Greenwood's percussive score provides a truly distinctive aural backbone. <br/><br/>All this is not without flaws. The parenthetical story element based around Plainview's half-brother Henry could possibly have been eliminated altogether to shorten the film without losing any real substance in the narrative (we learn a little of Daniel's family history but little more). The depiction of women - who are virtually absent in fact other than the muted and cipher-esquire character of young Mary Sunday - may leave some female viewers rather cold, though perhaps this reflects the rural/industrial environment of the era fairly enough. The film owes some obvious debts to Citizen Kane and Chinatown, amongst other works, but they're hardly poor influences to select! <br/><br/>In a word though, TWTB is marvellous. This is the kind of film that comes along perhaps only once a decade and will surely be treasured as an immense piece of cinema for many years to come."

","OK, this movie was indeed really good. However, I think there are some moderate flaws in the script. The motivation for the decay of Daniel Plainview is simply stated by him: ""I have this competition in me. I don't want anyone else to succeed"". This might be true and I do not have anything against it. But, from Daniel's actions one does not understand this key idea. It is simply set aside throughout the whole film. In my opinion, this compromises the link between the reasons/causes behind the actions and the actions themselves, therefore, leading to a flaw in the cause-effect relationship that should exist between these."

","Let me first state that I have always been an admirer of PT Anderson's work. This film is, in my estimation, no exception to the rule. Its beautifully photographed. It has some fine work by the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The score, by Johnny Greenwood, is an mix of sampled pieces from other film composers work.<br/><br/>Anderson has stated that he considers this film to be a work of horror and you certainly get that with the way the ""score"" is utilized (what was Anderson thinking?) The script, based on the work ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair is challenging and I appreciate Anderson's attempt at the adaptation. The levels of evil that the two main characters sink to is often a marvel to behold and I must say I found Mr. Plainview's evil far more ""honest"" than Eli Sunday's slimy evangelist.<br/><br/>This brings me to the performance of Mr. Lewis. This is where the film shows its greatest flaw. Apparently, Anderson watched ""The Treasure of Sierre Madre"" prior to producing this work. It shows up most frequently in the performance of Mr. Lewis. Its a mannered, opaque impersonation of Misters John and Walter Huston(with a little Walter Brennan thrown in for good measure). It may be one of Mr. Lewis's worst performances and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Since the film sinks or swims based on the performance of the main character I cannot heartily recommend the film. But it was a decent try. Be sure to check out the sly reference to the ""Beverly Hillbillies"". I thought it was pretty fun"
"mimosacymru","8","0","4","29 February 2008"," Where does it go from here?
","Powerful, Authentic, Gripping.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly a masterful effort from Mr Anderson, here tapping into a rich seam of acting talent, with Mr. Day-Lewis rightly lauded for his performance.<br/><br/>However I found it to be unsatisfying. I could have quite easily sat through a 5 hour cut of this film - it was that good. But when the final reel ended and I gathered my thoughts I could not accept that the film had not met my expectations. Perhaps they were too high or perhaps they were misplaced. I was expecting genius.<br/><br/>It struck me that there were just a few too many conceits. The much fabled opening sequence was neither silent (as I had been told to expect) nor satisfying because it felt as if they were trying too hard to create a dialogue-free sequence. It felt fake. When characters are interacting, the easiest thing for them to do is talk and sometimes (take a breath, film puritans) it's the most realistic thing for them to do. The nodding and knowing looks somehow lacked fidelity. I'm not going to question the production team's artistic vision - not my place! - but I can see the screen writing guides being written now (show don't tell, watch the first X minutes of 'There Will Be Blood' for example).<br/><br/>Plainview, as a man of anger, malcontent and visceral hatred, is the hook the film hangs on and it's difficult to see how anybody but Daniel Day Lewis could have portrayed him as effectively. He glowers gloriously throughout the duration and, perhaps a little unfortunately, towers over the performances of those around him. He will become one of the most reputed characters in film history.<br/><br/>After watching the demise of Eli and the listening to the cry of 'I'm finished', I couldn't help but ask myself ""Where does it go from here"". For Paul Thomas Anderson (reputation further enhanced), what will (and can) he do next? More importantly, what will the audience do next? You see, this is an intelligent film, a good film. What, if it wasn't for the exposure and perhaps sheer quality, would be called an 'arthouse' film. The vast number of people who see this should make a pact and refuse to ever pay again to view the Hollywood detritus that fills the very same cinemas 95% of the time. They should say ""We've been to the multiplex and bought our Pepsi and popcorn as the advertisers want us to, but instead of leaving the same building 120 minutes later after a cerebral assault of derivative sounds and images, we have exercised our emotions and intelligence in such a way that will prevent us paying to watch corporate-commercial nonsense ever again. We shall persuade the producers that we are on an evolutionary path where cinema as art continues and strives to improve over time and shall vote with our admission costs for the good and the crafted films.""<br/><br/>How ironic that we get the news within a week of this film winning at the Academy Awards that McG will be directing Terminator 4."

The performance by Daniel Day Lewis was excellent, but I have seen it before and felt cheated. He should not of received the best actor award for copying the same character he portrayed in the Gangs of New York.

Jonny Greenwood is not a composer of orchestral music (even though he had help to arrange his ideas!) and it shows...there is an over the top use of ""glissando Strings"" to create tension and other techniques such as discords etc.. these are useful used sparingly. There is an absence of using counterpoint and harmonic change throughout the whole score and at times the use of gimmicks and just rhythm becomes annoying against the cinematography and dialogue. The score has been written by a guitarist from a band and as a result it is limited and naive to say the least.<br/><br/>Shame as the film is excellent!"

","The question the director tries to answer is who are these industrialists and what shapes them. That is the riddle Paul Thomas Anderson tries to solve. <br/><br/>The beginning scene sets the tone, DDL gouging out rock silently in a shallow mine. You get a good sense of the mans determination, and you feel the earthiness of the film.<br/><br/>Thats how the film continues, slowly revealing bits of story that reveal more of Plainviews character. <br/><br/>Evil comes in drips and for Plainview sometimes it floods into his life.<br/><br/>The story is part allegory but can be taken at face value.<br/><br/>The Plainview character shouting out 'i've abandoned my boy' having dual meaning, he put his son in a home, but also it means he has abandoned that innocent, young, and decent part of himself that must have once existed.<br/><br/>Then there's the obvious allegory, the black oil smeared over Plainviews face in a MacBeth style scene. The allegory of darkness consuming the character very obvious. <br/><br/>Then of course there's the other key point of allegory in the film. The interaction between the evangelicals and the oil men. Obviously this is meant to mirror todays political climate. With the Bushites and neo-cons paying homage to the evangelicals to get their votes. This is a running theme throughout the film and the contempt that Plainview has for the evangelicals absolutely drips from the screen.<br/><br/>I wonder if real life evangelicals have a clue how Karl Rove and the neo-con machine laugh at them behind their back. <br/><br/>The movie becomes bleaker and bleaker, and it does start to get depressing. Paul Thomas Anderson has a bit of a clown in him and the ending is classic PTA. It becomes a theater of the absurd as the evangelical preacher comes crawling back to Plainview to beg for money after 'sinning' and blowing his money on the collapsing stock market.<br/><br/>Only to be killed with a bowling pin after being told his milkshake has been drunk by Plainview.<br/><br/>The milkshake analogy is both hilarious and disturbing in its societal implications. <br/><br/>The last scene providing a needed catharsis and some mirth that makes you walk out of the theater with a little levity.<br/><br/>The film overall reminds me somewhat of earlier Lynch work. Sometimes the film can feel a bit stiff like some of Lynchs early work, and the allegory can be a little too intellectual and not organic enough.<br/><br/>Though the film is undeniably intriguing and excellent. This film feels like an important step in PTA's career, a maturation of his style. And a very good piece of cinema in its own right. This is not a film that leaves you after seeing it. It percolates through your system, and like all good films integrates into your being."

The way the church is portrayed was bang on the money, showing how stupid and moronic the people who attend those things are.

","Without a word spoken over the film's first fifteen minutes director PT Anderson succinctly defines the persona of rugged individualist Daniel Plainview in this epic tale about greed and oil in There Will Be Blood. In excruciating detail we watch prospector Plainview toil under dangerous conditions as he burrows alone into the dark earth endure debilitating injury and literally crawl to the assayer's office to make his claim. Plainview is clearly a man to be reckoned with and over the next two hours we are witness to his rise and fall as he seduces, bribes, murders, gets saved and cajoles his way to vast wealth in the early years of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>In Blood director Anderson deviates from his previous works such as Boogie Nights, a dull soap opera on the porno film industry and Magnolia, a promising Altmanesque quilt with a spectacularly inane climax, by avoiding the multiple speaking roles that tend to deaden and distract from character development. In Blood he focuses on Plainview alone and we are rewarded with one of cinema's most powerful and fully formed character portrayals of this young century. Daniel Day-Lewis lives and breathes the role of Plainview that remains riveting from start to finish. Minus the Brooklyn accent and scenery chewing that plagued him in Gang's of New York he displays every bit the threat and ruthlessness but in a more chilling and stoic fashion. Anderson daringly and successfully keeps Plainview in nearly every scene revealing his lust for money and his methodology. At the same time he allows the audience to ponder the ambiguous side of Plainview (misogyny, feelings toward religion)on their own. Anderson also does a deft balancing act in maintaining Plainview's relationship with H.W., his adopted son. Claiming him as his own son (he states the mother died in child birth) there are scenes of genuine fatherly love, but oil, wealth and power still remain Plainview's greatest passion and as the film progresses one questions his use for the boy in his grand plan.<br/><br/>Robert Elswit's photography has a superb texture that presents us with a dry and dusty harsh California landscape filled with bleakness and challenge in which only the strong and driven can survive. He also daringly under lights scenes to convey the darkness of Plainview's character and world. John Greenwood's music score is uneven but effective most of the time and the sound recording is top notch.<br/><br/>My only minor complaint about Blood is the miscasting of Paul Dano in the role of Eli Sunday, Plainview's religious fanatic opponent. Every bit as greedy as Plainview, Dano's Sunday lacks the strength of character and maturity needed to oppose Plainview. His fire and brimstone tirades seem out of place and out of time, very much resembling the contemporary style of Tom Cruises' Magnolia preacher. This aside, There Will Be Blood is a very rewarding piece of cinema, imaginatively directed, patiently told and masterfully acted by Lewis."

He's earned credibility as a chief manufacturer of oil, but to expand his empire and become enormously wealthy he follows an anonymous tip that leads him to a small California town. Once there, he matches wits with an influential young pastor (Dano) with an equally ambitious agenda.

"howard.schumann","8","0","3","21 January 2008"," Well done but ugly and violent
","Paul Thomas Anderson's nearly three-hour evocation of the dark side of twentieth-century capitalism, There Will Be Blood, has aspirations for greatness but only partially succeeds. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil, the film attempts to show how the individual's drive for success fueled the growth of a nation and also contributed to a national zeitgeist that says anything is available for a price, either money or blood. With an indirect reference to today's quest for domination of oil markets abroad and Godly materialism at home, Anderson is on target with his message but the film lacks convincing three-dimensional characters, a story that reflects the chiaroscuro of life with its ups and downs, its joy and pain, and any feeling for the world's beauty.<br/><br/>The main protagonist of the film is Daniel Plainview played by Daniel-Day-Lewis in one of his most challenging roles. Though shot in Texas, the film is set in California in 1898. Plainview is a wildcat oil driller who digs his mines with a pickax and sleeps in a tent, the epitome of the lonely entrepreneur. Though he breaks his leg while prospecting for silver, by 1902 Daniel has struck oil and has taken the infant son H. W. (Dillon Freasier) of a deceased miner to raise as his own. He is already an established oil man when Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), a strange looking young man tells him that for $500 he will let him know where oil is to be had. Not one to pass up an opportunity, Daniel goes for the bait and learns that the oil is beneath Sunday's ranch in the fictional town of New Boston, California.<br/><br/>Promising to provide roads and schools to the town and a $5000 donation to the church, Plainview acquires the Sunday's land in spite of the objection of Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a charismatic preacher and faith healer at the local Church of the Third Revelation. Though Daniel agrees to let him bless the oil well at its opening ceremony, he reneges on his promise and the remainder of the film becomes a tug of war between the oil man's greed and the preacher's irrationality. While the film makes no connection between subsequent events and the lack of the blessing, shortly afterwards, a worker is killed and Daniel's now 10-year old son becomes deaf after a mine explosion. Plainview's fortunes continue to grow, however, and he envisions making a deal with Union Oil to build a pipeline to the Pacific. Yet with his increase in wealth, the misanthropic nature of Plainview's character emerges.<br/><br/>He admits that ""I have a competition in me. I don't like people and want to see them fail"", yet we never learn the source of his antagonism to people nor anything about his background. Unable to oversee his oil wells and care for his son, he sends him to a school for the deaf in San Francisco without even saying goodbye. He is at first taken in by a stranger Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), purporting to be his long lost brother but when his true identity is discovered, turns on him with a vengeance. This leads to an ending that is both a brilliant tour de force and a crass monument to punch-drunk ugliness. Daniel Day-Lewis fully captures the driven oil tycoon but he is little more than a caricature. While at times showing some inkling of humanity, Plainview is the driven embodiment of everything that is supposed to be wrong with the American capitalist.<br/><br/>Dano, who I admired in L.I.E. and Little Miss Sunshine, struggles mightily but doesn't quite fit the role of the crazed preacher, looking too young and too decent to be believed in the role. Ultimately, the film is a technical triumph with brilliant acting by Lewis, outstanding cinematography by Robert Elswit, and a compelling score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Yet it suffers on a human scale, leaving us with no one to admire and nothing to believe in, neither people nor institutions. As Andrew Sarris has put it, ""In this movie-going year of unrestrained morbidity and malfeasance, There Will Be Blood fits in very nicely with all the prevailing paranoia on and off the screen."" Like Plainview, There Will Be Blood is overly ambitious and dazzling in its look of profundity, yet, in spite of Daniel Day-Lewis, it is basically shallow and emotionally unsatisfying."

His story is as shadowed as his intentions.<br/><br/>But by the end Plainview is so vile, so overwrought, so full of disdain that he has absolutely no redeeming qualities left in him which caused me to feel a slight dislocation with him.<br/><br/>In the beginning Daniel Day Lewis gave his character ground and depth to feel real. He was wildly exotic but human in his softness and spirit...until the last act where I feel as though the film derailed into sophomoric delusion leaving Plainview in an abyss of his former self.<br/><br/>Granted time had passed, and lives had changed, but the last scene is like a different world where the same character talks and walks in, but doesn't necessarily feel the same.<br/><br/>Its a shame that all we're left with in the end is a caricature of Daniel Day Lewis' madness, and the tortured soul which forever burdens him...and us.<br/><br/>And yet the first two thirds of There Will Be Blood is some of the most fevered pieces of American Cinema you'll see all year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jaredmobarak","8","0","3","16 January 2008"," I will bury you undergroundThere Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood is a staggering work of genius. Paul Thomas Anderson has, if he hadn't already, cemented himself as the director of the present and future. While his previous work compared to the great Robert Altman, this entry is by all accounts his Kubrick picture. At every turn I could think of nothing else but comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's body of work. The cold, detached artistry of it, the gorgeous visuals bolstered by powerhouse performances, and the patience with which to allow a story of this kind to ferment and show itself, are all characteristics fusing them. Here comes the shocker, thoughand it is not more of a shock to anyone but myselfI think it is his worst film as far as my emotive connection to it. Now, I'll add that even his worst is better than 99% of the films made in a year, but a disappointment is still just that. What really pains me, however, is the fact that it is an almost flawless piece of art. At every moment I can only think of perfection, yet a void to why it is so. It is an issue of brilliant parts whose sum just doesn't add up. If nothing else, this film may make me change the way I look at cinema. There has been no other film that effected me as much as this, no other that will stick with me longer after my viewing; it should earn movie of the year for just that alone. Hitting on so many levels it unfortunately leaves me in confusion at the end. Much like Kubrick's ""masterpiece"" Barry Lyndonfor which I thought of more than once sitting there todaythis is a piece of work that will be studied and dissected and copied for years to come. Technically perfect, it has everything it needs except my adoration. Leaving me cold, I just can't wrap my head around it.<br/><br/>Anderson has my undivided appreciation for what he has done. Visually stunning, I cannot think of one bad moment. Even with the audience I saw it with laughing at inappropriate moments there were no faults. Being able to touch people in that way, making them so uneasy and uncomfortable that it is necessary to release the built up tension with a laugh only strengthens the argument of its greatness. It actually makes me angry that I can't just say screw it, I loved it, best film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>At its core, this is a tale of one man's complete and utter descent into hell. What once was a man of integrity and hard work becomes one filled with greed and hubris, flying too high and unable to feel the slow burn of his wings. Daniel Day-Lewis is allowed every reprieve thrown his way. The ability he has to embody so completely every character he portrays is astounding. Taking four years off between films is not only acceptable, it is necessary in order for the audience to recover from his brilliance, let alone his own needs to gain back the energy and life left on the celluloid. The devil is most definitely inside of Daniel Planview; unable to trust or love those closest to him, he sees the loneliness and solitude awaiting. Beginning on his own in 1898falling down a well and breaking his leg without help around for mileshe will eventually find that same detachment in 1927, although he is surrounded by wealth and creatures on the payroll. A family business for sure, it just takes a little while to notice that his family consists of only one member.<br/><br/>The supporting roles are all superbly fleshed out, each plays his piece of the puzzle, helping build to the inevitable conclusion, bringing to mind another Kubrick classic The Shining. One person truly succeeds at attempting to match Day-Lewis's dedication to the work, though, and he is Paul Dano. Actually cast during production, after the letting go of the actor who had already begun filming as Eli Sunday, Dano is scary as the prophet for the Church of the Third Revelation. His sermons are difficult to watch and powerful beyond belief. When he and Day-Lewis share the screen, you can't even imagine what might happen next. The spite and hatred brewing beneath both exteriors is palpable, ready to spill over at any moment. Words cannot describe the effectiveness of their relationship, both very much similar in opposite ways, tasting evil and relishing its desserts.<br/><br/>At almost three hours in length, I couldn't believe it when it had ended; the pace is break-neck. Even more remarkable is the fact that much of the film is told in silence, save for Jonny Greenwood's haunting and disjointed score, (reminiscent to an episode of ""Lost""), with just actions and scenery to progress the plot. With the first twenty or so minutes to be completely wordless and still create a complete background for the Plainview role, I can't comprehend the genius that is PT Anderson. Sure he owes plenty to the masters that came before him, but one can't doubt his skill and artistry here. He has my full respect and I will be seeing this film again, most likely multiple times, in the future because there is perfection at work. I give him full benefit of the doubt; it is me who is broken. Nothing this glorious can be any less than the best and if I can't see it now, it is I who needs to be shown where I have gone wrong."
