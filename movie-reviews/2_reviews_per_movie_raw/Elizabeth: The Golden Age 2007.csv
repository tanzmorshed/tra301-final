"eastbergholt2002","8","142","181","16 October 2007"," Good Fun but Flawed History
","Overall I enjoyed the movie. There have been too many recent films about the Tudors and Elizabeth in particular, but this film looks good and it keeps you entertained. It's set at the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth is shown as tough, smart, and married to her country. She also suffers from bouts of insecurity and irrational jealousies. This film is more hagiographic and melodramatic than its predecessor. <br/><br/>The film tends to ignore the facts when they get in the way of the story. Elizabeth was 55 at the time of the Spanish Armada and she was never a looker. Blanchett's Queen is youngish and attractive. Blanchett's acting performance is powerful and impressive but also a bit stagy. The way the politics of the time are depicted is a bit too black and white. The Spanish look grim and are dressed in dark colors. They are portrayed as crazy, religious zealots. Spain had a right to be upset at English privateers / pirates who attacked their ships and stole their gold. Mary, Queen of Scots is shown as a dowdy, schemer who disliked Elizabeth. The reality was that Mary was a pretty bimbo who made bad choices when it came to men.<br/><br/>Parts of the film veer too much towards soap-opera. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen)becomes a favorite, but when Bess Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting and Raleigh get secretly married, Elizabeth becomes jealous and behaves badly. Later, Raleigh and Francis Drake are shown defeating the Spanish at sea. In reality Raleigh was looking after the coastal defenses in the South West of England and didn't marry Throckmorton until 1591. The real Raleigh was a brilliant man: soldier, explorer, writer, poet and courtier and probably deserves his own film. The film is good fun but it's simplistic, cartoon history."

"MistinParadise","8","67","91","15 October 2007"," A Huge Opportunity for Greatness is Missed
","With a dream cast, a fascinating subject, and a budget larger than a pirate's booty, this film could have been great. But the chance is missed.<br/><br/>(Pros:) The cast is definitely the film's biggest asset. Cate Blanchett is incredibly brilliant even at times that the script fails to provide her with a worthy line. Her powerful performance is utterly captivating. Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh is as dashing as a man can be. As the man who charmed the Queen out of her heart and wits and dared to tell her not to act like a fool, Owen's Raleigh is daring at times, vulnerable at others, but always compelling and spectacular. Geoffrey Rush makes the best out of the very little that he's given to work with and Abbie Cornish and Samantha Morton are each great in their parts.<br/><br/>It's also worth a mention that the costumes and the locations are spectacular, paired with a few moments of good story-telling (only if those moments would last all through the film) they make a few absolutely extraordinary scenes. Another great characteristic of this film is it's subtlety, the emotions that are there yet not talked about, the wishes, feelings, disappointments, desires, and fears that are only hinted are the best parts of an otherwise disappointing story-telling.<br/><br/>(Cons:) Sloppy editing, campy scenes, and poor writing are what mostly hurts the film. Unfortunately the film's precious time is spent on side-stories that could have easily been discarded, and consequentially, not enough time is spent on the development of the main story. Everything that happens after Sir Walter meets Elizabeth seems forced. Vague at times, the film seems to be in rush to hit certain notes at certain times. Elizabeth meets Walter and a few lines later she's mad about him, so is Bess and so on. The audience is not given the chance to feel or take in what's really happening, not even enough time to get to know the characters let alone feel what they are going through. At times, it seemed as though many of the scenes were cut short in the editing room and had lost their essence in the process. (If that's the case, lets hope the DVD includes the director's cut.) <br/><br/>The film could have benefited from more climax and action (the battle is barely touched), (other than a few great scenes) most of the story is told through conversations in closed areas. More than anything, the writers leaned on poetic lines to deliver their story. Also, for all it's subtlety, the film takes sides so obviously that it hurts any chances it had at reaching some level of realism or fairness. For instance, not only Phillip of Spain is utterly evil, he's one ridiculous, petty, dim character. <br/><br/>Overall, the cast certainly makes the experience worthwhile, and as long as one does not expect absolute greatness or historical accuracy, this film can be great entertainment for most."
"Hancock_the_Superb","5","19","23","22 December 2007"," Flashy, disappointing sequel
","It is now 1588, and Queen Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) is no longer the fragile, naive young princess of England, but an accomplished monarch with a knack for public relations. England's empire is growing, and Elizabeth develops an attraction towards explorer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen). But soon war looms as Spain's King Phillip II (Jordan Molla) threatens to invade England, and a cabal of Catholics led by the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) plots against the Queen's life. With the aid of Raleigh and aging spy-master Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth confronts these foes and earns her place in history.<br/><br/>Shekhar Kapur's ""Elizabeth"" was a visually stunning, brilliantly acted, and extremely compelling film which depicted a young Princess forced by circumstances into one of the most delicate situations imaginable. The movie was gorgeous to behold in its art direction, cinematography and costumes, but also had an intriguing story and a very strong cast, headed by the brilliant Cate Blanchett. ""Elizabeth: the Golden Age"" has a lot to live up to, but surely the history behind the film would ensure an entertaining sequel about one of the history's most compelling individuals.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 'twas not to be. ""The Golden Age"" is a very weak, disappointing sequel to a great film. The story plods, the characters become two-dimensional, and the impressive cinematography and visuals bog down rather than enhance the film. With all of the intriguing aspects of Elizabeth's reign, and the fact that director and star were back from the original, it's doubly disappointing.<br/><br/>Where shall we begin our criticism? The story, which is all over the place. The original film has a multi-faceted plot, but all of the characters and actions tie together with consummate skill. Here, the various intrigues and plots are introduced incrementally; we don't even know who the English Catholics are until well into the film, and their relation to the plot, despite a lengthy introductory scene. ""Golden Age""'s various subplots cease to be layered and interesting and simply become a great big muddle.<br/><br/>Another huge criticism of the film is its characterization of historical personages, notably the Spanish. Elizabeth's portrayal is spot-on, but otherwise? King Phillip in particular is a hateful stereotype; most of his dialog is pronouncing Elizabeth as evil, even saying at one point ""Elizabeth is the darkness, I am the light."" He might as well twirl his mustache and laugh maniacally a la Snidley Whiplash. Mary Queen of Scots is the only villain who comes across as remotely human, and even she is hurt by very little screen time. The film makes very little of Mary herself, relegating her and the other supporting characters to the background, choosing to focus on a ridiculously overwrought, historically-improbable love triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Elizabeth's servant (Abbie Cornish).<br/><br/>All this might have been forgivable if the movie had delivered on its promise of a rip-roaring climax. Throughout the film's length we are impressed upon of the Spanish Armada's vast size and perceived invincibility. We see epic CGI shots of the fleet setting sail. We hear Elizabeth's ministers portentously pronouncing the Spanish as unstoppable. We get Elizabeth's rousing speech to the troops in full battle armor. And the payoff for all this build-up is... nothing. A few brief CGI shots of ships in battle, and an oh-so-fancy shot of a single horse swimming through the wreckage of a sinking Spanish ship. Pathetic, and unforgivable. I wasn't expecting a Rambo film but I was expecting a scene that made all of the dread mutterings of the past two and a half hours worthwhile.<br/><br/>The movie is as visually splendid as any you'd care to name. The use of imaginative lighting, costumes, and art direction is simply a site to behold. The film reaches its high point during an abortive attempt on the Queen's life, when her would-be assassin pronounces her a ""whore"" - followed by a shot of Elizabeth, dressed in white with immaculate sunlight streaming down around her. This scene is absolutely stunning, but it is also indicative of the film's basic problem. All of the interest is in the visuals and costumes, and there is no real substance to them.<br/><br/>The movie has one major redeeming factor, and that's Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is a brilliant Elizabeth, showing her to be a great leader, but also a desperately lonely woman whose best asset is her PR abilities. The supporting cast is woefully under-used, particularly Geoffrey Rush. In the original, Rush's Walsingham was an intriguing, slippery character. In this film, his contribution is to sit in the background and mumble a portentous line every once in awhile. The rest of the cast, except Samantha Morton, is unexceptional, through no fault of their own.<br/><br/>""Elizabeth: the Golden Age"" should have been a great follow-up to a great film. With a talented director, an amazing lead performance, and one of the most compelling chapters in history, ""Golden Age"" should have been something special. Unfortunately, it is nothing more than a big, shiny, leaden disappointment.<br/><br/>5/10"
"MartianOctocretr5","8","63","89","20 October 2007"," Cate Blanchett shines in biographical drama; some fiction added to the events
","Cate Blanchett reprises her role as the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I, and is the film's greatest highlight. She exudes power, strength and influence in portraying the 16th century monarch. Her commanding presence on the screen really gives the majestic qualities that the real queen certainly had. At the same time, she gives us a personal glance inside the woman's heart, where she has suppressed from public view an inner vulnerability and melancholy. Elizabeth certainly endured many sorrows, and this portrayal gives us a glance inside the woman's who carried all this upon her shoulders, and is credited with raising England to prominent status on the world stage.<br/><br/>In addition to Blanchett, the supporting cast all turn in superior work. The sets, costuming, and period speech are all mastered well, creating a true feel for the era being depicted. Although many of the people and events are real, a few liberties have been taken apparently to spice up the drama. Such fictionalizing probably wasn't necessary; enough happened during this queen's rule to make the story interesting without it. One example: the flashy Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed a favorite of the queen, but this movie puts them in a romantic triangle that just gets in the way of other things going on. Also, Raleigh, better known as an explorer, was not the hero in the battle with the Spanish Armada.<br/><br/>Blanchett shines when she delivers the famous speech to the troops on the eve of the Spanish invasion. But even she is burdened by the director's preoccupation with Elizabeth as a suffering angst-filled woman facing middle-age with less bravery than facing the world's most powerful fleet at that time. We get endless views of her taking her wig off in secret, and staring at a mirror. The first time this device is used is fine to get the point across of her hopeless situation of never taking a husband (and the slow advance of time having its way), but we see her looking like a shriveled ghost in too many such scenes, and it's way overdone in this context. Her ""real"" hair sans the wig looks like an inebriated Edward Scissorhands was her hairdresser, and her pale complexion looks like somebody pasted white-out all over her face.<br/><br/>Those few mistakes notwithstanding, this is a fine biopic with superior acting by Blanchett, and is recommended."
"EUyeshima","6","9","10","5 March 2008"," The Virgin Queen Redux in an Odd Mix of Old-Fashioned Melodrama and Romance Novel
","There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph, ""Elizabeth"". I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.<br/><br/>The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized on screen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proved to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Mollà is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.<br/><br/>Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included  one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving."
"Blueghost","Null","58","86","16 October 2007"," Ambitious period film.
","I hadn't heard too much about this film, but had seen the posters for it, so I gave it a shot. And after leaving the theatre I really wasn't sure what to say about it.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good stuff in this film, but there're some pitfalls as well. On the plus side the sets and costumes are magnificent. A great deal of care and love when into the art direction to bring us an Elizabethan renaissance film, replete with court intrigue and foreign emissaries who threaten invasion because of high seas thievery courtesy Clive Owen's character. Visually this film is very lush and impressive, though somewhat confining at times. We're never really shown Elizabethan England, just the ""important parts"" that are salient to the story.<br/><br/>And, as Elizabeth's favorite playwright would say, ""there's the rub"". And by this I mean that the film is a bit all over the place. It's a costume drama, it's a romance, it's a period political thriller, it's a military epic, and so forth. It even skids the fantasy genre with some of the fancy camera work that was done. But, all in all, the film's primary thrust is to try and grab hold of all of these genres, and tie them together into some kind of cohesive and suscint manner.<br/><br/>The romance, the intrigue, the sisterly emotions, the rivalry between matriarchs, and the ""battle scene"" hearken back to a time when Hollywood used to crank out these kinds of movies with some regularity. But the context between those films and ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" are nearly day and night, even though both are striving for a high water mark in historical drama.<br/><br/>I thought ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" was technically a competent production. In fact, given the difficulties there must have been getting some of the shots I'll give it high marks as a pure production effort. But as a film I simply found it to be a touch too ambitious, and over-indulgent near the end.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I didn't enjoy a lot of the film, because I did. Blanchet's Elizabeth is a strong woman; full of zest, energy, and a bit of anger, which she levels at her adversaries. But she's also a chief of state, internationalist, and, of course, the queen of England. She doesn't wear several hats. She wears a crown. But even so, and this is where the film falls a bit short, she doesn't demonstrate a cohesive ability to command all. She shows she's in charge, but doesn't act like she's in charge until near the end.<br/><br/>The film was geared and aimed at a female audience (a thing which I had not expected), and so a lot of the energy is directed at that audience, with the appropriate emotional flourishes. Combined with some so-so CGI for the action sequences (and a horse with a perm which almost had me laughing), one wonders where the film was headed. Elizabeth didn't save England with her emotional power alone, and yet this is the gist of the film. It's a real let down in this regard.<br/><br/>The film is a mixed blessing. There's a lot of decent acting, and some exceptional performances by the leads. Married to a rather extravagant art director to bring to life palace, throne room, chambers, and galleons at sea, and one can easily see that this was meant to be a top notch production. But some of the logical loopholes where Blanchet's character is concerned conspire with some of the story loopholes to hold back a better film.<br/><br/>As a guy all I can say is that it's not something I'd watch again, and I'm not too sure I'd recommend it to any female audiences. But, if you don't mind your period dramas skirting the edge of high kamp, then splurge on a ticket, and see what ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is all about."
"janyeap","9","145","230","10 October 2007"," A fairy tale about the ""Faerie Queene""? I love it!
","Another Elizabeth I film? Why not? The Elizabethan Era's, indeed, a fascinating periods in English history - an era when England was relatively well off compared to other nations  even if its wealth was unevenly distributed! <br/><br/>Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Does he give his audience any insight into the Golden Age when English Literature, poetry, music, theater, architecture, scientific and technological advancement, and exploration expansion flourished? Nope. His film does offer some interesting hints that women did enjoy the freedom of movement (ah ha, even a queen's closest and dearest lady-in-waiting could play cuckold to her mistress' favorite man!) and that competing interests and ambitions of colonial powers made it easy for ambitious sailors to legalize acts of piracy! Serious crimes could well resort in severe tortures. Director Kapur does stress that she was the ""peoples"" queen!<br/><br/>The story continues from where Cate Blanchett's young, flighty, and reckless Elizabeth made her finale masculine-like entrance in the prequel, ""Elizabeth"", as the Virgin Queen with her face heavily laced with the 'white-as-milke' make-up - an image of a queen ready to lead her citizens.<br/><br/>At a deliberate slow pacing, the introduction with its scenes, characters and their dialog prepare the audience to receive Elizabeth as the Queen with a more focused, more rigid personality, in charge of hers and her country's destinies. Yep, a woman with ready suitors, but offering a sense that she is wedded to her Empire! She seems very philosophical in her ideals and yet we see her court filled with sorts of political characters. Elizabeth, then, is seen with roving eyes, easily distracted by the presence of attractive men. Indeed, it's a crafty way to introduce Elizabeth before Director Kapur plunges his audience into a compelling tale of treachery, assassination attempts and romance that affects the Virgin Queen during her reign. <br/><br/>The film carries a mix of intriguing historical facts, legends and myths in ways that one can only expect history teachers of English public schools to apply to make their lessons interesting, or hear from gossipy English peers, from history classes, wanting to impress their friends with stranger-than-fiction tidbits and hearsay of those times. This film does promise a refreshing tale to grasp! There are those tongue-in-cheek whims and antics that mischievously provoke thoughts of the political and religious changing tides of modern times. Director Kapur has certainly avoided the creation of a history epic, based on dull, dry substance! <br/><br/>Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. She's seen as almost as a brutal ruler at times and on her consistent guard in her determination to hold on to her throne, alternating between her seemingly vicious whims, her heroism and tangled romantic emotions! Yet, she comes off gracefully as a person who has the heart to forgive. Oh yes, there's also that scene that prompts me to think of Joan of Arc! It's not hard to want to cheer for the Queen in her determination to fight against the religious intolerance, barbarism and fundamentalism of the Spanish Inquisition. Spain was a very powerful Catholic foe and the Church did try to destroy this Protestant Queen and to restore England back to Catholism! <br/><br/>The battle in the calm-to-storm scene is exhilarating to watch. We also witness her struggles in her attempt to balance her duties to her country and her vulnerability to infatuation and tempestuous relationship. Clive Owens superbly handles his role as the dashing Walter Raleigh  indeed, one of the most colorful and controversial character of the times and of whom English history has spun numerous tales about. This film also charts Raleigh's colonizing dreams, his involvement in a love triangle, his sweeping in and out of the Queen's favor and his immense dislike for Catholics - that did historically determine his fate beyond this film's exposure. Geoffrey Rush returns as the loyal and polished spy master, Sir Walsingham and historically seen as the man who attracted conspiracy theories. Hhhmh, was he responsible for the birth of modern espionage? He's truly fascinating to watch. This film has a great stellar cast of actors who don't disappoint. There's so much on-screen chemistry oozing out between characters in this film. Oh yes, the villains are so agitating and annoying to the core. <br/><br/>The background music soundtracks come across as dramatically bold and nail-biting, poignant at times, and emotionally mystifying at others- appropriately matching the many guises, moods and whims of the Virgin Queen  the cold and strong and always majestic personality vs .her sentimentally vulnerable images - and also effectively reinforce the moments of gripping horrors of the events witnessed or felt. The sounds do have an interesting mix. Some of the scenes really deliver visual cinematic effects that remind me of the paintings of the period. The somber settings work beautifully to support and give intensity to the horrifying scenes and moments. Just love the way the sets and backgrounds are crafted to avoid overshadowing the characters. Oh yes, I love the color schemes presented in this movie to bring credibility to the scenes! The naval battle and Sir Walters' underwater escapade are so fabulously and stunningly crafted - without going over-the-board with extreme flashy special effects and colors to highlight the events. <br/><br/>I was captivated from beginning to end. Oh yes, this film does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey in my attempt to separate legend and myths from historical facts. Oh yes, this film will make English history fun to browse all over again. Yep, I was absolutely entertained!!!"
"bbrown8870","3","227","370","13 October 2007"," Elizabeth: Die Hard With a Vengeance
","This rates as high as it does for me because of the cinematography. It is dazzling and Blanchett can't be denied, but ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is like a chick-flick with explosions plus costumes, super hair, and loud, intrusive music. The result is faux epic.<br/><br/>My wife summed it up well as we left the theater: ""I feel like I've just flipped through a coffee table picture book for two hours and somebody turned up the stereo."" History wrote this plot but Nicholson and Hirst thought they could do better. They couldn't, or certainly didn't. Freshmen composition classes come up with better stuff. Trite, forced, predictable. Did they even run this by an expert in English history? You gotta wonder. The script is oozing with 21st century mores and clichés. It made me think (during the movie, mind you) of the way Dutch painters depicted Homer and Aristotle in the garb of 17th century Holland. Are we that dumb? Sir Walter Raleigh is a caricature and Sir Francis Drake, never properly introduced, was a throwaway. Geoffrey Rush is wasted as Walsingham. Come to think of it, nearly everybody is wasted. Every single character is underdeveloped, with the possible exception of the title characterpossible exception.<br/><br/>""Golden Age"" set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction. Realizing the script had missed, Director tried to make up for it with window dressing. Substance would have served this queen better. With the colon in the title, I almost expected to see Bruce Willis saving the day.<br/><br/>You can see why ""Golden Age"" came out in October because it's not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about. With all the budget they had for this movie, you'd Universal could have found better writers."

","We had been looking forward to seeing this film - and made a point of re-watching the original 'Elizabeth' from 1998 a week before making the trip to the theater.<br/><br/>I will say that this film is technically beautiful in the grand cinematic style which was once associated with the epic films from the bygone era of the Hollywood studios with it's fantastic costuming and sets. <br/><br/>But - I am sad to say that this film was a disappointment. It suffers from numerous over-dramatic sequences which rely much too heavily on symbolism. After all, how many times & ways should one be forced to view Cate Blanchett posed in an angelic persona?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as one sits through this film, one must wonder what the writers & director were thinking. It is obvious that someone was unsure of which direction(s) they wished to steer this film toward - romance, war epic, drama,etc. <br/><br/>The awkwardness of this film projected a feeling that various pages of the script must have been stuck together as it continues along - giving it a feel that can only be described as disjointed and forced.<br/><br/>The problems with this film seem to be caused by a combination of a weak script, bad direction, and bad editing which resulted in this short-changed follow-up to the well-done original 1998 epic of 'Elizabeth'. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett and the entire cast are good actors & do not disappoint in their character portrayals. But sadly, this film was not up to the performances of these fine actors and we left the theater wondering why the director, the editors, and screenwriters all failed to do their jobs."

","For sheer sartorial splendor, this movie is unbeatable. But the raves end at the costume department: everything else about this movie is awful. I so loved the first ""Elizabeth"" that I was ready to love the sequel, but it was a complete disappointment.<br/><br/>Blanchett's acting is good enough, but none of her supporting cast do much more than deliver wooden lines with no sentiment. Rush, who was such a powerful figure in the earlier movie, is not much more than window dressing here. He has little to say, little to do, and adds no drama to the story. Owen is stiff and unconvincing. Perhaps the best is the Spanish king who at least is interesting. Or maybe Tom Hollander as Mary's jailer: he has only a few lines but he delivers them with intensity and makes them count. The rest seem to have had a really bad time of it.<br/><br/>And as with most lousy movies, this one dies because of its story, or lack thereof. The script has a mix of equal parts love, family, jealousy, religion, politics, intrigue, militaria, and does none of them justice. The battle scenes look phony and unconvincing; there is the hackneyed scene of the great speech before the big battle, but the battle never happens. The love stories are never convincing (neither one of them), and we never sympathize with either of the heroines. There is some smattering of religious thought thrown in, along with anachronistic sentiments of freedom triumphing over the inquisition, but the real issues (Catholicism vs. Protestantism) are never touched upon. One might think love of one's native land would be a theme in such a picture, but it's hardly even mentioned. There are so many minor subplots I can't even remember them all, and none of them amount to much of anything. Oh yes, Mary Queen of Scots, she makes a few cameo appearances as well, and we spend many minutes in lurid anticipation of her beheading, but then that too seems to have no connection with anything else.<br/><br/>Seems like the director/screenwriter couldn't choose which story they wanted to dramatize, so they tried to dramatize all five at once and ended up with a pointless hodge-podge.<br/><br/>I hate to admit it, but I was ready to walk out about halfway through but was too embarrassed. This from a guy who loves historical period films and who has the original ""Elizabeth"" near the top of the all-time list. Apparently the genius of the first film has completely eluded the makers of the second.<br/><br/>I give it 3/10."

","This movie approaches the brink of becoming another corny, hokey Hollywood travesty but recovers to become an incredibly powerful and unique portrayal of Elizabeth I and her closest advisers and the political situation in Western Europe in the late 16th century. Cate Blanchett offers a masterful, powerful and provocative portrayal of the Virgin Queen which unlike most Hollywood portrayals of historical personages does not devolve into a laughable caricature. Elizabeth has feelings too and cares about ALL of her people, not just those who are of her religious persuasion. Also, the movie offers a credible portrayal of Elizabeth's relationship with her cousin Mary as well as a credible and comprehensible explanation of King Philip's decision to go to war against England. Whether Spain in 1585 was the most powerful country in the world as the movie purports is a matter for debate but the fact that there was a time in history when Spain actually wanted to invade England is amazing and is a story in itself. This movie is worth watching."

With the rich history of record and the countless rumors from the period, the producers decided to make up their own out of whole cloth! Sir Francis Drake gets maybe a dozen words, and the Armada facts are turned upside down. I don't recall the English losing a single ship, and the Spanish only a few-and though the fire ships will wreak havoc on the Armada, it will come about as they travel home-not as in the film in a giant conflagration. But then, the focus was to make a fairy tale. And, interestingly, not the fairy tale of English legend, ""God blew and they were scattered."" Instead, the fairy tale is of high school melodrama."

","Most of the time it's the casting that makes a film and keeps us coming back for more. This is the case for ""The Golden Age"", the sequel to ""Elizabeth"", a film that turned Cate Blanchett into a star, introducing her considerable talents to the masses. In ""The Golden Age"", Blanchett is given more screen time and the opportunity to show the range she is capable of, giving us a portrayal that is complex, rich, exquisite, and ultimately glorious.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, it's hard to imagine anyone else, having the power this actress is capable of showing on screen. She carries the film, and it's her ability to interact with such varied characters that gives the film its strength. It all depends on the chemistry between her and the talented actors that support her, particularly, Clive Owen's rogue pirate.<br/><br/>""The Golden Age"" depicts another critical moment in the life of the Virgin Queen, as she must find the strength in herself to gather the support and strength she needs to save England from a brutal military attack by the Spanish Armada, the most powerful navy at the time. Elizabeth must deal with family issues, ethical issues, sentimental turmoil, another self-confidence crisis, and much more intrigue and attacks from both the Spaniards and their supporters on both sides of the ocean.<br/><br/>There are scenes in this film that will be remembered as perfect examples of what cinema can achieve, as the camera frames key characters during critical times in the story... Most impressive are all the scenes in which Cate participates, as she is able to show the amazing nature of a woman who endured much criticism and political turmoil and eventually transformed herself and her nation into one of the most powerful empires in the world.<br/><br/>There are interesting analogies in the film, particularly as Elizabeth adopts one life over another and allows her spirit to soar, vanquishing any negative impulses and nurture the surrogate child that her country becomes. According to the film, she finds herself incapable of finding an equal mate because of special circumstances, and then she rediscovers the strength that she has always possessed and turns into the leader everyone will respect, follow, and somehow adore.<br/><br/>""The Golden Age"" is a very handsome film, with superb production, and some spectacular costumes, exquisitely worn by Ms. Blanchett. It's definitely on its way to becoming a classic, a proud example of what some might call an intimate epic."
"Harker207","5","64","107","2 October 2007"," a disappointment
","The film was definitely beautifully shot and Cate Blanchett is, as always, wonderful. Technically, the sets and costumes were great, but as a previous commenter said, the love triangle was tedious and I felt the film relied too heavily on grand sweeping shots flooded with choral music, that dragged things down immensely.<br/><br/>Thematically, the film suffered for a number of reasons. In this day and age of religious strife, to pit Elizabeth, the white English Protestant who supposedly (in the film) supports freedom of belief (nothing could be further from the historical truth) against the swarthier, Arabic looking religious fundamentalist Philip of Spain (note: his Arabic appearance is historically accurate, but still) creates an uncomfortably clear reductionist parallel to modern conflicts that detracts from the film. Philip giggles like a madman the whole time, clutching his Bible.<br/><br/>Moreover, in attempting to make Elizabeth an accessible woman, the film focuses so much on her 'feminine vulnerabilities' and need for love that it drains her of the power and political astuteness that marked one of the greatest leaders, male or female, that the world has ever known. Elizabeth I was a POWERFUL POLITICIAN, not a giggling girl simpering at the feet of a man.<br/><br/>When the film focuses on the political intrigues and the decisive destruction of the Spanish Armada, it shines. When it focuses on the love triangle and reductionist religious fundamentalism, it fails. Sadly, so much of the film focuses on the latter that it is a trial to make it through the two hours."

If you have ever been to Fotheringhay, for example, you would know it is not by a lake in a setting that looks like Scotland.<br/><br/>Also Elizabeth's famous speech at Tilbury to her troops leaves out the best part, ""I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain...."" Why? The Armada battle is all-wrong with even the guns looking like they were from the Napoleonic Period.<br/><br/>Also Mary Queen of Scots probably had a French accent, as in the Helen Mirren version, as Mary was raised in France.<br/><br/>If you want a great scripted film just watch ""The Lion in Winter.""

","Utter tripe. While I wasn't expecting a documentary, surely the film makers could have kept the storyline a little more plausible. Sir Walter Raleigh, played ineffectually by Clive Owen, is depicted as an Errol Flynn type swashbuckler who personally sailed a fireship into the heart of the Spanish armada before diving overboard and swimming under the flaming aftermath to safety. It couldn't have been any worse if they had put a cutlass between his teeth and had a parrot on his shoulder. I half expected Captain Jack Sparrow to put in an appearance as well. Sir Francis Drake was relegated to one sentence of dialogue, and then only to egg on Raleigh, who in reality wasn't even on a ship at the time of the main conflict.<br/><br/>Mary Queen of Scots had the worst Scottish accent since Mel Gibsons portrayal of William Wallace. Francis Walsingham is portrayed somewhat woodenly by Geoffrey Rush, who seemed to be going through the motions and portrayed a character who ended up as menacing as a rather sleepy sheep.<br/><br/>Sorry if I am a bit negative, but this was utter tosh."

After her, the costumes and art direction it wasn't too great.<br/><br/>The acting of this movie overall was OK. Cate Blanchett was phenomenal showing her vulnerability and the complexities in her character having to deal with so many problems and yet having to stay in control. She fit her part perfectly as she did in the first movie. Like the first she really actually gave you the feeling of what a queen from back then might have been like. I like Clive Owen but I hated hated him in this movie. His style was too cliché and what really brought him down was not really realizing the point of his character. I understand Blanchett is supposed to be in love with him but he really just feels like he could have been cut from the entire movie and it wouldn't of made the slightest difference. I would have liked to have seen Geoffrey Rush much more in this movie but unfortunately his role was very limited.<br/><br/>The art direction and costume design was great. You could see some great photography and landscapes with great setup with the clothing. It was sort of able to fill the void with some of the mistakes made in this movie but it just was not enough.<br/><br/>Overall though the directing and editing was poor. The directing failed miserably at giving you an idea of what is happening. Even if you do get it, the movie fails at really showing how this event makes Elizabeth important great and why it is important.

Everyone familiar with the story is sitting waiting for Elizabeth to deliver that line, one of the greatest inspirational speeches in British history. It ought be the dramatic highlight of the movie. However, alas, it is not there. How can a screen writer not use such material?<br/><br/>Perhaps as bad is the role that the movie assigns Raleigh in the defeat of the Spanish Armada. During the entire fight up the Channel, Raleigh was never at sea. His responsibilities were on the land, defending the coast of Devonshire. Placing him on a fire ship targeted at the anchored Spanish fleet is the purist fiction.<br/><br/>Other lesser omissions and errors could also be cited.

However, the I've-just-seen-something-I-strongly-disprove-of look she has throughout the film just didn't cut it for me. That, and the mysterious persona she conveys makes her look more like she's craving attention then trying to withstand from it.

"bobak87","1","18","27","29 February 2008"," Sorry, but I really did not enjoy this film at all!
","I started watching this film in hope that it would be entertaining for a cold February night. The first film was a good watch, despite some of the historical question marks and overplaying of Dudley (not the first, and probably not the last time that this would be done!) As an historian, I have to say that I was very disappointed. Could they not afford Joseph Fiennes for a second movie? Was there any particular reason that one of the key members of court (not to mention Essex, another incredibly influential member of the Elizabethian court)was not included? The Raleigh/Elizabeth 'love story' was really a load of nonsense - is there ever going to be a film about Elizabeth where she is NOT fawning over all the men of her court? Yes, she was human and probably struggled with her feelings, but I suspect that there was more to her life than whether or not she was ever going to marry.<br/><br/>As for Mary Queen of Scots, my main upset with this is her accent. She is Queen of Scots, but she was raised in the FRENCH court, and was (briefly) Queen of France before the death of her sickly husband.<br/><br/>The film was rather complicated, as those with little or no knowledge of 16th Century British history could easily be lost - many of the characters aren't actually introduced properly, and it took my family some time to work out what exactly was going on. It would have been a much, MUCH better film if they had cut out all of the dramatic, uplifting music and spent more time on the script. As for clichés - my entire family gave up by the point of the horses leaping off the ship (Guinness, anyone?) If you are passionate about history, I would strongly recommend that you AVOID this film, as it will end up frustrating you (and those around you, if you are anything like me - I just have to comment when I'm watching a bad film...)

","If nothing else, Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) is an instructive case study in the failure of most sequels to live up to the successes of their progenitors. The original Kate Blanchett Elizabeth (1998) was one of the finest historical dramas of the last 20 years. In addition to the usual virtues of well-mounted period dramas (e.g. sumptuous costuming, make-up, and set-design), it offered a fresh point of view on familiar historical/biographical material, a sparkling script filled with memorable lines, secondary characters that burned themselves onto the screen, and understated but powerful cinematography and score. By contrast, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, while in some respects even more visually sumptuous than its predecessor, is over-produced, over-acted, and over-blown.<br/><br/>The problems with this sequel start at the core: a screenplay that lacks originality and wit. Whereas the first film brimmed with quotable lines like ""I am no man's Elizabeth"" and ""The dead have no titles,"" not a single phrase from the sequel sticks to mind. Even worse, its lack of imagination is compounded by systematic cannibalizing of key dramatic situations in the original script and by the regurgitation of dialog - minus the poetry and rhythms of the original language. When poor Kate Blanchett winced at the clip of her performance at this year's Oscar ceremony, it wasn't from false modesty. As a great actress, she recognizes unconvincing bluster when she sees and hears it. That she received a best actress nomination for this Elizabeth was a clear case of an Academy make-up call for not having given her the award when she really deserved it.<br/><br/>In addition to a wonderfully realized protagonist, the first film developed a rich cast of secondary characters like Sir Richard Attenborough's Lord Cecil and Geoffrey Rush's chilling but fascinating Sir Walsingham, Elizabeth's chief of security. In The Golden Age Walsingham returns as a poor shadow of himself, little more than a stooped and aging whipping boy for Elizabeth's frequent shrill tirades. To experience the trashing of this wonderful character (and actor) was emotionally painful. The sequel also lacked the compelling villain supplied by Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk in the original. In The Golden Age the villain's role is filled instead by Philip, King of Spain, but the cutaways to his religion-inspired vendetta against Elizabeth are distant emotionally as well as geographically, and the physical stereotyping of all the Spanish characters is embarrassing. Even the attempted assassination of Elizabeth, one of the most obviously recycled scenes, pales in the sequel. In the original we get the spooky, hood-clad specter of a pre-Bond Daniel Craig pursuing the Queen on behalf of the Pope (a wonderful cameo by the legendary Sir John Gielgud), while here we get a shaky nondescript youth pointing and firing a pistol at point blank range and either missing or forgetting to put a bullet in the gun. Who knows (or cares) which? On a positive note, Clive Owen's presence as Sir Walter Raleigh is The Golden Age's most interesting addition - but while Owen cuts a fine, convincing figure in 16th century garb, his relationship with Elizabeth is far less interesting and less satisfying than the one provided by Joseph Fiennes as the youthful Elizabeth's first love, Sir Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester.<br/><br/>Futilely attempting to compensate for a weakly-written script, The Golden Age offers up lingering, protracted visuals, one of the most overbearing musical scores in contemporary cinema, and - naturally these days - special effects galore. Unfortunately, the detailed CG rendering of the Spanish Armada's destruction succeeds less as drama than as an emblem of a Hollywood big budget vessel crashing and sinking under its own rudderless bulk."

","What can I say, the 1st Elizabeth was simply great, the kind of movie leaving you riveted to the edge of your seat! Unfortunately this one is very much the complete opposite. So yes the costumes are great and the few CGI special effects (basically the couple of minutes of action featuring the ships of the Spanish Great Armada) are well made.<br/><br/>But apart from that it's a 2 hours torture that could have easily been reduced to a half-hour. There's no rhythm, it's very very slow, with many supposedly ""key"" scenes just dragging on & on & on (e.g. the execution, the baby, the kiss, etc etc...). The trailer pretty much shows what's worth watching out of the 2 hours movie, how sad is that? Kate Blanchett's acting is possibly the only positive note overall & Clive Owen is pathetic as usual (though his worst performance is still Children of Men). As for Geoffrey Rush I really like him but he doesn't have much to do in this movie.<br/><br/>In the end, you feel the director made an attempt to picture some kind of intimate portrayal of Elizabeth: her fears, her doubts, her loneliness... Fine, but then stick to making some BBC TV documentary. Because for a full-length cinema feature it's definitely not good enough! Kapur should have stuck to the winning formula that worked so well for the 1st movie: the intrigues, the twisted plots, the action...<br/><br/>Sorry, just didn't do it for me."

","I am a huge fan of the first Elizabeth movie. I have it on DVD and watch it relentlessly. I am captivated by the intense acting and emotion in that movie and Cate Blanchett is simply mesmorising as Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush is also brilliant as Walsingham. So I waited in intense excitement for this sequel - the Golden Age - hoping for more of the same.<br/><br/>I didn't get what I was expecting.<br/><br/>This movie covers the period when Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots) is imprisoned and Spain is planning an invasion of Britain to assassinate Protestant Elizabeth and restore Catholic Mary to the throne. Which should all make for gripping stuff so why does Clive Owen bore us all to death for most of the time? I was headbutting the chair in front of me, wishing Elizabeth would order his head cut off or something. Anything to get him off the screen.<br/><br/>This movie PLODS along with pointless scenes and pointless characters. The bad guys are so badly developed and so badly acted that you don't feel anything when they fail. There is no real ""good guy"" to root for either. Half of the movie covers the old ground of ""Elizabeth is still a virgin and unmarried so here's some potential pathetic husband candidates for her"".<br/><br/>There is no real build up of suspense and when the Spanish Armada fleet (which is so blatantly CGI) finally gets underway, it's over before it begins (thanks to the dashing Clive Owens who does a Bruce Willis ""only one man can save us!"" act). I was looking forward to Blanchett doing her ""I have the heart and stomach of a King!"" speech but she didn't even do that either. Instead she looked as if she was trying to do a Mel Gibson ""Braveheart"" speech instead.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed and deflated I can't even begin to describe it. Even Geoffrey Rush (whom I was counting on to save the movie) looked so tired and annoyed throughout the movie, as if he signed the contract BEFORE looking at the script. When even he can't be bothered to make any effort, that doesn't bode well for the whole project.<br/><br/>Why oh why did they bother to make this movie?"

","Seriously, I don't know where to begin on this film which I went to with my grandmother and a sibling. <br/><br/>The film has so many pros, but in the end is down-weighed by cons. It's probably worth seeing at least once, but It's not necessarily going to be on your DVD shelf when it's available and that's okay.<br/><br/>The Pros: The acting is well delivered from everyone including Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen who are always perfect; the cinematography is gorgeous; the music is very stunning; and that ends up getting ""chewed"" down by the Cons: Extremely slow murders; illicit affairs that seem to drag; a not boring, but still long two-and-a-half hours; brief gratuitous nudity; unexciting war battle sequences; a literally non-existent script that seems to be trying to be telling the viewer a message that isn't expressed; all meaningful moments where someone is expressing something has ""next-to-none"" meaning; and the excellent music tends to play at inappropriate times like when the characters are saying something vital to the ""nonexistant"" plot.<br/><br/>And, plus, we viewers have already seen something like this before with the countless Adventure/History/War films out there. But while this film is ""so-so,"" it would have had a better place as an above-average T.V. drama, but then again HBO and the BBC have already re-enacted this story countless times so it probably wouldn't have been welcome there either. It's at least better then the 2004 take on ""The Alamo,"" but that's not saying very much. <br/><br/>So all in all, an extremely visual film with literally no substance. This will most likely only get an Oscar nominee for costume/wardrobe design and that's about it. I doubt it will find a place on cable either ( with the exception of Hallmark ) because it's nothing compared to any other historical drama/mini-series.<br/><br/>So see it if you've got time to kill.<br/><br/>P.S.: I seriously tried to look for any visual meaning and all I got was when, in one critical scene, Elizabeth is nearly assassinated by a traitor and doesn't die; she then seems to glow for a minute in the bright light as if the director was trying to signify that she is a strong women, but it wasn't elaborated on at all after all so then once again a vaguely-transferred message."

It felt so entirely false and ridiculous!! Was it just me, or was there a big, big lesbian suggestion between Elizabeth and Bess??? Why did I feel that a film about Raleigh's adventures in America would have been far more interesting whenever he was on screen? I'm pretty sure I'm not a genius politician, so why was it so tremendously obvious that killing Mary Stuart would start the war? Why did they keep emphasising the ""Elizabeth/Virgin Mary"" thing (like at the end). Wasn't she meant to be Protestant?!

I love the story, and have read and re-read the historical facts pertinent to the film. The premise main was not entirely flawed, although it does gloss over and leave out a lot. (where are you Sir Francis?) <br/><br/>Actually if they had left out Raleigh and had Clive play Drake this might have worked! ) coulda ... shoulda ... woulda .... oh well !!!! Drake was the bigger player than Raleigh and burned the Spanish fleet at Cadiz the year before.<br/><br/>It's possible that Mary Queen of Scots may have been setup by Phillip the Second, although, no one can really say whether that's true, it seems highly unlikely.<br/><br/>Also I doubt that Elizabeth was as uncertain of herself and conflicted as portrayed by the film. By then she was a survivor's survivor and new all the in's and out's of Renaissance Europe's Machiavellian politics. I did give Cate a great opportunity however. Unfortunately the movie just did not carry the story of England and Elizabeth's triumph over the Spanish as well as it could, actually it doesn't carry the story at all."

","I gave this movie one solitary star, and I suppose I will attribute that one to the actress who played Mary, the rival queen as hers was the only acting that stood out to me. Beyond her it seemed that the director had no ability to utilize the skill set of otherwise such great actors such as Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the movie bordered propaganda in its political incorrectness and it is becoming more and more of a frustration - as a non Anglo-Saxon - to watch movies such as these. Opening and ending titles which pitch England as the soul country to have fought Spain in those times and the immediate superpower afterwards, leave a wry taste in my mouth. If one makes historical costume dramas then at least tread the genre with some responsibility and don't grossly twist and distort history. As, during this particular episode in history, the French were fighting Spain and the Dutch were waging their war of independence from Spanish rule.<br/><br/>Then, to end the movie with the words that England entered an era of peace and prosperity could have used the word 'relative'. As within half a century the country would plunge into civil war and declare one war after another over petty commercial rivalry.<br/><br/>Make a fiction film if one cannot tell a story honestly.

Fact: the hero of the Spanish Armada has Drake, a brilliant tactician, who gets hardly a mention here. Fact: while fire ships were one tactic he used, the Armada was destroyed by the superior tactics and armament of a Navy that was about 80 years more advanced technologically: they had much faster, more maneuverable ships and much longer range artillery; they lay out of range of the Spanish guns, pounded them to pulp, and then closed in for the kill with their much more nimble vessels. It was Cassius Clay against Sonny Liston. Fact: Elizabeth was a penurious leader whose navy was never paid and was chronically under fed. <br/><br/>Blanchett is magnificent, as is Rush.

","I was highly disappointed in the sequel to the first Elizabeth. The title of this movie is ""Golden Age"", but we've been given nothing in the plot that describes to the viewer what Elizabeth did to make it the the Golden Age in England. Queen Elizabeth 1 was one of the greatest monarchs England ever had, and this film does little to show that. True, the film making is beautiful, the costumes are breathtaking, but beyond that the movie is a filled with pompous fluff. More attention should've been given to a better filming of the battle sequence, historical accuracy, development of historical details and dialog. The dialog is more concerned with being quotable and poignant without actually feeling like a real conversation amongst the characters. While trying to be regal it comes off as pompous and full of hot air. I'vie done a great deal of historical reading not only on Elizabeth, but on the Tudor family in general; and while this movie had the potential of being a great historical epic, it simply becomes a silly, expensive soap opera and a waste of the talented actors who star in it."

Scenes seemed to be in random order. What little plot there was, was laughable. It was like amateur night at the improv bar. I've listened to drunken karaoke that was less offensive. I think the costumes were left over from the first Elizabeth movie, so they had to shoot them and pretend there was a story surrounding it. Honestly, I think high school students could have created a better product with little or no knowledge of British history or film-making. It was a train wreck.

"Andy Sandfoss","4","14","22","15 October 2007"," what a disappointment
","Let's see now - this is a movie about Queen Elizabeth I in confrontation with the Spanish circa 1585. So where are the important players? Where's Leicester? Where's Sir William Cecil? Where's Drake? Where's Essex? Oh, yeah, in the first movie they said that the Earl of Leicester turned traitor against Elizabeth and participated in a plot to assassinate her. Cecil was real old and retired/fired by Elizabeth early on. Essex did't exist and Drake just kept in the shadows and did nothing important. Hmmmm.... Some peculiar history that Kapur has going on there. Just how are we to regard the relationship of this made-up faux Elizabeth to the real one? There were serious historical problems with the first movie that have only been made worse in this one. (They couldn't even leave the Tilbury speech alone; they just had to mangle it, too.) And yes, facts matter. Or would you accept a film biography where Lincoln went to Ford's Theater but left at the intermission? The only thing this film has going for it is Cate Blanchett, and it's not very kind even to her. She is basically there just to bellow in a ""regal"" fashion, flash a little eroticism here and there, and wear extravagant (and in some cases wildly inappropriate) costumes. The rest of the cast throws it away. Clive Owen in particular should be embarrassed at trying to create a Raleigh that should more properly be propped up as set decor for the next ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film. Geoffery Rush obviously just took the money and ran, giving nothing of the original performance as Walsingham in return. On the whole - don't bother. Wait 'till it's on cable....."

","In case you always wondered what was so special and important about Queen Elizabeth that she has remained one of the best-known persons in English history, this film surely won't tell you.<br/><br/>Its way of storytelling is at least 50 years behind. There is not one realistic and believable character in the entire film and although the images are splendid and Cate Blanchett does her best, the weaknesses of the script, in particular its puppet-like portrayal of the main protagonists are blatant.<br/><br/>Constantly, Elizabeth is referred to as an exceptional, unique person but it remains completely mysterious why we are supposed to believe this. She reacts all but calmly when she learns about the love-affair between Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth Throckmorton. If this is supposed to demonstrate a monarch's privation of personal wants, we have seen this much more convincingly elsewhere.<br/><br/>What is it then? Neither is Queen Elizabeth convincing as a Joan-of-Arc-lookalike addressing her soldiers nor as a war strategist maltreating a mosaic map with a stick. And when it comes to the death sentence of Mary Stuart, she is portrayed as the prototype of the ""typical"" woman too weak to bear the inevitable.<br/><br/>This film is not only pathetic and overblown, its look at gender is dated (and this is not because the time it is set in is the 16th century). Many a classical theater play about Elizabeth is more informative and innovative than this film."

Everything was stunning, from the settings and cinematography to the costumes.

","With a view clearly centered on the woman behind the figure of the queen, ""Elizabeth"" is a passionate portrait of the XVI century. The court, the costumes, the social hierarchy and procedures are thoroughly depicted showing both the richness and darkness of the time. <br/><br/>The queen (Cate Blanchett) is the main character, showed intimately, almost striped before our eyes. She starts as a monarch and with the pose one would expect from her. And yet soon we see that there is something more to that persona: the loneliness, the sense of duty with the lack of freedom it implies, the desire to love and simply be loved in return; to be loved by what she really his and only that. <br/><br/>As she lowers her defenses and allows Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a charming pirate with news of a world she has never seen, to come close, we could almost say she was only a woman during that time; no title, no obligations, pure will to be what she feels like. However the intrigue around the crown rushes in, the plot thickens, and the woman is set aside, giving room for the queen. It is after this, when it comes to the end of the movie, that something changes. Our intimate view of her character is lost and instead there seem's to be a little twist, as the overall feeling of the movie changes to that of an epic. In the final shots there's almost a deification of her and it's hard to believe it. And most of all it's less interesting because the woman behind the ""queen"" is more captivating than the idea of the ""queen""."

Perhaps even unsettling. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that the director has simply gotten carried away - he has immersed himself so much in the subject that the result is a work of obsession - and that always sits uncomfortably.<br/><br/>We are, therefore, treated to a movie that (hopefully) inadvertently proclaims that Protestants are good and god-favoured, whereas Catholics are a bad lot generally. That the English are a grand bunch of people, while the Spanish are vile and evil. That absolute monarchy and divine right are the only way to really run the town, so long as the monarch in question is virtuous, English and Protestant.<br/><br/>Of course, all of these things are fine and well for the story itself; the misfortune is that Kapur broadcasts these ideas through the film as his message to the audience.<br/><br/>It perhaps doesn't help that Philip of Spain is portrayed as a demented dancing dwarf with Tourette's Syndrome.<br/><br/>I'm going to watch this movie again at some point, but I have to say that it is, I think, a glorious Ozymandine failure."

In the past few years we have gotten HBO's stunning Elizabeth 1 and Helen Mirren's QE2, The Tudors, and the soon to be released Mary, Queen of Scots and The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately Elizabeth: The Golden Age is just a recycled rehash of these films and a souped up costumed soap opera. <br/><br/>The film covers the ground late in Elizabeth's life prior to the Spanish Armada. With the lack of an English male heir, the Spanish kingdom is closing ranks on her throne, pushing forth their candidate to rule the English throne.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is the meantime is swept up in her dealings with the smooth Sir Walter Raleigh. She is supported by the pretty but pointless in terms of story lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton, and Geoffrey Rush who is surprisingly reserved as her counsellor Sir Francis Walsingham. While all the actors involved are undoubtedly talented, they don't really have anything to do and their efforts are wasted on the atrocious script which amounts to nothing more than soap operatic gazing and tantrums.<br/><br/>Not even Blanchett can save this train wreck of cardboard cut-out characters, juvenile musing and tantrums, simplification of the English and Spanish characters, and their respective puerile depictions of good vs evil. To top it off, the nauseating musical score only accentuated the sensationalized soap-operatic elements of this overblown cheese.<br/><br/>Kapur seems to have gone downhill from the last Elizabeth. This ""sequel"" was atrociously and pretentiously shot. Such direction involved blocking the characters form the camera with all manner of stupid objects from frames to walls and lights, shooting from ridiculously pointless angles such as ceilings and poorly edited scenes, jumping from time frames across England and Spain with no continuity of what is happening throughout the story.<br/><br/>There have been so many better recent adaptations of Elizabeth. The trick is not to create something better than the last, or the umpteenth version of Elizabeth and Essex, but for audiences who crave more of one of our most enigmatic leaders; something that is unique, different and not merely a rehash of soap operatic whining and outbursts. Such material as The Golden Age that would be better off on the front pages of a tabloid magazine. Honestly in the end, I just didn't care."

And then Geoffrey Rush and Rhys Ifans: the clincher. I have to say, I was disappointed with this movie. The production is lush and the costumes are gorgeous, but the characterisation is paper-thin and the plotting lacks all tension. The only moment when I sat up in my seat was when Elizabeth, who has learned of the Mary Stuart plot against her, howls at the Spanish ambassador ""I have in me such a hurricane as will strip Spain bare!"". At other times I groaned out loud (the mad galloping on horseback through fields with sweet Sir Walter! What a cliché!). The white-clad, angelic Elizabeth who faces down her would-be assassin was a reprise of Galadriel, which I found unaccountable. The exhortation to her (rather thinly-populated) army, dressed in pristine armour à la Henry V, was lame.

As with the earlier movie, it looks magnificent, with wonderful locations. sets, and costumes, and the camera work is stunning with clever compositions and remarkable fluidity and angles. Again the acting is particularly fine with Blanchett a tour de force.<br/><br/>The focus is narrower in time, beginning in 1585 and climaxing with the defeat of the Spanish Armada three years later in action scenes absent from the first film. The main problem is the script from Michael Hirst & William Nicholson.

","With an exciting historical topic and a very influential all-star cast including Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, this movie looked like the next grand epic since Kenneth Braughn's ""King Henry V"". Despite the many negative reviews I have read, I still wanted to see this movie. I usually agree with most film critics, and unfortunately I have to agree with them one this one. ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" could have been a spectacular achievement, but it falls short on almost everything of which makes a historically epic movie.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film was nothing more than men trying to woo pretty ladies of Queen Elizabeth's court. The movie felt like a chick flick. The acting is even drier in this section of the movie. Clive Owen is no more than a chick magnet and a typical action hero, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored with the movie itself, and just went with the flow, following Blanchett's lead. Miss Blanchett though seemed to enjoy herself, bossing everyone around as queen, wearing pretty costumes and make up, and getting all emotional over every little detail; she would be happy in one scene and totally mad in the next. I have to admit though that this made her quite an ambivalent character<br/><br/>In the midst of all this, the movie tries to develop a conspiracy in which one of the Queen's distant relatives wants to assassinate her. This conspiracy is hard to follow; no names are given, so I don't know who is who, much less who ends up murdered and why. When this conspiracy quelled, the remaining hour is made of a wannabe action flick. For no apparent reason, the King of Spain, who is no more than an annoying figurehead that jabbers quickly in Spanish, wants to take over England. <br/><br/>This then leads to the big, epic battle in the North Sea. It takes forever to get to this sequence, and then it delivers as one of the most boring battle scenes I have ever seen. There's not enough explosions, death, and fighting to make it enjoyable. As far as my history goes, the naval battle in the North Sea was among the grandest and largest battles in world history. There are a lot of ships present, but there's not much happening with them. When this is all over, the movie wraps up with a happily ever after ending. <br/><br/>I may sound that I absolutely loathe this movie, but I don't. This film had some of the most beautiful cinematography and costume designs that I have seen since ""The Curse of the Golden Flower."" The set production and make up design was also as equally amazing to look at. And the score was very pretty, although it was a bit bombastic in the start and end of the film, occasionally overriding the dialogue. <br/><br/>It's not the worst movie I have seen, but it is certainly not the best. From the elegant artwork and the ""ambivalent"" performance by Miss Blanchett, I give this a 4/10."

"Ozzy2000","1","11","19","17 January 2008"," Cate Blanchette a joke that should play Reinhardt Hiendrich
","Shekhar Kapur once again gives us a complete distortion of history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first. The casting of the very masculine Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth is also disaster as the original Queen Elizabeth was a highly sexual creature from the age of about fourteen. Furthermore Queen Elizabeth was a very stoic person who showed no emotion to anyone in an age where royalty really was a sign of divinity. Cate Blanchett and the director are unable to capture the ruthlessness of the Queen Elizabeth nor even a close track of the historical sequence of events. There are many period films depicting great sea battles and this one is not that impressive. Geoffry Rush appears as Sir Francis Walsingham adviser to the Queen but is better suited to playing an Evil Pirate in line with his acting ability.<br/><br/>There have been much better films about the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first and the events at the time but students should stick to the documentaries and History texts if they want academic credibility.<br/><br/>I think this film would have been more entertaining if Shekhar Kapur gave it the Bollywood treatment with lots of Indian costumes , singing and dancing around decorated trees and re;eased it in his native India. I really believe that Cate Blanchett is best suited to Bollywood films or playing a the role of her look alike General Reinhardt Heinrich head of the Nazi Gestapo."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","10","17","13 October 2007"," Somewhat over-melodramatic
","Perhaps 9-years-later sequels are becoming a fashion: after ""Before sunset"", we now have ""Elizabeth: the golden age"". Those who remember ""Elizabeth"" (1998) will justifiably have expectations but logic suggests that those expectations should be modest. The early years of Elizabeth I saw her facing crisis after crisis, culminating in the climatic conclusion when, in Godfather-style-montages, we see her eliminate all her dangerous enemies. What follows, ""the golden age"", is by definition less stormy. Even when the ride could be at certain times a little bumpy, she was at all times in complete control. The tension of dramatic conflict is much reduced.<br/><br/>Whether one enjoys this sequel depends very much on how much ones cares about accuracy of historical facts. I can believe some of the audience going from being irritated, annoyed to furious as the movie progresses. But I'll assume that this represents only a minority of the audience. Most are here to see Cate Blanchett and couldn't care less about historical accuracy. <br/><br/>How do the movie makers keep the audiences' interest in this period of relative stability of Elizabeth I's life and reign? They start slowly, by brief glimpses of the plot lines that will be developed: the Spanish girl-Queen who will later send the Spanish Amarda to invade England, Mary Stewart whose conflict with Elizabeth is well known, Elizabeth Throckmorton the closest lady-in-waiting who will later get entangled in a love triangle involving the Queen. <br/><br/>The introduction of the key player Sir Walter Raleigh is made, however, in a form of an amusing interlude before the movie gets into the serious business of developing the plot lines. Still a pirate and not yet a nobleman, Raleigh brings back from the New World a parade of exotic curios, including tobacco. <br/><br/>Then comes yet another minor interlude, with Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), a major character last time but now reduced to a minor role with precious little to do, wandering around almost comically, continuing to play the futile role of the Queen's matchmaker. Then finally, it's down to the business of the 3 main plots. <br/><br/>The very well known story of Mary, Queen of Scots has been played with Mary or Elizabeth as the centre of attention in different movies and plays. ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" (1972) had Vanessa Redgrave in the title role. As well, each version will dramatize (some will say fictionalize) the conflict in different ways. A play I recently watched, ""Mary Stuart"", by 18th century German playwright Friedrich Schiller, portrays Elizabeth as quite ruthless in ordering Mary's execution. This movie, predictably, places it sympathy on Elizabeth, portraying her as suffering great agony in reluctantly ordering Mary's execution, a just sentence on a murder Mary plotted. The highlight of the aforementioned play is a climatic confrontation between the two women, which the movie does not show at all. Mary is played by Samantha Morton, and anyone who has seen ""In America"" (2002) and ""The libertine"" (2004) knows how good she is. Unfortunately, she has only a few scenes here, in a movie which understandably is all Cate Blanchett's show.<br/><br/>The climatic sea battle ending in crushing of the mighty Spanish Amarda is dealt with in a rather low-key fashion, which is not such a bad thing. Although it is needed as a constantly lurking climax, this movie is not really about a battle, but about a woman. I, for one, am happy to see that we are spared the pseudo grandiose of CGI ""spectaculars"". The battle is depicted mostly at close range, at the individual actor level, with an emphasis that is just about right.<br/><br/>My summary line is with reference to the love triangle between Elizabeth, Walter Raleigh and another Elizabeth, the pretty young lady-in-waiting. While I understand that movies often need such things, the treatment is a little too melodramatic for my taste. Granted that Clive Owen is sufficiently dashing and Australian actress Abbie Cornish quite charming, Blanchett's ranting and raving is not becoming of her regal persona that we see in most of the rest of the movie. I guess this was a few hundred years ago and they can do pretty well anything they like with the script. Just imaging them doing something like that with Helen Mirren in ""The Queen"" (2006)!<br/><br/>Two final words on this movie: Cate Blanchett."

","For a movie set in the 16th century I really didn't expect ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" to be so entertaining and fast-paced. Having not seen the first part, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to follow the plot, but thankfully the movie pretty much stands on his own (which is probably why producers chose not to call it ""Elizabeth I. II"" or maybe ""Elizabeth 1.2""... just kidding).<br/><br/>So, yes, it's an entertaining movie, but in the third act it becomes incredibly pompous. The imagery is very theatrical all the way through, but at the end director Shekhar Kapur just takes it one step too far. There are epic battles at sea with horses jumping into the water, thunderstorms and so on and so forth. Even though, I'm not an historian, I'm pretty sure most events aren't portrayed authentically. At least I can't imagine that all Spanish people back then were gay-ish psychopaths.<br/><br/>Well, yeah, big surprise: as a historical document this movie doesn't really serve well. It's popcorn cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. I heard part 1 was different. If it's true, then the sequel is a step down."

","Disappointing to say the least. Certainly not worth the 7.8 stars it was given. It was fluff with no substance. The story was too choppy. Although, there were a couple of times I felt Elizabeth's anguish most the time the emotion is cut off and the viewer is left dangling. It is not the fault of the cast. The story or direction was not up to the caliber of these actors. But alas, I love period pieces and the costuming was well worth the viewing of this movie. Thus the 5 stars.

","I think this film is quite awful, clearly fictional. They depict Elizabeth as a freedom and human rights lover. In fact, she made a law by which every single catholic priest in England had to be tortured and hanged. The UK still has problems of protestants vs catholics. Most of these problems were started by this queen. She wasn't a warrior queen either. It is also clearly anti-Spanish, not only on historical data but also inaccurate and misleading with respect to personality, details and physical appearance of the characters in the Spanish court. Philip II is not only distorted and manipulated at the level of historical facts, but also used as an excuse to, once again, assert themselves and the world that the Spanish are evil, dark, with black wigs and and coal black eyes. Philip II, a XVI century gentleman with blue eyes and red hair is depicted as a dark haired illiterate maniac. All of this film is no more than the perfect occasion to distort and manipulate the reality. Bringing forth the truth as a lie and the lie as truth. It should not be called historical film but propaganda film."

How can one call himself a ""historian"" and then tack his name onto this film? Kudos to the set directors and their crews, and the costume folks. You can really get a feel for what it would LOOK like in the 16th century, but the story is just wrong. Go find a good book about the Armada and you'll see what I mean. For crying out loud, Sir Walter Raleigh had NOT ONE THING to do with this event. He wasn't there. He wasn't even a sailor. Go find a good book about Sir Francis Drake. Then you'll know who the real hero of the story is. Shame shame shame. I avoided watching this movie for a long time because I knew Drake was being replaced, if that's the right way to put it, by Raleigh. I finally gave in and watched it. I shouldn't have.

","It's really not so odd that director Shekhar Kapur would wait nine years and then craft a loud, bombastic sequel to his only claim to fame, the lavish period drama ""Elizabeth"" which rightfully launched the career of uber-actress Cate Blanchett, in an attempt to resurrect his own floundering career. It is rather odd that Blanchett, a consummate actress of incalculable range, seems to never turn down a script, including this dud of a sequel to the film that first allowed her to shine. The oddest thing, however, is that the completely uncalled for ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is actually quite entertaining and might've received higher praise had the intrusive music score not induced such a numbing headache.<br/><br/>Blanchett, of course, is terrific, and doesn't seem to mind that the screenwriters have turned her signature character into a woman with split personalities: a raving love-scorned woman in private who constantly crumbles under pressure, and a powerful monarch who commands the wind and becomes a divinity to her people in public. Elizabeth has no character arc here like she did in the original film that saw her mature from frightened princess to calculating queen. The sequel suffers from this lack of development for its titular historical icon, but Blanchett rules the madhouse with an iron fist, chewing the scenery when necessary for dramatic effect and maximum entertainment value.<br/><br/>The sequel also suffers from too much focus on a silly love triangle involving Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh (an uninspired Clive Owen), and one of her ladies in waiting (a ravishingly gorgeous but ultimately lifeless Abbie Cornish). The rest of the film covers events that were already treated in a more respectful and quietly powerful manner in HBO's miniseries starring Helen Mirren. These include Elizabeth's divisive relationship with Mary Stuart (a blistering Samantha Morton doing an entertaining bit of over-acting), and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, whose sinking is done up in a rock opera style that serves as a guilty pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, director Kapur, who never saw an overhead shot, candlelit scene, or 360 degree crane movement he didn't love, uses his bigger budget to ridiculously grand effect creating immaculate set designs populated with over the top costuming and epic pageantry. ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is completely unnecessary, but despite some of its stunning ineptitude, it turns out not to be a colossal waste of time and will entertain those who will allow it to bludgeon them. Where the first film was a smart period piece inspired by ""The Godfather"", the silly sequel is a dumb art-house film inspired by obnoxious action flicks. Blanchett, who hopefully will become more selective in her roles as she ages, oddly seems at home in both. I'm not sure if that's the mark of a great actress or a desperate movie star."
"faithrs82","1","6","9","9 February 2008"," No entertainment
","While American moviegoers may go to be entertained, this one failed badly on that aspect as well. It portrays Elizabeth I as a whiny, indecisive, scorned woman who preferred feigned affection over the real power that she had. It is an insult to the historical Elizabeth and to Cate Blanchett who has been so amazing in the past. The first movie based on Elizabeth's life set the stage for who she was to become and how her reign brought about England's golden age. This movie should have been a continuation on that theme. But it failed miserably. Most movies featuring real persons are not historically correct, but they usually highlight the reasons that person was famous/great, etc. This movie does absolutely none of that."

","""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" tells the tale of veteran ruler Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) at the fear of being overthrown by the powerful King of Spain Philip II (Jordi Molla) as he's on a crusade to declare full Catholic dominance in Europe in hopes that his young daughter becomes the new Queen of England. Meanwhile the scheming Mary Queen of the Scots (Samantha Morton) has plans of her own to dethrone Elizabeth by throwing her into her prison. When Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returns from England after spending years in the New World, Elizabeth becomes enthralled by his presence as well as her lady in waiting Bess (Abbie Cornish). Chief Adviser Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) continues to negotiate with the court affairs as he listens in on Mary's evil plots. Mary's demise was the perfect foil for Philip to release the infamous Spanish Armada in hopes to overthrow Elizabeth as the Queen of England. <br/><br/>""I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too; and think foul scorn that ... Spain, or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and reward of every one of your virtues in the field."" This was the words of encouragement Her Majesty as she gathers her troops in Tilbury to take down the Spanish Armada in 1588. This ""Golden Speech"" is one of the most quotable words in British history that's up there with the many that was said by Shakespeare and Churchill and that neither Hollywood can ever botch or paraphrase those famous words. No matter how hard they try. <br/><br/>In 1998, I had the chance to see 1998's ""Elizabeth"" directed by Shekhar Kapur and my reaction was that is was incredibly stunning, but I had some issues with the pacing and I didn't really like Joseph Fiennes. In spite of those shortcoming it had plenty of Academy Awards nominations and other accolades to its credits. Nine years after that, they made the much anticipated sequel which is emphasizing on Elizabeth I and her relationship with Raleigh and the Religion Wars with Spain. From my knowledge I read that the Spanish couldn't get through because the English bays were not overly deep enough and the usages of fire ships and were also problematic. Strange as it seems, but Britain has been spared many times thanks to the waters surrounding the little country. Even their biggest ships were overturned due to excess stacking and abysmal weather conditions. <br/><br/>As for the film itself the costumes were quite gorgeous, but the historical inaccuracies were way overwhelming. Whether it's the fictionalized homicidal attempt by gunpoint, or the uses of historical locations, the undermining of Sir Walter Raleigh and the condemning of the Roman Catholic Church, the misconceptions in the motives of Mary Stuart and the Spanish as a whole, the falsifying will likely scratch the heads of any historical fanatic. <br/><br/>On the entertaining level, it is quite satisfying and will keep you on the edge of your seat, but the Spanish Armada is overwrought with a tedious montage sequence proceeded by an unorthodox shot of Elizabeth standing in a hallway. The entertainment value is pretty good and should leave a positive impression to the open public (not as good the first installment), however is there another reason why we should see another retelling of Elizabeth's life? I mean she's making more screen appearances than Abe Lincoln who seems to be in everything. <br/><br/>One of the things that underwhelmed me about this movie was the lack of a grandeur epic moment. This sequel should've been flooded with highlights to usurp the predecessor, but with the exception of the Armada, this film was watered down badly. I guess the scene that caught my eyes was the one involving Philip II of Spain. Not because of the green hue or his personality as a cowering religious radical, but the peculiar ways the shots were handled. Which also includes the rather obscene dance scenes ever shot on film. Acting wise the supporting cast seemed underdeveloped, but Blanchett shows her true dominance as a leading performer. <br/><br/>Even though this movie was very flawed, historically inaccurate and not overpowering in its delivery, this sequel is still strongly entertaining to watch if you like costume dramas, but if you want historical accuracy, it would better if you just read about in textbook."

","If your looking for a history lesson, you'd do better with Toy Story. This fluff-piece is a joke compared to its predecessor which has as much historical value as a wooden nickel. Apparently, according to this film, Elizabeth Tudor whined and whimpered and yelled all her queenly life in over-lit hallways that suggest that the halogen lamp was invented in the 16th century. Not a shadow to be seen on these movie sets. This time around, Elizabeth mopes and screams and whines like a jilted fifteen year old. Her maid in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, apparently missed all her acting classes because she could do nothing more than stare and vaguely smile. Clive Owen, who shows no more acting ability beyond that of a disembodied foot, looks like a cheap cartoon version of Errol Flynn in tights as he bandies around on ship ropes. He obviously texted in his role, sounding almost as dull and talentless as Liam Neeson doing Shakespeare. Even Bette Davis' version with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland, another fluff piece, had the smarts to portray Elizabeth as a real queen, acerbic, angry, confused, intimidating to her suitors, but ultimately capable of running a powerful country, taking up more space than her underlings. Here, Cate Blanchett, whines and sobs like she had just failed her SATS and does nothing more important than wear clothes. Some scenes are so ridiculous, you'd thing you were watching a back story of the making of Project Runway. Cate Blanchett, in this version, seemed more interested in the buffet for the cast members than acting like she ruled one of the most powerful forces in European history. The only interesting piece centers on the revisionist version of Mary, Queen of Scots. Unfortunately, like half the film, her demise is filmed entirely in slow motion, making her drawn-out execution last longer than her actual life. This film would have cost half the time to watch if they hadn't filmed so much of it in slo-mo. Snore. This is the crib notes to history, lazily made for coasting high-schoolers, most of whom cheat on tests and are no more interested in actual history than the wigs on their head and their designer's dresses. Which brings us to the trumped-up reason for Elizabeth's white makeup and hair pieces. In this film, the writers want to give the impression that Elizabeth's most important decision was to become a born-again virgin. In reality, she suffered from eczema, lice and rickets. Her appearance and hair faux paus were more an excuse to cover up those maladies, not a goth need to look wacky to her subjects. While the previous film suffers from revisionism and loose attention to history books, it has beauty and depth this film lampoons. At worst, the first film avoids looking like it's brightly filmed on the set of ""Friends."" And, strangely, in a story about an historical figure whose beauty, or loss of it, Cate Blanchett is not only very attractive but the only character that doesn't age. My advice: stop reading magazines about body consciousness, get the heck off your pointless cell phones, stop watching ""Stupid Vapid Housewives from Any County, and read a book on this amazing woman in English history. She took up a lot more space than this waste of celluloid implies."

","Recap: The history both in front of and behind the scenes of Elizabeth, the English Queen of the 16th century. Also known as the Virgin Queen for her lack of husband she lives in a peaceful time and the English people prospers. But she is a protestant, and the Catholic countries around the Mediterranean, led by Philip of Spain, plot against her. The center of this plot is the imprisoned Queen Mary of Scots. She is a catholic, and the focus of a rebellious group that wish to put her on the throne. This group try to assassinate Elizabeth, leading to Mary's, as the apparent head of the conspiracy, execution. And that is all Philip needs to declare war.<br/><br/>But also, there is the personal story of Elizabeth. Despite being at the center of attention all the time she is lonely. She longs for love and true honest friendship, which is desperately hard to find when you are in power. But then a Sir Walter Raleigh appear at court, and emotions stir.<br/><br/>Comments: I liked this much better than I thought I would. Knowing little of her time on the throne I knew there were some dramatic events that surely would do for good parts of the movie. But I feared that long stretches in between would be slow, dull and only about showing the costumes. My fear was fortunately unfounded.<br/><br/>Sure, it is a lot about the costumes, and the settings. And they are fantastic (I recommend to check the bonus feature about this). The director, production designer and art and costume department has truly done a masterful work. Because the movie is stunningly beautiful. Costumes, architecture, light and perspectives are woven together to a truly magnificent ground work for the movie. Fortunately, and to the directors credit, it is meant just to be the ground work, the foundation. It is never supposed to take over the story, be the main attraction or take over the story (i.e. just prancing about in long pointless dances dressed up in the beautiful dresses). Instead it supports the story well, gives it credibility.<br/><br/>The main story is divided in two with Elizabeth and Raleigh at the center of both. These two story lines supporting each other do so that are very few slow or dull moments in the movie. Perhaps not full of traditional action all the time, but there are always something happening, something brewing. It might be the complex relationship between Elizabeth and Raleigh, with the air full of attraction but a relationship that can't be. Or it might be the political plotting that leads up to the war, and one of the legendary naval battles in history. Either way, something is always happening. There are few, if any, dull moments.<br/><br/>A key part to this is the complexity of the main characters, especially Elizabeth, well played by Cate Blanchett. Clive Owen is good too as the roguish, independent and proud Raleigh, but it is Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth that stays in my mind. Deeply determined and strong, at least outward, she is also fragile and lonely, seeking attention and affirmation. It's her complexity that really breathes life in the movie.<br/><br/>8/10"
"TxMike","Null","2","2","23 March 2008"," The Protestant English and the Catholic Spanish go to war against each other.
","I enjoyed this movie a bit more than its rating would indicate, but my wife didn't care for it at all. After I saw it, I looked up a short biography of Sir Walter Raleigh and it seems that the movie is fairly realistic. However Raleigh seems to be somewhat romanticized in the movie. But most of the characters appear to be based on real historical people.<br/><br/>It was the 16th century and England was turning towards Protestantism, while about half of England was still Catholic. Queen Elizabeth's insiders urged her to imprison Catholics because of the threat, but she refused to treat her loving subjects that way. She strongly believed that people should stand on what they do, not what they believe. Still, some clandestine executions were carried out without her knowledge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Catholic Spain considered Elizabeth and her Protestant population heretics and vowed to conquer them. Their case was further aggravated by Sir Walter Raleigh, New World explorer, who also pirated the gold from Spanish ships and delivered it to the Queen.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is excellent as Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. The movie depicts her as having a romantic attraction to Raleigh, who had great affection for her also. However he impregnated one of her attendants, Elizabeth ""Bess"" Throckmorton (pretty, blonde Australian Abbie Cornish), and they were married in a small ceremony without the permission of Elizabeth. In real life that got them imprisoned in the Tower of London, but it isn't clear in the movie what their punishment was.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is good as charming and witty Sir Walter Raleigh. The movie shows him as a hero in helping to defeat the attacking Spanish Armada, but that was an embellishment for the movie.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is good as Elizabeth's adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, who was shown as actually doing things to encourage the conflict between England and Spain. He appeared to be a traitor.<br/><br/>Good movie. As history tells us, the Spanish were not successful, England entered into a ""golden period"" under Elizabeth, and even today Catholics and Protestants coexist in England. Sir Walter Raleigh did not fare so well after Elizabeth died, he was eventually tried for crimes and beheaded."

","This is about as good a film, for watching purposes, as I've seen in a while. Excellent acting, great cinematography, well-flowing editing, and just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Elizabeth, Walter Raleigh and Bess is nicely played out, making clear the difficult and unfair position Elizabeth is in as a woman whose only way of truly maintaining power in the eyes of those around her, as much as they try to convince her otherwise, is to not subjugate herself to any man, as much as she wants to be with one for personal reasons. (Unfortunately this is still an issue that is not so far from home.)<br/><br/>Again, for ""watching purposes,"" as I say - meaning, for the pure enjoyment of watching a well-made film - this is far better than a lot of the stuff out there, and certainly, in my mind, deserved more attention. The cinematography is gorgeous, the soundtrack cues timed perfectly, and the cuts move the film along very smoothly.<br/><br/>Not quite sure why the film isn't looked upon more favourably...."

And if you're totally ignorant of English history, you won't be annoyed by the many inaccuracies and lies.<br/><br/>The film is obviously victim of political correctness. Since Elizabeth is a woman who managed to stay free in that age of male domination, she must be good. Well, historian says she was tough, she was ruthless, and she knew politics... but she was quite different from the protagonist of this fairy tale.<br/><br/>Then, the producers of the film are trying to sell British people the idea that the British empire was founded by a progressive and open-minded queen. Not at all. The real founder was one who is totally out of fashion today, a blood-thirsty white male protestant Anglo-Saxon bastard called Oliver Cromwell, who is totally politically incorrect, but actually did the job. And Elizabeth was not such a progressive woman.<br/><br/>However, as I have already said, it's a nice fairy tale, the costumes are very good, Blanchett is special... and the 1588 battle in the Channel is not bad, though it's mostly computer graphics and it shows--looks a bit like a video game."

"Vaughanmister","6","2","2","20 November 2007"," Cate Blanchett reprises her breakthrough role as the virgin queen with somewhat less success.
","Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a victim of its own epic reach. It reaches for poignant greatness but achieves only stilted hyperbole. Whereas with the first film, Shekhar Kapur created an intimate-feeling, small spectacle (if such a paradox can exist), this second outing for the virgin queen feels much bigger and brasher.<br/><br/>The film takes place as England, with an empty treasury, must defend its borders from Phillip II (Jordi Molla), King of Spain, and his Armada. As well as this threat, Elizabeth must also contend with various threats to her life, not least of which from her incarcerated cousin, Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) and deal with her attraction towards Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen with a rather unenthused Devonshire accent.<br/><br/>What Kapur did so well with the first film, and what he does here also to some extent, is to create splendour. The sumptuousness of Elizabeth's various garments almost detracts from anything anyone is saying on screen. Whereas in the first film this was consistent throughout the film, here there are only set pieces of vividity and poignancy. There is a wonderful moment when the Queen has gone to morning prayers and her life is put in danger by a concealed assassin. As he shouts, she turns slowly, nervously, bathed in an almost heavenly light. But these moments are not enough to serve the film in its entirety.<br/><br/>After building up the story through moments similar to the above, it seems Kapur realises he has spent nearly all the film dwelling on the relationship between Elizabeth and Raleigh and hurriedly chucks the kitchen sink in for the film's climax. Elizabeth riding on a white horse on the coast, the sun glinting off her superbly polished silver armour as the ominous armada approach in the background. Walter Raleigh swinging from galleon to galleon in the sea battle, diving underwater as his ship, aflame, crashes into a Spanish vessel. Kapur appears to have abandoned history for the sensational. Although ridiculous, the sheer vision and spectacle of the climax forces you to appreciate it.<br/><br/>There is no doubt Blanchett carries the film, her intensity and sincerity as the Queen is worthy of Oscar recognition come next year. The rest of the performances are passable. Geoffrey Rush returns as Walsingham, now a decaying relic compared to the first film. Samantha Morton is severely underused as Mary Stuart, forgiving her Scottish accent (Mary was known to have lived most of her life in northern France) she conveys her as tormented, and sufficiently eccentric. In fact her beheading is one of the best moments in the film.<br/><br/>Verdict: What is more a series of set pieces and showy cinematography, never really amounts to a whole, but should be commended for its historically inaccurate, wacky climax- who needs a history lesson when they go to the cinema anyway? *** out of *****"

Even though I do enjoy chick flicks,I personally feel that the film should not have been portrayed in this way.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no chemistry between Abbie Cornish and Clive Owen; whether this was intentional I do not know.

","If you're thinking about viewing this film, don't let all the naysayers discourage you. If you enjoy great acting performances, stunning direction and cinematography and more (sets, costumes, etc.) you should be entertained for most of the two hours. The story was pretty interesting, too. I was amazed to look at the user-comments afterward and see all the complaints, nitpicking nonsense like ""the music is intrusive."" The score, like the production values, is just fine.<br/><br/>It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me, just like another DVD released this week (""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford""), the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats. <br/><br/>I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.<br/><br/>Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: ""rubbish."" Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority. <br/><br/>Rush is ""Sir Francis Walsingham"" and Morton plays ""Mary, Queen of Scots."" Their roles were smaller than I would like to have seen but both are riveting each time they are on screen, especially Morton. Owen, as the masculine and Errol Flynn-like ""Sir Walter Raleigh,"" also is fun to watch. Abbie Cornish provided eye candy as ""Bess Thorckmorton.""<br/><br/>On the negative side, I agree with the criticism that the filmmakers concentrated so heavily on the great costumes, sets and visuals, they didn't give the characters an equal representation. Also, the ending battle scenes were rushed and it wasn't really shown clearly how the Armada was defeated. <br/><br/>If I was Roman Catholic (I am not), I might be a little offended at this film. The Catholics, as shown here - the ones from King Philip II of Spain of the 1500s - are shown as ridiculously bloodthirsty and hypocritical to their faith. The writers make sure to show anyone with a cross, rosary beads or any other Christian symbol as a evil, despicable person. It was way overdone. On the Protestant side, it wasn't flattering, speaking as an evangelical, seeing ""The Protestant Queen"" shown as a true believer of some astrologer/ soothsayer (which is anti-Biblical) but was never seen consulting any minister (cleric). For advice, Christians seek God and/or His written word and pastors, not ""the stars."" That is so Hollywood to give that such revered credence.<br/><br/>However, overall, being someone enamored with cinematography, I had few complaints with this movie and felt I received my money's worth of entertainment. In fact, it inspires me to check out the 1999 film of the ""Elizabeth"" which, somehow, I never saw. I assume that will be high quality, as well."

","I went to the crew screening. SPOILERS. <br/><br/>I don't do this but I was very disappointed with this film and felt I had to get some things off my chest. It's an assumption but whole film has seemingly suffered from the big budget that has been pumped into this. The producers have obviously taken more control and in doing so have demanded a more mainstream picture for returns. I say this because all the conspiracies and intrigue that made the first film so great are now replaced with a very predictable love triangle plot. It is predictable to the point I was left bored during the majority of the film. Only the scenes with Mary were engaging. Samantha Morton is superb in this but is sadly neglected with very little screen time. It was again for the mainstream that the film ignored the fact that Mary was bought up in France and would've had a French accent but maybe this would be a tad confusing for the majority so here she speaks in broad scots. Sir Walter Raleigh is all that is wrong in this film. Looking perfect throughout to the point of camp he is the focus of this film. The worst moment being during the Armada battle sequence where he single handedly steers a fire ship in a Spainish ship hanging from the bow in a scene not dissimilar from Leo in 'Titanic'. It is so clichÃ©d people were laughing. Elizabeth is too pretty in the film. Apparently Cate refused to shave her hairline which would've made her look more in period which is disappointing considering Samantha went for it. the severe look achieved at the end of the first is forgotten about. She was tough, divine and now she is portrayed like a giggling schoolgirl who can't get laid. <br/><br/>I feel disappointed films are becoming increasingly controlled by accountants rather than creatives. This film is a prime example of this."
"Dan1863Sickles","8","8","14","18 October 2007"," I Laughed -- I Cried -- I Cheered For Blanco The Wonder Horse!!!
","Magnificent, lavish, stunning -- all these words apply. They apply to Cate Blanchett's looks, her talent, her sheer overwhelming allure as Elizabeth, the Golden Queen of England's Golden Age. Unfortunately, the movie itself does not quite live up to the limitless beauty, artistry and sheer animal fascination of Cate the Great.<br/><br/>Elizabeth was always decisive, dramatic, and intelligent, but this movie wanders in a daze from dark, dank, chilly looking rooms where nasty people mumble about plots and murder, to lavish and almost comically inappropriate love scenes, to huge phony looking vistas of stormy seas and galloping horses, and then back to more torture, more mumbling, and more incoherent emotional fireworks.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett, not yet forty, is so stunning in every frame it seems laughable to see her grapple with Elizabeth's fear of old age and decay. Clive Owen is actually pretty good as Sir Walter Raleigh, a stud who knows he's got what it takes and sort of lazily enjoys himself, in a laid back, Nicolas Cage sort of way. And newcomer Abbie Cornish is, to put it mildly, yummy. Picture Kate Winslet only sexier!!! As long as it's just heated whispers between these three, the movie manages well enough. It's sort of a dry-humping menage with fabulous costumes and endless closeups of the architecture. You'll cry when you see how much the lush and beautiful Elizabeth longs for one last night of pleasure, only to see her innocent (but ripe and desirable) young lady in waiting steal away the rugged man of her dreams. But after an hour you start to wonder, is this ALL we're going to see?<br/><br/>Cut away to Samantha Morton, stranded in a bleak castle and forced to play the alluring, sensual, and irresistible Mary Queen of Scots as some sort of gibbering lunatic. With an accent somewhere between Braveheart and Trainspotting. I kept waiting for her to say, ""hoot, mon! Ye canna be killin' the likes of me!"" The real Mary spoke French, by the way. She was funnier, prettier, had nicer manners, and washed more often.<br/><br/>But in this movie, Mary is not helpless and sweet, she's crazy and evil. I mean, eeeevil!! Once she turns loose her flying monkeys -- sorry, I meant her fanatical assassins -- you'll thrill to the most electrifying intrigue ever filmed. Or not. Actually, the assassination in the church scores big points as comedy, as the trembling teenage assassin apparently falls into some sort of hypnotic trance the moment he catches his first glimpse of Cate Blanchett's ghostly white face. Just what is supposed to be happening here? Was Elizabeth a psychic who could hypnotize her enemies and turn weak-minded boys into sex slaves? I kept waiting for her to say, ""you are getting sleepy . . . sleepy . . . no, not the audience, just you with the pistol!"" This scene felt like it went on for three hours and when it was over I still couldn't figure out why the young man didn't pull the trigger. Then a few scenes later Walsingham mumbles that it ""wasn't loaded."" Well, that clears things right up for me. Thanks! Not to interrupt, but Nicholson and Hirst, the two screenwriters for this thing, must have been doing a pretty heavy drug regimen to keep their minds limber, just like Jeff Lebowski in THE BIG LEBOWSKI.<br/><br/>But the problems don't stop with a script clearly written by stoned or drunk men. When the big battle scenes come at the end, Shekha Khapur demonstrates clearly that he is absolutely tone-deaf to the visual music of film. He can't manage to put together more than two minutes of real action footage, without cutting away to the most laughable and inexplicable junk ever filmed.You'll thrill to the heroism of Sir Walter Raleigh, diving from his blazing fire ship and ""aiming to find bottom"" just like Huckleberry Finn after a steamboat crash. Then you'll giggle like a madman at the sight of Elizabeth wandering through her empty tent with a dazed look on her face, like the heroine of a romance novel waiting for a hot date. (Where were the dozens of soldiers, nobles, and aides?) You'll cheer for Blanco The Wonder Horse -- a white stallion who, for no reason at all, is shown diving from a sinking galleon and swimming to safety. What does it say about a movie when an uncredited animal who contributes nothing to the plot steals the climax of the picture? Then you'll giggle like a madman again as we cut to meaningless shots of lightning, praying monks, and a twitching Philip of Spain realizing he's made a terrible mistake. I guess that lightning really got to him.<br/><br/>Finally, the whole Armada sequence finishes up with jaw-dropping non sequiturs, as Elizabeth, for no apparent reason, sheds her armor and wanders out into the night in her lovely nightie, to stand on the shore alone and take deep breaths and close her eyes in orgiastic pleasure at the sight of hundreds of burning Spanish galleons in the distance. Right, it makes perfect sense. Frankly, I was waiting for Blanco The Wonder Horse to swim ashore and make love to her all night long.<br/><br/>The real problem with this film is that it pays lip-service to the idea of a liberated, strong, assertive Elizabeth, but the only language the director speaks fluently is that of Gothic romance. So even when Elizabeth is celebrating her greatest victory, she has to be shown in a super-feminine posture. She's alone, in a sexy white bed gown, on a windswept cliff, looking as if she's a nubile young maiden aching with desire for Blanco The Wonder Horse.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett deserves better than this. Elizabeth deserves better than this. Even Blanco The Wonder Horse deserves better than this!"

","I lover the first one, but this one is not great. No chemistry whatsoever between Blanchett and Owen, a mediocre supporting cast, not enough Geoffrey Rush, too many choppy edits and actions scenes that look like Pirates of the Caribbean. Cate Blanchett was in character, but everyone else seemed to be phoning it in. The younger woman was dull, not worth betraying a queen. The Spaniards were cardboard caricatures, and they didn't speak in the proper Spanish for the period, instead they spoke like modern Spaniards. I mean, after Braveheart, you really have to step up to the plate with that sort of thing. It's like having George Washington speak like George Bush, not cool. I felt the director was either lazy, hung-over or he had the film taken away and someone else edited it? We were shocked it was the same director from the first film. In any case, I know making movies isn't easy, but I didn't go to school for it like these folks did so you'd think they'd do better. I'm not sure why things went wrong, but things went very wrong and at the end I wanted my money back ~~ and I got in for free!"
"Spookwhiskey","4","7","12","19 November 2007"," Overblown and Underdeveloped
","When it was first announced that Shekhar Kapur was to direct a sequel to his 1998 film Elizabeth, my first reaction was 'Why?' The original was such a solid film  good story, well told, well made and excellently performed  that I saw little point in checking back in after nine years had passed. Then the trailer was released. My hopes were significantly raised; the film looked stunning. If Kapur could manage to balance the deft character drama of Elizabeth with the kind of lush and epic period visuals on display in the trailer, we'd be in for a treat.<br/><br/>Sadly, Kapur manages to achieve only the latter. Despite another brilliant turn from Cate Blanchett, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a film that keeps its audience at arms' length, a historical political pantomime that all-but defines 'style over substance.' The film concerns The Virgin Queen's growing attraction to a dashing newcomer, Clive Owen's Sir Walter Raleigh, during a time of political unrest. Thrown into the mix is a subplot concerning the fate of the scheming Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton, criminally underused), Elizabeth's feeling the pressure of living so visibly to the public eye, Holy War with Spain and their nasty Inquisition, and a horse that jumps off a boat.<br/><br/>There's obviously an excellent story to be told with this material, but it's as if the film realizes half an hour in that it's bitten off more than it can chew and resolves to lay on the eye-candy hard and thick in an effort to distract us from just how convoluted its script is. Witness Rhys Ifans disappear into the mess after being set-up, along with Morton, as the film's sinister nogoodnik, only to leave absolutely no impression as the character goes nowhere. Abbie Cornish and Clive Owen fair slightly better, but only just, as their characters at least have the appearance of a narrative through line, but even they, two quite fine actors in their own right, find themselves merely ticking off plot points in an effort to push what story there is ever-forward and come off undercooked and oversimplified. But it's poor Geoffrey Rush who's drawn the short straw this time round. His Walsingham was such a key player in the original film; here he's basically an expositional mouthpiece who's thrown the sole dramatic bone of a small subplot involving the return of his Papist brother.<br/><br/>Blanchett is the real draw here, proving yet again why she's considered amongst the finest of her generation. Even as the film dissolves into a second half comprising a stretch of scattershot and impressionistic scenes that confuse rather than excite, Blanchett remains firmly on form, throwing into sharp relief just how much of a mess the film surrounding her becomes. In fact, once the midway point is reached, the film seems to do away with any notion of developing plot or character and comes off more as an extended trailer; glossy, gorgeous, the score all driving drums and soaring choirs, but absolutely nothing resonates. Here is a film that takes its most striking image  an armored, pale and auburn-haired Elizabeth astride a gallant white steed  and squanders it completely on a throwaway scene that's wholly robbed of any weight or power due to the lack of effort in developing what's come before. Elizabeth's rousing horseback speech to her troops before descending into battle should be stirring, the dramatic apex of the film where breaths are held and heartstrings tugged. Instead, it becomes another great-looking blink-and-you'll-miss-it flash that's all tell and no show, a final snatch at dramatic worth that rings hollow despite being delivered with genuine conviction on Blanchett's behalf.<br/><br/>Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a technically marvelous film that remains unsatisfying on almost every other level. The fire in the heart of Blanchett's Queen still burns bright; it's a pity the performance is done such a disservice by the film itself."

Clive Owen sounded like he was reading everything off a script for the first time, and the rest of the cast were boring and uninteresting. Not only did the movie fail at being even slightly entertaining, it was very historically inaccurate as well. Yes, I know that it's ""just a movie"", but it's no excuse for such a inaccurate script.

Yet does that stop anyone, ANYONE, from seizing the opportunity to defame Catholics and the Catholic Church? Where are the cries of the ACLU then? Why don't celebrities and talk-show hosts take a moment to speak about the damaging, hurtful injustices and prejudices when the Catholics are attacked?

But don't take my word for it. I now quote a film critic who has put to words the ineptitude and injustice of this latest bit of hacker's work. Steven D. Greydanus writes: <br/><br/>""A lurid sort of Christopher Hitchens vision of history pervades Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Shekhar Kapur's sequel to his 1998 art-house hit Elizabeth.<br/><br/>The earlier film, which made a star of Cate Blanchett as the eponymous Virgin Queen, celebrated the triumph of bright, happy Elizabethan Protestantism over the dark, unwholesome Catholic world of Bloody Mary. Even so, that film's church-bashing was tame compared to that of this sequel, in which everything bad, evil and corrupt in the world is ultimately the bitter fruit of Religion. And by Religion, I mean Catholicism. <br/><br/>""I will not punish my people for their beliefs  only for their deeds,"" says Elizabeth, conveniently forgetting that in the last movie she rammed the Act of Uniformity through Parliament, outlawing the Catholic Mass and imposing compulsory attendance at Anglican services. In this version of history, the hosts of Catholics martyred under Elizabeth are all traitors and conspirators. ""Every Catholic in England is a potential assassin,"" Elizabeth's advisers helpfully remind her in an early scene. Well, then, every Catholic in England is a potential political prisoner too.""<br/><br/>One day, maybe justice truly will be had for all. Until then, we Catholics must persevere as well as we are able in such a hateful, bigoted, hypocritical mess we call America."

Elizabeth I was a firecracker, a phoenix, combustible and perfectly capable of scaring the ever-loving out of her courtiers and councilors.<br/><br/>This movie tries to make things interesting by imagining an ersatz ""romance"" between the queen and Sir Walter Raliegh, but it cannot take the place of the ongoing drama that was the real Elizabeth.

"Monotreme02","6","3","4","23 December 2007"," Disappointingly daft and clichéd but features a rich, fascinating performance from Blanchett
","""The Virgin Queen"", Queen Elizabeth I, arguably the greatest monarchial leader England has ever seen, has received the royal treatment when it comes to the cinema. She has been played by an abundantly wide plethora of actresses, both old and young, and has garnered more than a few awards and nominations for those actresses. Arguably the greatest incarnation of the queen, though, and also probably the best film about the monarch, is 1998's Elizabeth, which was unfairly overshadowed by the vastly inferior and overrated Shakespeare in Love due to both films being set in the same time period and featuring a virtually identical cast of actors. But while Shakespeare in Love was light, fluffy, and almost irritatingly cutesy, Elizabeth was a far darker, grander, broodier incarnation of 16th century England, and featured a performance that should have gotten Cate Blanchett her first Academy Award were it not for Miramax's relentless promotion of Shakespeare In Love and the eventual (and undeserved) victory Gwyneth Paltrow of that very film scored in the category. With The Golden Age, the cast and crew were given a rare chance: A chance to re-tread the brilliant ground without the pressures of an all-too-similar parallel film. And unfortunately, for the most part, they missed that chance.<br/><br/>While the first Elizabeth film served as a wondrous combination between dramatization of a fascinating period in England's history, deliciously lavish production design, and an intense, amazingly dedicated character study on Cate Blanchett's part as she dubiously explores every possible nook and cranny of the mysterious Virgin Queen. The sequel gains much by retaining high quality in the latter two categories, but suffers miserably from severe drawbacks in the first and arguably most important category.<br/><br/>The film easily confuses epic and heroics with clichés, and is weighed down by an overwrought script not much above cheap daytime television melodrama in terms of the plot events. All would be forgiven had these elements been even remotely rooted in historical fact, but in reality the filmmakers took uncanny liberties and unabashedly replaced historical fact with melodramatic romance and epic fantasy action. Is she with child without royal consent? Would Sir Walter Raleigh have ever possibly swing heroically from ropes off of burning ships, dramatically brandishing his sword? Did Queen Elizabeth really ride horseback out to give her army a pep talk, even though we don't even see any of these soldiers in action when the day is done? Does it even matter than in 1585, when the film is set, Elizabeth was over 50 while Raleigh was barely 30, thus rendering their imaginary romance conceived especially for this film quite unrealistic? Indeed probably the biggest drawback to the film's replacing fact with melodramatic fantasy-fiction is that in most of the cases, it is totally unnecessary and barely felt. The film shifts gear from lavish costume drama to epic sea battle action for probably no more than five minutes before hastily returning to form. The Armada battle is over so quickly one barely even has time to notice Raleigh's exaggerated swashbuckling heroics.<br/><br/>That said, the film does have two slightly more successful fields, first and foremost its lavish look. Costume dramas traditionally exceed in the production, set and costume design fields, but the costumes Queen Elizabeth wears alone are sure to win awards. Such meticulous detail is put into designing every last frill and tapestry, that the film is undeniably a true work of design mastery, much like the first film. The cinematography is also more than complementary of the look and direction the film obviously was aiming at, drenching almost every scene with very dim but harsh glows, leaving many blacks and shadows, perhaps in order to emulate Elizabeth's state of mind. The country is prospering, but the Queen is forever torn inside.<br/><br/>And indeed the film more than excels in that final category, regarding the character study of Queen Elizabeth. And for that I give most of the credit to Miss Blanchett. It's impossible to deny it: Cate Blanchett is indisputably one of today's very best and most prominent leading actresses, and in recent years in particular she has more than excelled in delivering fascinatingly multi-layered and expertly acted roles in every genre possible. Blanchett is no stranger to playing real-life people: Aside from already playing Queen Elizabeth I in the 1998 film, she has also channeled Veronica Guerin, Katharine Hepburn, and Bob Dylan. But with Queen Elizabeth, Blanchett gets to do something very special: Since the character comes from a time before the media era, there is essentially nothing for Blanchett to imitate and to base her performance on. Thus, she is forced to (and succeeds admirably in) finding the character within Queen Elizabeth on her own. She plays her with a wonderfully entertaining combination of authoritarian matriarch and playful, mischievous teenager. Cate delivers a truly powerhouse performance in the film, and her performance is easily the best aspect of it. Just watch how broken she is as she mourns the treachery of her own sister, Mary Queen of Scots, expertly played by Samantha Morton and also the only of the film's plot points that was actually remotely interesting to watch unfold.<br/><br/>I was greatly looking forward to this film; the historical costume drama is a consistently reliable genre, and the concept of the combination of epic swashbuckling action-adventure with the dramatic depiction of Elizabeth's reign, as well as the notion of Blanchett returning to arguably her greatest film role, got me perhaps a little over-excited for this release, which made the poor reviews and subsequent box office performance even more disappointing than I would have expected. The film indeed suffered from some inconsolable plot weaknesses, but does feature exquisitely lavish production design and an expertly poignant, rounded and fantastically intense performance from the always great Cate Blanchett, and that's enough to make it even somewhat worth a look."
"Redcitykev","8","3","4","27 November 2007"," Very enjoyable, but where was Drake?
","I am no scholar of the Elizabethan era, so I can not comment on the historical accuracy of this enjoyable costume drama, but I am sure that the figure of Sir Francis Drake played a larger part in the decisive battle against the Spanish Armarda than appeared to be the case here. The only sight you have of him is on board ship, and then you only realise it is him when Sir Walter Raleigh mentions his name! I know that was not the main emotional point of the film, and I do appreciate that Raleigh and Elizabeth had a very close, intense relationship, but surely one of England's most crucial sea victories should at least feature with one of its major players having a larger role.<br/><br/>Now I've got that off my chest, on with the review. The film is splendidly mounted, and looks great - it was a pity that the print that my local had was very scratched in places. The acting is, as one would expect from such a prestigious production, uniformly excellent, with Blanchett again showing amazing emotional range. Geoffery Rush is also very good, and Clive Owen has great presence as Raleigh.<br/><br/>The fact that the film concentrates mainly on the relationships between the main characters allows us to see Elizabeth as a human being with all the faults and passions that brings with it, rather than someone above the humanity around her. Having said that there was a couple of times when the lighting was used to make her look like a Saint, notably when she 'survives' the assassin attempt on her.<br/><br/>The politics of the era were, naturally, somewhat simplified - I am sure the politics of the time were as complicated and complex as ours today - but this did not matter, and served to increase the dramatic tensions on the screen.<br/><br/>Whether or not this is as good as the first film starring Ms Blanchett in the role I can not say as it seems a life time ago I saw that film, but in its own right it is well worth the admission fee, even if it is not entirely historically accurate."
"csrothwec","6","3","4","4 November 2007"," Biggest cinema disappointment so far this year
","Cate Blanchett's acting in the central role is as spectacular as in the first film, but she, (and everyone else involved), is totally let down by the writers of the script. The whole film plods along as, in popular history, the Spanish galleons allegedly did in the Armada of 1588 itself; top-heavy, over-manned and extremely sluggish in covering the ocean. Recent naval historians have revised such views and, while the film contains numerous other pieces of historical tosh, (Sir Francis Drake and Raleigh virtually sharing the command of the English fleet against the Armada??? I don't think so!), this was also abundantly true of the original film, ""Elizabeth"". The crucial difference, though, was that the original film had pace, humour, terrific insight into the nature of power and, simply, thrills, which made one more than ready to suspend disbelief and be swept along by the action as it unfolded. Although the latter film looks very good, (the costume department having done an especially fine job and the photography being on a par overall with the first film as well), there is just not the pace or human interest in it to sustain the attention of the audience over nearly two hours, (as testified to by the fact that this was the first film in 2007 which I had seen in a cinema in which more than one party walked out before the end!) As I say, a terrific disappointment, leaving one wishing the writers, (considering all of the assets they had their disposal, not least the massive talents of Ms. Blanchett), could meet the fate of those unfortunates who come under Walsingham's power in both films! The protracted scene in the original ""Elizabeth"" where the plotters against her throne are arrested or otherwise dealt with to a background of achingly beautiful choral music was said to have been inspired by a similar scene in ""The Godfather"". Seeing ""Elizabeth - the Golden Age"" reminds one how ""The Godfather"" was also very rare indeed in having a sequel which at least matched the original film. If a third ""Elizabeth"" is planned for future years, (the Essex rebellion and Elizabeth's final years?), the producers will need to consider very carefully what went wrong this time and not repeat it."

","With 'Elizabeth: The Golden Ages' Shekhar Kapur returns to continuing the story of one of the most fascinating and enigmatic queens in history. His 1998 movie 'Elizabeth' gave us a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth I's introduction to the throne. This time he explores a different side of her, that of a respected accomplished queen who possibly desires love and a future with a family while at the same time she has to battle Spain to rescue England <br/><br/>It is good to see Kapur back to the director's seat after a long time. However, this time his direction is inconsistent. His take on the film is very partial (Philip being portrayed as completely evil and stupid). The film starts off as a period drama but the end sequences take a very opera-like form. One should not rely on it for historical accuracy. Parts of the movie look rushed, especially the love triangle of Owen, Blanchett and Cornish. I wonder why Kapur chose to give this film a different colour tone (green-tinted). This was not the case in the first movie which used a rather preferable sepia tone. The score, though beautiful and mesmerizing, is overused in plenty of sequences. The visuals are dazzling and the cinematography is remarkable and the makeup and costumes are excellent.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is back in the title role. Needless to say that she breathes fire into the role that, as was also evident in the first movie, is meant for her to play. Geoffrey Rush too reprises his role and does no less of a brilliant job with the little that he was given. Samantha Morton is first rate. Rhys Ifans springs a surprise. Abbie Cornish is very good. Clive Owen is clearly overshadowed by his castmates but he works the charm well.<br/><br/>'Elizabeth: The Golden Ages' could have been a more effective film had its presentation been more consistent. Although it does not meet the standards of the first film, it is a strong movie that is intriguing to watch and visually pleasing."

I saw this film on DVD- and when Ms Morton's scene was played I had to repeat it. It is incredible acting all 60 seconds of it. Just watch her wonderfully subtle facial expressions as she becomes aware of the inevitable consequences of her actions. Now that's about the only thing that I was moved by in this film. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush always deliver great performances, but this was not the stage for their talents. The history was often wrong, the settings were too lavish and the writing was paper thin. I enjoyed the first installment enormously, but I was almost enormously disappointed by this film."

I guess anything to get most women crying over a love story! The bad guy/good queen thing was overplayed and it was funny to see the King of Spain walking in abbeys in small steps as if he's just be castrated was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Finally, one could see the addition of the role the Ottoman navy played in distracting the Spanish but I guess then we couldn't see the little hysterical queen going insane about her manlessness.<br/><br/>All said, very nicely shot and Cate Blanchett does a good job.

","After the superb earlier Elizabeth movie starring Cate Blanchett I sat down to watch this expecting more of the same. Instead I saw Margaret Thatcher & Errol Flynn take on the dark lord Sauron as scripted by the Comic Strip.<br/><br/>I should have known from the opening scenes which depicted Fotheringay Castle as set in a lake and surrounded by mountains. The Northamptonshire Alps perchance? The 52-year-old Elizabeth (the film opens in 1585) is still busy looking for a husband and issuing public statements about her fertility. Enter Clive Owen as Errol Flynn as Raleigh (with a bit of Drake, Essex & Leicester grafted on so as to avoid confusing the viewer with more than one leading man). There's one ludicrous piece of outright Flynnery when Raleigh single-handedly sets fire to the Spanish Armada. Blanchett sounds like a strident renaissance Thatcher. Samantha Morton gives Mary, Queen of Scots a twee Scottish accent which it is highly unlikely the real Mary ever possessed, having been taken to France as a small child and subsequently spent less than eight years in Scotland. Philip II is shown as the evil mastermind, plotting- mostly in shadow - the downfall of Elizabeth.<br/><br/>After interminable scenes of dancing and Thatcher/Flynn flirting Mary is executed having been caught bang to rights up to her soon-to-have-the-head-separated-from-it-neck in plotting to kill Thatcher. None of the genuine historical ambivalence about her 'guilt' is displayed. I half expected Tom Hollander - her jailer - to shout 'you're nicked, chummy'.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Blanchett/Elizabeth/Thatcher morphs into Boadicea/Joan of Arc, dressed in full body armour and with her hair having grown three feet in a day and addresses her troops. The famous line about being a 'weak and feeble woman' is excised from the script, probably for fear of offending somebody. Drake gets a brief mention during the sea battle (which, conveniently, can be seen clearly from the shore by the Queen) but otherwise is non-existent.<br/><br/>Enough. I've wasted enough of my life watching this drivel without taking up more time writing about it. It really is as bad as Braveheart. I hope I haven't given anyone any ideas saying that. ""When Wallace met Lizzie"" may yet be made."
"petep","7","6","12","13 October 2007"," Solid but not as good as the first
","I'm thinking that quite a few liberties were taken with this film. It's Hollywood though, so what do you expect? Cate Blanchett ends up the best looking 52 year old queen ever portrayed on the big screen. I didn't realize this until the end though, so as with all the other historical details, I remained blissfully ignorant coming into the theater. Though I had just recently seen Elizabeth, and enjoyed it, and I've been known to go see just about any sequel. No regrets here, but it wasn't as good as the first and won't be considered for even 10% as many top 10 lists.<br/><br/>This film merely jumps to a later part of the queen's life and focuses on her relationship with adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the looming threat of the Spanish Armada. There is of course the unending issue of religion and threats of assassination to make the queen's cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), into God's chosen queen. Elizabeth still benefits from the wisdom of close adviser Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush, the only other notable returning character from the first film besides the queen). The size of the Spanish army does not intimidate the queen, and she will not back down from any challenge. She is getting rather tired of the search for a man though. When an appealing fellow like Clive Owen announces he's named a newly discovered colony Virginia in your honor, well, that's kind of rubbing it in your face, isn't it? The production design in a movie like this has no choice but to be good, to both eclipse the original and give this movie its own buzz. No disappointments there. I also liked the story, but most of the performances were by the book. You know what to expect from an historical tale such as this. The only standout performance is from Blanchett. As a queen she is supremely confident and says whatever she wants to. The book of stock English historical characters for BBC productions and stage work doesn't include anything as entertaining as she was here. The camera work is a mixed bag. Some shots that give you the perspective of an outsider looking in are really interesting, but then you have your fair share of pointless, excessive glamour shots, mostly of the queen in bright light trying to look like a queen, maybe even looking directly into the camera. One of her holding a friend's baby comes to mind."

","I have fond memories of 'Elizabeth' staring Cate Blanchett and I had seen an interview of her on TV where she spoke of wanting to bring something new to the role. I had high expectations when I entered the local movie palace from the 1920s, which the film failed to meet.<br/><br/>My only reaction to Geoffrey Rush was to think that I had seen him to it better before and that he was old and tired in the role.<br/><br/>Clive Owen brought too little to his role and left me with more questions that answers about Raleigh.<br/><br/>Jordi Mollà was opaque as King Philip II of Spain.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett added nothing to our understanding of Elizabeth I that we hadn't learned from 'Elizabeth' and HBO's excellent 'Elizabeth I'. She was so mysterious as Galadriel in 'Lord of the Rings' and so ordinary as Elizabeth. She should have waited ten more years to return to the role or studied with Helen Mirren.<br/><br/>The film's attention to detail provided the highlights.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Not in the class of 1998's first segment, Cate Blanchett is still a wonder as the virgin Queen. Here she displays much more vulnerability and emotion than in the first, but her weaknesses are a bit too heavy handed. Director Shekhar Kapur is back at the helm, though for some reason he has only made one other film (Four Feathers) since the 1998 Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Clive Owen plays swashbuckling Sir Walter Raleigh who charms his way into the Queen's inner circle and more than charms Abbie Cornish (A Good Year), the Queen's personal favorite of her court. Owen adds a bit a cartoonish feel to the film and is definitely shown to be the hero of the holy war. Geoffrey Rush is back as Elizabeth's adviser and he is given a sub-plot with his brother so that he doesn't spend the entire two hours just bowing to Blanchett. The whole Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) story is presented very awkwardly, but the beheading was actually beautifully filmed. Adding to the cartoonish feel was the manner in which Jordi Molla portrays King Philip II of Spain ... very odd.<br/><br/>This one manages to cling to epic status through amazing sets, incredibly wonderful wardrobe and a terrific score. Even though it isn't the masterpiece of the first segment, it is still worth seeing and will be involved in Oscar talk."

","For viewers who have not seen this film and you do not mind remakes of historical figures, this is one to watch with Cate Blanchet returning to play Queen Elizabeth, this film shows the time after her claim to the throne and how one woman conquered the Spanish empire.<br/><br/>If you have watched the first, in the end of the film when she cuts all her hair off and makes herself entirely hideous to 'Marry England' it continues as if she regretted doing that in 'The Golden Age'as she so obviously feels unattractive and like she has lost her youth and when the charming Sir Walter Rileigh appears problems occur and the plot takes a rather bland path.<br/><br/>It strangely takes the form of a ill-fated romantic movie, which can be quite irritating when you much rather grab a few dollars and head down the video store where you sure would find a few.<br/><br/>I suppose it was added to make the film more interesting but really i find it a distraction to the importance of it. The final scene is powerful and seems to steer the film back on the right track.<br/><br/>Cate seems to have a real connection now to Elizabeth's character and fits perfectly into the oversised wigs and elaborate dresses to elevate the film's success with her superior acting talent.<br/><br/>Although previous comments have critisied the making of Elizabeth to be clichéd' and predictable, it basically is the closest you will find to a non-soapy Hollywood remake of one of the worlds most famous rulers: Elizabeth."

","First of all, let me say that I, like many others, walked into this thinking there was no way that it could be anything but brilliant. I gave an enormous cheer when I heard a sequel was planned; fantastic cast, fascinating director, good storyline, and a sure hit. I knew that it wouldn't be historically accurate as the first wasn't, but I see this as a FILM not a documentary, and do not worry too much about that.<br/><br/>However I, like countless others, ended up slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>If you could separate various aspects of the film, individually they would succeed. The score is almost deserving of a modern classic concert; it is sumptuous when on its own, but it tended to be incredibly over dramatic at many of the wrong moments, and drowned out some potentially fantastic speeches (eg when Elizabeth screams at the retreating Spanish Embassy). It also ruined several moments (such as Elizabeth's silent walk on the hill, looking out over the Armada) which were beautiful enough without it.<br/><br/>The writing wasn't brilliant; it covered too little in too long a time. Granted, they would have spoken in the way they did in the film, but there were many unnecessary moments that weren't entirely relevant to the plot. The result was simply too long.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of the casting and acting was brilliant. Cate Blanchett, of course, excelled once again as Elizabeth. In all rights she deserves an Academy Award Nomination at the very least. Abbie Cornish, Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush were also very good; Samantha Morton was fantastic, even though her part was underwritten. My only casting misgiving was Jordi Molla as Philip of Spain. It was clear from his very walk and manner that he is an actor best suited to comedy (see Bad Boys II), and I think he totally ruined the part. His scenes became slightly tedious as a result, and this broke into the backbone of the plot. A more serious and refined Spanish actor would have been better IMO; Molla is good in other things.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good, and interesting. I loved the water scenes, and was amused by the horse in the water sequences; the final scene was visually fascinating, as the camera wheeled round the glorified Elizabeth, but I HATED the moment when she looked into the camera; that broke the reality barrier in the last few seconds in the film, and made me feel... for want of a better word: miffed.<br/><br/>Anyway, whilst a little disappointed, it was quite interesting. I shall buy the DVD and watch it again, and see if my mind has changed!"

","Great cast, good photography, but the film depicts the English as all good and the Spanish as evil religious zealots, a caricature of history. The Spanish Armada was decimated by a storm, and not by Sir Walter Raleigh's ingenuity. He played a minor role, if any, in the whole battle."
"ElMaruecan82","6","1","1","12 June 2017"," Elizabeth in Love...
","In my review of the 1998 ""Elizabeth"", I said that it was more than your average costume drama since it had more to offer than the  well, costumes to begin with, and the usual antechamber plots, dizzying castle shots and climactic outbursts of blood. It wasn't the most original comment but I'm even more partial to it after watching the sequel of nine years later.<br/><br/>Shekhar Kapur's first film was about the rise to power and the tactically efficient ascension of a courageous woman who stood tall against the Catholic establishment at a time it was still having a wide influence over British citizens. She defeated the odds by becoming the second Protestant sovereign of Britain, a captivating conquest from a heroine who, by cinematic standards, was an 'underdog'. Her climactic purge was a Machiavellian masterstroke often compared to the Baptism Massacre of ""The Godfather"", not the most unflattering comparison.<br/><br/>In ""The Golden Age"", we meet Elizabeth again and she's not an underdog anymore, if she was Rocky, it would be the third: she's the Queen, as majestic and imperial as ever, but a bit too comfortable and accessible given her regal aura. I didn't mind it at the beginning and thought it fit the film's subtitle. But at the end, I wasn't sure I would give it the same compliment than the first film. It is entertaining and there's not a single bad performance, but there's a spice lacking somewhere. Like instead of dealing with the 'uneasy the head where lies the crown' trope, the focus was located this time a bit lower than the head, and maybe, just like Balboa, Elizabeth got too ""civilized"" for her own good.<br/><br/>The Queen is in a zone of comfort indeed, smiling, laughing, throwing a few winks to Bess, her first lady-in-waiting (played by the distractingly beautiful Abbie Cornich), making naughty jokes about her virgin status despite the zealous and formal insistence of Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to get her a husband. These parts tie the first act together and the sunny scenery, not to mention the magnificent art settings, make the whole thing a real visual delight. The problem is that these frivolous trivialities, rather than being the quietness before the storm are in fact the machinery structuring the whole first act, which makes the entrance of Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), supposedly one of the film's highlights, more problematic.<br/><br/>Let me explain this: Owen is an extraordinarily charismatic actor, a man's man with a real presence, so instead of seeing in Raleigh the explorer who conquered a land he named Virginia in the name of you-know-who, who brought to England new resources such as potatoes, tobacco and gold, ""borrowed"" from Spanish ships and not under their contentment, we see the dashing and dark brooding adventurer who immediately catches the eye of Cate Blanchett. We see the romance instead of the history, Elizabeth's heart-troubles contextualize the movie rather than the real problem 'out there', which is the rivalry with the most powerful Catholic country of the world: Spain. I wouldn't have minded an intimate angle if it wasn't so superficial, not to mention, historically inaccurate.<br/><br/>There's even a moment where the bond is so tight between Raleigh and Elizabeth that he crosses the line of insolence without even coming close to reach Elizabeth's breaking point. This Elizabeth is so hypnotized by the achievement of Raleigh that she forgot about her greatest conquest: power, and belittled herself in a way I didn't quite expect. I guess these artistic licenses were too blatant not to be deliberate, a sort of narrative choice meant to create a bigger contrast between Elizabeth's sudden vulnerability and the dark and scheming confidence of Philip II (Jordi Molla), ominously contemplating the conquest of England. The Spanish king is convinced that he's on the right side of God's Law while Elizabeth is the prey of doubt and love-sickness.<br/><br/>It's not an uninteresting parallel between emotional fragility and unshakable faith, but the portrayal of Catholics isn't subtle and tends to reinforce that awkward feeling of something Manichean going on. I don't mind the Spanish being the antagonists, from a historical standpoint, it was true but it's all in the treatment and 'Golden Age"" is too busy trading the authenticity for a few romantic subplots that I found myself lost more than once. The film shows an Elizabeth who's contested from within and from the exterior, whose loyal Bess gets pregnant from Raleigh but even the less literate in History knows that the real deal is the big fight against the Armada and couldn't care more about Elizabeth's self-esteem and existential issues.<br/><br/>Yet the screenplay didn't establish solid hierarchies between the subplots. Everything is handled as if it was the same matter of life and death, to the point that we never really identify the moment where she Elizabeth overcame her demons, which basically means the whole second act. We have to accept that 'what didn't kill her made her stronger' to get ready for the big finale. It is ironic that in all this castle soap-opera, the most interesting character's arc is Marie Stuart (Samantha Morton) whose story-line is handled in better clarity and concludes in perhaps the most beautiful and memorable scene.<br/><br/>I was baffled to read that the film took liberties with history, while it had the perfect material: the Spanish Enterprise, the assassination attempts, the execution of Marie and of course the Armada whose climactic fight was too spectacular to elevate the film above conventionality, not that I believe Kapur tried to be unconventional. He was too busy making this visual ride that he forgot to stay focused on the few elements that made Elizabeth such an unconventional heroine.<br/><br/>It's like Kapur was so carried away by the loss to ""Shakespeare in Love"" that he wanted his 'romantic' Best Picture contender. The film was ""only"" nominated for Best Actress and Costumes, not such a good idea, after all."
"Better_Sith_Than_Sorry","6","1","1","3 June 2017"," 20% Fact, 80% Fiction
","OK I admit the 20%/80% is a rough estimate....but wow, this film really, really plays fast and loose with the facts. I mean, really. I enjoyed the first film (""Elizabeth"" (1998), for which I gave 8/10), and that one also took liberties with the truth...but this one goes a little too far in my opinion.<br/><br/>I will focus on the numerous inaccuracies presented for just one character, Walter Raleigh, to illustrate the point. He is shown describing sea voyages to the new world to an enraptured Elizabeth (wrong - he never went to North America at all and only sailed to South America 10 years after the events in the film). He is shown having a potential romantic relationship with Elizabeth (there is no evidence for this). He is shown taking part in the battle against the Spanish Armada, igniting a 'fire ship,' when in fact he was on land at this time and played no active role in the fight. He is shown being named Captain of the Royal Guard prior to that battle when in fact that did not happen until four years later. And while it is true he impregnated one of the ladies of the court, and was imprisoned by Elizabeth for it, again these events happened several later than when they are presented in the film. This matters because it affects the 'why' - in the film, Raleigh is released from prison so that he can help defend England against the Spanish Armada - but of course in reality, that battle had happened years before, and when it did happen, he wasn't in it.<br/><br/>And sadly, it doesn't end there. The craziness with this tortured history ranges from extremely minor points like portraying Elizabeth speaking German (she didn't) or Isabella of Spain as a child when in fact she was 19-22 years old for the periods shown in the film (why she is shown as a child I have no idea, it did not seem to contain any relevance whatsoever) to serious fabrications or omissions, such as showing King Phillip of Spain wanting to invade England solely or mainly because it was Protestant. Yes some mention is made of English piracy on the open seas, but the crucifix-clutching Phillip is clearly shown to be desirous of deposing Elizabeth for her 'heretic' leanings and nothing more. The fact that the historical Elizabeth in 1585 sent English troops to the Netherlands in an effort to frustrate Spanish plans of domination there is never mentioned, and of course English actions such as these contributed greatly to Spain's eventual decision to send the Armada. But to watch this film, we are led to believe that Elizabeth is happily hanging out in England, minding her own business, when the big bad wolf (i.e., Spain) decides it wants to be a bully and punish England for embracing Protestantism. Yeah, it's not that simple ~ <br/><br/>Even more laughable in this film was Elizabeth's reasoning for why England could not fall to Spain. What was it? She refers to the Spanish Inquisition! She states that she cannot allow Spain to take over and impose the Inquisition on her people, that they have the right to follow their own consciences, etc. As if that is the FIRST thing you care about. Not that your country would be invaded, or that you'd lose the war, or that England itself would be wiped off that map - no. Your concern is not any of that, your concern is a fear of the Spanish Inquisition? Is this a joke? ""I don't care about my country (or my kingdom), it's that freedom of conscience thing that really gets me..."" This is revisionist at its worst.<br/><br/>The film itself looks beautiful. The sets, costumes, locations are top-notch. That part of the film gets a 10. The music is mostly OK, although sometimes ramps up in needless intensity which could be annoying. But the truth...oh, the truth. Or lack of same. So so so far removed from reality it's egregious. And if you want to say it's fictional, fine. But then don't put this forward as history, giving textual preambles and postscripts about Elizabeth, because that suggests that what we are about to see, and then saw, was part of history...and of course it's not. Better to say this was Queen Elizabeth of fictional Freedonia (sorry, Groucho) and you're much better off. 6/10"

Spain is preparing to invade with its Armada, and Elizabeth is threatened by hidden dangers.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett returns to play an older Elizabeth from her amazing turn in 'Elizabeth' (1998). She has taken on the personality of the Queen. She has the presence of royalty. The story isn't as compelling as the earlier movie. It doesn't have the same intensity. It's more about the costumes and less about the drama. The Spanish Armada could have been a great counter supplying the movie with much needed action. There is far too little of it, and most of it end up being less than exciting. Cate Blanchett is still great but the movie isn't as great as the actress."
"robert-temple-1","8","1","1","11 December 2012"," Another triumph for Cate Blanchett, but the film does not entirely make it
","This is a sequel, by the same director (Shekhar Kapur), to ELIZABETH (1998), both dealing with Queen Elizabeth I of England at successive periods of her life. (The last period of her life, 1588-1603, still awaits a final sequel.) This film is not as successful as its predecessor, but the central performance by Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth is if anything even more amazing, glorious, and breath-taking this time around. The costumes by Alexandra Byrne and the wigs and hair styling are all Oscar-worthy, some of the best ever seen on screen. A great deal of trouble was taken to find locations, and as the original palaces do not survive, three cathedrals (Ely, Winchester, and Westminster) were used as palace-substitutes, along with a lot of historical mansions. (The use of the ancient coastal chapel at Rame Head, one of my favourite places in Cornwall, is not credited.) Although the use of carved stone cathedrals with unadorned walls is not accurate, for the palaces would have been hung with rich tapestries, the substitute settings do create an eerie and somewhat bleak atmosphere which adds to the film's effectiveness considerably, as if we are watching a Greek tragedy unfold. All of these things are excellent, as are the scenes with Dr. John Dee (played by David Threlfall) acting as the queen's astrologer (though his close association with Walsingham's spying activities is not referred to). But the film goes off the rails somewhat due to the miscasting of the two main male roles. Clive Owen attempts to portray Sir Walter Raleigh (whose name is mis-pronounced in the film, for it should be pronounced 'rawley'), but he is so very much a 21st century person that he just cannot pull this off at all. I am afraid he is not a particularly good historical actor, and he thinks that to be forceful on screen he needs to glare at the Queen with a touch of insolent 'man of the people' swagger. But that is all wrong, so, so wrong. The other casting failure is Geoffrey Rush as the spy chief Sir Francis Walsingham. Rush, unlike Owen, is a very fine actor who is versatile at anything, and he does his usual excellent job, but he just is not right for the part. The real Walsingham was such a sly sophisticate that Rush's gentle and avuncular under-playing of the role is a note so false that, combined with Owen's misjudgements, it throws the film right out of kilter. A number of key historical characters are eliminated as 'non-persons' and do not appear in the film at all, but such simplifications may perhaps be excused, as this is only a single film and you just can't squeeze everybody in. Mary Queen of Scots is brilliantly played by Samantha Morton, and she adds a great deal of poignancy to this film, not least in her marvellously exasperated fit of picque when she is found out as a conspirator and realizes that all of her secret notes have been intercepted by Walsingham. Although the real Mary was a psychopathic murderess who killed her own husband and others besides, Morton's performance, which gives us a tiny bit of sympathy for her, in this context will do nicely. Abbie Cornish is excellent and sensitive as Bess Throgmorton (also spelled Throckmorton). King Philip of Spain is very brilliantly portrayed by Spanish film star Jordi Molla. The film pulls no punches at all about the crazed and bloodthirsty fanaticism of the Spanish Catholics of that age, who were the 16th century equivalent of today's Taliban, lusting to kill anybody and everybody who would not bend the knee to their dogma. The entire story of the Armada is bravely told, and though Sir Francis Drake only gets a brief look-in, never mind, who wants to quibble, as it's only a movie. Early on, as the Armada threat looms, Tilbury Fort is mentioned as a barrier to its advance towards London on the Thames. Alas alack, I have read all the state correspondence about Tilbury Fort. The true situation was far more dire than is hinted. Sir Alexander Temple, hereditary commander of the Fort, and Captain John Smith on the other side of the river at Gravesend, had to fund the only significant defence of London and garrison all the men and provide all the weapons for their forts at their own expense, so broke was the Crown, and they never got their money back. (No wonder Sir Alexander's son James signed the Death warrant of Charles I half a century later, his older brother having also been killed because of another madcap royal miscalculation, the crazy Isle of Rhé Expedition.) The scenes of the Armada, aided by digital technology, are impressive, and convey the danger and conflict very well. I would say that the script was a bit weak, with lapses into modernity for some of the dialogue, and the historical vision (apart from the scenic and design elements, which are first rate) was a bit feeble, even misleading in parts. But then, most historical films about a period as remote as this are worse, so we must not be overly critical. Certainly it would be worth making ten more of these films about Elizabeth just to see Cate Blanchett continue in the part, she is so astounding and convincing. I don't know if young people ever watch films like this, as they have all been so brain-washed by their trendy teachers only to have concern for what is 'relevant to today'. But as the teaching of history in British secondary schools now only amounts to one hour per week, it would seem that films are the only hope left to prevent history disappearing down the drain altogether. Few people under 25 even seem to know who Winston Churchill was, and as for Sir Walter Raleigh, does he do coke; if not, why not?"

Basically, set in 1585, Queen Elizabeth I of England (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Gloeb nominated Cate Blanchett) is still a virgin and unmarried, she is being advised by Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to marry, or the throne will pass to her next of kin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). She is uninterested in the Archduke of Austria (Christian Brassington), who is infatuated with her, then she meets (Sir) Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) returned from the New Wold, called Virginia, bringing potatoes, tobacco, two Native Americans and gold. She is enthralled by Walter's tales of exploration, and she asks lady-in-waiting Elizabeth 'Bess' Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish) to keep an eye on him, but she begins a secret affair with him, while the Queen is advised by astrologer Dr. John Dee (David Threlfall) who predicts war. There is a plot by King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Mollà) to assassinate Elizabeth and have Mary replace her, so Anthony Babington (Eddie Redmayne) shoots her, but she survives. When she recovers and discovers Mary's involvement she has her beheaded for treason, even though Philip hadn't intended for her to become Queen. Walter asks to leave for the New World, but Elizabeth instead knights him and makes him Captain of the Royal Guard, and then she discovers along with Bess that he is the father to her child. The Queen strictly tells her off for marrying without royal consent, and banishes her from the court, while putting Walter in prison, then of course the Spanish Armada start approaching England. Elizabeth does forgive Bess and set Waleter free to help fight in battle, where she is on a horse in the full plate suit of armour, but the formation of the army is stopped by a major storm. In the end, Elizabeth is with Walsingham on his deathbed, she blesses the child of Bess and Walter, and returns to the throne as Virgin Queen of England and mother to her people. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Robert Reston, Tom Hollander as Sir Amyas Paulet and Eddie Redmayne as Thomas Babington. Blanchett is once again a dignified and charismatic Queen Elizabeth I, Owen is a dashing Raleigh, and other members of the supporting cast stand out too, certain moments definitely stand out in this film, including of course the battle scene, so it is a very worthwhile historical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up & Hair and Best Production Design. Cate Blanchett was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!"

","You could do a lot worse then this. For starters, it looks absolutely magnificent. Just take those scenes of the armada. Friggin Oilpaintings. It got a great cast and i find it relatively engaging with an ""open"" story that throws different threads at you. Its true that its flawed. Its like the director isn't really sure what part of Elizabeth or her history he wants to explore, so it comes across as a little confused. Personally i found the triangle drama rather interesting, not the love aspects of it, so much, but the parts where the Queen lives through her servant (see, the dance scene, for instance). Its most glaring flaw is probably the bad charachstions of the Spanish king and his followers , but really, its not in the forgreound, and you have seen much worse."
"edwagreen","4","1","1","25 October 2008"," Elizabeth: What's So Golden About this Royal Clinker? **
","Thoroughly boring, tedious and choppy film dealing with Queen Elizabeth. While Cate Blanchett is suited for the part, see the television version with Helen Mirren. The latter displays outstanding acting.<br/><br/>The writing here is the major problem. History is really chopped up as Mary Queen of Scots is implicated in an assassination attempt of Elizabeth, and off goes her head as a result.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush, as the queen's adviser, has the perfect role but it is squandered by a completely lack-luster performance by him. Clive Owen is appealing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but an Errol Flynn he is not.<br/><br/>The battle scenes dealing with the Spanish Armada are brief and confusing. In addition, when Blanchett dresses up in battle gear to cheer on the troops, she is a cross between Joan of Arc and Lady Godiva.<br/><br/>Off with their heads! I'm talking about the writers of this rather boring film. At least, the costumes were exquisite."
"tubby1","7","1","1","5 October 2008"," Passion on Canvas
","Any picture trying to portray the life and times of a past historical figure are always susceptible to historical flaws and inaccuracies. Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a film which I cannot judge on its historical accuracies but it is a film made with passion.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is great as Elizabeth in a time of ill-will for England, and Clive Owen a very charming Sir Walter Raleigh who has returned from the New World. The cast to be fair all perform splendidly and it cannot be criticized in this regard. Indeed, the sets, cinematography, special effects, costume designs are so lavishly displayed you forget that the film is set in the late 1500s, but this is to be adored rather than criticised.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, King Philip II of Spain and Mary Stuart are one-dimensional characters and this is a real setback for me. King Philip only seemed to communicate with profanities and religious rhetoric - an archetypal villain with not a fluttering or due effort to humanise.<br/><br/>Elizabeth: The Golden Age has much passion and this can be seen clearly in its delivery and execution. I enjoyed its colorful resonance and excellent acting and is satisfactory vieiwing."
"vip_ebriega","8","1","1","30 April 2008"," 'Elizabeth' still keeps her throne.
","My Take: Not as bold, dashing or historically accurate as the first ELIZABETH, this sequel still has stunning visuals and superb acting.<br/><br/>Stated at the end of the original ELIZABETH are the untold events not portrayed in the film. It is said that Elizabeth I ruled for 40 years, and that those years were also known as the ""Golden Age"". Untold, no longer. For now, there is ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE, a sequel to a great film that didn't warrant a sequel. Don't get me wrong, ELIZABETH was a great film. A bold, dashing and exhilarating foray into the dark and powerful reign of The Virgin Queen, but its not the kind of film that would require a sequel. It's like expecting a sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND.<br/><br/>THE GOLDEN AGE doesn't even do its homework on history. I'm no history buff, but I don't have to be to say that it's highly improbable that Sir Walter Raleigh, even with his strength, defeated the entire Spanish Armada on his own. That's a thing that happens in films like 300 that doesn't give a damn about accuracy. Putting it in a ""serious"" historical biography could only be the fault of Hollywood. Other than being inaccurate, the screenplay is often confusing and riddling. Either the script can't stay focused on a single point, or the film lacks the right direction. The films main plot concerns the attempts of Span, led by its unruly King Phillip I (Jordi Mollà), and England's own Virgin Queen (Cate Blanchett, in top form) who regrets to surrender. But the film also revolves around a love triangle between the Queen, a ravishing seafarer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and one of the queens' handmaidens (Abbie Cornish). There's also the plot to overthrow Elizabeth from her thrown by Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), who proclaims herself the heir to England's throne. Revolving too very often from one plot line after another, it just raises confusion and too many questions.<br/><br/>ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a practice in style over substance. Ah, but what style! How much can you put so much style under a single 2-hour feature. Although it has a plot and script intact, the real reason for the film's existence is that Director Shekhar Kapur, costume designer Alexandra Byrne and set production designer Guy Dyas had a field day with the costume designs and sets. The costumes are breathtakingly awesome, bursting with style and certainly puts the ""fab"" in fabrics. In fact they are so good, it gets are mind off what the people who wear them are saying. Honestly, we are too busy thinking about how Cate Blanchett wears these outfits each day of filming rather than listening to what the queen is saying. We also marvel at the wondrous sight of incredible set designs that burst with textures and tapestries. The style here is overwhelming, that they even overwhelms the plot.<br/><br/>Other than the fabulous designs, the best thing still about the film is the ravishing return of Cate Blanchett for the role that gave her the boost to stardom. Her performance here as the queen is actually tougher and more energetic. When confronted with the Spanish Ambassador, the spunky queen bellows ""I, too, can command the wind sir! I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare when you dare to try me!"". Once again, best best bits of the screenplay goes to Ms. Blanchett, who delivers them with stunning power guaranteed to make a killing at the Oscars. Supporting performances are also fine, especially from Geoffrey Rush returning as the mysterious Sir Francis Walsingham.<br/><br/>Overall, it sinks with history and confuses with screenplay, but stuns with sheer beauty, breathtaking style and great performances. It's confusing, riddled, but ravishingly entertaining. Fans of the first film will like what they see, even if it lacks the total control and boldness of its predecessor. For everyone else, its a popcorn-movie which cares less about accuracy but aims to entertain. Set aside the criticism said about this film, and enjoy it for what it is. Sure it's as accurate to history as 300 was (or is that inaccurate), but its fancy and fancifully entertaining.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"beregic","8","1","1","17 April 2008"," at least a visual pleasure for everyone.
","i would give the feature a solid 10 for direction,costumes and especially ACTING.however the historical perspective obliges me to take off a couple of points for reasons bellow.overall i recommend this to both ""epochal""( this feature has awesome costumes and overall little details, well done visual fest that includes very ""heroic"" scenes) lovers as much as to the soap-op-rah ones(emotional love ,drama). it blends the two genres by logically romanticizing their own formats instead of only emotional overtones.some witty dialogs as well except for certain feminine love elements that are ""cliches""(just a couple). the pace starts strong, slows down in the middle loosing a bit of focus but then picks up again with vengeance towards an epic end)). but make no mistake, this is not a medieval ""war"" in any way or any ""grand battles"" to see.but the plot substitutes better then any sgi effects could( seeing Elisabeth on the horse with such speeches is way over the top, naive, but this is only once quick scene , i can live with that). the soundtrack is appropriate better then the average medieval movie would generally have.<br/><br/>but first what i liked; -1)the characters all fit their role pretty much( maybe the queen of Scots is given too much ""credit"" i guess for maximizing the drama effect).Clive Owen plays his part very good, however maybe more space could have been given to his character development. after all Sir Walter Raleigh was the man that practically did build the strong English fleet therefore the empire and that beside providing much needed ""company"" to the queen and not only. -2)there has been some points made about how Cate Blanchett as Elisabeth looks way too youthful( she was indeed 55 when Spanish armanda arrived). at first glance that is what i thought as well, but when the character development arrives and intimate scenes with her are ""given away"" one can realize that Cate Blanchett is actually utmost perfect in playing Elisabeth.in my opinion as a male i do not find the actress attracting at all ,as a ""female"" per see, at least in this particular feature.as scenes goes by she DOES have wrinkles and one can see a very much faded beauty, if there was one in the first place. however it is her personality on screen that makes her simply a ""diva"". extremely strong female with a strong self control and her private love life insecurities just confirm her ""under dog"" status when it comes to physical beauty...the movie gives a good imagine HOW and WHY Elisabeth manage to actually build an empire; her utmost diplomatic skills of understanding and not mixing politics with religion. the very first scene we see her in relives the above statement.the actress queen, unlike many other features, where a liberal viewer might have an instinctual dislike of royalty, is very like a leader should be regardless of sex or personal views.<br/><br/>now to the negative parts: -1) quiet many intentional historical ""revisions "" here even if the general facts DID happen as described; however is the manipulations given to the plot that could make a historian feel insulted. first of all of historical character development: - it is generally accepted by historians that Sir Walter Raleigh(Clive Owen) WAS the queen's lover. while the movie portrays Elisabeth as the victim, the truth was that Sir Walter Raleigh married her courtesan Elizabeth Throckmorton out of political imagine needed and that LATER?(after the armanda). the soap Oprah developed the courtesan as the one with ""free choices"" when the reality was exact the opposite.the queen had her lover while the courtesan HAD to marry him. therefore in reality the royal was just using her subjects as pawns with disregard for their feelings. 2)- King Philip ll of Spain is portrayed as a religious ""nut""; obviously the directors have disregard for history and simply portaged the Spaniards( all have dark ""evil"" lookalike beards LOL) as bad guys obviously to make Elisabeth look as the ""good queen"". well guess what, she( both the actor and the real historical figure) do not need that because, at best, it makes them a disservice, since their achievements are already beyond many other kings or queens...or actors.this feature was advertise as a historical picture and yes i could understand some mistakes for visual and script visuals; but with this ""revisions"" the picture gives me a slight imagine of a sci-fi...still great but NOT ""real"". the Spanish empire was already in decline during those times due to its own created gold inflation( too much gold taken or stolen from Americas.) 3)- the queen marry and Elisabeth related history is almost entirely given a twist. while marry was indeed a ""tool"" for the catholics and not anywhere close to a leader, Elisabeth was more then happy to see her go eventually due to practical political reasons to avoid civil war. 4)- the Spanish aramnda was destroyed and scattered by bad weather; English fighting skill did not have nothing to do with it."
"Quinoa1984","6","1","1","9 April 2008"," works, up to a point, as overloaded soap opera, then loses sight as poetic war ensues
","I barely remembered the first film Elizabeth (though I remember still that I liked it, however without much enthusiasm to see it soon after again) before I decided, based on a few surprisingly good reviews, to seek out the 'sequel', which follows Queen Elizabeth in some of her most formidable and turbulent years in power. And it turns out to be... what I expected, with a couple of points of merit. It is, actually, not too much unlike the also recent The Other Boelyn Girl, and there's a commonality that will make some want to see it a lot more than others. The performances by the female leads are fantastic, and there's some male eye-candy for the more fashionable and iconoclastic characters (for the former, Cate Blanchett re-assumes her role, and for the latter we have Clive Owen here as Walter Raleigh, a handsome pirate- need to emphasize this again *handsome*), and it's beautifully designed. It rightfully won its costume Oscar, at the least.<br/><br/>But the director Kapur is not without his excesses, and isn't entirely sure which movie he would prefer more- perhaps history, as it would seem, doesn't discern the two sides. Elizabeth might quietly have a 'thing' for Raleigh, but she cannot ever show it, despite him being, in a perfect world as they say, the most promising prospect to help her conceive and continue on with kingdom of Britain. But there's also her most trusted assistant, played by Abbie Cornish, who is also smitten with Raleigh, and they end up marrying and having a child behind the Queen's back. There's a lot of tension, too, with the Queen's cousin Mary (Samantha Morton in maybe the best supporting role of the movie, which maybe isn't saying much), who wants to take the crown for herself. Her plot against her, as it turns out, is seen as a treasonous turn for the Spanish, and so they put forward their offense against the UK.<br/><br/>Now, for all that Kapur can do with the material, the best choice he does is to let the scenes of human romantic turmoil, repression, and the shortcomings of Elizabeth beside of her strengths, ring out for all their melodramatics are worth. That makes The Golden Age tolerable, even watchable in a guilty pleasure sort of way. But then when the big battle scenes at sea come, it turns into a mess. He just can't seem to direct those scenes without mucking it up with pretentious visual poetic-theatrics that bog down everything to a crawl. And because Kapur can't leave one side without the other, he's left with an enjoyable but turgid muddle on his hands, with a fiery and (color us shocked) complex Blanchett performance at the center. In fact, if you have any reason to see it at all that doesn't include an interest in costume/period pieces or old-school English history, see it for her."
"djholmes-1","6","1","1","29 March 2008"," Good acting... irritating script
","Maybe we don't go to the movies for a history lesson but, when there are recorded historical facts available, script writers should follow them. The movie would have been no less entertaining if it had been historically accurate. It was not, after all, a fictional story. The acting was excellent, Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, and Abby Cornish in particular. Clive Owen was good in the most inaccurate portrayal of all, dragged in only to have something romantic for the queen. To ignore all those genuinely responsible for the defeat of the Armada was an insult; Raleigh was a very minor participant. The first movie, Elizabeth, was far superior."
"seangordon","6","1","1","6 March 2008"," Not a BAD movie, but certainly not a perfect sequel to one of the greatest movies of all time,
","This movie is most certainly not a let down, but it does have its sour points. If the movie were about a fictional queen, few people would have such complaints about it. The problem with it is that there are several mistakes in historical accuracy. Most of them aren't that terrible, but they're the little things that just drive you crazy, like the fact that Robert Dudley was only in the flashbacks. Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Leicester (pronounced Lester) were friends for life. The gun that threatened HM's life wasn't even in existence yet. The Spanish Armada Battle was unnecessarily short, and some of the parts of the war scenes weren't needed. The armour that Queen Elizabeth wore was ludicrous; she never would've worn that. SHe most likely wore a breastplate and a dress.<br/><br/>The acting is a different story. It's amazing. Everything about the movie (counting out its terrible inaccuracies) is pretty great. I mean, the costume design is Oscar-winning. The acting is just phenomenal. I mean, just really superb. Some of Clive Owens and Cate Blanchett's best work. The scene where she's shouting at the Spanish ambassador was really realistic.<br/><br/>If you love Queen Elizabeth I, you should see this movie. You'll eventually get past the historical inaccuracies."
"bdspars","7","1","1","7 February 2008"," enjoyable film, but...
","This film is entertaining and the acting for the most part is excellent. For a period film, Elizabeth, The Golden Age, is recommended. If the film has any weakness, it would be the acting of Clive Owen. Owen dresses the part and fits the part but he does not carry the part. Owen's lines are delivered cold and without emotion; Owen's acting talent is limited and this film proves it.<br/><br/>The costumes in Elizabeth, The Golden Age, deserve a commendation. The accuracy of the historical facts of Elizabeth's reign are fairly accurate but not clearly portray the Elizabeth history knows.<br/><br/>Mary is 16 years older than Elizbeth but in this film, it is clearly overlooked. In addition, there is no reference to the pregnancy of Mary which would have played an important part in her life and death under the hands of Elizabeth.<br/><br/>The final demise of Mary is clearly misrepresented in this film. Elizabth certainly had no love for Mary and did not have misgivings for her death, Elizabeth did not wish to be attached to the death of Mary and had her secretary handle the event.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is spinning many stories and the average movie goer should do some reading before viewing."
"oneloveall","5","1","1","25 January 2008"," Worthy production contradicts an underdeveloped screenplay
","The second installment of Queen Elizabeth's cinematic chronicles finds all the necessary ingredients returning to impart a classy experience, namely director Shekhar Kapur and Cate Blanchett in the title role. While much of the sumptuous production inherent in such a big studio period piece certainly delivers to the eyes, the plot's bumbling maneuvers cannot help but take viewers out of most of the queen's inner turmoil this film was supposed to be convincing us of, leaving little more then a stylized costume melodrama in it's place. Blanchett, never less then admirable in any role, feels underutilized in a script that coasts by with the conviction of a glamorous history lesson.<br/><br/>None of it rears off-ramp too noticeably, but in general the movie will chiefly apply to British history buffs; even if massive liberties were probably taken, the specificity of these poorly developed subplots feel pre-made for those already fixated upon Elizabeth's recent resurgence in entertainment."
"kaholle","2","20","66","9 October 2007"," clive owen should never wear puffy shirts
","I liked the first Elizabeth with a fresh Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes. This movie was putrid. The dialogue was wretched - Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh: ""I need something from you. And I haven't had it in a long, looong time."" It's not what you think, either. And when the lady-in-waiting Bess asks Raleigh if a sailor's life isn't lonely, he replies, ""Sometimes.... But it's the life I've chosen."" These were two times when I actually couldn't help myself from laughing out loud. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchette and Samantha Morton are terrific actresses, usually. But this movie made them look like screaming, hormonal b*tches. <br/><br/>And Clive Owen, who is a fabulous actor in modern roles should never wear puffy shirts, or a goatee, or spangles. Ever."

","Almost a decade after the release of ""Elizabeth,"" director Shekhar Capur and star Cate Blanchett return in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" a film which loosely bases its plot from the life of Queen Elizabeth I of England during her 27th year of reign.<br/><br/>After vowing a life of celibacy, Elizaveth is now pressured into marrying by her adviser, Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), in an effort. One of her suitors is Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who returns from an expedition to the New World and swoons the Virgin Queen with tales of having named an island after her. Meanwhile, King Philip II of Spain prepares to launch a holy war against England and her Protestant queen.<br/><br/>Visually the film is an eye candy - Remi Adefarasin's shots are nicely composed, and the production design are nothing short of remarkable. But the film is replete with subplots suffering from an uneven script and pacing that the film ultimately becomes a forgettable melodramatic affair. Blanchett delivers a solid performance and is virtually the lone bright spot, while the likes of Owen, Rush, and Abby Cornish as the queen's principal lady-in-waiting fail to impart a commanding presence.<br/><br/>What results is a film of deluxe design but lacking the emotional force to be truly involving. And the liberal use of history probably won't win additional affection for this queen either."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","3","7","10 February 2008"," This is the year for Cate's Oscar!
","When I saw the trailer for Elizabeth: The Golden Age, I was a little baffled, I know this is going to sound so bad, but I was thinking ""Oh, great, the sequel to Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The Search for More Money"". I mean, they ended the movie Elizabeth so well, why did they need another movie? But after Cate's Oscar nomination, I decided to go ahead and see the movie and just see if it was any good, I watched it yesterday and I have to say that Elizabeth: The Golden Age was really good. I'm a little surprised by the rating of a 6.9, I thought they presented Queen Elizabeth with the great honor and strength that she deserved. Cate Blanchett was astonishing, her performance was just incredible, it's almost like this was the role that was just meant to be her's. She brought Queen Elizabeth to life like no other actress has before.<br/><br/>Queen Elizabeth has taken rule to England, she is still childless and unmarried, the war between the Prodestents and the Catholic's is still going strong, since Elizabeth is a known Prodestent, many people do not want her on the throne. Mary Stewart is Elizabeth's cousin and many people believe that she should have taken the crown and will assassinate Elizabeth just to get their way. For once Queen Elizabeth's emotions are starting to show, she's frightened and worried what is going to happen to her and her kingdom, but with the reassurance of the adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh and old friend, Sir Francis Walsingham, she feels the strength to go on and go into war with the Spanish.<br/><br/>Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a remarkable film and I was really impressed with how they presented Elizabeth, she was so strong and admirable. The film itself is great as well, while it's not strongly accurate, the story is terrific, I know they had to give it a little something to grab the audience's's attention. But the sets, the costumes, the characters, Clive Owen made a great performance out of Sir Raleigh, he was the perfect choice. I would recommend Elizabeth: The Golden Age, it's a terrific movie and I hope Cate gets the Oscar she very much deserves for the performance of Elizabeth.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jaredmobarak","8","3","7","16 October 2007"," I will live right until the endElizabeth: The Golden Age
","Whereas Elizabeth told a tale of royalty and the politics underlying every action to gain power, Elizabeth: The Golden Age weaves the story of how that strength survives. Michael Hirst gets help this time from the capable William Nicholson to explain what happens once the queen has proved her worth. The country has accepted her, yet many Catholic dissenters hide behind Mary Stuart, looking for an overthrow. Outside her kingdom sees Spain reviling her crown, standing against the God they hold dear. King Philip has a plan that will use Elizabeth's most trusted advisors' loyalty against her. This is a time where religion hangs over everything heavily. One cannot become a leader without God's acceptance and one cannot start a war without that permission either. As a result, the story starts off at a subtle pace, slowly unraveling the conspiracies at play, to later crank up the suspense for a war that will shape the world as we know it today.<br/><br/>The years between the two films has seen director Shekhar Kapur hone his skills and develop an aesthetic much flashier here than its predecessor. Yes, he had the majesty of set and wardrobe in the first film, but here he takes it to the next level. Elizabeth begins in power; therefore she must show off her royal beauty. The movie can be seen as one of over-extravagance, but I don't think it ever goes too far. Kapur's attention to detail should be commended, and while the visuals are stunning and at times overwhelming, they never are at the detriment to the story being told. This can't quite be said about the cinematography. He appears to be a bit over his head on composition, giving us many instances that beg the question, why did he do that? One such moment, at the end, shows Geoffrey Rush (reprising his role of Walsingham to much the same accomplishment) lying on his bed through a pinhole gap in the ceiling. The screen is black besides the small opening with its blurred edges. Not only is it strange, but it lasts for only about five seconds before cutting back to a normal vantage point. Another example is of the queen standing to the left of the screen while a column fills the other five-sixths. She isn't even showed in full, but allows a bit of her dress to go behind the obstruction. Awkward moments like this seem out of place and take the viewer out of the worka little misguided auteurism.<br/><br/>I can't fault him too much for these transgressions, as there are just as many instances of pure beauty. From Sir Walter Raleigh swimming underwater while ships burn above him to the execution of Mary Stuart, Kapur gives his share of emotionally stunning sequences. Give him a weighty score and the ability to film in slow motion and let him do his thing. Even the many times he portrays metaphors and allusions to faith and God are done so with a deft hand. The shadow of religion covering most of the proceedings help allow him to get away with it, as that was a standard of the time, but he never lets them become too heavy-handed or laughably easy. I also give him credit for knowing his limits and instead of showing horrid action/war scenes, he holds back to only shoot the destruction the war creates. Maybe it was his experience with battles on the critically panned Four Feathers (I can't weigh in here as I haven't seen the film), but his masking the fighting with only explosions and aftermath works effectively.<br/><br/>Just as with Elizabeth, The Golden Age's aesthetic, great as it is, only equals the acting on display. With both Rush and Cate Blanchett returning, one could not ask for more. Blanchett shows her strength at all times while also letting a bit of her dreams for a normal life seep through. When she is with her favorite ""lady in waiting"" Bess, a nice turn from Abbie Cornish, or alone with Raleigh, her true self shows through the façade of stoic leadership. She longs for a love affair, but not so much that she would sacrifice the people she rules. Her ability to hold to her word that she will protect everyone of England, no matter their religious preference and to even go to the front lines while they fight for her, (a nice scene even if the speech was a tad lackluster) shows her humanity and greatness.<br/><br/>Kapur has assembled another dream cast of British stars to support his lead. Clive Owen, as Raleigh, is the perfect amount of charisma and self-assured defiance needed to make his role believable. In order to have the queen's full respect, he had to stand up for himself no matter what she might do as a result. Samantha Morton is fantastic as Mary Stuart. The role is somewhat of a MacGuffin, but effective nonetheless; hopefully she will take more roles as the villain in the future. She is a great actress and it's nice to see her branch out of the heroine mode. There are many other familiar faces, all doing an admirable job to keep appearances up for this wonderful period piece. One more of notice, however, is the almost unrecognizable Rhys Ifans. Completely gone is the goofiness I know him for from films such as Notting Hill and Human Nature. What a surprise he is playing the Jesuit priest on a mission from Spain that no one quite knows until it is too late."
"johno-21","8","3","7","15 October 2007"," The Great Cate is again Good Queen Bess
","I just saw this during it's opening theatrical weekend and so far the critics have been harsh and the box office figures disappointing but there is a lot to like about this film. Director Shekhar Kapur is back in Elzibean times with his second installment in his semi-historical lavish costume drama series on the life of England's Queen Elizabeth I. Also returning from the 1998 film Elizabeth are Cate Blanchett in the title role, Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham, cinematographer Remi Adefarasin, film editor Jil Bilcock, costume designer Alexandra Byrne and screenwriter Michael Hirst with a script co-written with William Nicholson. Like the first film this is filled with historical inaccuracies and thus can only be called semi-historical. It has a dark sinister feel to it to match it's content of castle intrigue and war. the film takes place between the years 1585 and 1588 covering the plots against the throne of Elizabeth by her cousin Mary Queen of Scotts (Samantha Morton) and her agents, the invasion of England by Spain's Phillip II (Jordi Mollà) and introduces us to Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen). All this can be confusing at times and the film seems to go off into different directions and tries to compact too much history into too little a time frame. The quest to try to try to make a political marriage and have the childless Elizabeth produce an heir to the throne had long passed by these years. A political marriage was still hoped for but Elizabeth was far past her potential childbearing years. She was between the ages of 52 and 55 during these years and although the most wealthy and privileged woman of her time, a woman of that age was elderly looking by 16th century standards yet Blanchett appears to be a woman of 40-45 years old by 21st century standards. It's kind of hard to get past. They needlessly try to fit the quest for an heir into the film's time frame. The ill-fated Spanish Armada's invasion of England is reduced to the time frame of a soccer match with Elizabeth in full battle armor straddling a horse with a leg on either side like a man and rallying the troops on land as the Armada approaches. Sir Walter Raleigh rides a ship ablaze into the Armada setting hundreds of Spanish ships ablaze in one great conflagration that seemingly sinks the entire Spanish fleet as Elizabeth watches from a cliff in her nightgown. It looks great but it's silly and historically farciful. The most famous fire ship battle took place in the English Channel off Calais and there were several more battles and skirmishes in the channel before the Armada set sail around Scotland and met with disastrous weather which cause most of it's ships to sink off Ireland. The route of the Armada from leaving Spain to it's return took all summer long. The battle as depicted in the film is fictional and Elizabeth was in London not on the banks of the channel watching a fire ship battle. She did inspire her troops with a speech at Tilbury on a white horse but she wore a single metal breastplate as a symbol of resolve but she wasn't clad in full shining body armor dressed for hand to hand combat. This film has a relatively weak script with a soap opera-like dialog but despite it's faults the film looks great. Every scene is like a painting. Great set decoration, lighting and costuming. It's simply beautiful to look at and Cate Blanchette is nothing short of fantastic. I think she'll get a Best Actress nomination from the Academy Awards and this film could get several more for Best Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Sound. There are a lot great sinister characters here in small supporting roles and even though Jordi Mollà as Phillip of Spain is a small non-English speaking role he's so perfect that I would give him Best Supporting Actor consideration at least. This film is certainly a visual treat and despite it's many flaws and my many criticisms I would still give it an 8.0 out of 10."
"librlart","7","3","7","12 October 2007"," As if Greenaway were to attempt an epic battle film...
","I saw this film at the Arclight in Hollywood, a theater that, for better or worse, can often make films deserving direct-to-video releases seem like potential Oscar nominees. This film was introduced there as one that would undoubtedly get an Oscar nomination. I was dazzled, I was confused, I was frustrated. But I was never bored, and found myself surprised when it was over.<br/><br/>In many respects it is a fantastic film; visually stunning, beautifully shot and decorated, always fascinating to watch. Some of the props and costumes were on display in the lobby of the theater, and that helped pique my interest because they were ornate and exquisitely crafted. (I had arrived to see another film that I couldn't get into.) Some others have complained here of the heavy-handed score, but I found it rather interesting. I thought it brought out the sub-text of many scenes quite well, and carried some battle scenes that would have, excuse the pun, sunk left to their own devices.<br/><br/>But I left with many questions unanswered. I'm not sure if the stories were mangled in the editing room, or whether they never were in the story in the first place. Undoubtedly there was a lot of historical information to consider including. There are three major thematic plots concerning, in increasing order of importance, Elizabeth's love (dis-)interest, assassination attempts, and religious war with Spain. They seemed to be given inverse importance as the story unraveled.<br/><br/>Elizabeth's love interest in Raleigh occupied the most screen time, and I thought they were great together. But her toying with the younger Elizabeth (Cornish's) interactions with Raleigh seemed to indicate either denial of her own attractions or confused directorial intentions, and I wasn't sure which was the case. The film does well at personally investigating Elizabeth, the woman, and less well at portraying historical Elizabeth, the Queen and administrator of an empire.<br/><br/>The back-story of the assassination attempts isn't clearly spelled out; the historical context of the antagonists is skimmed over; when we get to the final battle scene, we barely have any idea who the foe is, we just know they have an overwhelming number of troops and ships and spend a lot of time torturing people in dungeons apparently filled with drying laundry. Mary's plots and notes seem inconsequential, and we barely have any idea just what she *was* plotting to do or how she intended to do it. We don't discover what the notes said, or see the interceptions of them occur, and they have none of the Shakespearean impact of Rosencrantz's and Guilderstern's efforts. Indeed, perhaps the writers should have taken a few cues from the artists of the era they were writing about. We barely get to know the enemy, hence we never really consider their capabilities and have trouble seriously considering them as a threat.<br/><br/>When the battle is over, we have no idea why the Queen was leading troops across land like a Joan of Arc when the entire battle was at sea. We never see hand-to-hand combat on land. There is no explanation of how five ""fire ships"" succeeded in defeating an enormous fleet. Everything up until the battle scene leads you to expect epic combat on the order of Braveheart or the writer's Gladiator, and instead, after a single confrontation, England triumphs and Spain is left whimpering with their tail between their legs. ""Oh, I guess it wasn't God's will for us to win."" What happened to all their ships? How did England win by burning a handful of boats and making them break formation? We didn't get the epic-style gratification of seeing the enemy suffer and fail. Hence I was left feeling like I was watching a British propaganda film.<br/><br/>Blanchett, Owen, Rush, and Cornish are all fascinating to watch perform, and they could probably make a car commercial seem like high drama. At times I wasn't quite sure Blanchett wasn't just recreating Judi Dench's Elizabeth, but her vulnerability gave the character much more dimension. I wished the camera could linger longer on Cornish, as it did on Blanchett or Owen, so we could have some time to consider and SEE her role as things unfolded. The dialogue of Walsingham/Rush's family did little in exposition to explain his situation or it's impact on those around him, yet we come to understand that quite a lot was known and going on - after the fact. The film should have shown us these cases, not told it afterwards. So much was lost dramatically by this directorial choice. As others have said, some of the dialogue is trite. Somehow the actors and score managed to lay their coats over this annoying puddle.<br/><br/>Of course it is easy to pick apart the works of others, and I found this to be a highly engaging and entertaining film. I think when you see something well-crafted, you hope it will succeed in every dimension, and I found myself with too many unanswered questions afterwards. I left wondering what *really* happened historically, and a half-hearted internet search revealed that Elizabeth gave a famous speech on the battlefield that didn't seem like what I'd just seen on the screen, although I may be mistaken.<br/><br/>The film is definitely worth a gander; visual eye candy that will certainly beat a stroll through the Elizabethan era costume vaults of the Metropolitan Museum. It's like a Greenaway film or Orlando, with a bit of plot to keep you awake and some superb actors to boot. It just won't let you have the taste of blood in your teeth that you expect from a war film, and perhaps the use of that context was it's greatest failing."

","Elizabeth the Golden Age gets off to a bad start with a Clinton-like lie (in the first 3 minutes) about Elizabeth guaranteeing religious freedom to the Catholics in England --- kind of like Michael Vick saying he's kind to dogs -- it's like starting a fine dinner and finding a cockroach in the salad. There is NO REASON to distort history in a movie.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Universal has taken one of the most interesting situations in English history and filmed it with mundane boredom. Except for Cate Blanchett in the title role all the players are dull and lifeless.

"woodkmw","8","2","4","10 December 2007"," Very enjoyable viewing
","Contrary to some of the other comments on this site, I just saw the movie yesterday evening and I found it to be very enjoyable viewing with an excellent cast. Cate Blanchett was wonderful in this movie as were the other cast members. The actress who plays Mary Queen of Scots haunted me as I knew I had seen her somewhere before but couldn't place her. It was only just now when I checked with IMDb that I learned she was Agatha in Minority Report! Just couldn't shake where I had seen here before. I would like to comment on some of the other reader postings as well as touch on some of the points I found enjoyable about the film.<br/><br/>1) That the movie depicts the Spanish as black-wearing religious zealots. Well...yes...and your point is? If you look at any period painting of the Spanish court and courtiers they are always dressed in black. The only exceptions usually being very young members of the royal family. As for being religious zealots you only need to open any history book to see the countless religious wars that the Spanish waged at the time. The persecution at home with the Spanish Inquisition. The later destruction of the Americas by Spaniards that destroyed anything they viewed as pagan and un-Christian. Religion was an obsession with the King of Spain who ruled under the idea that ""I will not, nor shall I ever be, King of a realm of heretics."" 2) That this movie depicted a woman prone to flights of fancy and girlishness. Well again, in every in-depth history book on the Queen you will find that she was exactly that. A woman who had a terrible, traumatic childhood where her death loomed every day. Who was suddenly thrust into rule, as a female ruler surrounded by males. Someone who was vain, girlish, tempestuous. All of these characteristics are well known to have been held by Queen Elizabeth I who later in life banished all mirrors from every palace and insisted on having her official portraits painted by just a few painters always depicting a younger personage. Someone who never felt the honest love of another person who didn't want anything from her. Who like everyone felt her youth fading with every year. I thought this was captured magnificently by Cate Blanchett in this film. Especially at that one beautiful scene with she and Raleigh in front of the fire where she secretly begs him for just one kiss. You can feel the insecurity and lovelessness in her every move and calculated word. I thought that was one of the best scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>That the movie did not do justice to the Queen who ""invented modern drama."" Hardly. Queen Elizabeth's reign is given far too much credit in this department. If you look at the dates of many of the great Renaissance English dramas such as those produced by Shakespeare, you will find that the majority were written after her death in 1603. It was her successor King James that really patronized the arts, not so much Elizabeth. Elizabeth was actually more famous for never being able to make a decision. Upon her death, James inherited a whole host of problems. She deferred the execution of Mary for a very long time until finally every adviser told her that it had to be done as Mary had committed treason and for years was going around referring to herself as the Queen of England. That's eccentric if you are some beggar on the street, not when you are second in line to the throne. Finally she got her much overdue whack and roll.<br/><br/>I also thought the sea battle was done very well. I did not view it as a ""rock em sock em robots"" filming. I thought the scene toward the end that showed the fleet in flames was very well done. If anything I thought this part of the movie could have been more gruesome and violent.<br/><br/>As for Walter Raleigh's personality. I really don't know as I was not there. He is known to be a gentleman but also a pirate/privateer. He couldn't have been too courtly as he frequently attacked ships at sea, Spanish cities, and was thrown into the Tower on I believe at least two occasions. He is shown as gallant in the scene in the movie where he throws down his cape for the Queen to step across a puddle.<br/><br/>All in all I thought this was a very enjoyable, rich movie. Fantastic settings, great costumes and interiors, a good sense of the period, the majesty, religious fervor, secret practices with plenty of the day-to-day courtly practices that the rulers of the time experienced. I would recommend it highly."
"liberalgems","10","2","4","3 November 2007"," A Wonderful Film About An Important Chapter in History!
","I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!<br/><br/>To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.<br/><br/>If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of the dictator Franco!! Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!"
"cathylr","4","0","0","21 May 2020"," A bit too ´sentionalist´ to my taste
","To start with the positive, I found the costumes and set amazing. I guess a lot of research has been done as it matches what I recall having seen in museums. The photography and visual are really good, creating the dark ambiance of the times. However, on the latter, I find that it tends to go too much into describing the tortures inflected at the time as well as the misery. I found it realistic at first but it is many scenes with big zooms that seem to want to repulse the viewer to create some kind of sensationalism.
As I am not an historian, I cannot comment on the accuracy (many other reviewers here seem to have done the job already) but the aspect that I am in contempt with is the fact that I don´t manage to get into the story. The acting and the plots may be in line with the reality but I do not believe in the characters. A few scenes seem a bit ´made in Hollywood´, which is odd for a film about English history. By the way, why having chosen an Australian actress for the part?
My overall impression is that, as per the title of my review, this film was made to ´impress´ but not to reflect a part of history. As I am writing, there is one hour left to this film but I don´t really find any interest in watching further.
A great visual but that´s it."
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","11 March 2020"," A decent whistle-stop historical piece
","I never studied the 'Elizabethan' period at school (choosing instead to get all my knowledge about the era from 'Blackadder II!'), so I'm not entirely sure how accurate the story of - arguably - Britain's most famous queen is, but it certainly ticks off all the major beats from the latter part of her reign (to my limited knowledge, anyway).<br/><br/>In some ways it's actually a 'sequel' to Cate Blanchett's first turn as the monarch, however whereas before we saw her rise to power and experiences at being so young and yet so powerful, here we're treated to a far more 'mature' Queen Elizabeth II and the pressure placed on her to find a husband, while at the same time trying to suppress her own (rumoured, so I understand?) desires for Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the very real threat that the Spanish may well invade soon.<br/><br/>Blanchett already proved in the first outing that she's more than capable at portraying the royal in the period and her performance cannot be faulted here either. This is one film where a poor performance from the lead whose shoulders everything rests on can completely ruin the film. Here, as expected, she carries it off with ease and shows how even the most powerful woman of her age had many problems with her personal life and that of generally being a woman.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other famous faces in the case - mainly Clive Owen who is at the peak of his rugged charm, but also Geoffrey Rush. Both are excellent and perfectly suit their roles, but this film is Blanchett's baby all the way and she eclipses everyone around her at every turn.<br/><br/>Many people who have seen both films seem to think that the first one is better, mainly due to the fact that - apparently - it sticks closer to history and takes less liberties. However, for anyone even vaguely interested in this era of British history could do a lot worse than watch it to get a decent overview of the events of the time. Yes, many are skated over a little and everything seems to happen very quickly, but with a performance like Blanchett's it really should be overlooked. My main gripe was that the budget clearly didn't really stretch to particularly realistic computer-generated special effects during the battle scenes at sea, but if I wanted wall-to-wall special effects, I'd watch a Marvel movie."
"CinemaSerf","6","0","0","5 March 2020"," A stilted but colourful costume drama...
","Sadly, someone agreed that a sequel to ""Elizabeth"" was required so we ended up with this rather fanciful vehicle for a still competent Cate Blanchett but not so much for a terribly wooden Clive Owen as ""Walter Raleigh"". Following the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), England is facing impending invasion by the Spanish Armada. The (largely forgivable) factual inaccuracies that dogged the first film are somehow magnified in this rather poor follow up. It really does miss Richard Attenbourgh; despite the best efforts of Geoffrey Rush and a somewhat flighty Abbie Cornish. As you'd expect, the film looks great and there is quite an interesting ""making of"" documentary demonstrating how the whole thing was filmed - perhaps more interesting than the film itself. Fortunately the Queen didn't live too much longer after this so we ought to be safe from ""Elizabeth III"""

"skepticskeptical","6","0","0","13 December 2019"," Uncompelling
","I prefer to look at historical films as works unto themselves. This means that I ignore historical inaccuracies--whether real or possible. In part that is because we can only be dependent upon other people´s versions of what happened before us. Every work of history is omissive, so we can never really know ¨the whole truth¨. My disappointment with this film, therefore, has nothing to do with what others may decry as false depictions of history.<br/><br/>Instead, I found that the character of Elizabeth ¨The Virgin Queen¨ portrayed through most of this production does not cohere with the conclusion of the work. She is shown to be weak and lacking in self-esteem and resolve for fully three-quarters of the film, making it very difficult to admire or sympathize with her. Even worse, it simply does not make sense that she suddenly becomes a strong woman of determination just so the film can have a triumphant ending.<br/><br/>The costumes were great, and I hope to watch the first Elizabeth film at some point to see whether it is more consistently crafted."

","The previous film, just called 'Elizabeth', showed the early years of Elizabeth I's reign; now she is an established monarch but her problems are not over. There advisers want her to clamp down on English Catholics as they believe they are plotting against her in an attempt to put her cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, on the throne. The Spanish are looking for an excuse to invade and pressure is being put on her to marry and produce an heir. Explorer Walter Raleigh, just back from claiming an area of the New World, which he has named Virginia in her honour, catches her eye and they become friends. He is also attracted to her attendant Bess Throckmorton. As various plots play out the Spanish launch a giant armada to invade England; the odds are in the Spanish fleet's favour but a small English force prepares to meet it.<br/><br/>If you insist on historical accuracy you are likely to be disappointed but if you are happy with a film that provides romance, plotting and a fiery naval battle then this is a lot of fun. The story moves at a good pace and has interesting central characters. Cate Blanchett impresses in the title role; the rest of the cast are solid too; notably Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish as Raleigh and Bess Throckmorton respectively. The settings mostly look great... even if the iconic Eilean Donan Castle; a coastal castle in Scotland sees an odd standing for the inland Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire!

","29 October 2007. This rich, luxurious,and gorgeous epic level movie is burdened with a convoluted, clumsy script that seems as murky as the plots surrounding the Queen leaving the audience far much in the dark until the bright sun of clarity shines later in the movie. The characters, especially in the first half of the movie seems more caricatures and one-dimensional figures of good and evil that really do not do justice to this much more fully realized world of Elizabeth. Oddly enough it is the role of Mary Stuart played by Samantha Morton later in the movie that takes center stage in such a dignified manner that her performance almost outshines all others. Sir Walter Raleigh and Bess, Lady in Waiting relationship is an attempt at putting a human face on the Middle Ages, but still there is so much overlooked. Skimmed over is war scenes, the Queen's actual decision in the sentence of Mary Stuart. There are far too many plot points that seem to end up skipped, making the audience fill in the gaps, as if having to watch most of the movie, except there are gaps missing along with English dialogue that ironically enough might have been better handled with captions like the foreign languages used in the movie. Overall, Cate Blanchett's while not as stellar as Helen Mirren's performance in 2006 of another Queen, is competent and penetrated though perhaps too overwrought, to manipulative. The movie made strong points, ethical, moral, and otherwise, but it failed to seize the mighty throne of the genre. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","I wish I could give this film a higher rating in view of its lush costuming, locations, and casting. However, it doesn't live up to its title, and one anticipates a ""Golden Age, Part II"" (Or was that covered in ""Shakespeare in Love""?) Too much of this is simplistic history. The Spanish are depicted as the embodiment of evil while the English are pictured as a freedom loving people who only reluctantly torture captives and lop off people's heads and are beginning to persecute others for their religious beliefs with less and less intensity. The Armada is seen as a vast, invincible force brought low by some bad weather and fire ships, especially the last one launched in superhero fashion by Sir Walter Raleigh. (The scene of him leaping into the sea at the last minute is sort of funny now, because it resembles so much the TV commercial featuring John Jameson diving into raging waters to retrieve a barrel of his treasured whiskey.) And what's with the horse jumping overboard? Was that supposed to be symbolism of some kind? I half expected Sir Walter to come back on land riding the horse! Any one who watches the History or Military Channel knows that the defeat of the Armada was much more complicated. There was no lack of bravery on the part of the English sailors, but bad weather played a much bigger role in the total distruction of the Armada than is pictured in the film. Finally, without a deep knowlege of English history, it's hard to tell who is who in these dramas, and what their motives are for their actions. Even before you can figure out who someone is, he is arrested for treason, tortured, and hanged."

","This movie is the sequel to ""Elizabeth - The Virgin Queen"" (1998) and, like all sequels, suffers from an inferiority complex towards the original film. It is a regular historical film, which depicts a key moment of Elizabeth I's reign of England: the Invincible Armada and the English resistance to Spanish ambitions. And Cate Blanchett (who continues to give life to the English queen) is still brilliant in her role, almost being able to become the queen that herself. Unfortunately, as in the first film, this effort follows without the merit and appreciation of the critics and the Hollywood Academy (the Oscar nomination for Best Actress that year did not pass that same). Geoffrey Rush continues to give body to Sir Francis Walsingham and do it with great talent and ability, even though his character has not here the strength it had previously. Clive Owen is perfect in the role of Sir Walter Raleigh and reaches, with this film, one of the most interesting works of his career so far.<br/><br/>Historically, unlike the previous film, it didn't seem very able to be faithful to the truth. The script is too imaginative and too much focused on an unlikely and theatrical affair between the Queen and Walter Raleigh. The Spanish Armada is barely portrayed and the struggle between English and Spanish, the natural film climax, ends up being completely emptied of relevance, which makes no sense and puts in question the film edition, and the quality of the script. In fact, there was no ability to foresee the importance of this point for the film's outcome. If the director (Shekhar Kapur) and writers (William Nicholson and Michael Hirst) thought that Blanchett's great interpretation, a very good cast, scenery, clothes and some romantic suggestions would be enough to save the film, they're wrong. Do not make omelets without eggs, says the people, rightly so. This film had everything to be better, to match its predecessor, but a bad script and editing laid everything to lose.<br/><br/>Despite its a very still and boring movie (sometimes seems that people have forgotten that they're almost to be invaded), this film is quite reasonable and worth seeing, especially for the excellent work of the actors."

Except that, the plot is interesting and intriguing.<br/><br/>The theme and setting really works well together as the movie progresses in my opinion. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the story of the characters and how they developed throughout the movie. i did not like the kind of psychotic Elizabeth coming forth a little bit in the movie, i just think that it sends the wrong message. the other characters where OK, by that i mean that i did not find anything intriguing with the characters, also i found their story to be sort of weird and boring.<br/><br/>so to sum up this review, i would say it is a more or less good movie for kids/young adults because of the truth the movie is based on. it is also surely nice for people especially interested in history. i did not want to give this movie more than a 6/10. but keep in mind that i watched this movie in green because of some technical issues, also i was continuously tormented by some of my ""friends"" during the movie and that brought it a little more down for me."

The Spanish Armada was defeated in minutes..!!! It is visually a beautiful movie, and we can expect a final film. (Elizabeth died when she was 70.)

","Elizabeth: The Golden Age – TRASH IT (C-) After watching Elizabeth it was hard to believe that the same director can make such shallow, tedious Elizabeth movie. Everything we fall in love with Elizabeth was gone in this movie. Nonetheless Cate Blanchett was superb and astonishing as she was in Elizabeth but it's the mediocre script which wastes so much time on mockery and love story between the pirate, the Queen and her Lady. Abbie Cornish is overrated, she is boring and even as Queen's lady she doesn't have the elegance. She is sure pretty but not elegant. Clive Owen is misfit and I actually don't really like him. I don't think he ever gave a Hit movie. And this man has worked with Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Keira Knightely, Nicole Kidman and here with Cate Blanchett. I mean he has worked with all big directors and actress but never sure shot hit in years. Overall, don't waste your time on this disappointing venture. The only thing good is Cate Blanchett and the costumes."
"Laakbaar","8","0","0","11 May 2012"," One grand, beautiful scene after the next
","I love a good Elizabeth movie as much as anyone else. In fact, just a few days before I saw this film, I had seen a 1939 film (Private Lives of Elizabeth & Essex) starting Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. It was fascinating to be able to compare these two movies from two different eras, to see how modern cinematography has developed in its depiction of Elizabeth and the late 16th century.<br/><br/>Perhaps unsurprisingly not much has changed with regard to Elizabeth's appearance and clothing. At least in modern movies Elizabeth is allowed to take her make-up and dress off once in a while. Even take baths.<br/><br/>In the 1939 movie, the theme was the love affair between Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex. This 2007 movie is set somewhat earlier, but it also shows the emotional life of Elizabeth, including her feelings for Walter Raleigh.<br/><br/>I thought that the performances in the movie were excellent. Cate Blanchett was marvellous. So was Samantha Morton and Geoffrey Rush. Clive Owen too was really good, especially at the start where he is trying to catch the queen's eye. His tale of making the crossing and reaching the new world was as gripping for the viewer as for Elizabeth. Say what you want about Clive Owen, he's good.<br/><br/>In this movie many of the scenes were achingly beautiful. At times it was like looking at a collection of Old Masters in a museum. The lighting, colour, costumes and rich settings were all used to their best advantage.<br/><br/>The beauty of the scenes became so striking at times, however, that the artifice kept leaping out at me. At times it was so obviously beautiful, so clearly romantic, that it seemed staged and posed.<br/><br/>I really didn't mind this aspect though. I can't get enough of modern attempts to display medieval and renaissance life. Seriously. There must be many fascinating aspects of the period that have yet to be shown on film.<br/><br/>OK, perhaps there was a bit too much jingoism in there. I understand that Elizabeth is a patriotic figure to the English (or at least to English filmmakers), but Elizabeth the virgin guardian angel of England? Elizabeth the warrior queen? Elizabeth the mother of her people? This is wishful thinking on the part of the director and themes that don't work for me. I suspect that English people however swell with patriotism when they see Elizabeth portrayed as a virgin-mother-warrior-angel-queen in full Renaissance finery. Even in the 1939 film the Americans did this in an old-Hollywood sort of way.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie for me was the execution of Mary and Elizabeth's anguish at what had happened. Morton played this brilliantly. Blanchett brought to life the doubts about it and the horror of it all. Walsingham did what he had to do, but what a mess this conflict between Protestant and Catholic really was. What did bloody Mary do to deserve this? <br/><br/>After the movie I looked it all up on Wikipedia. Mary was actually married to Philip II of Spain. I had forgotten that fascinating detail. History could easily have gone the other way. This movie did not portray the Spanish in a way that I would consider realistic. I'm sure they were not all crazed religious zealots. No more so than English Protestants like Walsingham.<br/><br/>There was somehow a problem with the plot or writing. The film seemed a little disjointed, jumping from one grand, beautiful, melodramatic scene to the next. I was on the director's side right up until the scene where Elizabeth exhorts her troops on horseback. That went too far. Even Cate Blanchett was unable to pull that one off.<br/><br/>Still I enjoyed the film. It's under-rated on IMDb. I'm not sure why."

Most of the time we are looking at these three characters, instead we could watch strategies, motives and intrigues of Spaniards. Spaniards appear in the movie only a couple of seconds (really only a couple!), paradoxically the story of the film is set in the war between England and Spain. It seems that the director had forgotten that it should not have been a movie about an imaginary love, but about Elizabeth and her most important role in the history of Europe- the war! Similarly seemed the final fight: do not expect any effects, most interesting things about it, you will hear in the “subtitled epilogue”.

","Well, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Queen Elizabeth I, but I don't know so much about history to be able to point the flaws or the rights of the synchronism between movie and real facts.<br/><br/>But after watching and reading some reviews about the movie, seems that Shekhar Kapur flaws with The Golden Age (2007) the same way as he did with Elizabeth (1998). I mean... Shekhar is naturally excessively sensible and poetic with his movies, so all his devotion and all the historical figure that Elizabeth means for him is a lot iconic. So that's the way he portraits Elizabeth in both movies, as some kind of sacred woman guided by God's hands and not just and only a queen. He's not wrong because he, as a director, have all the rights to express all his artistic visions thru his work, but at the same time he exceeded it somehow affecting the final results and all the huge potentials of both movies in its historical meaning. So, both movies turned from historical movies to genre movies with all its romance and divinity icons humanized by Elizabeth.<br/><br/>No words, technically it's an amazing movie. All historical rescues for the art direction are perfect and incredibly detailed by Guy Dyas who is responsible to transform The Golden Age from a low budget movie into a visually blockbuster one. Shekhar Kapur is also an amazing director who usually feed people with amazing and large shots over the huge and mesmerizing locations. As anyone here said before, sometimes we miss seeing more of the Elizabethan age in England than it's shown in the limited sets but all the production was so under limits that all that is shown is respectful.<br/><br/>About the cast, Cate Blanchett is an actress that any comment is dismissed because she's always perfect and only her persona is the necessary to uplift any kind of movie. Shekhar said that The Golden Age would never be produced without Cate, and we can notice why. The strong and tenderness figure that Cate gives to Elizabeth is something that only her could be able to do. But talk about Blanchett's performance is not being fair with all the cast. Samantha Morthon as Mary Stuart is terrific. The moments which Mary Stuart appears are few and short but Samantha Morthon is a so amazing actress that her dazzling presence during the scenes are just a plus for the excellent choice for casting her. I think that all that Samantha represents as an excellent actress can be seen when Mary Stuart is under house arrest, the scene is superb and the camera could capt every single expression on her face, which are splendid.<br/><br/>As I said before, Shekar is a so poetic director that every scene, every camera movement and every effect has a purpose, so, it's a lot recommended for those who watch this movie also check the DVD for the bonus for a better understanding of all the concept of the movie and its director. Maybe The Golden Age cannot be a great historical movie and suffer with some flaws but all the direction, acting and amazing art direction naturally covers everything that seems to fail. And all of that is more than one reason to watch this amazing little piece of art."

","""Elizabeth  the Golden Age"" (2007): I think it's fair to first mention what I said about ""Elizabeth"" (1998): ""I continue to be amazed at the early, huge talent of Blanchett, surrounded by the talents of other actors, set in this world of stone and silk, blood and wine, golden crowns and poisoned gowns. Every time I see this film, I like it more. Perhaps it's not as huge in scope as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but of equal quality when it comes to being a character study. It just doesn't get any better than this. The transformation of a girl into a woman into a reluctant, then resigned, then powerful queen, surrounded by liars, schemers and self-centered fools, is powerful history enough. Add the very best acting, sets, & costumes that feel REAL (not Movie-real), and a point that never veers away from it's goal, and I've got a film I'll see numerous times. Cate Blanchett is the best."" Now: ""Elizabeth  the Golden Age"" is a great followup effort. All I've said about the latter applies to this one, and I add that the shift from the first ""dark"" film to this, a film full of light, is an interesting visual symbol for the changes in England (not to mention the darkening of Spain). This part of the story is ""grander""  bigger  with huge events  less about the growth of Elizabeth, and more about England and its goals. It DOES get personal, but all is repeatedly set aside for the sake of what was seen as British destiny. This would make a wonderful double feature."

","... all greatest actors need trying their chance with Shakespearean roles, and all greatest actresses are fascinated with the role of Elisabeth I. Only that this ambition is sometimes risky: much as I would find Cate Blanched fascinating in the role of young Elisabeth, there is a predecessor that shadows her brilliant performance, and that's Glenda Jackson.Cate's character is too attractive for a queen whose ugliness used to be written of by the chronicles of her time. Besides, Elisabeth the movie does not seem to be based on research: Tudor palaces did not have large stone Gothic chambers, but relatively small wood panelled ones. Watching Elisabeth the movie I had the impression I was rather watching a Niebelungen story. However, taking into account that the focus of the movie limits to Elisabeth's early years on the throne, the dangers she faced, her early relationship with Dudley, and her forays into the marriage game, we could assume that, given a better chance to deepen her character, Cate would have matched Glenda Jackson's performance. Should this movie have a sequel, the audience could see the Queen's development from the young queen depicted in Elizabeth the movie to icon Elizabeth created for herself over time."

","There is quality and excellence wherever you look. It's all here. The acting, the sets, the music, the script, the direction all combine to create an outstanding visual and aural cinematic experience. The costumes are vibrant in colour and rich in texture; perfect down to the smallest detail.<br/><br/>In the first film made 10 years ago, Cate Blanchett played an Elisabeth who transforms from an innocent young girl in love, to a young queen ""married"" to her country. In that film she was good, but in this film she gives a truly remarkable performance. Geoffrey Rush is also retained from the first film as Walsingham, and has now become her cunning, personal counsel who has created the 16th century equivalent of the secret service.<br/><br/>Now Elisabeth is a strong, mature monarch, confident of her abilities after many years on the throne of England. She is still a woman though, despite her being known throughout history as the ""virgin queen"", and the film explores her feminine side, as she falls in love with Sir Francis Drake (Clive Owen) and then her humanity, as she pardons the two people she loves the most after they have deceived her. We are shown her great dignity and strength as she dons full battle armour and rides out with her army to confront the forces of Philip of Spain, as they approach the English shores.<br/><br/>There is a gradual and constant build up of tension leading to the arrival of the Spanish Armada. However, the director has thankfully avoided the temptation to impress with vast, sweeping, battle scenes, as indeed, this is not a film about war or military achievement. It is about a woman; a woman who sacrifices her own happiness for the good of her country, a woman who succeeds in commanding respect in the world of men, and a fearless queen who leads her country from ruin to greatness - into the Golden Age. <br/><br/>Could this also mean a golden statute for Cate Blanchett? I would not be at all surprised to see this film win the 2008 Oscars for best actress and best costumes. <br/><br/>An outstanding film. Don't miss it!"

"bopdog","10","4","14","14 October 2007"," Majestic and splendid! Why the unfair attack by critics? A well-made and GREAT movie!
","Grand movie! First, I am truly and sincerely puzzled by the seeming ""attack"" on this movie by the critics. From what I read, I expected a gaudy, clumsy ""bodice-ripper"" girlie romantic movie type thing. Being a devoted fan of both Cate Blanchett AND Elizabeth I, I went anyway.<br/><br/>How wrong the critics were! This movie succeeds on most levels. It was enthralling, fully entertaining, and engaging every moment. The atmosphere of the authentic palaces and castles gave it a wondrous feel. Granted, the ending had a few cinematic weak points. But bear in mind they were trying to depict a battle that took place over two days, as I recall from school, and hundreds of miles. In real life, the Spanish plan was very complex. But a freak storm drove the Spanish armada off course, and caused a series of cascading coincidences--- Spanish Phillip's navy had planned to join up with Dutch troops and soldiers in France, etc., etc.--- but the wheels came off. And the English DID capitalise on this brilliantly and win the war.<br/><br/>While many forces combined up to make the Catholic Spanish plans go pear-shaped, how could a movie deal with all of that in just 10 minutes or so at the end of the film? The ""literary license"" taken by the director to condense it all into a few dramatic moments is understandable, and forgivable. The SPIRIT of the denouement of Catholic Europe's attempt to topple Elizabeth was spot on. It was, by and large, historically accurate. Although her thrilling speech to the troops at Tilbury, as recorded by history, was not fully given here, and that was a loss. Her real-life remark: ""I have the weak body of a woman, but my father gave me the heart and stomach of a king!"" sent the troops gathered there into a frenzy, making them ready and able to defend England against ANY enemy. But alas, those famous words were missing from this script. Oh well.<br/><br/>I also read criticism that the music was too loud. Frankly, I didn't even notice it, it was perfect ""movie"" music. Also, critics blasted the costumes as being too gorgeous, too elaborate. I am a bloke, and not into women's clothes. But even I was impressed by the costuming--- females and males alike; lead characters and background characters equally apt. What--- were the critics searching THAT hard for something harsh to say? They were way off base on this movie--- ignore them, and go enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>As for the cast and the acting--- again, brilliant. As a self-confessed fan of Cate Blanchett, of course I am biased. But she and Geoffery Rush, both Australians, oddly enough, made a great and believable team. As did fellow Aussie Abby Cornish, who played Elizabeth's best friend, protégé, lady in waiting, or whatever--- and Walter Raleigh's booty call. And, again, not being a girl, I can only guess at the accuracy of the ""girls only"" chit chat and boudoir scenes, but they SEEMED realistic to me. Elizabeth was one of history's greatest leaders. Her successes and political acumen and power went far, far beyond any dosage of mere ""luck."" She was, historically, a true political genius. And I believed the movie when it portrayed her as considering all of England as her children.<br/><br/>I never did understand the full extent of what the heck Rhys Ifans' ""Robert Reston"" was doing--- his plotting and such were clear, but then he simply got arrested and said his purpose was fulfilled, even though his plot to kill Elizabeth failed. Or WAS failure his plot? Or something else? I dunno... I suppose that's a cinematic weakness.<br/><br/>And Clive Owens was mostly great as Mr., then Sir, Walter Raleigh. I liked his roughneck character--- although during the naval battle scene, which he did NOT participate in, he acted a tiny bit like Eerol Flynn in ""Captain Blood."" That was a bit lame, and after he sets his fire ship ablaze, and dives overboard, we magically see him dry and tidy on some other English bloke's warship, unsure how he got there.<br/><br/>But those are mere quibbles. The atmosphere, the majesty of the royal court vibe, the history, even with its abbreviations and dramatisations, and the homage to the real Elizabeth's true greatness make this a splendid effort.<br/><br/>Go with an open mind, ready to forgive a few minor flaws, and be ready to simply BASK in a sumptuous and enthralling drama that really did happen."

","I liked this movie a lot, the photography was excellent, the acting was amazing and the costumes were fabulous. I think it was one of the best films of the year, easily.<br/><br/>However, I had two problems with this movie. First off, the soundtrack was annoying and it tried too hard. I kept thinking, 'are they going to play this the ENTIRE time?' Sometimes silence is the most powerful statement, and a fake epic always needs noise. I did not feel Elizabeth was a fake epic, so the constant background noise was unneeded.<br/><br/>Second, the way they portrayed Elizabeth made her seem not simply mortal, but weak. I thought how she reacted to Mary being killed was beautifully done, but Clive Owen (as amazing to look at as he is) made Elizabeth seem a weak, needy woman. She was powerful, she needed no man, that would have been the statement I would have liked to see. A woman Queen needs a man to kiss her? Hardly."

","How can people say that it is bad? Maybe, just maybe, it is not as good as the first one. But it is still a beautiful masterpiece. <br/><br/>The beauty of Elizabeth: The Golden Age lies in that it mixes simple, boring historical fact with personal things of her life- Her public side and her personal side. Because that's Elizabeth. She was most of all politics, but, once in a while, she had personal problems. But even the boring politics are made wonderful here because of Khapur's masterful camera and cinematographic games as well as great performances. It is all about mise en scene, this film. <br/><br/>The sequel has the same relationship with its predecessor as The Godfather Part II: While the predecessor is about the transformation of the main character, the sequel is about the character's successful attempt to remain that way."

","Sometimes Oscar season can get way too caught up in itself. Too many times you'll head to the cinema only to find that there is nothing but heavy-handed, deep-meaning dramas. Elizabeth: The Golden Age breaks from that with gusto.<br/><br/>It is the story of Elizabeth I as she must fight for her throne as the Spanish try to steal it away from her at all costs. At the same time, Sir Walter Raleigh, a somewhat noble pirate, enters Elizabeth's life and draws her attention away from national affairs... and onto him. An epic story of love and war follows in one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is breathtaking in her portrayal of the Virgin Queen. Every scene, every line, every feeling is done to perfection by this phenomenal actress. She plays Elizabeth with pride, strength... and fear. I'm definitely seeing a Best Actress nomination for this one and probably a win. The other standout is Samantha Morton as Mary Queen of Scots. There is certainly some Oscar potential for her as well. The film looks amazing on screen as well, with gorgeous cinematography and wonderful costumes, all complemented by a grand swelling score.<br/><br/>Some people have said that the plot had not much story to it, but I didn't really see that at all. I was entertained the whole time and there was definitely a plot twist I did not see coming. Granted, some of this I'm sure came from the passion Ms. Blanchett poured into each scene. The pain she's going through inside is completely heartbreaking. The film is at the core a fairy tale on a grand scale, but what a wonderful thing to watch.<br/><br/>Yes, in a time of year when epic tales are not so common to be seen, The Golden Age is a gem. Go and see it on the big screen while you can. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

"MartinHafer","7","1","2","11 December 2013"," A more fact-based follow-up to ""Elizabeth""
","""Elizabeth"" is an enjoyable film, though much of it was supposition and fiction. The intrigues and personal lives of folks of that time are really unknown in many ways and so the filmmakers too liberties with history--embellishing it here and there to make it seem more exciting. Here with the follow-up film, however, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is less about intrigues and persons and more about grand events--and as such is much more factual and better history.<br/><br/>This film has three main plot themes. First is the ultimate execution of Mary Queen of Scots. This is covered superficially--perhaps because the film was about her cousin, Elizabeth. Regardless, what sort of woman she was isn't really alluded to (she was a rather awful person). Second, her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh. Exactly how close it was is open to conjecture, but the film sure got it right that the Queen did not respond well to his secret marriage to another. Third, the climactic battle with the Spanish Armada. This is very grand, though exactly how the Spanish lost and how the weather did far more damage than the English navy isn't really discussed. Of course, me being a retired history teacher, I look for these things and assume the average viewer will not.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at, is a bit sterile when it comes to much of the acting and is engaging--though I assume not to a large percentage of the folks out there. If you like historical bio-pics, you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, you might find it a bit confusing and occasionally ponderous. As for me, I slightly preferred it to the prequel."
"Movie_Reviewer_from_LA","6","1","2","23 January 2011"," Not as Good as the First ""Elizabeth""
","""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up pretty much where 1998's ""Elizabeth"" left off. The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England. On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without. The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth's own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.<br/><br/>Whereas the first ""Elizabeth"" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading). Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time. The scenes depicting this more or less ""platonic"" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly. Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping ""pirate,"" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in ""The Golden Age."" She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen. In an obvious effort to make her more ""identifiable"" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film. This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, ""regular"" commoner. The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham.<br/><br/>Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being. For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative. Lucky for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene (although I do wish that he had toned down the music a scosh).<br/><br/>The first ""Elizabeth"" was a genuinely great film; yet, while this second installment may not be quite as ""golden"" as either its title or its pedigree might suggest, it's still hard to resist the lure of that Elizabethan magic."
"ksundstrom","5","1","2","31 December 2010"," Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age needs a third film
","Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age gets only an average: 5. But the acting gets 8 (9 for Cate Blanchett), the rest only 3. Why only 3? The director Shekar Kapur in his second part of Elizabeth 1 (first part 1998) provides marvelous parts such as Elizabeth's court when receiving the ambassadors and Sir Walter Raleigh, the hectic preparation for defending England against the Spanish Armada 1588 and the dramatic naval battle. But the rest is very much Bollywood stuff, though Shekar Kapur is not an Indian but from Pakistan. Great improvements to England were made under Elizabeth's rule. The incorporation of the East India Company which ruled India until 1857 before the rule was taken over by the English Crown. The modest beginning of stock exchange trading (influence of the Dutch), development of industry (textile, mines and naval construction), better agriculture, the acceptance of the growing role of the middle classes, better conditions for the poor... Secondly, the role of Sir Walter Raleigh does not do justice to his importance. No emphasis on his contributions as scholar, soldier, sailor and statesman, just emphasis in the film on his piracy, colonization of Virginia and his sex appeal. The thoughtful viewer is ignored, just historical froth is served up. Shekar Kapur can do better. Let's hope he can be given the opportunity to rise to the challenge in a third definitive version of Elizabeth 1."
"dromasca","5","1","2","28 May 2009"," no match for the first movie
","Director Shekhar Kapur tries with this sequel to ride on the success of his first 'Elizabeth' movie one decade earlier. However, despite the promising premises of a story of love, war and politics centered around one of the most fascinating characters in the history of England and of the world he largely fails. His rendition of the crucial years of the reign of Elizabeth the time when the English monarch renounces marrying ever, faces internal rebellion from her Catholic subjects, decides to execute Mary Stuart and is caught by the remorse of this deed, lives the impossible passion for the pirate turned politician lord Walter Raleigh, and eventually faces the deadly danger of the invasion of England by the then superpower Spain to prevail in glory and make out of England a great nation tend to be accurate in their historical details but lack the power to create emotion. The counter-performance is even more amazing taking into account that a magnificent team of actors serves the director in this film. Individually the performances of Cate Blanchett, Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush or Samantha Morton are each of them close to the best level we can expect from such fine actors, but they somehow do not link one with the other and fail to interest the viewer on the human plane. The emotional response from viewing this second 'Elizabeth' is similar to the one of seeing a fine documentary or docudrama about that historical period. Too little for such a gathering of talent."

She becomes highly upset when learning one of her court maidens is having his baby. Also, Elizabeth survives an assignation attempt by rival Mary Stuart, whom wants the throne.

","I'm mostly Spanish. To me Queen Elizabeth was not some well-meaning, noble monarch, but a desperate, royal cut-throat willing to send her countrymen out on numerous provocative raids. Every time I hear of a new treatment of the period, I'm always interested to see what the spin is. (In case you don't know, public relations got its real start back in Elizabethan times with the English trashing Spain's Inquisition.) There's no attempt to escape the pirate angle in this movie. What is toyed with is the idea that Elizabeth authorized the raids. And it may be the case that she couldn't control people like Sir Walter Raleigh, but nevertheless she did little to discourage their activity, or to turn away their profits. In this movie the question is made to appear one of the poor English holding off the much more powerful Spanish. Raleigh believes that when he takes from the Spanish, he weakens them and, therefore, protects Protestant England. That's probably an acceptable interpretation of events. You can't go praising theft otherwise.<br/><br/>All that aside, I'm a fan of both Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen. And Geoffrey Rush is near perfect here. And now I can add the director to my list, Shekhar Kapur. I found the pacing, style and script wonderful and unusually entertaining and you'd have to ascribe a great deal of that to Kapur. Among the actors, Cate is especially excellent as she makes Elizabeth someone even I can admire. She really deserved some high praise for her portrayal, easily the best I've ever seen, and there have been quite a few over the years. About the only thing I'd quibble about would be the sets which seemed a little too opulent, having visited the Tower of London. I imagine the real Elizabeth wasn't quite so surrounded in splendor. Still, the art direction is quite effective. This is definitely a fine movie and well worth renting."

"sddavis63","5","1","2","8 March 2008"," Another Romanticized Look At Queen Elizabeth I
","As historical epics go, I have to say frankly that I've seen better movies than this one. Even just on this general subject, one can go back to 1939's ""Elizabeth and Essex"" for a more interesting (if overly romanticized) portrayal of Elizabeth, and 1986's ""Lady Jane"" provided a far more interesting look at behind the scenes action in the Tudor court (admittedly from an earlier era than ""The Golden Age."") ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (with Cate Blanchett in the title role)deals essentially with the events leading up to the eventual defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Like the 1939 movie, this one also is overly romanticized (no one seems able or willing to take a cold, hard look at Queen Elizabeth I), and plays at length on Elizabeth's personal fascination with Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) while at the same time hinting (without any substantive historical foundation that I'm aware of) of an intimate relationship between Elizabeth and her favourite Lady in Waiting Bess (played by Abbie Cornish), who eventually becomes Raleigh's wife.<br/><br/>Blanchett and Cornish were both very good in their roles; Owen not particularly convincing to me as Raleigh. The most interesting part of the movie dealt with Elizabeth's angst over what to do with Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) who is Elizabeth's prisoner, the angst being both personal (the two were related) and diplomatic. The actual confrontation with the Armada is restricted to the last half hour or so, and isn't really all that significant a part of the story (except insofar as the threat of it provides the backdrop to a lot of what happens.) I thought the story often seemed to bog down, which sometimes made it hard to follow, and there was some questionable camera work which also made the movie difficult at times. Some of those technical weaknesses were made up for by magnificent costumes and elaborate sets that did give a ""you are there"" flavour. Still, I thought this at best an average movie. 5/10"

","ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden. Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights. Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.<br/><br/>The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Mollà), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people. The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).<br/><br/>Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with the meager material from the script. She IS a Queen reborn. The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England. This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more. Grady Harp"

This film chronicles the events between Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Raleigh, and the tension between England and Spain.<br/><br/>The fine costumes are extravagant and lavish. Together with the well scouted locations, the film easily takes me back to the times when Queen Elizabeth I lived. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Queen Elizabeth I again. Camera work is good, and most shots are well composed. However, I find the shots that look through architectural features too excessive. There are several scenes which the architectural features take up most of the screen, and we only get a glimpse of what we really need to see. An extreme example is when Queen Elizabeth I kisses the ailing man towards the end of the film, we only get to see the scene through a hole.

","1st watched 12/16/2007, 7 out of 10(Dir-Shekhar Kapur): Well-made chronicle of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I and her struggles against Catholic Spain as well as her innermost struggles of being the ""virgin"" queen. Cate Blanchett once again does a good job of portraying the complexities in this historical character and let's us see what many probably didn't get to see in her day(which of course were her private struggles amplified in this film). The movie is partly about the entrance of Sir Walter Raleigh in her life, played by Clive Owen, who is a swashbuckling handsome type from Spain who comes to get on the Queen's good side and permission for his exploring, but instead tickles her fancy and the Queen would like to have him in other ways. The other part of the story is the conflict between Spain and England and how it got it's start. Sir Walter falls for one of her suitors which causes the queen knipchens and makes her make irrational decisions like denying Walter's exploration and keeping him around as captain of the guard, in hopes that things might happen between them eventually. This is where the story is interesting. The war part, in my opinion, is not done very well and just brings down the movie. Elizabeth is very successful historically in this area, but in the movie she gets help from Sir Walter and her expertise in this area is not expanded or portrayed very well. For the most part, though, this is an entertaining and well executed movie with good acting and interesting conflicts. One suggestion though --- hone up on your history before watching it, as I didn't, and you may understand the movie a little better."

Reading their biographical notes reveals the reasons they stood out. Morton, acting school starting at 13, Houston - Shakespearian training. They shone like gems. I didn't 'get' Clive Owen's portrayal of Sir Walter Raleigh - the words in the script seemed to be right but the passion seemed flat for a swash buckling, opportunist, thief/pirate. The script seemed to position him as more of a wise, guru-type romanticist trying to tread the fine line between lusty and 'lofty'."

","This was an absolutely stunning movie by director Shekhar Kapur, who has a history of doing very-well done films, as few as he has under his belt. The costumes were what held my attention for the most part of movie; they were vivid, vibrant colors indeed fit for a queen. Makeup and hair was extraordinary, especially for the always brilliant Cate Blanchett. She delivers a very powerful depiction of the Virgin Queen, making her appear as a most believable blend of power, vulnerability, and humanity; we see her laughing with her attendants, making jokes at the expense of very powerful world leaders, acting out of passionate rage and jealousy, and being broken under the weight of her own crown. Yet she still managed to pull everything together at the end and continue her reign as Queen of England. <br/><br/>I think there were two parts of the film that were exceptionally powerful to me. The first was when she asked only for a kiss from Sir Walter Raleigh, who could have probably been better played by someone other than Clive Owen. Such a simple action, yet one that held so much meaning to a queen who could not have what she wanted most. The second part was when Elizabeth, in little more than a white nightgown, stands on the cliff overlooking the burning Spanish ships. The clouds part a little behind her as she smiles in relief and triumph as she watches the destruction of Spain as a superpower of the seas and the world. It was a very poignant image for me.<br/><br/>I think that while some things could have been done to make this film better (replace Clive Owen, make it a little longer in order to give the characters enough time to grow believably, give Geoffrey Rush more screen time as his character was indeed important to Elizabeth's saga, develop Mary Stuart's story a little more), it was a well-done piece of cinema that deserves recognition. It is very rare that we are bestowed with a historical film as engrossing and beautiful as this. I hope we get to see more like this for other historical figures sometime in the near-future."

He betrayed the Catholic Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, precisely so he could have an excuse to attack. Certainly, he would have allied with Mary against Elizabeth and perhaps then married off his daughter to Mary's son or another heir to the throne, but it seems to me that Philip cared little for Mary or even the Pope, only for his own dynasty.<br/><br/>If there is a Tudor expert in the house who would care to comment, I would love to read what you have to say."
"fwomp","8","1","3","9 February 2008"," A Grand Costume Drama About One Helluva Queen
","ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, THE GOOD German). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation  England  from the 1998 film, ELIZABETH.<br/><br/>With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.<br/><br/>The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, ""Bess"" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, SHOOT 'EM UP).<br/><br/>Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).<br/><br/>The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.<br/><br/>Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.<br/><br/>This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, ""Yeah. Seen it. Been there."""
"MaxBorg89","7","1","3","14 January 2008"," Occasionally uneven in pace and seriousness, but interesting and effortlessly carried by Blanchett
","Horror, fantasy and comic-book films tend to have sequels even if the original was bad, as long as box office results were relatively positive. But biopics? Who would actually green-light a second installment of someone's cinematic biography? Even Cate Blanchett was unsure whether to play Queen Elizabeth I again, despite the Oscar nomination she received for the first movie. It took some persuading from director Skekhar Kapur and co-star Geoffrey Rush (the only other returning cast member from the original film) to get her back on board, and even though Elizabeth: The Golden Age isn't nearly as good as the previous chapter, Blanchett confirms she is one of the best actresses ever.<br/><br/>Ending the first picture with Elizabeth fully embracing her responsibilities as sovereign of England, The Golden Age shows her struggles to maintain her authority. That isn't easy, as dangers are hidden everywhere: though locked up, the Queen's villainous cousin Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) keeps plotting to claim what she believes to be rightfully hers, and to achieve that she seeks the help of King Philip II of Spain, an overly devout Catholic who sees it as his mission to rid the world of a Protestant ""traitor"" like Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Things don't fare much better at court either, for the monarch, still unwilling to get married, may have met a man capable of stirring conflicting emotions in her, emotions she deemed lost after her disappointment with the Earl of Leicester in the previous installment. This man is Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a brave and sufficiently cocky ""pirate"" who has brought a lot of trouble to Spain's ships. As he troubles Elizabeth too, she leaves him in the hand of her most trusted maid (Abbie Cornish), inadvertently setting in motion a chain of events that could cause a quite unexpected reaction on her behalf: jealousy.<br/><br/>Much like he did back in 1998, Kapur delivers a visually perfect feature, with sets and costumes that render the period while keeping the movie from feeling old-fashioned. He also employs the same narrative technique as he did last time, intertwining conspiracy thriller and romantic tragedy, with the addition of a little action in the third act, which sees the British fleet face the Spanish Armada in one of the most riveting naval battles to have been put on screen (it even manages to make Pirates of the Caribbean look lacking in explosions). What precedes that epic showdown, however, is at times frustratingly uneven: certain scenes succumb to a bout of slowness, and certain dialogue exchanges between Blanchett and Owen (appropriately charismatic and ""rude"" as the Errol Flynn-like Raleigh) are corny to say the least. But overall the suspense is rather consistent, and the dangerous love triangle at the second act's center manages to get more dramatic as time goes by.<br/><br/>All of that, though, is unimportant in assuring the film is watchable. The first Elizabeth's saving grace was the actress playing the main part, and the same happens in this sequel: the mere look on Blanchett's face as she stares at a potential assassin should be enough to give her the Oscar she didn't get in 1999, such powerful is the sense of authority, control and restrained rage she conveys in the continuation of what will remain her crowning achievement (pun not intended). Only Morton, using her three or four scenes to perfection, comes close to stealing the limelight from the protagonist, with a wounded, compelling depiction of dignified defeat.<br/><br/>At this point, the only question left is: do we need a third film? Not really, although Kapur intends to make a final installment about Elizabeth's last years. Do we want one? Well, yes, but only if Blanchett accepts to reprise the role. Oh, and returning to the qualitative heights of the original movie wouldn't hurt either.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","22 December 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Elizabeth: The Golden Age
","Cate Blanchett reprises her role as 16th Century Virgin Queen Elizabeth I in director Shekhar Kapur's sequel of sorts to Elizabeth (1998), which I can't recall if it made it to the local screens. However the DVD of Elizabeth was recently released on DVD here, but you need not have watched that movie because the events that transpire here are after the fact of her ascension to the Throne of England, and you need not be a history buff in order to get up to speed on the events that led up to the opening of the movie. Of course it does help a bit, so if you're choosing not to approach this blind, then you can pop over to Wikipedia for a quick synopsis.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the threat of war with Spain looming on the horizon. Spanish King Philip II (Jordi MOlla), a devout Catholic, wants to wage holy war against England, of course to expand his empire, but under the guise of Relgion, since Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is a Protestant. And to do so requires a reason to send his Armada across the English Channel, which involves making calculated political steps, counting upon those who are Catholics, and to throw his weight behind the supposed Queen in exile / imprisonment Mary of Scots (played by Samantha Morton) - here's where you'll probably need some background information to understand the intricacies of the English Mornarchy, in no part made even more complicated since Henry VIII was ruler before his, giving the family tree a healthy boost in the number of branches.<br/><br/>The focus however, is still set on Elizabeth, as she goes about trying to deflect questions about her fertility, virginity, and singlehood (there's actually a good reason to why she stays single, not that she's unattractive, or have a lack of suitors). It's like a tale of two halves, where the beginning involves dalliances with her lack of love life, setting the stage for a triangle between herself, her favourite hand maiden Elizabeth Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish, whom the gossip mags credited for coming in between Ryan Phillipe and Resse Witherspoon), and suave pirate Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), who charms them with his tales of the high seas and the finding of the new world. Later to be Sir Walter Raleigh, his initial audience with the Queen was for funding his exploits, but later with Cupid's arrow, it becomes pretty much muddled with affairs of the heart, as we learn of the social impossibility between the Queen and the pirate, and the countless protocols that come with privileged women.<br/><br/>Those who were expecting spectacular battle scenes, especially when the trailers have Elizabeth in full armour, rousing her troops, will be sorely disappointed, because history had already decided the outcome of the battle. Moreover, as far as naval warfare go involving ships with sails, Pirates of the Caribbean had already laid down the gauntlet as far as spectacular is concerned, and that unfortunately, had elements of the supernatural and the fantastical in its aid.<br/><br/>But for a period piece, with foundation laid in history, coupled with a dash of artistic and dramatic licensing, Elizabeth: The Golden Age does serve up copious amounts of excellent acting, courtesy of Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush reprising her role as trusted adviser Sir Francis Walsingham and Owen, that it still makes it compelling to witness historical events put up on screen (of course with accuracy never being 100% anyway). Historical biographies more often than not have dramatic moments included to spice up proceedings, but this one had enough political intrigue and scheming draped with beautiful costumes to keep you engaged. Time to pick up the prequel!"
"JamesHitchcock","7","1","3","19 November 2007"," History Is What You Can Remember
","The original ""Elizabeth"" from 1998 told the story of the first fifteen years or so of Elizabeth's reign and of her progress from a frightened young princess to the ""Virgin Queen"". ""The Golden Age"" moves the story on to the 1580s. Despite her success in dealing with domestic opposition, Elizabeth is still not completely secure on her throne. English Catholics dispute both her legitimacy and her right to rule, and many regard Mary Queen of Scots as their rightful sovereign. King Philip of Spain, Elizabeth's former brother-in-law, threatens to invade.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett returns as Elizabeth, as does Geoffrey Rush as her Machiavellian counsellor Sir Francis Walsingham. The most important new character is Sir Walter Raleigh, portrayed here as the new great love of the Queen's life, and also as the mastermind of the defeat of the Armada. The film deals with the supposed love-triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh and her maid-of-honour Bess Throckmorton, which also formed the basis for the 1955 film ""The Virgin Queen"".<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, the film takes liberties with history. Although it takes place in the years 1585 to 1588, King Eric XIV of Sweden is shown as one of the suitors for Elizabeth's hand in marriage. He was in fact deposed in 1568 and died in 1577. Raleigh did not marry Bess until 1591, three years after the events shown in the film. He does not appear to have played any part in the defeat of the Armada; the real heroes of that engagement were Lord Howard of Effingham and Sir Francis Drake. The film also takes liberties with geography. In real life Elizabeth's speech to her troops was made at Tilbury, a town in the low-lying Essex marshes, but here it takes place on high chalk cliff-tops. We see the Queen sail past the New Building and Bridge of Sighs at St John's College, Cambridge, although these buildings were not built until the nineteenth century. Mary Queen of Scots was not imprisoned in a castle on an island in a Scottish loch (she was, of course, in exile from Scotland) but in one on the flat plain of the English Midlands. The real Fotheringhay Castle could not have been used for the film (it was demolished in 1627), but no doubt a closer equivalent could have been found.<br/><br/>The film, however, is not overly concerned with historical accuracy. Like the earlier film, it is a stylised pageant very different in style to the traditional English costume drama such as ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" or ""Mary Queen of Scots"". These differences may reflect the fact that the director, Shekhar Kapur, is originally from India and has worked in the Indian cinema both as actor and director. Although it was made by a foreign-born director, the film is quite unashamedly patriotic (and therefore something of a rarity in the modern British cinema). As in the first film, cathedral interiors (Wells, Winchester and Ely) are used to represent Tudor castles and palaces. The idea is to present not so much a biography of Elizabeth the real woman as one of Elizabeth the myth, the iconic ""Virgin Queen"" who plays such an central role in England's National Legend. (Each country has its own National Legend- a selection of stories from its past which define its idea of itself and its place in the world).<br/><br/>""The Golden Age"" has been accused of anti-Catholicism, a criticism which in my view seems unwarranted, although it has given rise to a good deal of debate on this page. (One thread on the message board, in particular, displays remarkable amounts of bigotry on both sides). Although the film undoubtedly portrays the events of the 1580s from the English perspective, and therefore shows Philip II as the villainous aggressor, the Catholic Church of today is a very different institution from the one which existed 400 years ago. Criticism of the sixteenth century Church, therefore, should not be seen as reflecting badly on the modern Church, any more than war films which portray the Nazis as villains should be seen as anti-German or as attacks on the democratic Germany of today.<br/><br/>The stylised, symbolic nature of the film becomes particularly clear when Cate Blanchett (as good here as she was in the original film) is addressing her troops. At 38, Blanchett is much younger than the historical Elizabeth was during this period (she was 55 at the time of the Armada). For most of the time, this discrepancy is hidden by the use of make-up, but in this scene Blanchett appears, not as a middle-aged lady who hid her greying hair beneath a wig, but as a beautiful young warrior-maiden in armour, her long red hair flying in the wind behind her. The cliffs used were actually in Somerset, but they are doubtless intended to represent the White Cliffs of Dover, a powerful symbol in English history and folklore. This scene has little to do with historical reality, but it is one of the most memorable images in the film. This is the sort of folk-history which remains in the mind long after the schoolroom version has been forgotten. And, as Messrs Sellar and Yeatman reminded us in ""1066 and All That"", history is what you can remember. 7/10"
"jromano91","10","1","3","5 November 2007"," Striking
","This movie was one of the best historical movies I've seen. It changed my view of the Queen Elizabeth of England. Although this movie is not exactly historically accurate, they made the war with Spain amazing, absolutely striking. Cate Blanchett does an amazing job as the queen for she is powerful, forceful, amazing, and weak at times when necessary.<br/><br/>Although the camera angles are OK, the movie has some blurred and then focus effect that does not add into the overall appeal of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, the best scenery, I'd say is when Queen Elizabeth places the ring back on her finger and walks out the camp, barefoot and climbs up to the edge of a cliff and watches the whole Spanish Armada sink and burn and it shows a scene that kind of looks like a scene from Pride and Prejudice with Keira K.<br/><br/>Although, there were some unnecessary blood and violence in this movie, the overall effect was great. However, I'm a little disappointed in how they conveyed the virgin queen. They focused so much on her faults and her weaknesses rather than her strong points and did not show how Philip of Spain at first wanted to be with the Virgin Queen and after she denied him, went to Mary Stuart of Scots."

","I thought this had all of the components of an excellent movie...good actors, great sets, exciting plots, the costumes were excellent.

What ever happened to editing? The lack of it ruined this movie for me!!!!!! The synopsis at the end of the movie telling about the consequences of the loss of the Spanish Armada doesn't even appear on the screen, you can tell it's supposed to be there, you can see the top of the letters......weird.

If I want a history lesson, I know where to find one. I watch movies to escape, dream, be inspired, even. Yes, we all know these stories, and we all recognize the liberties taken. Shakespeare emphasized the human element against history routinely and I don't think he worried about accuracy, so who can argue w/that?"
"brassneck-1","7","1","4","2 December 2007"," Another Re-write of History?
","This film is enjoyable, even though, for me, its re-writing and omission of important historical incidents does detract somewhat from the whole in a way that ""Elizabeth"" did not. One can't help feeling that this has been done to aid its appreciation in the States by making the otherwise quite complex historical context easier to digest (that's not intended as a suggestion of a lack of intellect in the US but the inevitably far less detailed knowledge of English history on the part of the vast bulk of the cinema-going public there).<br/><br/>Where, for example, is the Tilbury speech? And poor old Sir Francis Drake seems to have been airbrushed entirely in favour of the seemingly newly crowned hero of the defeat of the Armada - Sir Walter Raleigh! Blanchett shines again, continuing her pleasingly singular though, at times, slightly annoying Galadrielesque portrayal of Elizabeth - who was, after all, one of England's most singular monarchs. Clive Owen, however, comes across as being slightly lightweight with a mid-Atlantic accent that distracts from what is a pretty universal ""Anglish"" backdrop.<br/><br/>Tom Hollander also stands out as Sir Amyas Paulet - Mary Queen of Scots gaoler - with only vague hints of his previous role as Lord Cutler Becket."
"didi-5","7","1","4","8 November 2007"," bit of a mixed bag but visually impressive
","The long-awaited sequel to 1998's 'Elizabeth', and using some of the same cast (notably Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I and Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham), this film scores on visual splendour but fails to engage in its battle scenes.<br/><br/>As Sir Walter Raleigh in an upgraded part that doesn't pay much attention to history, Clive Owen is OK but nothing spectacular. If anything his characterisation is overwritten for such a dull person. Smaller parts fare better in a muddled story which involves court intrigues, Mary Queen of Scots (played quietly and with dignity by Samantha Morton), Catholics, burning ships, and the Spanish Inquisition.<br/><br/>Kapur's direction does not fail in the scenes of regal spectacle - the Queen is never anything other than stunning - or in the more intimate and thoughtful scenes - but something is missing, and the gung ho pirate-like Armada adventuring is a bit of a misfire.<br/><br/>A worthy sequel, but not as good as you might think, and not as good as the first 'Elizabeth'. It will probably repay a few viewings to make sense of the complicated plot."

"pdmb","6","1","5","26 October 2007"," Great to look at but lacking any kind of plot
","I saw this on 25th October in Norwich, complete with Q&A session with Geoffrey Rush and Shekhar Kapur. Overall, an impressive piece of film-making but with some major minuses. Given that the director has taken a liberal view of history, there is no need to pull him on up on several areas of blatant historical and Geographical inaccuracies, such as Elizabeth's speech at Tilbury, Mary Stuart's accent and Northamptonshire suddenly sprouting mountains. This is a reasonable adaptation strategy - take the main dramatic points of the film and fill in the rest with the spirit of the story you want to tell, even if it is inaccurate. <br/><br/>PLUSSES- The cinematography is excellent. The costumes are also amazing (even if not historically accurate as blue wasn't a colour known to Elizabethan England, but tish and pish).<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is superb, again. Sam Morton is very touching as Mary Stuart and Geoffrey Rush is what he always is - excellent.<br/><br/>MINUSES- Clive Owen - Oh Dear!!! Granted, he looks the part but the boy reads his lines like it's read through and not a terribly important one either. He CANNOT ACT!!! What accent was he supposed to have?<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is criminally underused. His character, Walsingham, was a mainstay of the first film and yet is so peripheral in this, even when he is the supporting actor.<br/><br/>The plot. Very loose. The plot is simply how the Queen learns to cope with becoming divine rather than human, and how Spain plots to invade England. The first half an hour is very flabby and the dialogue a touch *too* over-dramatic in places.<br/><br/>Some people have accused it of being anti-catholic. Bullsh*t! It is about Catholicism versus Protestantism; that's what the history is about. That is why Spain wanted to invade. But it is also about tolerance over dogmatism. Elizabeth rejects punishing the Catholics in her land when she has the chance to do so. This is a parable of the dangers of religious extremism and is not picking on Catholics unfairly. Put it into today's context and it makes an important point.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall, an enjoyable film but Owen's performance is so bad as to detract from the good things in it. Beautiful to look at but a bit of a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Kapur said he would like to make a film about Elizabeth's last few days on earth, so watch this space."

"phantomtristan","8","1","5","18 October 2007"," Elizabeth: The Golden Age
","Almost a decade later, director Shekhar Kapur follows up his critically acclaimed Elizabeth with Elizabeth: The Golden Age which includes the ethereal Cate Blanchett reprising her role as the famous regent.<br/><br/>Now firmly settled into her throne, this second film follows Elizabeth facing the crisis of the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. In addition to this she also has to deal with an internal crisis as she starts having great affection for Sir Walter Raleigh (played by Clive Owen)Â—a pirate staying at the court. She obviously is unable to marry him being that she is the Queen, and a queen who has already refused many offers of princes from all of Europe.<br/><br/>This is a glorious, sumptuous epic with award-caliber production. The cinematography is some of the best I have seen since Titanic, and the sets and costumes are magnificent. The sweeping score blends all the scenes together perfectly. Cate Blanchett's performance stands out from the star-studded cast as she reprises her role with a ferocious intensity.<br/><br/>I have only one complaint with the film. It is the fact that the director changed Elizabeth's character into a woman publicly longing and pursuing a man in ways that reminded me of a giddy love-struck teenage girl with their first crush. It seemed out of character for a regally mature, sophisticated queen who should already have experienced such things and outwardly have moved on. This film is quite different in tone as the other one. It is much tamer (garnering a PG-13 rating compared to the R rating of the other one) and more entertaining with the love story and the climatic battle at the end. Even with the change and the rather major complaint the film manages to be a stunningly produced, acted, and compellingly wrought epic piece of cinema. It makes me hope Kapur will make the third of his planned Elizabethan trilogy."

","So I'm a huge history buff and when the first ""Elizabeth"" was released with Cate Blanchett, I was extremely excited. I was, however, very disappointed. The movie didn't really get into detail at all. She becomes queen, says "" I am my father's daughter"", and it's over. I wanted to see more of what went on during her reign. At the time, of course, I didn't think they would be a part 2. I liked ""The Golden Age"" but didn't love it. It was what I expected tho, not too much detail, just the basics. Cate Blanchett does a wonderful job in portraying Queen Elizabeth. I'm not a huge fan of Clive Owen though so that may have added to me thinking it was just OK. To sum it up, this was a good film, but for anyone who is really into learning about the life of the Virgin Queen,""Elizabeth"" with Helen Mirren is EXCELLENT! It's four hours or so long, but totally worth the time spent watching it. You learn a lot about Elizabeth and the inner struggles she faced as a female on the throne in 16th century England."

Melodramatic and a bit soap-opera-ish at times, but Blanchett gives a powerful performance once again. The cinematography is beautiful as well. I was disappointed, however, that not all of the famous ""heart of a king"" speech was used. In fact those very famous lines were left out ! I would love to know why... Plus, all the palace interiors were a bit too obviously shot in cathedrals. But oh happy day, there was NOT a scene of Elizabeth meeting Mary Queen of Scots! I am so tired of that particular inaccuracy being done by Hollywood. Now I am going to read up more on the Spanish Armada and probably be aghast at all the inaccuracies in the movie that I had overlooked!

"Buddy-51","7","1","10","13 October 2007"," somewhat better than advertised
","""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up pretty much where 1998's ""Elizabeth"" left off. The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England. On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without. The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth's own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.<br/><br/>Whereas the first ""Elizabeth"" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading). Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time. The scenes depicting this more or less ""platonic"" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly. Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping ""pirate,"" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in ""The Golden Age."" She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen. In an obvious effort to make her more ""identifiable"" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film. This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, ""regular"" commoner. The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham.<br/><br/>Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being. For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative. Luckily for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene. (I do wish, however, that he had toned down the music a scosh.)<br/><br/>There's no question that the first ""Elizabeth"" was a genuinely great film. Yet, while this second installment may not be quite as ""golden"" as either its title or its pedigree might lead one to believe, it's still hard to resist the lure of that olde Elizabethan magic."

","The film received mostly negative reviews when it came out, and still has to this day. To my surprise, it's adequate, although fairly average, and not that far below the quality of the original. It benefits from having a more structured plot, and the storyline is more about rising action and a climax (unlike the first). Blanchett is also quite impressive and I actually expected to think she was over the top (like I feel she sometimes is) but I think she plays it brilliantly, certainly not a nomination or performance I dismiss. Overall, it's definitely not nearly as bad as reviews would make me believe and once again the best thing about it is Blanchett."
"Tcarts76","9","0","1","22 September 2012"," The way a biopic should be done
","This movie gets a 9 from me, and is a great example of how a Biopic should be done. Usually when you watch a biopic the producers and directors go in either one direction or another based on personal beliefs. They tend to either show somebody in a very negative or positive way regardless of any facts. This one showed an emotional sometimes irrational Queen in a humanistic light that was very refreshing. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett was amazing in the role of Queen Elizabeth. At times in the movie the viewer can't help but hate her, and at other times one can see the burdens that lay upon the Monarch and feels some compassion. Blanchett shows great skill in bringing this historic character to life in a very complex and extremely humanizing way. Never does one really grow to love the character but at the sametime you have to admire her. This surely was no puff piece (Kristen Dunst as Marie Antoinette anyone?) but it wasn't a negative one either.<br/><br/>The only downside I saw was 2 fold. One Sir Walter Raleigh's relationship to the Queen. There was in fact rumors of a romantic relationship, but nothing substantiated as proof in history, and he wasn't a big hero against the Spanish Armada as portrayed. Second, I am kind of disappointed that the movie didn't mention more about her father. True, she probably had little love for the man, but I think he would have been a great topic since his split with the Catholic church brought about a lot of the turmoil Elizabeth had to face.<br/><br/>All in all, This was a great movie, with great acting, sets, costumes, and pretty much many details. If you like period pieces and history definitely watch this one."

I LOVE the first installment and will often watch it whenever it's on (""I am no man's Elizabeth!""), but the same is not true with this film.<br/><br/>There's too much going on and there wasn't a clear focus. The objective of Elizabeth (film) was to depict her ascension whereas this one left me confused. Was it the Spanish Armada? Was it her finding a suitor? Was it the betrayal of Bess and Walter? Was it her feud with Mary, Queen of Scots? <br/><br/>There were so many people involved I devoted more time to researching the cast of characters in Wikipedia. The bottom line is this: if you want to watch Cate Blanchett wear some wicked cool costumes then this movie is for you. If that doesn't interest you, skip this and either watch Elizabeth (film) or some other showcase of the British monarchy like The Young Victoria or Elizabeth I."

","I saw this for the first time last Saturday night and whilst it has a 'top' Hollywood cast list I find once again that it another English historical take 'Americanized'! Not only do they change the plot to suit themselves at convenient moments, the get the facts wrong as well. The biggest gripe I have is about Mary, Queen of Scotts who having been brought up in France at the french court from a young age spoke with a french accent not a Scottish one as depicted in the film.(something like Russell Crowe in Robin Hood who spoke with an Irish accent) This irritated me no end. This may seem like a petty gripe, and it is I agree but I just feel if they are going to spend all that money making some thing so historical, then at least get it right!There are of course plenty of other inaccuracies which have been mentioned in previous reviews so I will not mention them again. I liked Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth, she brought a show of strength to the part which of course is what Elizabeth was famous for but her pronunciation of Raleigh's surname was another irritation.It's not Ray..leigh it's Rall..eigh! Drake was more instrumental in the defeat of the Armada having let the fleet enter the channel and then opening fire. The English fleet were smaller and able to turn around better in the channel and were at no time being demolished by the Spanish.The English only lost 8 men in the entire battle whist the Spanish lost almost the entire fleet. Bad weather certainly did not help the Armada but credit must most certainly be given to the English and not the Spanish. I suggest a good read of David Starkey's Monarchy books which covers all aspects of each and every one of our rulers through the ages with an honest appraisal of each one, then the Americans may just get it right!"

","Not since ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" has our greatest monarch been so ill - served.""Elizabeth:The Golden Age"" is dumbed down tosh that would have been kicked out of an ""Eastenders"" story conference.It patronises its audience that clearly is supposed not to be able to accept or even understand that 21st century values and conventions did not apply in Tudor times.Women were considered mainly as objects for male pleasure and their main use was to continue a bloodline.This applied even to Queens.Hence the concern over Elizabeth's childless state.The only way she could keep the throne was to behave in a manner so ruthless it would have made her late father blanch. She may have had lovers but they were strictly for political gain or to perform a purely sexual function.She was never to display weakness or vulnerability. I find her physical contact with Bess Throckmorton to be highly fanciful but it might please a modern audience looking for some girl - on - girl action. Mr C.Owen plays Raleigh as a second - rate Errol Flynn,defying his Queen with flashing eyes and sparkling teeth. Miss Blanchett has certainly mastered the English accent but she poses rather than acts and barely seems in control of her horse during her battle speech. Mr G.Rush seems to have decided to play Walsingham as if he was in a state of acute sleep - deprivation.Elizabeth would have had him for breakfast. The interwoven plot about Mary,Queen of Scots,seems to have atrophied on the vine,so to speak.Only on the morning of her cousin's execution does Elizabeth seem to have given the matter much consideration. Still,it's not easy being Queen............. I wondered,as the film came to a close,what it was actually supposed to have been about.The Spanish Armada?The growing pains of the Anglican church?The end of the Spanish Empire?The love affair between Raleigh and Bess Throckmorton?The conceit that anyone can fall in lurve even the Virgin Queen?All of the above?

","A movie anchored (sorry) by a superb performance from Cate Blanchett; by turns commanding, vulnerable and often world-wearied, together with fine support from a generally excellent cast (particularly Geoffrey Rush). However these are pretty much the only redeeming features of this rather ham-fistedly structured movie<br/><br/>There is no insight given into the political drama which forms the backdrop to the story, so instead the director resorts to parading A- Team style baddies. All the Spanish dress in black, and grin a lot while feeding ""evil-plan exposition 101"" to the audience. The middle act mixes in a few perfunctory classroom history highlights (Raleigh presenting tobacco to the royal court a typical example) presumably to try to add a veneer of authenticity quite at odds with the silliness on show, before the whole movie then lurches uncomfortably into a lacklustre and directionless battle filmed in such a stylized manner as to appear to have been lifted from Lord of the Rings effects sequence outtakes. Clive Owen in particular looks most uncomfortable at having to drop in a last minute bit of swash & buckle on board an utterly fake looking studio set galleon. Even Gena Davis put more back into it than that!"
"MBunge","4","0","1","26 November 2010"," Another big budget sequel that falls short of the original
","This movie demonstrates the same thing winning the lottery sometimes does - you can't give some people money.<br/><br/>This is the hugely disappointing sequel to the outstanding ""Elizabeth"", which was largely the film that launched the American career of Cate Blanchett. Here she returns to the role of Queen Elizabeth I. It is 1585 and England finds itself under the threat of Spain, whose king (Jordi Molla) is a Catholic religious fanatic waiting only for an excuse to topple the Protestant Elizabeth from her throne. As the Queen's right hand man, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), defends Elizabeth from plots at home and tries to find a politically advantageous husband for her and her country, Elizabeth's fancy settles on a privateer and explorer named Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen). Eventually a scheme involving Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) and Walsingham's own brother gives the Spanish king a justification for war and the Spanish Armada, the greatest fleet in human history, sets sail to conquer England in the name of God. Unless you're intellectually allergic to the subject of history, you probably know how that turned out.<br/><br/>This isn't really that bad a movie. It's only mediocre or a bit worse. When judged against the quality of the first film, however, it is one of the worst sequels ever. We're talking Godfather III territory. ""Elizabeth"" was a low budget film that took the idea of the historical epic and turned it on its head. It took one of the most important moments in British history, the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne, and made those important events merely the setting for a deeply personal tale of a young woman in a dangerous and conflicting circumstance. All the other elements of the story, political, religious and cultural were secondary to human joy, ambition and anguish of the woman who would become one of the greatest rulers in world history.<br/><br/>""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" had a big budget, bigger stars and arguably focuses on an even more dramatic moment in the Queen's reign. But while the first movie subverted the concept of the historical epic, this movie fully embraces it. This is not the story of a woman, it's the story of a kingdom. And while Elizabeth may be the most significant character in the story, she isn't the most important. This story is really about the efforts of Francis Walsingham to defend his sovereign with deceit and strength. And it's about Charles Howard and Francis Drake, who actually led the British to victory over Spain's massive assembly of ships. Those men's actions may be in service to Elizabeth, but she's not directly involved in what they do.<br/><br/>The movie tries on occasion to go back to what the first film did and let us see the pressures and inner pain of Elizabeth, but it never quite figures out what to do with her. The Queen is mostly a bystander for these events of history and for what is going on in this movie. Even in the love triangle of Elizabeth, Raleigh and the Queen's handmaiden Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), Blanchett has nothing to actually do but fuss and fume. Yet the attention of the story is so completely fixed on Elizabeth, that none of the other characters get the chance to live and breathe on screen.<br/><br/>""Elizabeth"" gave us a new and compelling look at the legendary monarch. ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" tells the same sort of story about her that every other historical epic tells about every famous ruler. If you've never seen the first film, you may find this one passable. But if you haven't seen the first film, definitely rent it instead of this."

","Back when I saw the first ""Elizabeth"", I found it OK if not a masterpiece; my friend and I discussed a joke version (the credits would feature Jackie Chan). ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" focuses specifically on the period when England went to war against Spain. The movie switches back and forth between Queen Elizabeth I's (Cate Blanchett) private and public lives (wondering about her role in the world vs. looking the imperious grand dame).<br/><br/>Having not lived during the era portrayed, I can't verify the authenticity of anything in the movie. But overall, I thought that they did a worthwhile job looking at this particular time during Elizabeth's life (sort of like ""The Queen"" did looking at Elizabeth II). If there was anything that they didn't show that I would have liked to see, it was William Shakespeare (although he got famous after this period, so he probably wasn't important).

","I have not seen the first part of Elizabeth, but was interested to see this one. I read the reviews on IMDb and they were on such extremes  from love it to hate it; very rarely something in between.<br/><br/>The story is about Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) the queen of Britain in sixteenth century. There is religious war between Catholic and Protestants. Spain (a catholic country) wants to attach Britain (a Protestant country) with the help of France, overturn Elizabeth's rule and install a Catholic queen Mary Stuart (Samanthan Morton). In the meantime, Princes from various countries come with marriage proposals to the virgin queen. The queen gets attracted to Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who robs Spanish ships, but he marries the queens' closest maid. In turn of events Mary Stuart is beheaded for planning to murder Elizabeth. Spain and France ships attach Britain. With the help of Elizabeth, minister Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffery Rush) and Sir Walter Raleigh Britain's army defend the borders.<br/><br/>The movie starts with highlighting the core subject and like Bollywood movies dwells in comedy and romance in the first half, and emotions and drama in the second half ultimately ending with a fight sequence. A typical masala fair by Indian Director Shekar Kapoor (whose name remains hidden from all promotional and marketing materials of this movie  a case of discrimination? I don't know!) Cate Blanchett has given a tremendous performance with the range of emotions that she exhibits. As a general rule, public and political figures normally carry an expression-less face so not to convey their thoughts to anyone. But this queen Elizabeth was overly expressionist. For me sadly it looked more melodramatic than it usually should be.<br/><br/>People who do not know details of history  would find this movie an entertaining, because it tries to present the historical plot in commercially viable manner. Otherwise, the movie and the behavior of characters may look stupid to say the least.<br/><br/>Geoffery Rush is worth mentioning for his loyal characterization and immense acting skills. Clive Owen looks fabulous and acts well too! Both the writers of the film, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst  picked up from TV careers and given opportunity to work in a major international flick, try their best to fit a historical plot in a Bollywood story format.<br/><br/>The photography and costume are very good. The sets authentic. Surely contender for nominations in various categories.<br/><br/>If you close your eyes to minute readings of history, you can just sit back and enjoy this masala fair!

The battle scenes at the end of the movie also seemed lacking too.

For me this film worked out very well. Cate Blanchett plays an excellent role as Queen Elizabeth and thereby carries the title role with verve. Clive Owen fits well as the more or less pirating adventurer that aids her in her life in many ways. All other actors revolve around them and each other in matching style. Added to that the events that keep the pace of the film going, a great musical score and a complete lack of unnecessary additions.

To me Elizabeth was done justice and I felt that the ending was fine and summed up the movie well. As for the plot being flimsy there is no way of that. It was as strong as the first Elizabeth maybe even stronger when you think of it. Finally Geoffrey Rush is the last person to be called under used. From my point of view he was nearly used to much with his emotions flying everywhere in some places. The one person who was under used was Samantha Morton as Mary, Queen of Scots but no offence to her but she just wasn't pretty enough for the role. Apart from those small hiccups I could easily recommend this film for one sole reason. Cate Blanchett! She was absolutely brilliant. At least all the critics agreed on that.

The plot veers all over, with little organisation or synthesis. Characters come and go with little concern for story exposition or viewer comprehension. This Raleigh is certainly not the man I think of, and if the movie will show scant regard for true history (Mary Queen of Scots would have spoken with a French accent), then why would they not give Elizabeth the rousing words later writers gave her about having the body of a weak woman but the heart of a king - ""and a King of England""? Many of the scenes are completely over the top (especially during the turning point of the Armada battle with Philip reduced to obvious symbolism and Elizabeth standing around alone doing nothing but having the wind in the castle blow her clothes majestically)which are ultimately empty and do little to compensate for the emptiness throughout. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com"

The film is a visual delight, and the performances of the cast are first rate,esp. by Cate Blanchett, who has once again played the lead role with almost perfection.In my opinion, hers is an Oscar-worthy performance, and I'm pretty certain that she will at least get a nomination for the Best Actress category, even if not win it (that depends on the relative performances of the other four nominees in the category as well !). Cate Blanchett has truly brought out the majesty of Elizabeth, the individual and the undoubtedly great queen that she was.<br/><br/>Kudos also to Shekhar Kapur (the director) and the twin writers who have done a great job.However, Shekhar should have been more circumspect and accurate in portraying the battle with the Spanish Armada (which in reality never occurred !). He too stands a pretty good chance in the Best Director category at the Oscar next year (in 2008).<br/><br/>Finally, supporting actor Abbie Cornish (who played the role of Bess, Elizabeth's main lady-in-waiting) is a great looker, and the film is worth watching for her alone !

","Although I enjoyed this film which is based more on actual history rather than the hallucinations of the Hollywood scriptwriter, I felt it's one flaw was editing: there were several scenes in which I could not determine who was in the scene, who they were, and what they were doing. One lesser flaw was giving the wrong historical impression about the fire ships--leading those ignorant of the actual history to believe that the fire ships had actually annihilated the Spanish Armanda. In fact, the fire ships primarly broke the formation of the armada, sending them northerward in the storm to circle Scotland in order to get home. As the armada ships became wrecked on British shores and in Ireland, the hapless seamen were captured and tortured to death by Elizabeth. None of these most dramatic historical events show up in the film. nevertheless, I gave the film a 9 out of 10 for its excellent acting by Kate ( despite the lack of chemistry between her and Clive Owen), in gratitude for a most compenent film rich and lavish in historical reenactment. I was especially impressed with the fireship scenes (leaving me wanting even more, despite the fact that in most ""action"" films I want far less)."

","Historical drama meets rock video in a glorious but over-the top sequel to the sublime original. Blanchet is again superb. She looks, and most definitely acts the part with all guns blazing. Wonderful. Rush likewise provides the voice of reason and calm with is portrayal of wise old Walsingham and the relationship between the two is a constantly fascinating golden thread running through this sometimes patchwork production. The screenplay is a curate's egg of high passion and gory drama mixed with occasionally stilted and cliché-laden dialogue. The cinematography is curiously over exposed for much of the time and lacks enough of the colour and richness that a Tudor court would have possessed to near-excess . Maybe some artistic meaning is intended by this curious seoia tinged effect . If so then It's lost on me and much of the film simply looks like a badly faded print. I'd be disappointed if my photos came back from Boots looking like this. The supporting cast is headed up by an unconvincing 007-style Clive Owen as Raleigh. Whats up with Owen? His acting verged on drama-school at times, his timing and inflection weren't great and his West Country accent barely perceptible. He looked right. The roguish smile and the cocky stance were Flynn-esquire but when he opened his mouth... And the fire-ships scene where he swings from the rigging. Oh dear - pure silent-movie hokum. I was expecting Douglas Fairbanks to join in at any second. It no doubt seemed like a good, robust, macho scene on the story board but really it didn't work at all and for a few moments turned a largely well made and serious drama into a pantomime. Thankfully there are enough positive moments to overcame such flaws. The striking image of Mary Queen Of Scots in brilliant red gown looking up from the block prior to execution is exceptionally vivid and lingering scenes of Elizabeth bathed in light, more deity than monarch, also catch the eye. But when she stands on the cliff top, night dress billowing in the sea breeze, watching the Spanish Armada consumed by flames on the horizon I was expecting her to break into song. Pure MTV. But hey! It was enjoyable and griping in so many ways that the fluff and the silliness can be mostly forgiven. It's a movie after all, not an Open University documentary."

","A history lesson dumbed down so much that 7-year-olds could understand what's going on, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is nevertheless a wholeheartedly entertaining film. It reminded me of the fluffy, goofy historical epics Hollywood used to make back in the 1930s, when the emphasis was on romantic swooning rather than historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett could play a milk pail and keep me riveted, and she's dynamite once again as Elizabeth I, leading her country against the onslaught of the invading Spanish, who are intent on bringing the Inquisition to England. Blanchett is too good for material like this, but she gives it her all like a pro, and no amount of production design (and believe me, there's plenty to spare in this movie), could induce me to take my eyes off of her. Geoffrey Rush reprises his role as Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right-hand man, but he's mostly relegated to the sidelines. Stepping up to front and center this time around is Clive Owen, who plays either explorer Walter Raleigh or Errol Flynn, I'm still not sure which. All I know is that by the end he's swinging on ropes like Douglas Fairbanks, carefully groomed chest hair blowing in the breeze, as the English navy takes its stand against the Spanish armada. Actually, the silent film reference could apply to the Spaniards as well -- they're so deliciously evil that you half expect them to start twirling their villainous mustaches. I hope all the Catholics out there have a good sense of humour.<br/><br/>By the end, all attempts at realism have been swept aside, and the movie has descended into pure camp, Elizabeth practically calling down God's wrath to defeat the Spanish. And you know, Blanchett is such a good actress, I almost believe she COULD call down God's wrath if she wanted to. All I know is that when she shouts out the film's best line, ""My bitches wear my collars!"" I sure as hell sat up and took notice.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
