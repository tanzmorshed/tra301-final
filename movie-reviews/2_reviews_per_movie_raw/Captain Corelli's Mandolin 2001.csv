","I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. <br/><br/>All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the plusses (John Toll's magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script).<br/><br/>But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.<br/><br/>On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!),has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Ok, it's a given that you cannot make a good movie from a good book. (Unless you make it a trilogy :-) But comparing the book Corelli's Mandolin to this movie it's clear how much has to be cut to fit a screenplay. The book is very funny in places, romantic (of course), dramatic. What's left of it in the film is inexplicable romance -- as other reviewers have remarked, it's unclear why she falls in love with the italian while her betrothed is still around, and I have no idea why this was changed from the book -- and some gratuitous gunning and bombing scenes, more than in the book which derives its power from not hammering on the obvious points. Whole characters are cut: Carlo has maybe 10 seconds screen time, while in the book he has a whole story line that runs several chapters."
"FlickJunkie-2","8","42","54","10 March 2002"," Ambitious project falls slightly short
","As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost.  Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.<br/><br/>There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid.  Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.<br/><br/>Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.<br/><br/>John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fiancé.<br/><br/>I rated this film an 8/10.    Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission."
"sddavis63","7","34","45","11 August 2002"," Love And War And Occupation
","After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. <br/><br/>The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them.<br/><br/>The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, ""we would rather surrender to this German's dog than to you Italians."") The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can't understand,) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought.<br/><br/>It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise.<br/><br/>7/10"
"officersmess","6","23","31","27 May 2001"," Very Watchable
","Unlike many, I have not read the book and so I watched this purely as a film in its own right.  I'm not especially keen on romance dramas, and I expected this to be a bit slushy and/or operatic so I was rather hesitant about going to see it in the first place...<br/><br/>But I'm glad I did, because it was good.  Beautiful, ""feel good"" scenery and with a light touch of humour that made it rather more endearing than a straight drama would have been.  The romance was gentle, inoffensive and sufficiently interwoven with enough ""proper"" story-telling to keep my interest, and the score was not too obtrusively operatic.<br/><br/>
Overall, the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish, inducing a range of emotions as it progresses.  It's about 2 hours long, but I didn't find myself fidgeting or looking at my watch once - and that's quite a feat for me!!  Very enjoyable."
"Helen14","10","47","69","7 May 2002"," The film is a true depiction of went on in Cephallonia during the war and after.
","Being Of Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised when watching the movie. I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","16","21","29 January 2009"," Sketchy, Melodramatic and Clichéd
","The main problem with 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is that it focuses primarily on the romance between Corelli and Pelagia and that too is half-baked. What is it that draws Pelagia towards him is too unclear. Is it just his musical talent or his zest? The film is set against the backdrop of a war between the Germans and Italians in a Greek island but the war is given less significance and what we see appears very sketchy. The entire film appears too sketchy, melodramatic and clichéd. Much of it is also historically inaccurate.<br/><br/>On the technical front it is well executed. The cinematography of the beautiful exotic locations is breathtaking. The score is terrific. Where acting is concerned, Penelope Cruz can't seem to lose her Spanish accent (she's playing a Greek character) but her performance is otherwise wonderful. John Hurt and Christian Bale are equally marvelous. Nicolas Cage is a miscast. His Italian accent, energetic personality, overdone non-verbal gestures all yield to a caricature rather than a character.<br/><br/>Perhaps director John Madden was pressured to fit the entire novel into a two hour period and he chose to focus on the romance more to draw a larger crowd. I can't shake the feeling that perhaps someone like Anthony Mingella would have made a better and more complete film of it."
"lib-4","8","20","31","14 September 2001"," Music can bring love
","At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better.  I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.  My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart.  The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans.  I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again."
"foxnetwork","Null","19","30","16 September 2002"," Disappointment, some spoilers.
","Well, I see most of you liked this movie(I didn't). I read the book a few years ago and thought that it was quite good. I am of the firm belief that one shouldn't really compare books to their adaptation to the screen but this time It was hard not to. OK it's somewhat beautifully shot and the scenery is as I had pictured it but it ends there. Nick Cage is probably one of the most overrated actors of our time and his embarrassing shot at the Italian officer is remarkably unconvincing. I had hoped that American film makers would stop making the actors do fake accents to represent them being Italian etc. but no...audiences are obviously thought to be so stupid that they wouldn't understand that Corelli is Italian if he spoke with no accent. Then we have the Hollywood ending and all the other major changes in the script... (spoilers) Mandras is in this movie some kind of hero/friend of Corelli and helps him as opposed to trying to rape Cruz's character and getting killed as in the book. And of course Cages and Cruz's characters get back together a few years later instead of when they're in their 80s. I wish Hollywood wasn't so afraid of telling an uncomfortable story so that good books could become good movies instead of bad ones like this."
"mario_c","6","17","27","11 March 2007"," Could have been better
","When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times: ""It's not really what I expected, I thought it would be better"", but now that I finished watching it I realize: why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn't it just a ""love story"" made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? <br/><br/>Captain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the ""Hollywood standard's"" touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of ""plot holes"" as this one is!) instead of this ""sweet story romance, with the perfect ending"", which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a ""forgotten"" Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! <br/><br/>But the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History's knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe.<br/><br/>Globally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the ""Hollywood show's standards"" up-mentioned."
"gnamel","10","11","20","17 August 2001"," Sensitive portraits, historically faithful
","A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz were quite impressive, but it is to the older Greek characters that go the highest praises. Irene Papas is as gorgeous as ever! Though some scenes seems a little long at times, this film will be a heavy Oscar contender."
"zardoz-13","1","6","10","8 February 2008"," The lack of romantic chemistry, a hopelessly muddled plot, and leaden direction sabotages ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin.""
","""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" confuses more often than entertains. Although I haven't read Louis de Bernieres's World War II-era bestseller, I know enough about the changes to recognize the shortcomings of director John Madden's leaden movie adaptation. Audiences may remember this English director best for his 1999 Oscar-winning comedy ""Shakespeare in Love."" Personally, I enjoyed Madden's earlier effort ""Mrs. Brown"" (1997), starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria. Nevertheless, if good looks guaranteed great cinema, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" would qualify as spectacular. Lensed on location in scenic Greece by two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer John (""Braveheart"") Toll, this ambitious but abominable Nicholas Cage & Penelope Cruz wartime tearjerker is easier on the eyes than the ears. Aside from establishing a concrete sense of setting and atmosphere, Madden and scenarist Shawn (""A World Apart"") Slovo have butchered Bernieres's novel so that it emerges in bites and incomprehensible pieces. Incredibly, Madden and Slovo let the action veer erratically between comedy and tragedy with an indifferent romance at the heart handicapped by a curious lack of chemistry. Complaints about miscasting may arise in the minds of some moviegoers. Nicholas Cage's insufferably sweet, Puccini-loving, mandolin-strumming Italian artillery captain is almost enough to give Fascism a good name. Meanwhile, nothing good comes of Cage's ersatz Chico Marx accent. Actually, Sylvester Stallone would have been convincing in this role. If poor dialects irritate you, prepare for a veritable cacophony. English supporting actor John Hurt, Iberian beauty Penelope Cruz, and Welsh leading man/villain Christian Bale all sound and look out-of-place alongside Greek native Irene Papas. Purists will most likely skip this Zorba the Greek meets ""The English Patient,"" not only for its inconsistent babble of accents but also for its mishmash of historical revisionism, not to mention its pallid plot.<br/><br/>""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" unfolds on the idyllic Greek isle of Cephallonia in 1940. A wise old local physician, Dr. Iannis (John Hurt of ""Alien""), who has been compiling a history of the island and its earthquakes, narrates this yarn. He lives outside the village with his grown-up, headstrong daughter Pelagia (Penelope Cruz of ""Blow"") in a small mountainside home. A brawny fisherman called Mandras (Christian Bale of ""Shaft"") wins Pelagia's heart with his rough and tough ways. Her crusty old mustached father warns her from the start: ""I would expect you to marry a foreigner."" According to him, Greek men dominate their wives, and Mandras is ""not her equal."" When Mussolini invades Albania, Mandras and she get engaged. He ships out to fight the Italians. Pelagia pens dozens of letters, but Mandras never sends a reply. Later, we learn about Mandras's illiteracy. Perhaps Pelagia's father knows best. Anyway, this revelation smells like a plot contrivance. How could a bright, well-educated girl like Pelagia overlook such an obvious fact? She serves as her father's nurse and aspires to be a doctor herself. Doctors are trained to observe, so Pelagia should have known. Furthermore, neither Mandras nor Pelagia appear as if they were made for each other. One flirtatious splash in the Mediterranean doesn't a romance make. Madden doesn't pump up the passion between these two. Sadly, Bale and Cruz make an unpersuasive couple. Meanwhile, Madden has given audiences the village tour and introduced its citizenry. Dr. Iannis wields a fishhook to extract a dried pea from a man's ear canal. Although his hearing has been restored miraculously, the husband dreads a future where he must endure his wife's constant complaints. This joke serves as a bookend of sorts that opens and concludes the film. Suddenly, the skies erupt with military aircraft and parachutes blossom. Mussolini's Fascist troops have come to occupy Cephallonia and ships pour in more men and equipment.<br/><br/>When Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicholas Cage of ""The Family Man"") lays eyes on Pelagia, her beauty overwhelms him. ""Bella bambina!"" He exclaims and orders his platoon to glance in her direction. Initially, true to the romance formula, Pelagia wants nothing to do with Corelli. She regards the Italians with fear and loathing. Corelli is not only an artillery captain but also serves as a translator. The scene in the town square when the Greeks refuse to surrender to the Italians, preferring instead the Nazis, deserves a lusty laugh. Later, the Italians decide to billet their officer elsewhere. The Italian Army quartermaster makes arrangements with Dr. Iannis to board Corelli. Pelagia hates these arrangements, until the captain captivates her with his mandolin.<br/><br/>Gradually, Pelagia's glacial attitude melts, and she falls in love with Corelli, even after her betrothed returns to the island and joins the Greek partisans. Mandras's mother Drosoula (Irene Papas of TV's ""Homer's Odyssey"") is not happy about this new arrangement. The Cage & Cruz romance kindles few sparks. A more meaningful but tragic romance occurs between a so-called good Nazi officer, Captain Gunter Weber (David Morrissey of ""Hilary and Jackie"") and another island girl. Although Madden shows the Italians firing their artillery, this bunch of guys heads to the beach to guzzle wine and warble Verdi operas to their prostitutes. At first, everything seems great when our protagonists learn that Mussolini has surrendered and the war is over for them. ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" has focused primarily on comedy until the Nazis come goose stomping into the action, and everything turns tragic. <br/><br/>Sadly, Madden botches both assignments. He cannot stage a decent big battlefield scene, and he fares no better with the intimate romance scenes. If you're looking for a better version of ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" then check out Gabriele Salvatores's ""Mediterraneo"" (1991) which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. World War II buffs will appreciate the genuine-looking Stuka dive-bombers that rain destruction on Cephallonia. The lack of romantic chemistry, a hopelessly muddled plot, and leaden direction sabotages ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,""and it fade outs on a whimper rather than a bang of jubilation."
"Mercader79","6","3","4","22 May 2001"," Homage to Cephallonia.
","(Spoilers throughout) Am I alone in thinking this film in many ways improves upon an excellent, if flawed, novel? Make no mistake: DeBernieres' book is a modern classic, but it has two major weaknesses  one aesthetic, another of historical accuracy. This film nobly addresses both of these.<br/><br/>1) Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an excellent and moving novel. The idyllic pre-war life of the natives is vividly and touchingly depicted. The subsequent horrors of war are thus all the more harrowing when they finally arrive.<br/><br/>For all that, DeBernieres singularly fails to create a satisfactory conclusion. The last hundred pages or so detailing the intricacies of Pelagia's post-war existence are not uninteresting in themselves but seem banal indeed compared to the stirring drama that has come before. It is essentially a Second World War novel and should have ended with Corelli's departure from the island, or at least, soon after. The concluding chapters add nothing to the novel  DeBernieres should have been more ruthless and ended the story as soon as the main action stopped. The Great Escape would not have been improved by a concluding section about the surviving character's lives in the post-war decades and nor is this.<br/><br/>Commendably, the film improves upon this weakness. Now Corelli returns, soon after the war's end. This is a decided improvement on the novel where an ageing Corelli does not return  inexplicably  until fifty years later! It is thus far too late for him and Pelagia to get together and provides a wholly unsatisfactory outcome to the novel.<br/><br/>2) The novel is also undermined by a serious historical misrepresentation of the Greek anti-Nazi resistance movement, notably the organisation ELAS who Mandras falls in with. In the book, these are portrayed as Stalinist demagogues, more interested in the propagation of a narrow interpretation of Marxist dogma and political infighting with the British Allies, than genuinely resisting the Nazis. After the war, they are portrayed as practically being akin to the Nazi terror they supplant:<br/><br/>in Cephallonia the Communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration campsHitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils.' (p442).<br/><br/>As DeBernieres now grudgingly admits, in this respect, he got his research badly wrong. Although I am no expert on wartime Greece, by all accounts, ELAS played an active and constructive role in combating the Nazis. The film rectifies DeBernieres' error, showing Mandras and the other guerrillas fighting the Nazis side by side with the Italians. This does involve a fairly major alteration in the novel's story line, however  Mandras's attempt at rape and subsequent death thus do not occur here, nor do any of his guerrilla experiences which are detailed throughout the middle stages of the book.<br/><br/>There were other changes in the film that I was less keen on, however. The role of the Italian soldier Carlo, who plays a fairly major part in the novel, is here almost wholly omitted, presumably because of fears that his homosexuality would offend the crucial American market. His gesture in saving Corelli from the firing squad is thus largely inexplicable, except as  rather lamely  a benevolent sacrifice towards Pelagia.<br/><br/>On the other hand, CCM is such a long and complex novel that one can forgive the film makers for not transcribing every aspect of the book to the screen. Film is a different medium to literature. The unfairly hostile critical reception this film has received suggests far too many expected a carbon copy of the novel to be revealed on film. (And as Madden also directed the generally awful but highly overrated Shakespeare in Love perhaps this evens the score somewhat).<br/><br/>That said, the film is not perfect. I am not convinced Cage was the ideal Captain Corelli. The depiction of village life does come across fairly whimsically and compares poorly to the portrayal of European rural life in the 1940s in Jean De Florette. Although I've said changes from the book are not bad per se, some of the changes  the date of the earthquake from 1953 to 1947 seemed rather pointless. But generally ignore the pedants. The film would not be improved either by a) forcing the cast to learn and speak their character's native languages and subtitling throughout or b) correcting such 'inaccuracies' as the Italians occupying the island for two years (er - they did) or b) depicting Abyssinian style atrocities committed by the Italian forces on the island (none recorded). While not quite in the class of other Second World War classics like Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List or The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is generally a good film."
"anvourl","4","4","6","31 August 2002"," Lack of identity, poor acting, multi-language mess
","A very poor acting and lack of identity characterises this film. Penelope Cruz avoids expressing any kind of feeling, even that of love and she keeps having that extremely serious look on her face. Nicolas Cage on the contrary expresses his feelings so intensely that he becomes unbelievable;it's like saying ""look, now I am a man who's happy for no apparent reason"" or ""now I am horrofied by Germans' brutallity"". However, Irene Pappas was unique as the Greek mother and John Hurt as Pelagia's father. I also enjoyed Emilios Chilakis in his very short appearance as the Greek guerilla: he talked in a very determined way as a man who has decided not to surrender should talk. However, even though the represantation of the specifique era was quite good, hardly as the actors try, they don't succeed in their roles of the locals (needless to say that Greeks actors are excluded). The pronunciation was a very big disadvantage: Pelagia spoke English with a Spanish pronunciation, Correli spoke English sometimes with bad italian accent, sometimes with perfect american accent; however he can also speak perfect German and he can read a text written in Greek!!! And the story goes on with that multi-language mess. Also, watching the film you can hardly believe that there is a war going on: It seems that Greece had no problems during the Occupation (by the Germans and the Italians), since Italian soldiers were here to enjoy the sun. Thank God that Germans arrive on the island and we start to remember that we are during a war. And yet, the director makes it appear as if Italians and Greeks were allies against the German enemy. People of Cephalonia fought really hard against Itallians and Germans and many of them were executed; but it seems as if Italians fought for the shake of Greeks while the later were enjoying the italian music. Besides, there was a very poor reprasantation of fight and bombing. And during that events, Pelagia found the time to fall in love with Corelli, before we could realise it: She seems more in love with Mandras than with Corelli and she has hardly exchange a complete and meaningful dialogue with him; however she can't live without him. The director actually does focus neither on war events nor on the love affair and that ruins the movie. Also, I can't avoid mentioning that I got tired of watching Pelagia walking around with a basket. I assure you that women had much more to do even in that time of '40's.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** Can someone explain to me why the guerillas executed Eleni (Pelagia's friend) for simply kissing a German on the cheek and Mandras denies even his mother's request to save her, while Pelagia (who had a love affair with an Italian soldier and everybody Knows it) has their help and approval?<br/><br/>Finish studing Medicine in two years? That's a record!"

Seeing almost all of this year's love movies (what came into our theaters) I can say this is second best after Moulin Rouge. The story is simpler but it's not a fairy tale. One could easily think this really happened, almost 65 years ago. I felt every moment of the Italian soldiers murder..and I did regret as much the fact that the german captain did not commit suicide. It was the only thing honorable to do. But he didn't do it.. as it was war..and no honor came before glory. Again a very good movie coming from the director of Shakespeare in love.

","I actually was looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before the release, it sounded like a genuinely nice film, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.)<br/><br/>Well, it might have been all of those things BUT it is so boring that I defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention. Also, Cage's attempt at speaking with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He's such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film. <br/><br/>'Disappointing"" seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree.<br/><br/>I guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage's accent, it did not do well."
"Critical Eye UK","1","7","13","19 July 2003"," Busted strings
","SPOILERS AHEAD: Others here have wondered how this rates an IMDb 6/10. They're not alone, though my math runs slightly different: 8/10 for the first 30 minutes, zilch for the rest. Because it's as if there are two movies here: a lyrical small-budget essay about the impact of reluctant victors on reluctant losers. And a war movie so addled of execution you not only wonder where the hell the mandolin went, but where the plot disappeared to as well. It's as if director John Madden suddenly grows tired of the picturesque and picaresque and goes home, leaving everyone to stumble around in a morass of exploding cliches. Exposition? There ain't any. Bad enough that Cruz's capitulation to Cage is so unreal; worse, though, that the Italians sign up without demur or debate to the partisan side and battle it out with their former German allies for. . . What? No idea: if the island's some kind of strategic outpost, the script certainly seems unaware of it. Lazy film making doesn't get any lazier than this. What's especially sad about all this is that the original novel was based on fact, and wrought with such a delicate hand that it deservedly met with world-wide praise. Here, however, history is tarnished rather than garnished, and truth made to look like just another celluloid improbability. The nadir comes with the post-war 'earthquake', when you think 'aw for God's sake, do we REALLY need this rubbish on top of everything else?' Only later do you realise that the earthquake did happen, and that it's the movie's narrative incompetence that makes fact look like fiction. Of the cast, only Cruz and Hurt are worth mentioning: Cruz, because she is a consistent, consummate actress, and Hurt because he gives the impression that there's still some dramatic meat left on the plate even when the script ultimately deprives him of anything to gnaw on. As a result, Hurt's concluding monologue -- which wraps up the entire movie -- at least sounds slightly less trite than as written, so that you're not completely flattened by the stupefying banality it all. Even so, the performances of Cruz and Hurt still fail to mask the central problem that, at the end of the day, 'Captain Correlli's Mandolin' isn't actually about Corelli, or his mandolin, or indeed. . . anything at all. Hopeless. 2/10."
"Chris_Docker","4","9","18","6 May 2001"," Bland and syrupy
","Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the 'right' side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory,as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn't hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel."

","Against her father's wishes Pelagia marries her fisherman fiancé just before he goes off to war. When she stops getting replies to her letters everyone fears the worst but she holds out hope that he is still alive. Meanwhile the Greek's initial defeat of the Italian army causes Hitler to support a full attack that leaves Greece and it's island inhabited by Italian soldiers. Pelagia and her father find themselves housing Italian Captain Corelli, who loves music and is charming. While Pelagia hates Italians and loves her husband she finds herself falling for the Captain over time.<br/><br/>At the time of release there was plenty of dating couple who went to see this film and there was also a boost in the tourist trade in Greece, accompanied by lots of television travel programmes talking about the islands and the film. These two things were in my mind when I sat to watch the film tonight and I quickly understood why they were the case. Firstly the reason so many travel shows picked it up is because the film makes the place look great! Each shot is full of warm colour and the locations are picture-book all the way through. The idyllic feel that the location brings is also part of the wider film with a story that is sweet but high on Hollywood gloss. I have not read the book and have no intention of reading the book but I understand from other's comments that the screenplay has lost some 'difficult' elements and focused on the romance in the story. Ignoring this (as many who have not read the book will be able to) the film is just like the landscape  sweeping, easy on the eye, nice and ultimately quite unmemorable.<br/><br/>This explains why it was a popular date movie or, to use that expression I generally dislike, chick-flick. The romance is simple and sweet and it is enjoyable on that level; I can't say it touched me on a deep level (or any level) but it was sweet and I quite liked it. Towards the end it gets harder and more about the war than the romance but I felt this was too sudden a change that had been left too late in the game to fully work  it was too much of a sea change for me to fully go with it.<br/><br/>The cast are mostly pretty and OK just like the landscape. Cage is too nice to be true but still tries hard; his Italian accent has corny 'mama-mia' moments but is generally OK. Cruz is fairly bland and doesn't bring a great deal to the film other that her looks (which personally don't appeal to me that much) and Christian Bale is given little to do considering how good an actor he is generally. Hurt is good value as always and the support cast fill in the gaps well even if few of them have anything approaching what could be called a character.<br/><br/>Overall this is a sweet film that turns bitter for the final quarter of it's running time  a change in mood that is quite difficult when it occurs due to it's suddenness. However it manages to stay quite sweet and romantic despite running with a simplified script and a glossy approach to everything. It is quite unmemorable and I doubt I shall ever watch it again but I found it to be like the landscape  easy on the eye and rather pleasing to watch without touching me on more than a superficial level."

","I have just returned from Kefalonia. That's the only reason for marking this movie with ""3"". I like the Island...<br/><br/>I simply have no idea what's wrong with John Madden. On the paper, the guy seems to know what he's doing. Seems to be able to differ good from bad (if we take that there is no right and wrong). But after letting myself finish this movie (since I seem to be a masochist when it comes to finishing everything I am watching) I have got the impression that this fellow had been directing this in a complete emotional chaos because I can not believe that his fellow citizen Louis de Bernières had anything close to this idea. Love story?! Goddammit no! Let's start with the casting. Nicolas Cage?! Let's see, his character is a profligate Italian occupier fighting along with the Nazis under Mussolini and seducing a wive of an honest Greek patriot who goes to war to prevent his home Island being occupied...On the scale of charm from 1 to 10, that actor must have been something like 15 to even having any chance to make his character acceptably nice so one could even finish watching the movie! There were only two movies in the entire career of Nicolas Cage when he reached above 5 on such scale and where he has been able to transfer some kind of emotion through his character: Leaving Las Vegas and Face Off. However, considering that something above 5 is way below required 15, I have a feeling like I have been raped after watching this movie to the end.<br/><br/>OK, I understand. The history of art deals with probably the greatest anguish of mankind - the unpredictable ways of love. But after she (Pelagia - Penelope) was able to deceive and leave her handsome, honest, simple-minded patriot Mandras played by Bale (probably the only one partially rising to the occasion along with Penelope here) for the (above described) Cage, I believe the only honest feeling one could actually gain would be to support the angry Kefalonian inhabitants by marking her with βρώμικο πουτάνα - sporca puttana (for the ones still liking the Italian lover :) No really, even John Waters' Pink Flamingos love does not seem so repulsive anymore.<br/><br/>OK, I could be moving on with this, but I believe I have made my point clear enough."
"Karl Self","3","5","9","19 August 2009"," Painful
","I haven't read the book so I'm not anal about the movie digressing from the original plot. But it's still a horrible movie. If you want to make a schlocky love movie with Nicholas Cage affecting a risible Italian accent like out of some Little Cesar's Pizza commercial, be my guest. But please show some respect and don't base it on a real tragedy, the bloody German-Italian occupation of Greece in the Second World War and the 1943 massacre of 9000 Italian troops by the Germans.<br/><br/>To be fair to the movie, Penelope Cruz does her usual excellent job of playing an attractive girl who painfully holds out against her romantic feelings before eventually giving in to love. The only problem is that I've seen her in this role before. Other than that, the movie is 1950ies-type of inane. The Greeks are proud archetypes (but hey, daddy's still all for emancipation and that), the Italians are jolly opera boffins, and the Germans uptight, evil maniacs. Beautiful, proud Pelagia is betrothed to a resistance fighter but has the hots for a jaunty Italian soldier. You connect the dots. That's really all there is to it.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that the entire plot's long been done before, a million times better, and with infinitely more charme, in the 1991 Italian movie Mediterraneo. If you like the general idea of a romantic comedy about Italians occupying a Greek island, and going native in the process, you've struck gold. Captain Corelli's Mondolin, on the other hand, is trite sh*te."

","An awful travesty of the Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.<br/><br/>There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible, although I am not certain this actually happened."
"titofeh","1","5","9","10 June 2005"," patently offensive TRASH (in addition to pathetic film making)
","Firstly let me issue a disclaimer by stating that I was born in Greece. That out of the way, and without going into too much detail about Cage's laughably pathetic accent and the over-the-top acting by everyone not named Hurt, I have to focus on the fact that this movie is grossly offensive to Greeks.<br/><br/>Please consider that this movie is based on a book which purports to be based on history. Therefore, I believe that it carries with it a responsibility of staying true (as much as possible) to history. It wasn't just a context/backdrop for a story, it was *history*. And if the knee-jerk defense is ""well, it's the book at fault, not the film"", then I castigate the story as a whole: film/screenplay/book.<br/><br/>My mother read the book on which the film is based, and was so thoroughly offended by its bias that she had to put it down 2/3 of the way through. Upon hearing that the author got a lot of flak for stretching some truths and outright fictionalizing some very important historical elements, and that the screenplay toned these down to be more historically faithful, we thought to go see the film and see if it did a better job.<br/><br/>I was so put off by the film that I left before it ended. Rather than give you a laundry list of historical inaccuracies (you can find those anywhere on the web through a google search), I want to state that the way they portrayed the Italian military/occupiers in the film as peace-loving, song-loving, wine and dance-loving romantics, although they were part of the AXIS powers (remember, Hitler? Nazis? that whole thing?) was ridiculous, especially when contrasted with the way they portrayed the Greek resistance fighters (among whom my grandfather was counted as one) as brutish, glowering, violent animals...it was nauseating. The Greeks were INVADED and were protecting their home. The film seemed to portray a more sympathetic picture of the Italians when they were 'betrayed' by the Nazis than it did of the Greeks for protecting their home in the first place.<br/><br/>How would we as Americans feel if we went to a movie about the Revolutionary War, and saw the British portrayed as peace-loving heroes and the minutemen and revolutionaries portrayed as murderous, brutish thugs? Yes, I'm aware there was fighting and guerrilla tactics; it's not about the actions taken so much as the light in which they're depicted. And, personally, I think that would be more defensible as a film because the Colonies were rebels, and England was trying to protect her interests, as opposed to a free/independent nation being invaded and occupied and then trying to defend itself. This film really tried to slant the audience into sympathizing with the invaders, instead of (at the very least) just portraying what happened, or perhaps even (gasp) generate sympathy for the invaded.<br/><br/>So yes, the movie does the Greek countryside some justice, and may be pretty to look at on some level, but most of the critics of the film (as a piece of film-making) are SPOT on, and I add a personal note of extreme umbrage at the license taken in portraying the Greeks as virtually without any honor at all and of the Italians as virtual heroes. Book and movie both offensive historically, and movie offensive cinematic ally as well.<br/><br/>Trash."

Once it starts building, you will stay glued to the screen. It has several twist and turns and the war details are poignant. The movie's previews may be a little misleading in leading you to believe the movie is mainly coverage on WW2; however, this is more a love story and an exhilarating one at that.

This film was thoroughly enjoyable and would suit a wide range of audiences. The language, however, should have been in Greek with English sub-titles since it was filmed in the beautiful island of Kefalonia, and all the villages on the island were partly filmed, there should have been a lot more emphasis on the hardships that the locals had to endeavour.  The film did not portray this, but used a softly softly approach to hide the evils and the real tragedies  that did happen during those times.  All in all the total film did have interest as well as intrigue and stimulation.  I would recommend it to viewers who would be interested to know about the history of this lovely Greek island."

","Few days ago I finished reading of Louis de Berniéres novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. The book was really breathtaking. I was looking forward to see the movie right after reading the book. This succeeded really quickly. I was home alone and I started to watch maybe a half an hour after I have read the last page of this amazing book. It was after midnight already, but I could not wait to see how the film-makers captured the huge power of this masterpiece in the movie. But as I felt happy when I first saw images from book (Cephallonia weather and the whole atmosphere) - such I was disappointed when Berniéres' novel full of reality of life, war and everything slowly changed into silly romantic flick. Everything is too much simplified so the story goes too fast.<br/><br/>I am sure, that if Louis de Berniéres himself should make film (screenplay) from any of his novels, it would cost a lot of money and 150 minutes of time at least. But it won't be sweet happy-end story about cute girls, charming italian captains and brave partisans. It would be much more. Life and Berniéres' characters aren't so simple. Somebody really thought that if he will fill the movie with quotes from the book, people will think that it actually is book. This isn't bad film...I still give 7 points from 10. It's just deeply disappointing for those who read the novel. Maybe there are many perfect novels in the background of many average hollywood flicks. But sometimes there will be much better not to shoot some fine books... For those, who have read this commentary till now I have one advice - if you like superior reading and not just movie love stories - try some Berniéres!"

The amazing transformation of Mandras from every-day village lad to the bottom pit of human scum - gone. Carlo, a whole storyline of beauty, sorrow and prevailing humanity - reduced to twenty seconds of valiant dying that leaves us wondering why (and why the hell so long?). The book was about life first and foremost, and all its aspects - love, death, survival, cruelty, kindness, nonsense and magic etc. This movie is a weird watered down love story of a highly improbable Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz (who's actually OK despite her Spanish accent :-) ) with all the rawness and irresistibility of the forces of the human heart and twisted minds vanished. I was left wondering why the hell did they even fall in love, I didn't feel their love at all, the movie was full of loose ends and weirdnesses - what the hell was Mandras doing popping in and out all the time? Meaningful parts of the book were discarded while bullshit and inconsistent though nicely hollywoody passages added... OK, it is a bitter diatribe but I actually registered IMDb to voice my disgust, so there you go. If you didn't read the book and liked the movie, read the book, you'll be blown over.

It is amazing how much of this film is direct from the book... Nicolas Cage plays an amazing Italian Captain, who's first love is music. He is thrust into a situation beyond his control, and he lives his new life as best he can, using his love of music and culture to bring some sensibility to a confused world. In Penelope Cruz's Pelagia we see an intelligent girl, brought up by her father, to a cultured world of languages and knowledge.

","Range of performance from actors was on the whole good; Nicolas Cage and John Hurt doing really quite well - although Cage's part had more scope.<br/><br/>
Cage's accent was quite believable as English with an Italian lilt. Hurt's, as Greek, was less so; lapsing into pure English occasionally.  The English/German accents were pretty terrible, no points for Patrick Malahide or David Morrissey.  Ranges of the Greek island natives was small, but then, having been occupied by the Italians, they didn't have very much to smile about.<br/><br/>All the acting was very good, down to passable.  Points to Cage and Hurt for some great performances as the suave love-struck Italian and rugged, long-suffering Greek father respectively.<br/><br/>The story - okay, a group of opera-singing Italian artillerymen is perhaps not the most natural subject, but the boys could definitely sing; Cage's mandolin playing was haunting and thoroughly believable (I can't believe it wasn't him playing it, in fact).  The story is classic love-triangle material, but a war and a twist keep it interesting.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent, John Toll showing us the lush Greek Cephallonian landscape. However, with scenery as striking as this, Toll could hardly go wrong by just pointing the camera anywhere.  The scenery, already really a character of its own, becomes somewhat more dominant toward the end.<br/><br/>Pacing was rather slow for my taste. Some shots lingered a little too long when I was expecting a cut.  General pacing was slow; with the start of the third act being a jarring acceleration into high-gear.  After that the pacing slows down again with a slight bump toward the end.<br/><br/>Overall: for someone interested in a solid film, and willing not to bitch about the pacing, this is definitely one to see.  Good story, direction, and cinematography.  If the editor could tighten it up a little, this would be 8/10; otherwise 6."

","Here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There's heroics and humor, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, a very similar, or should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of doctor Iannis, and their life on Kefalonia during WWII. Pelagia's fiancee, local fisherman Mandras, enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. When the Axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. As Mandras joins the partisans, charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and, most importantly, an ode to island life on Kefalonia.<br/><br/>Some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I am glad nobody ever tried.<br/><br/>The movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin', however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie."

The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book.

","In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was ""completely out of tune"" with the book.  The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details.  In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the story and characters fall flat.<br/><br/>This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through.

","It was obvious to me that this one would be yet another one of those movies Hollywood tries to feed you every once in a while. Based on a generally appreciated book the story is set in 1940 in the beautiful island of Kefalonia (Cephalonia) in Greece and presents life under the Italian, and then German occupation through a generally lighthearted romance between a Greek girl and an Italian captain (yes, that would be Cage).<br/><br/>
I was surprised to find out that the movie was *much* better than I thought. Perhaps, if I expected a quality film I'd be very disappointed. The movie combined history with romance in an intriguing way which kept you going until the very last minute. The photography was amazing and the music was subtle and almost unnoticeable at times. Casting could have been better, with Nicholas Cage being anything but an Italian and Penelope Cruz having the tendency to just stand there looking at the camera doing nothing. <br/><br/>I'd probably recommend it to someone who'd like to rent a movie for a night in and looking for something less challenging/heavy than other movies involving war and history."

","Captain Corelli has received some really harsh reviews, but it really isn't that bad. It's obvious what the problem was, the book was just not transferable onto screen. It couldn't possibly of been crammed into 2 hours, but then any longer and some would've found it too bum numbing. Needless to say, the scenery and score were just perfect. So Nic Cage's accent was dodgy, but apart from that I thought he was perfect for the part. He was exactly as I imagined Corelli to be, quite dorky but kind. For some reason, I've always thought of him like this, even after watching Con Air and Face Off. I was especially impressed with Penelope Cruz. I've never seen her in a thing, and after appearing in all those gossip columns with Tom Cruise, I foolishly thought she was just another average actress with good looks. But she was suprisingly good. I think people mistook her for being wooden when she was just trying to play her role down (nothing worse than a war damsel over-acting, how cheesy). Despite other comments, I fail to see what was so good about John Hurt. Place any other old man in his role, Ian McKellen etc, and I'm sure there would be no big difference. It's not that hard to play a wise, expressionless, old man, especially if you're old and a man. Outstanding acting came from Christian Bale. He played his part with so much emotion, I was quite suprised after American Psycho, and it made me very sad when Pelagia left him for Corelli (though one can't really see why...Pelagia goes from being in love with Mandras to practically finding him annoying, she only manages a weak ""sorry"" and not even any tears!) I also thought the Mandras' mother was played really well. But here are the bad points. What the hell happened to the character of Carlo?! *SPOILER* I can understand why the movie left the homosexual bit out, but his close friendship with Corelli was practically non-existent. And it can't make sense to anyone who hadn't read the book why he'd suddenly step in front of Corelli when all the Italians were being shot and save him, when the two had barely exchanged words throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Another major point...the chemistry between the two leads. I fail to see any whatsoever. In fact, I agree with another commenter, the only loving scenes were between Mandras and Pelagia at the beginning. This made the film lose some of its intensity. All in all, good novel adaption, quite a good film. 8/10"

","Far and away one of the worst films I have ever wasted time watching. I knew 5 minutes into it that Nicholas Cage would never be convincing as an Italian, his accent was that bad. I kept thinking that it was Cage trying to be an Italian, and for that matter Cruz was just as bad. In order for a film to be successful one must be able to suspend belief, and the characters must inhabit their roles. Neither actor did this.<br/><br/>Bale was quite good, actually the only redeeming factor in the film. The war scenes were comical, the music was overdone, and Cage, well, let's just say that this is a movie that did not need to be made. Or rather, if one is going to make it, for God's sake use an actor that can be convincing. The story is actually interesting-the movie is a complete butchery.<br/><br/>My favorite line is when Bale asks Cruz if she had really fallen out of love with him, and actually had never really loved him at all, she says 'sorry'. A terribly accidental moment of comic relief.<br/><br/>Please don't waste your time on this film. Watch Matchstick Men again, or The Orchid Thief, if you want a Nick Cage fix."

","Alfred Hitchcock used to say that the sight of people in Paris (or Moscow, or Kefallonia) talking amongst themselves in English, was all by itself enough to ruin a movie.  Okay, so Hitchcock was a bit loopy.  But such things can happen.  The way everyone in ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" speaks English - the Greeks with a Greek accent, the Italians with an Italian accent, the Germans with a German accent, the BBC newsman with a BBC accent - seriously undermines the credibility of every scene, and brings outright idiocies in its wake.  It's fair enough, sometimes, to let English stand in for some other language.  But EVERY other language?  Details are obscured: is Captain Corelli bilingual, trilingual (he converses with Germans, but in what tongue? this is an important issue), or can he only speak Italian?  How many languages can the average islander speak?  How many languages can the average Italian private speak?  Is there an accepted lingua franca on the island, and if so, what is it?  It's as if everyone is speaking not Italian or Greek or German but European, a language with slightly different regional variants.  Every single person we see speaks this English-as-a-second-language with precisely the same degree of  proficiency - although Nicholas Cage will every so often utter a word like ""signora"" or ""bella"", to confuse matters further.<br/><br/>So the absence of subtitled Greek, Italian etc. is a real problem, accounting for all that is seriously wrong with the film - ALL that is seriously wrong, mind you, which is why I resent people talking about the film as though it were a disaster (those who have acquired an irrational hatred of Miramax are especially fond of doing so), when it is at worst a pleasant outing, with much to recommend it.  Cinematography is gorgeous. The island is gorgeous.  People look as though they really live there. (John Tool's photography is EXACTLY the kind of thing Peter Jackson ought to have tried for when he made ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  The fact that the latter was showered with praise and awards while the former merely got a few half-hearted compliments shows just how little respect Tolkeinesque fantasy is accorded.  People EXPECT a World War Two story set on a Greek island to look superb.  With fantasy, we're delighted if only it fails to look embarrassingly bad, sometimes even if it doesn't.  But I digress.)  There are one or two - okay, considerably more than one or two - lines that are just too obvious and pat, but usually contained within scenes that are somehow strong enough to bear them.  The story as a whole is an engaging one.  The bit with the sea mine is surely worthwhile.<br/><br/>No worse than mediocre in other respects, it's worth seeing simply because it's worth SEEING."

I was very disappointed with the script and the acting.  Were Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz awake while they were being filmed?  John Hurt did a credible job as the doctor / mayor of the Village, but he was no Anthony Quinn. This was neither a great romance nor a good World War II story.  When you compare it to a really great WWII movie about Greece, like ""Guns of Navarrone"" it doesn't hold up.  There were a few funny lines and amusing scenes, especially when the Italians sang opera while the German officer watched, without a clue.

Well there is one other thing on their minds as exemplified by that dratted handsome Capt Corelli when we first see him looking in his dress uniform as if he would be happier piloting Thunderbird 3.On spotting Pelagia in the crowd as they march through town to accept the surrrender he orders his men to salute ""Bella bambina at 2 'o clock"" thus identifying himself as a dog and a sexist at once.A stereotypical Italian then. Mr Nicholas Cage plays Capt Corelli in a way that clearly pleases him. He and child of nature fall in love which Miss Cruz valiantly tries to depict,her brow furrowing with effort from time to time.Wise doctor/philosopher Iannis thinks no good will come of it.The Italians surrender as soon as is decently possible leaving the dour humourless Germans to fight alone with entirely foreseeable results. Not to be confused in any way with the well - received novel of the same title,""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" sets cliché upon cliché and devil take the hindmost.It tries for the sweep of a David Lean but lacks the absolute control of his subject that categorised his work.

The acting of the principals, especially the reliable John Hurt as the village doctor, is excellent. And the atmosphere of a small Greek village of that era is re-created well. The Penelope Cruz character falls for the Italian while her Greek fiancé is away fighting with the partisans, not while he's still around. I stayed in Sami, on Kefallonia, where much of the film was shot, less than a year later, and it's a community still to some degree traumatized by what went on there during the war.

It's sweeter than candy and has almost nothing to do with WWII, even though it pretends to be a war movie. <br/><br/>The story begins just before the war starts. Pelagia is engaged with a local fisherman against her father's will. Then the war starts and all the young men of the village go to war, fighting the Italians in Albania. Just before her fisherman leaves, she marries him and she promises that she will write him letters every day. She never gets a reply and doesn't know if he is still alive. In the meanwhile the Italians are defeated, but her husband hasn't returned. Hitler has send German troops to help the Italians and Greece looses the war after all. The Italians occupy Greece, but still no sight of her fisherman... An Italian captain is housed in their home. She hates him but after some time she starts to love him of course.<br/><br/>If you think you will see any action shots of the war the first 1.5 hours, you will be very disappointed. The only thing that you'll get to see is the love-hate relationship between the captain and Pelagia, Italians singing, dancing, drinking and making love... Trust me the movie's pace is so slow that you would like to push the fast forward button all the time because much isn't happening. Don't think that I wanted to see explosions all the time. I like romantic stories, but not if almost nothing happens in it.<br/><br/>Another reason why I will not see this movie again is because everybody seems to speak the same language, only with a small difference in accents. It doesn't matter if it is an Italian, a German or a Greek, they all speak English. Only a few times I heard some German, in the background. Especially Nicholas Cage's Italian accent was awful. I know, it's still a Hollywood movie, they need some known actors in it to make sure it gets enough publicity. If that's the only thing the producers were thinking about I can only say they succeeded. If they wanted an authentic feeling they should have hired actual Greeks, Germans and Italians. I'm sure there are some great actors in these countries as well. <br/><br/>What I did like about the movie was the scenery. The landscapes were absolutely beautiful. Like I said, it felt more like a brochure for romantic holidays. Seeing all the landscapes made me almost jump on the next plane to Greece so I could spend the rest of my life there. Let's be honest, that's not good if you want to shoot a war movie, is it? Or do you guys want to spend the rest of your lives in a ghetto with an extra trip to a concentration camp perhaps? <br/><br/>No, this movie really couldn't convince me.

Corelli is instantly charmed by Pelagia and tries to win her heart by playing on his mandoline.<br/><br/>The movie portrays quite historical the way to disaster of the 12.000 strong Italian Acqui Division and its East-front battle hardened commander general Gandin. In September 1943 Italy surrendered. Contradictionary orders from Rome and Athens to lay down arms and hostile reactions by the Germans, made the confused Italians to decide to took up their arms against their former allies. They sank a German landing ship with reinforcements for the small German garrison. Supported by Stuka's and Jagdpanzer the ""elite"" 1st Gebirgsjäger Division is transferred to the island and in a few days killed 1300 Italian troops, loosing only 200 men of their own. On 21 September the Italians were forced to surrendered and 5300 were instantly shot, including Gandin. Hitler himself personally ordered the ""destruction"" of the ""traitors"". The tragedy for the remaining Italians was not over because of the captured remaining Italians another 3000 lost their lives when their transports were sunk. The movie shows us a glance of this immense tragedy and proceeds with the escape of captain Corelli and his return to the island after the war. He meets Pelagia in the ruins of their house, destroyed by an earthquake. The movie starts and ends with showing us the simple local people and their daily problems.

John Hurt is a great actor and has a weathered enough face to look the part of Cruz's father, an aging Greek country doctor, but fell just a tad short in his performance too. He's too - I'll say ""English"" - to pull it off.<br/><br/>Aside from Cruz, Christian Bale was well cast as Mandras, a brave and noble soldier and Cruz' fiancé. His character was a bit macho and I suppose that was one of the reasons Cruz fell for Cage's more sensitive Corelli, but it was never quite believable.<br/><br/>In the Cruz films I've seen (""Vanilla Sky,"" ""All The Pretty Horses"" and this one) the directors seem to use her sparingly. She pops in when needed. She's left a bit of a mystery. I never get the sense of who her characters really are. We usually see her only when and as her love interests see her. That's a shame. Because I could never see too much of her."

","It is a love story and there are so many of them in the movie industry but still, it seems different. Is it because of the actors, who play as there were actually there, at that time and make us believe that these events are really occurring? (it is surprising to see how much effort was made just to get the Greek accent when they are speaking in English!)Is it because we're not used to seeing stories taking place in amazing greek islands which have, in a weird way, something very familiar: in a way it's very far but you feel very close to those characters, this place, the events..If you like Greek culture, there is great chance you'll feel the same way. Besides,it is a love story which takes place during world war two. It sounds like you already know how the story is going to end right from the start but you don't. you only think you do! The director doesn't try to make a drama. Even in the saddest moment, hope reappears. He mostly prefers to leave some parts to our imagination, which could have been extended much more by other directors. There isn't any exaggeration from the director's part, even if it's a love story he never insists in extending the scenes where something actually happens between the lovers, he prefers to concentrate on preliminary acts(!). The war,shown the same way, is much more effective from our side, it is fast and hard. At the end there is this feeling of having listened to a enchanting song:it was melancholic and joyful, and it was worth it."
"PeteBDawg","3","2","4","6 January 2003"," Corelli on Cruise Control
","Several people I know were really excited to see this movie, because the marketing made it look very dramatic and romantic.  There were shots of this beautiful, peaceful, idyllic Greek island and of pitched battle shattering the paradise.  An intense romance was supposed to emerge from this twisted set of circumstances.  If the movie had moved dramatically from peace at the beginning to fury near the end, the romance that emerged probably would have been pretty dramatic.  The problem with this movie is that neither peace nor war is actually in this movie.  The majority of this movie takes place during an unstable and unpleasant, but not necessarily volatile, military occupation.  And because the action cruises at such a middling pace, refusing to commit to one ideal or the other, the idyllic, star-crossed romance people expected never materialized.  I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The most fitting word to describe this movie is probably ""Petty.""  The film seems to strive to show how everything that happens on this little Greek island is completely unimportant to everybody involved, but they still act really serious about everything they come across, even when they're supposed to be having fun.  The characters all seem to be in vaguely bad moods all the time, as if they wouldn't even bother to talk to one another unless the film required them to in order to advance its plot, slowly and inexorably, toward its garbled, mistimed conclusion.<br/><br/>This movie is a major watch-looker, folks.  That is, as you sit and take in this movie, you will look at your watch frequently.  Very frequently.  And if you don't, you won't have any idea when it's going to end, and the answer you'll want to hear is ""Now."""

","Warning:  If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in film, disregard this review and move on.<br/><br/>Yes, I borrowed the ""one line summary"" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but, among other virtues, this movie emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings.  This film is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to spare.  In a word, they have ""character.""<br/><br/>A small nitpick:  Unless you know the history of WW II, you probably don't know that, from Captain Correlli's arrival on the island to the fall of Mussolini, 3 and one-half years have passed.  The average viewer might think the romance was of the ""whirlwind"" variety.  That is not so.  The romance develops slowly, which gives it both dignity and meaning.  The film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of marking time.<br/><br/>Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent.  The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good. <br/><br/>
The history was right on the mark.  Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who, for the most part, were reluctant allies from the start.  If you find that shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, just after France's capitulation, lest it fall in the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization.<br/><br/>This film was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical.  The script was not thought-provoking, nor was it clever, but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, nor would they have been appropriate.  <br/><br/>The story is tender, and the message is uplifting.  The characters are honest, brave, earnest, sympathetic, and likeable.  It's a nice little film. 8/10."

"paul_tremblay","5","2","4","18 May 2002"," Cruze and Cage: wrong chemistry
","It's hard to pinpoint the reasons of the failure of Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Is it another good example of a how-to-cash-in-on-a-literary-success-and-do it-hastily-so-your-audience-is-hooked? Is it really what happened? The book is already a few years old, and it wasn't a Grisham after all. So what's or who's responsible for such a laughable result?<br/><br/>One thing most of the critics rightfully pointed out: the language, or languages, of the film. On a remote Greek island invaded first by liberal (or inept) Italian soldiers then by a big bad German army, everybody speak English for the sake of the American audience who still feels deeply embarrassed when Nicholas Cage (seemingly speaking some Greek, we assume) is the go-between during a `surrender' ceremony: he reads the Greek text from the island official, translates it into Italian, I mean English, then goes get a German soldier who doesn't appear to be disturbed by any language barrier (actually, does the German soldier speak Italian, German or Greek: only his director could tell).<br/><br/>The rhythm of the film gives you the feeling that we're dealing with several different stories seemingly directed by different people then spliced together by a team of editors who thought that adding a totally irrelevant earthquake at the end would move us For those of us still awake, it just confirmed that the filmmakers had no idea how to kill time. The evolving relationship between Cruze and Cage is so unrelated to the rest of the narrative that when you get back to the island and the existing conflicts, you feel you just visited another island for a few minutes. Cruze's fiancé, which should have a link between Cruze/Cage and war situation on the island is indeed poorly used, and we either don't care about him, or just find him superfluous.<br/><br/>The filmmakers tried too hard at being politically correct and at satisfying their subtitle-haters American audience, and succeed at neither. They also attempted at chewing more than they and we can swallow: show side-by-side WWII and its geopolitical implication and a love story, all true stories. Titanic tried and made it, but we're not talking James Cameron here The narrative drifts from one focus to another, linking the two stories amateurishly, showing seemingly separate episodes without any warmth or talent, either from the cast or the production crew. The extreme violence of the last 30 minutes is so seems to be coming from left field, when compared with the rest of the film: the rhythm is totally off.<br/><br/>The last meeting between our two love birds, reunion intended to be climatic and tearjearking, falls so flat that the word awkward comes to mind: Cage appears to be years older, but not Cruze. Maybe the filmmakers were looking, without any kind of focal point or heart, for a Hollywoodian ending, and, as a matter of consequence, the actors are gauche and clumsy and don't know what to do, and neither do we: should we ask for a refund?"

","I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice. It's kind of slow in the beginning, but I never thought for a second this was a defect; on the contrary, its slowness contributes to recreate the tranquil atmosphere of the stupendous Greek island of Cephallonia as it was in the forties. The photography of the island was so beautiful that I was almost able to smell the olive oil and the leaves on the trees.<br/><br/>The main characters were noble, heroic, and honest. The second time I saw the movie, I appreciated even more the figure of the Greek Mandras. His very last scene with Pelagia is a perfect image of how a man can accept a hurting future with incredible dignity and honor. I really admired the guy. I liked Corelli and the soldiers of the Opera House because their jovial character reminded me of many of my friends in Italy, gathered in huge parties driving around at night and singing while waiting for the bakery to open at four in the morning in order to get a croissant. I liked the beautiful, strong, and intelligent Pelagia and her wise and loving father Iannis. I loved the entire atmosphere of the island, which reminded me of my father's small village in Southern Italy. These Mediterranean places have one exceptional thing in common: time seems to run slower over there, letting you fully appreciate the beauty and the serenity of the community and the scenery.<br/><br/>There is something weird about all the accents that somehow declasses the movie a little, and makes it look less sumptuous than it is. I understand that some people may feel a little puzzled by this cornucopia of Italian, Greek, German, and Spanish (Penelope Cruz) accents, even though this aspect did not bother me at all.<br/><br/>Anyways, the main reasons that made me like the movie were the growing appreciation of the Greeks and the Italians for each other's cultures, the ability of the characters to elevate human dignity and pure sentiments over the brutality of war, and last but not least the contrast between the Latin culture of the Greeks and the Italians on one hand and the Teutonic culture of the Germans on the other. Finally, this movie made me think a lot about the very meaning of war and about the fact that you can call somebody enemy only until you actually get to know that person. That is the moment when he or she stops being an impersonal shadow and becomes part of your world, and sometimes - like in this movie  he or she can even become `your world.'<br/><br/>Inspiring."

"Cherry Parker","Null","2","4","2 September 2001"," A big lesson and a wonderful image
","Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a film that you couldn't possibly forget, first of all simply because of the location of filming, which, in these days of lightning-sped urbanization fills the heart with a longing for peaceful, leveled life in nature's beautifully powerful company. Apart from the beauty that you see, there is a beauty that you percept inside your heart. It is a film where each character has a handful of choices before him, choices that may change his or somebody else's lives forever. There are no black-and white characters. It has so much to say about love, and not the usual kind shown in films  love that surpasses just falling in love. Love that binds two people together in such a way that not only war, but also time's separation cannot shatter it. It is a film about life passing by and how our hearts change with time  accordingly to what people around us, as well as ourselves, choose to do. It also teaches us that everything, I mean absolutely every little thing that happens to us has a reason and comes from someone whom we may call Fate. It is in what we DO with the things that happen, how we react to them, that our liberty and free will are held.<br/><br/>I just came back from the cinema, it was only my second time viewing CCM, but I ensure you it will not be the last. Penelope Cruz is charming, and has a difficult role, where her character must choose, and show dignity and honor in the choices she makes. I call it difficult because she does not simply play a woman in love with the enemy. She plays a woman who time led through falling in love, being in love, and took her where little actresses I know have ever been  to a time of real love, not exciting, not breathless, not rash and quick to fade, but patient, smart, and everlasting. It is the ability to ACT OUT the difference that, apart from her amazing beauty, I greatly admire. I am also wonderfully surprised by the accent that all the actors have developed accordingly to what nationality their characters were. They were all really genuine, well maybe except for Gunter, who could have been better. Nicolas Cage's character had so much color and life inside, that his rather unhandsome appearance did not seem unequal to his partner's evident beauty. Go see it, even if you do not like war films. It is definitely a film of unforgettable beauty and challenging wisdom."

Nicholas Cage never disappoints. I am going to read the book, and am certain it will be excellent. But I know that a movie can NEVER live up to the images created in the minds of its book readers. You can't expect that any movie could live up to that. I also frown upon people expecting that Hollywood is going to give an accurate portrayal of history. That does not sell tickets. Perhaps we should learn about history from real sources such as history books or documentaries.

","Sandwiching a love story between Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) and Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage), Pelegia's father-physician (John Hurt) removes an ear blockage from a patient at the movie's beginning and is asked to replace it at the end. In between is a cinematic lesson, reportedly unfaithful to the novel and somewhat to historical fact, that says the most about the arts and ways of healing as any movie I've happened across since reading Albert Camus' The Plague.<br/><br/>Captain Corelli's Mandolin opens in 1940 on the island of Cephallonia. When the Germans trump a Greek military victory (elsewhere) over the forces of Mussolini, an occupying force of battle-unsullied Italians arrives to incur the contempt and detestation of the locals. What follows is a transnational tension that gradually becomes a reevaluation, both among the populace generally and in the heart that resides in the female leading character, a daughter-doctor in training.<br/><br/>Hurt should be nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a physician of body, soul, and ethics. He probably ought to win, pending a look at other prospective candidates. Cruz shines in a pair of scenes where she speaks not a line but reacts by purest facial language to that which she feels obligated to despise yet cannot because of its gentility. Cage likewise gives a wholly acceptable performance, and Piero Maggio in a minor role is even better as the one Italian who is a survivor of the prelude carnage. David Morrissey plays with skill a stiff German liaison officer who takes a liking to the Italians' frivolity. Bale balances carefully his character's simultaneous patriotism and romantic plight. Irene Papas is capably present as his mother.<br/><br/>This film is getting reviews of mediocrity and badness from many critics. Romantics are advised to ignore them. In my mind it's an IMDb 7, or in customary ratings lingo, against the grain, at least 3 stars. Bright stars, at that, lighting the stage of an unusually medicinal Greek tragedy."

Ok, not the greatest sarcasm.  Anyway, she has a fiance, played by Christian Bale who doesn't really fit the role of a greece type of person unfortunately, and she will marry him as soon as he comes back from the war.  But while he's away, the Italians come in to the island and it should seem that her world might seem normal anyway.  But then her father, played by Hurt who is the only watchable guy in the movie, lets an Italian Opera soldier (is that what you'd call this contradiction of a man) played by Nicolas cage with Italian accent and all, inter her home. And I don't think I need to go any further, not because it's unthinkable, but because I don't want to drone on with the obvious plot points.<br/><br/>Not reccomendable, unless you are a really die-hard fan of Madden's last film Shakespeare in Love (which I felt was ludicrous when it came time to the Oscars) or the novel it's based on.

The character that becomes involved with communist partisans, Mandras (Christian Bale), who is the other love interest of Pelagia (Penelope Cruz).  He doesn't become the villian he is in the book, and his toned-down character becomes merely an ignorant oafish guy.  There's no reason for Pelagia to turn away from him--his character doesn't change or develop into something reprehensible. There's no good reason for Pelagia to fall out of love with him.  Or rather, the reasons given in the film are too wimpy and toned down.<br/><br/>The worst offense is the elimination of Carlo Guerico as a main character. I guess my husband is correct when he states that Hollywood can never portray a homosexual man as a strong, heroic role model.  Carlo becomes merely a vehicle for Corelli's survival, the ineptness of which is compounded by it being revealed by the character ten minutes beforehand. There isn't even a surprise there!<br/><br/>The acting was less than inspired.  It seemed as if everyone was going through the motions. There was no joy in this movie, and no sorrow either.<br/><br/>This movie could have been so much more, and it's hard for me to get around that.  I mourn for the film that might have been."

","Contains spoilers, if anything could be considered able to spoil this mess. At times the cinematography equals some of the book's verbal power. Cephalonia is gorgeous.  But this is the most miscast movie I've ever seen. Sometimes the offbeat casting works, as in the case of John Hurt and Irene Pappas as Pelagia's father and Mandras' mother, but the rest of the time it's pretty horrifying.  Nicolas Gage has no romantic appeal (and gives a ludicrous performance) and Penelope Cruz, in addition to being too old, has a horrible voice that is so nasal and whiny that it is groan-inducingly comic.  Worst casting is the chubby old maidish Brit for the island's head Nazi.  He gives the impression he's going to bake a nice kidney pie for dear old mum, rather than promote the interests of the master race.  The events of the book are depicted, but there is no context for them, so nothing makes much sense.  (The healing of the insane, the detonation of the Turkish bomb, etc.) For example, Carlo does save Correlli, but Carlo has two lines at the beginning of the movie and then disappears until his final scene.  You have no idea who he is, much less of his great homosexual love for Correlli. The alcoholic priest has been reduced to a walk-on who gets killed by a Nazi at the end.  There is no `La Scala'.  The Italians sing merely because they're Italian rather than because they want to disguise hemorrhoidal pain. Mandras' character has been changed completely.  In the film he doesn't become a homicidal Communist.  Rather than practice sexual abstinence, as Correlli wisely counsels in the book, he and Pelegia hop in the sack right away with no worry whatever that she would be perceived as a collaborator. The movie makes virtually no sense.  They tried to fix the book's ending, but it doesn't work because the characters have no depth and you don't care. Psipsina is not in the film either.  Worst point in the movie is Pelagia's tango (it rivals Maria Montez's choreography in Cobra Woman.)  It could have been a great film, but they blew it.  I can't believe they didn't show Mandras swimming with the dolphins.  This was a big disappointment."

","Although this movie is not out in the States yet I was able to catch it on a trip to London. I'm sorry, but I just could not get past Nicholas Cage with that horrible Italian accent and phony ""love of life"" demeanor. Penelope Cruz was great, as was John Hurt. These two are in a class far above Nicholas Cage who seems to be limited to action movie and the occasional chick flick. However, I have to say that Christian Bale stole the show. Especially bearing in mind that the leads were all playing characters of a different nationality than their own, Christian Bale was the only one who came across as convincingly Greek. In fact, I didn't even realize it was him at first despite having seen him in Metroland other films. The film was hardly as gripping or well-performed as the English Patient, which I think it pretends to. Why couldn't they have had Greek and Italian actors in the lead parts, speaking in their own languages (with the translation in subtitles)?? This movie was a sad day for Nicholas Cage and a sad day for fans of international films if this is the kind of Hollywoodization we can expect in the future."

The most interesting plotlines like the sacrifice of Carlo (which is key to the survival of Captain Corelli is glossed over as to be almost invisible - not by any chance to do with the fact that it was a gay subplot???) are missing. There doesn't seem to be much drama and also very little mandolin - I also have to say that I didn't think anyone's performance was good - the acting just came over as being very hammy. You'd also think from this film that the Italians were a nice bunch of lads basically on an army holiday - all they do is sing and dance. Weren't they a fascist army?? Hadn't they been involved in atrocities previously ? It would have been nice to have a more balanced view - the cynic in me would ask the question whether Hollywood was afraid of offending the Italian-American viewing public.

","This is a beautifully-crafted, emotion-packed testament to the horrors of war and the power of love. Its accuracy as regards the actual WW2 occupation of Cephalonia by the Italians and Germans, and its fidelity to the novel on which it is based, are neither here nor there. As a movie, it is completely successful on its own terms, which are old fashioned enough to include a linear story line and straightforward characterisations and relationships.<br/><br/>The central love story is a take on Romeo and Juliet, neatly fitting in with the fact that director, John Madden, made Shakespeare in Love, also based on a star-crossed lovers theme. The magnificent Cephalonian scenery also brings to mind ancient Greek drama, and its constant theme of man against the fates, so it may be significant that Madden also directed one of the episodes of a 1990 TV series on Greek Myths (with acknowledgements to IMDb!). But, since we're now in the sphere of  commercial cinema, not classical tragedy, the film has a happy ending, though this is muted and well judged in tone.<br/><br/>Almost all the performances are thoroughly convincing, especially John Hurt as Dr Iannis, and Penelope Cruz as Pelagia. Nicolas Cage is also effective as Corelli, though his earnest passionate persona may not be sufficiently stereotypically Italian for some people's taste. Particularly believable is Christian Bale as Pelagia's brave, but insensitive, fiancé, Mandras. The production values are high grade, including the music and effects. In particular, the battle and massacre scenes are graphically realistic and truly shocking.<br/><br/>To sum up, this is an excellent movie, with much to admire, and very little to dislike."
"iprudd","8","2","4","27 May 2001"," A classic love story set against WWII
","The majority of the criticism that I had heard about this film related to the picture postcard location and the 'silly accents'. I have not read the book, yet! The accents were appropriate.<br/><br/>The film opens on the Island of Cephalonia just before the outbreak of the second World War. Pelagia, the daughter of Iannis, the island's doctor becomes engaged to Mandras, a fisherman. Her father does not think that this is a good match but allows Pelagia to make her own choice. Mandras goes to fight the Italians. The war takes a turn for the worse and the island is invaded by the Italians with German support.<br/><br/>The war does not really touch those that are based there. During this time a tentative romance develops between Pelagia and Corelli. After the Italians surrender the Germans massacre them. Some escape, Corelli amongst them. He is smuggled off of the island by Mandras and his partisans.<br/><br/>The war ends and Pelagia is now a doctor. However, she still carries a torch for Corelli. Iannis writes to Corelli who returns and wins back Pelagia.<br/><br/>The film does jump a little, but this is to be expected of a film based on a sweeping BOOK. This said, this does not spoil the FILM. The locations are beautiful, this cannot be helped either since the island is beautiful. This works as a romance which is what it is. The performances from the central characters, Cage and Cruz are good and make the story believable, I can forgive her the dire Woman On Top. Hurt provides a strong performance also. Bale is good in support. <br/><br/>This is one to go and see and judge for yourself."
"James Zborowski","Null","2","4","18 May 2001"," Trouble in paradise
","First of all, just to get it out of the way, I'd like to say that yes, I read Louis de Bernieres' magisterial, charming, evocative, panoramic novel shortly before going to see its celluloid adaptation; and whilst the film compares highly unfavourably to the book, that is not really the point. What is the point is that, whichever way you slice it, this film is extremely poor.<br/><br/>Much has already been said about the extreme ropiness of the accents all round.  We have Nicolas Cage sounding like he's wandered in from a Cornetto advert, a Spanish Greek, a scouse German (to quote Empire magazine), and a passable Greek accent from John Hurt.  But what is most amusing is that there are supposed to be four different languages knocking about the film (Greek, Italian, German, English), but, due to Hollywood's fear of subtitles, there is in fact only one.  Consequently, in one scene, a Greek listens to a BBC news report (in English, and supposed to be), then says (in English, but ostensibly Greek) that he does not understand it.<br/><br/>This aside though, the central romance, between Captain Corelli and Pelagia, is really where the film either stands or falls; and sadly, it does the latter.  The two characters share what seems like virtually no screen time, and certainly no chemistry.  I must mention the book here, because in it, there is a true sense of the relationship between the captain and Pelagia. But in the film, any sense of longing or depth is lost, only to be replaced by the tangibly physical, which fails to convey any sense of true intimacy.<br/><br/>Indeed, the characters never seem to come together.  They just seem to all be wandering around in their own little movies, never interacting beyond a few words.  This seriously undermines any sense of pathos when tragedies strike, and makes the film very sterile.  Moreover, the characters, even when taken alone, are utterly two-dimensional.  Perhaps four or five of the characters are given any decisive shape at all.  The rest are so insubstantial that, whatever happens to them, you simply don't care.<br/><br/>So, there we have it.  A romance without romance; a comedy without humour; a war movie without a sense of destruction or loss.  ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" fails in all categories.  And it doesn't even look that good. Cephallonia is a place of outstanding natural beauty, but even the cinematography - something I'd of thought they'd be bound to get right, if nothing else - seems strangely muted and washed-out.<br/><br/>I admit I take films seriously, but I also try to enjoy them, if I possibly can.  And in this case, I'm sorry, John Madden (who directed the wonderful ""Shakespeare In Love""), Nicolas Cage (a truly great character actor) and John Hurt (legend), but I couldn't."

","Lots of criticism have been heaped upon Captain Corelli's Mandolin. After having seen it myself, I'm rather positive myself about the movie. The beginning was rather slow and a little bit too sweet - the blooming romance between Pelagia and Mandras didn't convince me.<br/><br/>After history comes booming in, the tone of the movie changes dramatically. First of all, as an historian I have to give a lot of kudo's on the movie makers themselves for the virtually flawless depiction of WW2 Italian soldiers at war, and the same goes for the depiction of 1944 German soldiers, correctly dressed with mixed European and Afrika Korps uniforms. The researchers finally have done a very fine job on getting the uniforms and military settings right, unlike American ""war"" horror movies like The Guns from Navarone and Where Eagles Dare, where terrible mistakes in the composition of German military uniforms regularly spoil my appetite.<br/><br/>
A frequent criticism I've picked up is about the overacting of Nicholas Cage c.s. in their Italian soldiers' roles, with their opera singing and so on. I have to counter this strongly. As a Latin myself with ample knowledge of the Italian participation in WW2, I state that Italian soldiers often behaved like that, and not only them. For those interested, I strongly recommend the reading of all six parts of Spike Milligan's wartime memories, to see that peacetime overacting very often equates to wartime normal acting. I was sorry that Nicholas Cage, or Nicholas Coppola as he is in fact called, didn't work more on his Italian and retained his American twang throughout the movie, but whatever. Specially as the movie went on, he became more and more convincing as the theatrical artillery captain in the royal Italian army. And as for the actual historical framework depicted in the movie, I was fairly satisfied. I even noticed that history is in fact more accurately depicted in the movie than in the book!<br/><br/>About the storyline itself. Cage was a little bit ""less himself"", kind of subdued, very uncommon for him as an actor. John Hurt was rather convincing, as were most of the cast, but Penelope Cruz dissappointed me. Specially with the still unfaded Irene Papas at her side (Zorba the Greek), I noticed how plain she acted. The producers should have searched for a second Irene Papas and casted her as Pelagia!!!! If we talk about a flaw in the movie, it was her plain acting and her failure to react chemically with the Mandras character.<br/><br/>But on the whole, once the ""glorious"" Italian army, which surely earned our sympathy as poor blokes caught between a rock and a hard place, swaggered into Cephalonia, the movie gathers momentum, and doesn't lose it anymore."

It does not have the sense of love-torn apart by undue circumstances and reunited against all odds the movie's description tried to represent.<br/><br/>As far as the actors, I never sensed the chemistry between Penélope Cruz and Nicholas Cage.  Penélope Cruz's character Pelagia is convincingly filmed, but when she talks, I don't know what comes out, she isn't even trying to do a Greek accent.  Plus anytime she speak English, it sound monotonic and unconvincing, the only variation being her raising her voice.  She isn't as bad as she was in other movies, but she still didn't pull it off.  It was a big leap of faith for the producers to cast her on a such major role and their gamble did not pay.  Nicholas Cage's character Captain Antonio Corelli's Italian accent seems to only have one pitch, and when the acting gets demanding, it disappears.<br/><br/>Even if the 2 characters did fall in love and had their brief fling as depicted in the movie, I fail to see how Penélope Cruz's character fell out of love with her fiancee because she never saw him or had her mail replied (apparently, he can't read,) but could stay in love with Capt Corelli long after he left the island.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the story was decent, with movie going through tragedy, lovers separating and reuniting.

","Ever since the closing moments of `Notting Hill when the Hugh Grant character was seen reading the novel `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' with its distinctive blue cover, like so many fellow readers of this superb work I have looked forward eagerly to the film from the same British production company of Working Title. Essentially people's reaction to the movie is likely to depend on whether or not they are familiar with the book. My three companions at the cinema had not read the novel and loved the movie. I suspect that most of those who have savoured the written version will like me  leave with their undoubted pleasure tinged with a sense of disappointment.<br/><br/>Of course, a film always has to be different from the book, not least because of the distinctive media being used and the variable time available  and `Mandolin' is a particularly long and complex work. Therefore I can understand scriptwriter Shawn Slovo abandoning almost all the political references and concentrating on the romance, although I think that the result is a little too sanitised. I can even appreciate the need to change the ending and make it more immediate and emotionally satisfying. But was it really necessary to excise even the homo-erotic relationship between Corelli and his saviour Carlo?<br/><br/>The greatest strength of this work from British director John Madden (`Shakespeare In Love') is the island of Cephallonia itself and, whatever the extra cost, the decision to shoot it entirely on location has resulted in some wonderful photography and a sensuous feel to the whole work. The chief weakness is the casting. The gorgeous Spanish actress Penelope Cruz is perfect as the young object of Corelli's affections Pelagia and John Hurt is rather good as her father, the local physician Dr Iannis. But Nicolas Cage is seriously miscast as Antonio Corelli, with mannerisms and accent that defy credibility, while David Morrissey is even worse as the leading German on the island and Christian Bale little better as the rival for Pelagia's love, the fisherman turned resistance fighter Mandras."

Next question, can one of the world's more beautiful women with lips the size of the state of Georgia actually carry off a young woman from remote Greek island? They got the hair right and the make up was good, but those lips, not in a million years of evolution would those lips be found on a Greek island in 1940.

In concept I can believe that these two (Cage and Cruz) fall in love, but there is so little chemistry that it is fortunate that the good doctor is pushing the relationship (but why?).<br/><br/>For 90 minutes pretty much nothing happens which may be a reflection of how exciting duty was in Greece for the Italian army, but the ten minutes of bloodshed that comes is so much counter to the story that it seems gratuitous (what can we do for the men in the audience, oh let's shoot some people and blow up stuff) then there is the ending, are they in love? You tell me. We have Italians and Greeks, the world's models for passionate people, and yet I hardly could feel a moment of real tenderness or joy (the one exception coming when Cruz is thrown into the water by her Greek fisherman boy friend.

","I remember the fuss & bother about the original book's publication & since then I've come across a seemingly endless number of people who've bought it, but never finished it. If the film is anything to go by, I can understand why.<br/><br/>First of all the film has the natural advantage of being set in the Mediteranean, so you get the beautiful backgrounds of the sea, blue skies, lush olive groves & so on. Although I have no idea if it was filmed in the Greek islands that's what fills the screen & it's pleasing on the eye. The CGI German Stukas still look unreal, proving that the computer programmers have a long way to go even before they can replace objects, let alone people, but CGI is only to be expected when showing such rare aircraft in the massed formations used in World War 2. Gone are the days when films such as The Battle of Britain, or The Battle of Midway could be filmed with the real thing! Those ex-mlitary aircraft, once so plentiful to film studios when the airforces of the world fianlly got rid of their old piston engined fighters in the 1960s, have long since passed into museums & private collections.<br/><br/>As for the story, well I kept waiting for something to happen & all I got were a few fizzles & ultimately dissapointment. What does happen is so predicatable it's not worth the wait. The too-ing & fro-ing between the characters played by John Hurt, Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz & Chris Bale is yawnfully cliched & tired old stuff. Oh yes, it's a love triangle... how novel....'scuse me while I catch up on my sleep. There was one minor highlight very early on, where the town fathers wouldn't surrender to the Italians & insisted on a German officer instead, but that was about it.<br/><br/>It doesn't even try to maintain accuracy, like when the sea-mine is exploded. Yes it's nice to finally see something of what an explosion REALLY does & not what Hollywood likes to make you see, but the simple fact is that sea mines contained a ton or half a ton of explosives & despite the sand-bagged bunker Corelli used he'd be minced meat, quite literally so.<br/><br/>Also, can anyone tell me if the Germans ever used landing craft with drop fronts? As far as I was aware they never had anything like this in WW2. Maybe I'm wrong, but I suspect that modern day landing craft were used as the sight of barges lazily ploughing their way across the Aegean wasn't so dramatic.<br/><br/>As for the actors, well Nicholas Cage should give up hopes of ever putting on an accent ever again. It was AWFUL! Overall he wasn't convincing either, something I can't put my finger on, but he was woefully miscast in the part of Corelli.<br/><br/>As for Penelope Cruz.....well she's as sour faced as ever & simply uninteresting. Although the latter may have been a product of the overall disinterest I had in the film I have since seen her in the far more interesting ""Blow"" & the same impression lingered. She has a nice figure, no doubt about it, & the guys will cheer when she gets her top off for a roll in the hay with Corelli. But she's got that Audrey Hepburn thin neck/big head combination that looks like she will break at any moment. It also makes her look anorexic at times too.<br/><br/>John Hurt ( the Brit') discharges his role with understated ease....aided by the fact that his character seemingly doesn't have much to do, despite being center stage for a lot of the time.<br/><br/>Chris Bale wanders around as the third corner of the Cruz/Cage menage au trois, alternating between heroic, sympathetic, pathetic, to rebelious. All in all I'm left with the conclusion that the story simply doesn't give the actors enough to do. Nick Cage's Corelli does seemingly have an indestructable nature, he survives being bombed, shot & blown up (the sea mine incident), to return to his beloved greek girl (Cruz). The earthquake of 1947 is shown, why I don't know, maybe it was a real incident that had to be worked into the story, but it just seems to happen & what it's supposed to mean I'm not at all sure.<br/><br/>It's hard to be so down on a movie, but that's the way it goes with something like this. I'm glad to say that the night wasn't wasted, I'd rented ""The Rutles"", so had plenty to laugh at this week (a BBC comedy, half Monty Python, Half Saturday Night Live based on the life of the Beatles & the inspiration for ""This Is Spinal Tap""...try it, you won't be disapointed).<br/><br/>For those who rent this on DVD, forget any bonus material, no cut scenes, out takes, behind the scenes, or ""making of"" stuff, completeing on DVD the overall disapointment of the film."

","Based on a popular novel by Louis de Bernieres, John Madden's 2001 adaptation of ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is a pleasing, if flawed, film that may enrage fans of the book. Filmed on the Greek island of Cephalonia and set during World War II, the story revolves around the romance between Pelagia, daughter of a local doctor, and Captain Corelli, an Italian soldier stationed on the island with his company. Romantic entanglements ensue when Corelli is billeted in the doctor's home; Pelagia is already engaged to Mandras, a hunky local fisherman, and danger escalates when German troops arrive to assume command after Mussolini surrenders to the Allies.<br/><br/>Enhanced by John Toll's gorgeous cinematography of the Adriatic island and Stephen Warbeck's beautiful score that includes the haunting ""Pelagia's Song"" or ""Ricordo Ancor,"" which is sung over the closing credits by Russell Watson, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" could have been a classic romance of love amidst war. The casting began well with Penelope Cruz, who is perfection as Pelagia. However, after Cruz, the casting falters, before ultimately flopping. While John Hurt is a stretch as a Greek doctor, his skill as an actor makes him credible in the role. Christian Bale as the young Greek fisherman is a bigger stretch, but he too tries valiantly, although his accent comes up short. The biggest problem is Nicholas Cage as Corelli; while Cage is of Italian descent, he reeks American and is completely wrong for the part. Cage's performance seems as forced as Cruz's is effortless; her attraction to the big lumbering oaf with a bent for opera is unconvincing and leaves the film with a gaping whole at its center. The script by Shawn Slovo abbreviates the novel and also sidesteps a critical point; Slovo cuts the pivotal character of Carlo to little more than a cameo and thus obscures the motivation for a crucial moment in the story.<br/><br/>While the film was a major disappointment when the novel was fresh in mind, time has been kind, and, with expectations lessened, the pleasures of ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" emerge. Penelope Cruz is Pelagia, and her lovely performance is the film's major asset. Add the location cinematography, a small role by the incomparable Irene Papas, and the unforgettable song ""Ricordo Ancor,"" and many fans of romantic movies may enjoy a film that throws light on a barbaric near-forgotten episode during World War II. Some viewers may also be inspired to seek out the novel, which expands and deepens the events depicted in the film. Otherwise, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" can be classified as a guilty pleasure for a rainy afternoon."

","It's 1940 Greece. Cephallonia is an island of traditions. Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) is the daughter of Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) and girlfriend to childish fisherman Mandras (Christian Bale). Fighting breaks out between Greece and Italy. Mandras goes off to war vowing to marry Pelagia upon his return. The Axis forces march onto the island with no resistance. Italian Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage) and his men never fire a shot. Mandras returns terribly injured and then joins the partisans. Despite initial hatred, Pelagia falls for Corelli and his mandolin. Captain Günther Weber (David Morrissey) is the awkward German trying to befriend Corelli. When Italy surrenders, allegiances change.<br/><br/>The Anglo-American lead actors strip away the Mediterranean heat. Cage is playing up the quirkiness unnecessarily. Bale can never pass for an islander. Everybody is doing an accent. There is no chemistry between anybody. Cruz is left with no worthy dance partner. There are no compelling relationships and the movie suffers. It's a warmed-up wartime period piece romance."

","Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001): Dir: John Madden / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz, John Hurt, Christian Bale, David Morrissey: Mandolin refers to peace with hardship. If that is really the case, then I could have used one during the screening of this stupid charade. Nicolas Cage stars as Captain Corelli who arrives in town with his fellow German soldiers. He will house with a local doctor who is against the arrangement until they accommodate him with medical supplies. Then he asks, ""Where will I sleep?"" to which the doctor responds, ""In my daughter's room."" Then Cage asks the million dollar question, ""And where will your daughter sleep?"" She hisses, ""It's none of your business where I sleep!"" Such pitiful advertising, as if anyone cannot figure that out. Yes, they fall in love, war breaks out, tears are shed, blah, blah, blah. It's about as entertaining as a bag of horse crap. Similar to John Madden's superior Shakespeare in Love but doesn't contain his same skill. John Hurt as the doctor deserves better than this. Cage sounds dumb-ass stupid with that German accent, and his parading about for Cruz's affection is embarrassing. Penelope Cruz plays this obvious bimbo whom the audience can figure out long before she can get a clue. This is about as stupid as that pathetic Pearl Harbor was months earlier.

","Regarding the Axis powers of WWII, we have always been willing to cut the Italians a big old break. The Japanese pulled a sneak attack on us at Pearl Harbor, and the Germans were responsible for the holocaust, but we like to think that the Italians were basically good people who just got carried away by Mussolini's speeches. And so, an actual incident during the war, when the Italians teamed up with the Greeks to fight against their former allies, the Germans, fits right in with our disposition to grant the Italians favorable treatment.<br/><br/>In the movie, the Italian soldiers that occupy a Greek island have not seen any real action, but that is not surprising, because I have never seen an Italian soldier kill an American in a World War II movie. Moreover, they don't seem to care about the war. They just want to sing opera. Isn't that nice? The Greeks also seem to like the Italians better. Nobody seems to have a problem with the fact that Palagia is obviously in love with an Italian officer, Captain Corelli, and even has sex with him; but another girl, who just gives a German officer a friendly kiss on the cheek, is hanged by the Greeks for being a traitor.<br/><br/>Reality or no reality, the decision by the Italians to fight with the Greeks against the Germans rather than simply handing over their arms when Mussolini surrenders turns out to be a big mistake, because except for Corelli, they are all slaughtered by the Germans for being traitors. But then, that only makes us like the Italians even more."
"SimonJack","9","0","0","6 August 2014"," A war and love story about Italy and Greek islanders in WW II
","""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is based on a 1994 novel of the same name. I haven't read British author Louis de Berniéres' book; so my take on this story is solely based on the quality of the film. I first saw the movie in a theater when it came out. I enjoyed it enough, that years later I bought the DVD – primarily for my WW II movie collection. I have since watched this film a couple of times. <br/><br/>Those who read and enjoy history know the general story of Italy's involvement in WW II. Under the tyrant Mussolini, the Italians went to war on the side of Nazi Germany. We also know that most Italians' hearts were not with their official cause. So, after Mussolini was overthrown on July 25, 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allies. Nicolas Cage, as Capt. Corelli, makes that point in the film when he says that Italy surrendered to Great Britain and the United States – not to Germany. The Italians in southern Italy later fought with the Allies; while in the North under German control, the Italians were involved in many underground operations. They hid Jews and helped downed Allied pilots escape, and carried out espionage against the Germans. <br/><br/>This movie, like the book it's based on, is a story of Italians who were sent to occupy the large Greek island of Cephalonia. And, of their heroic conflict with the superior German forces after Italy surrendered to the Allies. It is also a story about the island, its people and tumultuous history. And, it is a love story about the Italian captain and the island doctor's daughter, Pelagia, played by Penélope Cruz. <br/><br/>The acting, directing and all aspects of this film are excellent. The cinematography is outstanding. The film was made on the island of Cephalonia. When I first saw this film, and since then, I've recalled another recent unusual film set in Italy in the war. ""Life is Beautiful"" came out in 1997. It was filmed in Italian, German and English, and won 3 Oscars of 7 nominations. It was a warmly told story about a Jewish father who makes a game out of his family's incarceration by the Germans in order to save his young son's life and spare him the horror of what was happening. <br/><br/>That film endeared movie-goers at the time – if not all of the industry critics. ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" didn't fare as well. It had a big budget -- $57 million, but the critics mostly didn't like it, and it wasn't a box office hit. It is an American-made movie with American actors. But it is set in the actual location of the story. While the story is different, I think it is of the same ilk as the earlier film. It shows hope and humanity amidst tyranny. I think this film does an excellent job with its story. It is a very good love story as well, and I highly recommend it. <br/><br/>I especially like the lines by Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) when he explains true love to his daughter, Pelagia (Penélope Cruz). He says, ""When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness. It is not excitement. It is not the desire to mate every second of the day. It is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every part of your body. No! Don't blush! I'm telling you some truths. That is just being in love, which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over, when being is love has burned away. Doesn't sound very exciting, does it? But it is."""

","I didn't read the book, so I didn't have expectations either way when I watched this movie. I bought the DVD as ""previously viewed"" because I like Nicolas Cage. I loved the movie myself, for several reasons. I'm an incurable romantic, so I loved the romance. I knew that the romance between Pelagia, (Penelope Cruz), and Madras, (Christian Bale), was doomed from the start, for the same reason stated by her father, (John Hurt). He just wasn't her intellectual equal. They would never have had a happy marriage. Plus, he demonstrated that he took her love for granted by not getting a literate friend to answer her letters. What an idiot! He just didn't deserve her. It's no wonder that she stopped loving him. It's also no wonder that, in spite of herself, she fell in love with a cultured, literate, music loving man like Captain Corelli, (Nicolas Cage). I also love location movies with majestic scenery. It's one of the things that make The Great Escape such a great movie. I'm also a military history buff, especially WWII history. I love it when I learn something new about WWII from a movie. That's another thing this movie has in common with TGE. It's reasonably historically accurate, (see the Wikipedia articles ""Axis occupation of Greece in World War II"" in the section ""Nazi atrocities"" and ""Kefalonia"" in the section ""World War II""). It's a historical fact that the average Italian civilian or soldier had no great love for either Mussolini or Fascism. It's also a historical fact that the Nazis knew this, and so they didn't have much respect for the Italians. However, I hadn't known about how the Germans turned on the Italians like rabid dogs after Italy surrendered to the Allies. That said, it came as no surprise when it happened in the movie. It also didn't surprise me that Captain Weber, (David Morrissey), was sickened by the atrocity. It's another historical fact that the majority of German soldiers and sailors, both officers and enlisted men, weren't Nazis, and had no great love for those who were. With a few exceptions, most of the atrocities carried out by the German military were done by the SS, the concentration camp guards, or by special groups that were made up entirely of fanatical Nazis. Never forget that the German military was organized on the Prussian model, which emphasized strict obedience to superiors, and for officers, rigid adherence to their oaths. Which is why Hitler had the German officer corps swear an oath of personal allegiance to him after he came to power. To those who couldn't understand why the partisans hung the woman who showed affection to the German officer and didn't do the same to Pelagia, it was BECAUSE the woman showed affection to a German, and Pelagia fell in love with an Italian, who fought to resist the Germans in the end. Finally, to those who knock this movie because it's different from the book, SO WHAT? When is a movie adaptation EVER totally faithful to the book it's based on? Also I read in someone else's post that the author finally admitted that he didn't do enough research and got his facts wrong in his portrayal of the partisans. So, all in all these are the reasons I LOVE this movie, and I urge anyone who either hasn't read the book, or realizes that the movie isn't going to be a carbon copy of it, or has an interest in WWII history, or is an incurable romantic like me, to see this movie. 10/10"

She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings. Aside from the love story angle I thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true devastation war can have on its people...government makes the decision whereas the people suffer.

Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.

","Few words can adequately describe quite how bad this movie is. Having not read the book, I didn't come with expectations of how the characters should look or act. There is not a single moment of truth in this film - in other words, the 'actors' (and I use the term loosely) always look as if they're play-acting in a film. None of them become the characters they are meant to be portraying. Many of them look as if they want to laugh. If the characters are Greek or Italian the would, in reality, speak Greek or Italian. This being a film for the English speaking world, instead they use accented English. It is amusing when someone reads aloud from a letter written in Greek - which is seen on screen - and does so in English. But the problem really was the variety of accents. Was there no voice coach on this film? Not one of the actors comes close to voicing 'Greek-English'. Penelope Cruz sounds determinedly Spanish while John Hurt and Christian Bale have obviously been studying Tomi Conti's lamentable accent in Shirly Valentine. David Morrisey - a fine actor who has appeared in many British TV productions - gives a woeful performance as a German, with another accent of no fixed abode. Nicolas Cage - vastly overrated as an actor - is dead in the eyes and never brings Captain Corelli alive for one moment. Given that Hurt is a brilliant actor, Bale wonderful in American Psycho and Cruz amazing in All About My Mother, the performances they give in this film are superficial and extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>The film - mercifully short at around 2 hours - looks as if it were cobbled together, so bad is the narrative. There is no sense of time or pace and the crowd scenes have obviously been cobbled together using local extras (I presume). During the war scenes, dead people are artfully arranged on the ground, false dollops of blood on their shoulders or backs. There is no sense of the horror of war. Noone seems particularly frightened when they're being shot at.<br/><br/>No one seems to have aged or developed during the course of the film - with the exception of some obviously false facial hair on Christian Bale. John Madden, who directed the wonderful Mrs Brown, is perhaps out of his depth bnut has not been aided by the script or the performers.<br/><br/>On the plus side (yes, there is one) the scenery is wonderful and because of that, thousands will probably flock to the island where it was filmed. At least the director of photography did a good job.<br/><br/>If there is a worse big budget film this year, I will be extremely surprised. Save your money; Don't go."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was under the impression that Nicolas Cage's character was an American soldier, and that Penelope Cruz was the Italian. This was thought because of Cage's horrific attempt at an Italian accent with the line ""Bella bambina at 12 o'clock"" (or something like that). I assumed he was trying to fake an accent to be silly as he was marching around what I thought was Italy. The accents were horrible, and as always, Penelope Cruz sounds like a squeaky chihuahua trying to squeeze out her lines. And lets not forget about Christian Bales accent, wow, sounded like he was trying to speak through a ball of cotton stuffed in his mouth. And if the accents weren't bad enough, during the love scene between Cage and Cruz, you get a glimpse of pit hair from not Cage, but Cruz! Maybe that was the norm for women in Greece back then, but that's not what just doesn't fly in a love scene these days.

And I agree that Penelope Cruz's performance was hardly stellar. But there are lots worse films out there.<br/><br/>And this film does have some very good qualities. It's a war movie that's less about war than it is about the every day tragedies that befall the locals who are caught up in war. The cinematography and scenery is excellent, and on location. And it reminds us that even in war, soldiers are still people, and not necessarily very different than ourselves. Although the film has a happy ending, there is a great deal of tragedy in between, so there is a sense of realism here.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage's performance here is actually quite good, even if the accent isn't...and I say that as no fan of Cage. John Hurt is good as the doctor, Christian Bale very good as the young fiancé, and Gunther Weber is fine as the Nazi soldier with the most contact with the people. It's also good to see Irene Papas as an authentic Greek.<br/><br/>I think this is a pretty decent film. A balance between the horror of war and the joy that can be found in many adverse situations.

","I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was fairly good since it had a pretty fitting title, but I was somewhat disappointed with the acting and the ending. ""Capitan Corelli's Mandolin"" is a perfect title for this movie, since it tells about the way Capitan Corelli played his mandolin quite well. The mandolin signifies so many things in this movie. For instance, he could have felt happy by playing it for his love Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) or he just wanted to help relieve the tension. <br/><br/>During a war it's obviously quite difficult to be happy or peaceful; this mandolin signifies many things in this movie: love, cleverness, happiness, etc. I think this is why I liked it. This mandolin is very important for Capitan Corelli, since it's his only refuge to show his love, hope, triumph and peace. This movie is very valuable to me and requires a thoughtful watcher. It's the only Nicolas Cage movie I have liked so far.<br/><br/>The plot is well told. John Madden (Shakespeare's in love director) has made another worthy film in which he keeps the viewer interested in knowing what will happen to Capitan Corelli and Pelagia's love after the war; he shows us they could be very happy after the war.  Penélope Cruz was appropriate to star as Capitan Corelli's lover. She wasn't that great, but she shows us her good acting skills, even though she's from Spain. She also shows us that people from Spanish speaking countries can be good at acting. Christian Bale played Mandras rather well, it shows us he was also appropriate to play this character; he really did it much better than his earlier role in American Psycho. It's amazing to see him letting Capitan Corelli live after being so hurt by the Germans.<br/><br/> `Capitan Corelli's Mandolin"" takes us to Greece in 1940, where the Second World War is going to start. Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) and Mandras (Christian Bale) are in love; they will get married after Mandras returns from fighting for his country. Pelagia meets the Italian Capitan Corelli who is living in her house. Capitan Corelli falls in love with Pelagia and vice versa; however, they know it'll be a frustrated love, since she's engaged with Mandras who is fighting for his country and will come back to marry her. The war takes place and many Italians get killed, and Capitan Corelli gets hurt badly. Overall this is not a bad production, but I'd hoped for much more. 7/10"

","I haven't read Louis de Berniere's book, and don't know anything about the history, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the film to either*. But Captain Corelli's Mandolin stood on it's own as a beautiful & moving story set on the stunningly lovely Greek island of Cephalonia. Go and see it if only for a sneak preview of your next holiday destination! Nicolas Cage's accent, shall we say, under-utilised his Italian background, but this is fairly easily ignored if you set out to enjoy the movie. Penelope Cruz carries the movie - she is gorgeous as Pelagia. There is an interesting bit just when Pelagia's local beau is about to leave to fight & he gives a lovely on-bended-knee speech, but only to set her up for a gag, as it turns out. Our emotions are easily aligned with Pelagia' feelings of confused humiliation.  The relationship between Pelagia & her father (John Hurt) is sweet & lightly drawn. <br/><br/>*Go & see Captain Corelli's Mandolin even if you get uptight about the possibility that the movie will be different from the book - they're completely different mediums & movies can't possibly reproduce in every detail what's is a book, or vice versa."

","The movie was taken from the book, ""Corelli's Mandolin.""  The author apparently listed every human emotion he could think of and tried to incorporate them all into one book.  I didn't read it but that's how the movie turned out.  It has humor, instrumental and vocal music, graphic violence, magnificent scenery, history, nature on the rampage, dancing, naked women, war-time atrocities, anticipated and unanticipated plot twists, and philosophy, all provided by an excellent cast.  I didn't anticipate, and was a bit put off by, the level of violence.  But, if you read the dedication at the end, you'll understand why it had to be.  Nicolas Cage has become my favorite contemporary actor.  He didn't disappoint.  Penelope Cruz is a gifted actress and, while IMHO she's not Sophia Loren/Rita Hayworth/Ingrid Bergman beautiful, it's hard to take your eyes off her. I've never seen John Hurt give anything less than a terrific performance. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this one, I don't see any reason to continue awarding them.  In one scene, he explains to Cruz (his film daughter) what love is.  All I can say is, ""Wow!!!""  I've seen better movies this year.  But this one is plenty good enough to more than justify the price of admission."
"azaro666","6","1","2","6 May 2001"," A real let down
","Luckily for me I have not got round to reading the literature upon which this movie is supposedly based on. I say luckily because my opinion on the film would probably have been far more harsh than the one I have at the moment. The problem with the film is that it just doesn't seem to want to do anything for itself. It is more than content with simply letting the camera rove around the spectacular scenery. Don't get me wrong it is breath-taking to watch some beautiful things, but if I wanted to see that  and that only I would watch the discovery channel or holiday programmes.<br/><br/>John Madden had promised so much from his recent efforts, and had showed his audience that he was more than capable of handling drama in such a way as to make us care about the characters. However, this just isn't possible. Maybe there is something wrong with the script, because there is so little dialogue that sticks out. Maybe there was some concern from the studio as to the length of the film, it certainly feels as though it has had huge chunks taken away from it, because no studio in the world would let such a shallow piece of writing be made. <br/><br/>One almost feels as though the spectacle of the novel and its success may well have been enough to secure money, and a big box office, and so the writing of dialogue took second place to everything else. I mean look at the cast that they were able to secure, Cage, Bale, Hurt, Cruz, four actors whose most recent films have made them A-list quality. It has all the ingredients to be a film remembered and admired.<br/><br/>The cast though is, mostly dreadful. Nicolas Cage, who is said to have Italian decendancy is mocking in his performance and although he tries to shape off this loveable nonchalant man, the accent simply makes him look mugging. Penelope Cruz walks around for two hours pouting and refusing to drop the accent which is here forte. Hurt gives a solid performance though and Bale continues to play good supporting roles.<br/><br/>The films biggest pratfall though is its confusion to let the audience know what it is actually trying to tell us. There is, what feels like, a love story but why is there love. There is no occasions upon which any chemistry happens, nor incidents which would make two people love each other, only once does he play the mandolin for her. There is also the war story which takes up half of the film and really makes you empathise with Correlis plight but that soon wilts away as the love story comes back. It would have been predictable had the film had any direction, but by never finsihing anything it starts and by leaving the audience asking why it simply fizzles out. <br/><br/>Readers of the book will probably say 'its not the book, but it is still brilliant' but the fact is that book or not, it is a badly acted film which is unsure of what it is functioning as love story/ war movie/ moral tale/ national pride. It is unclear and very much a let down."
"timyang","Null","1","2","5 May 2001"," A flawed movie
","The problem with producing a movie based on a book is that sometimes movie-makers try to turn the book into a movie. <br/><br/>The texture of the book is found in the detailed and poetic prose that describe the anecdotes of the quirky characters and explained parts of their lives and their motivations. For example, there is Father Antonio who gets alcohol poisoning because he is too greedy for the offerings his parishioners bring. There's Mandras, the idealistic and playful fisherman who finds his soulmates while swimming with dolphins. There's Carlo Guercio the gay Italian soldier who falls in love with another solider Francesco who inspires him to heroic acts that even his Greek enemies cheer. There's Dr Iannis who speaks with the longest words he can find for no other reason than he is Greek. The book is filled with these stories so much so that there's hardly any space left for the love story of Captain Correlli and Pelagia.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to cram as many of the stories into the first 40 minutes. The book managed to pace itself with luscious descriptions of the island, but movies with their finite time spans and budgets do not have that luxury. The result is that pacing was completely lost and felt hurried and cramped. I also felt that the actors seemed to feel the pacing and hurried in their speeches as well, especially Nicolas Cage. Certainly each scene by itself was a credit to the director, cinematographer and the actors in them, but the editor left hardly a pause for the audience to take a breath and inhale the atmosphere. I would have loved to see what the movie would have been like if it were three hours long instead of its paltry one hour and 50 minutes. <br/><br/>This is not to say that the moviemakers are completely to blame. The author himself bears a certain degree of responsibility. In his book, Louis de Benieres furnished each character with a chapter for themselves so that the wonderful tales of their lives and loves could be told. Yet conspicuously missing is the one for Captain Corelli. Captain Corelli in the book became more like a machine that was built for spouting one-liners and for buffoonery and only appeared toward the middle of it. I'm suggesting that the character of Captain Corelli was nowhere near developed enough to centre a movie around. I've always felt that the best love stories only fluorished in backdrops of drama and social and cultural tension. There was none of that during the occupation on the island of Cephalonnia thanks to the incessant camaraderie between the native Greeks and the Italian soldiers who occupied their island. Thus the love story had so little drama that it felt more like a teenage crush story with all its awkwardness and assumptions. I would stick my neck out to suggest that de Benieres wrote in the character of Captain Corelli and named the book after him as a cynical joke played on his publishers after they insisted that a book of the inhabitants of a tiny Greek island during its occupation in World War II would not sell as well as a romance novel. <br/><br/>Having said all that, I would recommend that you watch the movie and read the book. In that order. You can introduce yourself to the characters during the movie. But allow the book to flesh them out for you. Trust me on this."

","I enjoyed this film much more than I expected to, and that was largely due to the high standard of the acting.  It's true that some of the accents were poor - especially John Hurt, who veered between upper-class English and some kind of anonymous Mediterranean dialect.  That aside, all the main characters were convincing.  I particularly liked Christian Bale and Penelope Cruz.  David Morrissey as the young German officer also showed why he is hammering on the door of stardom. This film had nearly everything - humour, pathos, violence and sex, plus beautiful scenery.  However, it began to drag towards the end, and I found the denouement totally unconvincing.  But, as modern films go, it was pretty good.  I think it will go down as a minor classic."

","Captain Corelli's Mandolin (the movie) is a beautiful movie and the acting, especially by John Hurt, is quality. However, it is presented purely as a romantic story, while the books speaks so much more about the brutality of war.<br/><br/>Take, for example, Mandras. In the book he starts off nice but mildly sexist and then is transformed by the brutality of his war experience in Albania and the Partisans to a cold-blooded murderer. Now in the film he turns into just the loser of a love triangle. But not completely... he still hangs the woman who likes the German. Why? It goes against his film character (although fits with the book character).<br/><br/>And the film ending. Well, its how a love story should end. But CCM is really about how war tears people's lives apart and how we can make the best of it. The book's ending wasn't perfect either, but it was better."

","In Britain, you can guarantee that there's always someone on the Tube reading the novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. You can also guarantee that anyone who has read it will say, 'How can they make it into a film?' I also thought that, but was not disappointed. Set on the island of Cephalonia, CCM basically tells the love story between Pelagia (Penny Cruz) and Captain Antonio Corelli (Cage), set against the unfolding story of WW2. It changes elements of the book (as it had to), but for the good and is shot intelligently, sympathetically and beautifully, with some marvellous performances - John Hurt being a notable. OK, so it doesn't tell the book word for word and it distorts some of the original history, but it looks wonderful, is engaging and very emotional.

The hanging of that girl is the best metaphor of the evil these terrorists committed. Being Greek I understand the damage these people caused terrorising the country until their defeat in 1949.<br/><br/>It is also worth mentioning that anyone from that part of the world saw the Italians as the villains and the Germans as occupiers at worst and usually liberators, since September 11 it is worth noting that one should not view lightly those such as Captain Corelli who would so easily give weapons to the Al Qaeda of the 1940's.<br/><br/>And it down plays the significance of the Greek victories over Italy in Albania, where 70,000 Greeks smashed 250,000 italians, and would have held off the Germans indefinitely if the Yugoslavs had not faltered."

His Italian accent sucked but his lousy performance probably had no better directing than the rest of the film and nobody ever accused him of being an actor or artist anyway.

Not so in the book, which makes more of Carlos's adoration and of course his final sacrifice when he saves the captains life by falling on him while being shot.<br/><br/>While on the island on my last trip, I took a long walk towards Argostoli and came a across what looked like the remains of a cavern or quarry protected by a fence. Surrounding it either side was a stony wall.The farmer nearby mowing his field had left the gate unlocked and I walked in and stood at the edge looking down at a plaque on a wall with a bunch of flowers arranged by it. It was here on this spot that I realised 136 men of the Italian Acqui division were shot dead by the Nazis. The Greeks with respect, buried the Italians bodies at the same spot. I felt terrible knowing the view point I had was one that would have been seen by a German soldier as he looked down on these poor men as they were executed.<br/><br/>So many tourists pass this peaceful little place without any idea of its tragic past.The film only portrays one of these terrible executions, but they took place all over the island of Kefalonio.

","OK, so what really, really frustrates me about this movie is that it could actually have been great. Let me start by saying that the book engaged me to the point where I got so frustrated with the two central characters - Captain Corelli and Pelagia - that I actually hurled the book at the wall. Rarely has any book touched me so deeply. You really get to know and love the characters. Therefore, to try and incorporate the book into just over two hours is just insane, as for one thing, you don't get the scale of this love affair which goes on over decades. When I found out that Nic Cage was to play the Captain, I was thrilled. When I then found out that Christian Bale was to play Mandras, John Hurt to play Pelagia's father and David Morrissey to play Weber, I was ecstatic and couldn't wait for the film to be completed. Effectively, all the right ingredients were there for this to be a classic. When I subsequently went to see the film, I was underwhelmed, annoyed and disappointed. The film actually looks beautiful but it only has about half the story in it. The development of the Carlos' character is sadly lacking. Major liberties have been taken with some of the central events in the book. For me, this should have been at least 200 minutes long in order to adequately do justice to the book. A Greek tragedy but not in the right way."

Yeah that's about it.<br/><br/>Really. <br/><br/>The book is a masterpiece of literature and the film chops a major character down to a few lines, another character to a few moments, and major historical plots to insignificant references. Plus the book has the courage of a sad ending whereas the film goes to a happy ending, and still a happy end is what you'd wish because the characters ""deserve"" it. I gave the film a 9 because managing to make a coherent film when you have thrown away (for lack of time) two thirds of a script and still make such a wonderful film, with actors that fit so well in their role, a film where you will cry and where you will be afraid like you're 6 and everything that happens on the screen is for real, please please forgive them for salvaging the core of the script and making you want to read the book, which will keep you fascinated and remain in your memory for the rest of your days.<br/><br/>The story - but do you really need this in a nutshell? - is about acts of heroism and love and the horrors of the war.

"meliajanssen","Null","1","3","23 October 2004"," Another love-war drama
","I agreed with another commentator's review that John Hurt should've received at least a nomination for Best Supporting Oscar. I was first bewildered that he was cast as a Greek doctor coz I had always thought John Hurt was one of the most 'British' actors I'd seen on screen but he pulled it off very well, from his tanned complexion (much thanks to the location I guess) down to his impeccable accent. Nicholas Cage tried to do his best and you could see his diversity and I appreciated the efforts he took, especially since he has Italian roots (Coppola). Christian Bale also shone as Greek patriot desperate to fight for his country and he was so passionate that I could almost fall in love with him. The worst miscasting however, was that of Penelope Cruz. Yes, the role was supposed to be of a simple Greek island girl and perhaps they couldn't find any other actress who was beautiful but not too extravagantly gorgeous that it'd make her believable in the role. But Penelope Cruz couldn't grasp the Greek accent and she had no chemistry with either Nicholas Cage nor Christian Bale.<br/><br/>They did stretch the movie out to show the intensity between Captain Corelli and Pelagia before they actually made a love. I tend to squirm at supposed love dramas which have nothing but sex. The movie showed that Pelagia was desperately in love with Mandras but his patriotism was too much for her handle and instead she fell in love with Captain Corelli's carefree ways. It took a while but I shan't question the director for the length though it could probably test your patience a bit.<br/><br/>If anything else, the location and gorgeous scenery make up for any defects the movie has. I can't stand war movies but I make exceptions for movies like this coz the scenery makes up for the violence and intensity of the plot. If anything, they score points on cinematography."

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","3","25 June 2004"," Different to the Book, but still Attractive
","Contains spoilers<br/><br/>Victorian novelists frequently contrived implausibly happy endings to their stories in order to meet the expectations of their reading public. The classic example is Charles Dickens's decision to change the ending of 'Great Expectations' because his readers expected the novel to end with the marriage of Pip and Estella. The modern reading public, or at least those of sophisticated tastes, have been conditioned to regard happy endings as false and sentimental, so the modern author of literary fiction is under pressure to contrive implausibly unhappy endings, even to stories that would be improved by a happy one. I have always thought that Louis de Bernieres' otherwise excellent novel provides a good example of this phenomenon; just as its internal logic seems to be leading up to the union of Corelli and Pelagia, the author conjures up a bizarre set of circumstances to frustrate it. Unlike many of those who saw the film after reading the book, therefore, I have no problem with the fact that the filmmakers decided to reverse the novel's ending. <br/><br/>The story is set on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the Second World War. Following the defeat of Greece, Cephalonia is occupied by a detachment of Italian troops. The main plot concerns a romance between the Italian Captain Corelli and Pelagia, the daughter of a local doctor. The first half of the film, which deals with this burgeoning love-affair, is fairly slow moving and gentle, at times even comical, in tone. The second half, however, contains more action and is darker in tone. The fall of Mussolini and the defection of Italy to the Allied side provoke a tragic confrontation between the Italian forces and their erstwhile German allies. <br/><br/>Some simplification of such a complex novel is inevitable when it is transferred to the screen, but quite apart from the change in the film's ending, there were other changes to de Bernieres' plot that worked less well on screen. The main one concerned the character of the fisherman Mandras, Pelagia's former lover whom she jilts in favour of Corelli. In the book, Mandras is a largely unsympathetic character who becomes a fanatical Communist and turns into a violent and arrogant bully. In the film, he is shown as simple and uneducated, but brave and honourable, without ideological motivation except love of his country. The filmmakers do not seem to realize that this change also has implications for the way we see Pelagia. A woman who deserts a gallant resistance hero for an enemy of her country, even if that enemy is on a personal level a likable individual, makes an unlikely romantic heroine. The film is largely devoid of political content; it is perhaps a sign that the Cold War is well and truly over when Hollywood manages to remove the politics from one of the most anti-communist novels of recent times. <br/><br/>The other change I did not like concerned Corelli's friend Carlo who dies saving his life. In the book, Carlo is a major character, but in the film he is a relatively minor one, and all reference to his homosexuality is removed. I felt that this spoil this part of the film, as Carlo's sexuality is important to an understanding of his character and of his motivation for saving Corelli. Another criticism I would have concerns the use of accents; all the actors, whether they were supposed to be playing Italians or Greeks, used virtually indistinguishable assumed 'continental' accents, which meant that it was difficult to differentiate between the two nationalities.<br/><br/>Despite my criticisms, my overall impression of the film was a favorable one. With the exception of the miscast Nicholas Cage who seemed too old and insufficiently vivacious to fit my idea of Corelli, I felt all the main actors played their parts well. The film was visually very attractive, and the photography made good use of the beauty of the scenery of the Ionian islands. Although some of the deeper issues raised by the book have been removed, what remains is still an attractive love-story and in places a moving story of men at war. 7/10. <br/><br/>A couple of goofs:- Rome fell to the Allies in 1944, not 1943 as stated in the film. Mussolini did not surrender to the British and Americans; the surrender was made by the new government of Marshal Badoglio, which was at the time holding Mussolini as a prisoner. I understand that in modern Greek the name Pelagia is pronounced, and more correctly transliterated, as 'Pelayia'; some of the actors used this pronunciation, but others pronounced it incorrectly with a hard 'g'."

","At the lowest level, this is about people surviving the worst that war and nature can throw at them. At the end of the film, the Greeks of Cephalonia can still celebrate traditional festivals, even after all the tragedy of the seven years which this film covers.<br/><br/>The true victims of the war are the unmilitary Italian army who occupy Cephalonia after Greece surrenders to Hitler. Captain Corelli, played by Nicholas Cage, exemplifies them; he hasn't seen action, and would rather not. He and his men would rather be a choir or a musical ensemble than a fighting unit. When they must fight the ruthless Germans, they are exterminated.<br/><br/>As might be expected from a film made on a holiday destination, the scenery is mouth-watering. The music (Greek traditional and liturgical, and Italian opera, and the theme tune) is equally delightful.<br/><br/>There are very few things which I found less than satisfactory. Cage's Italian accent seems a little laboured. (I must applaud his musical skills here, though). John Hurt's rasping delivery has perhaps been a little over-used in recent years, so his portrayal of an irascible Greek doctor also struck me as slightly contrived. Christian Bale's embittered resistance fighter seems equally unreal. Penelope Cruz on the other hand, does fit very well with her looks and accent.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a lovely film, well worth seeing."

","Surely, for a film that is based on a novel to be any good, it actually has to resemble said novel in some way?  This film, however, does not. Carlo's character, one of the major players in the novel, is completely and utterly shut out (under-written would be a huge understatement), while the character of Mandras is so ridiculous it made me wince.  In the novel he turns into a character full of resentment and bitterness, hates Corelli, tries to rape Pelagia, is disowned by his own mother and then commits suicide.  In the film, however, he is portrayed as noble - a good man who bows out of his relationship with Pelagia in order to ""make her happy"".  He even joins forces with Corelli at one point!  The films also ends too early - the novel goes on for over 20 years after the war and accounts for Corelli and Pelagia's future, and serves to reinforce the sense of loss - one of the story's main themes.  The film ends in 1947, though, with the earthquake which, in the novel, kills Iannis.  In the film, Pelagia simply finds him sitting by the rubble of their home, slightly flustered.<br/><br/>Other characters such as Velisarios and Father Arsenios, as well as less important characters like Bunny Warren, are either missing or tremendously overlooked.  The sheer disregard of the novel shown by Shawn Slovo's abysmal script are an insult to de Bernieres' views and opinions that he tried to convey by telling the story in the first place.  As a result, the film fails to express the meanings it should contain.<br/><br/>Fans of the film are likely to argue that although it fails to adhere to the original novel, it is still a good film.  But to argue this is to neglect the fact that it is not a film in its own right.  It is ""based on the novel"" and as such should stick to it for at least a minute.  This film does not. If the makers of the film were trying to steer away from de Bernieres' novel, they should have made their own, different movie.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone film, Captain Corelli holds its own, but only due to the above average technical side of it - the cinematography, as many have said, is particularly note-worthy.  But the script, together with the fact that the film was ever made, completely destroys the entire ethos of the story. Read the book first, and then, if you think you can handle it, attempt to watch this awful monstrosity of a film."

It also introduced me to details of a part of history that I hadn't really known before.  <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the quirky plot aspects of the entire Italian unit coming from one area, and all being members of the musical organization.  I had no problems with the accents or other aspects of actors of various nationalities playing characters of various nationalities -- is there some expert at ""accents"" anyway?  <br/><br/>I thought the emotions and complexities of emotions were well portrayed all around.  John Hurt was excellent, but so were all of the actors playing the ""lesser"" parts.  Except for the earthquakes, the movie made me want to go there on my next vacation... About the only aspect of the story that, when you stop to think about it, was unlikely, is that Correlli survived.  But then who wants a ""down"" romantic drama?  <br/><br/>The movie celebrates trying to make the most of a bad situation, and it certainly didn't pull any punches as to thinking that ""thinking happy thoughts"" and singing together can solve all the world's problems.

","I was expecting much worse, remembering the negative reviews I read when it was originally released in theatres, and most of the user comments here are certainly not kind at all, but when this popped up on Showtime I figured I'd give it a go. Certainly the 'free' viewing may contribute to my less than eager attitude about panning this film as many others have done, but after it finished I found myself thinking for a casual night of TV film it was OK. I thought also, as others have mentioned, that Cage's attempt at an Italian accent was unnecessary. Viewers can easily make the mental leap to an Italian officer without benefit of a poor accent. I mean it's not like we think they're all speaking English in Greece, right? Just opens you up to the kind of criticism it garnered. I confess to not reading the book, but now knowing (via the posts here) the Cruz/Cage characters get back together in their 80's, and not a mere two years after the war's end, would have been a more striking, and satisfactory conclusion to the story. As far as the period, ""Mediterraneo"" was a much better film, but this had it's moments. A happy ending on a rainy Tuesday night in Georgia is OK, and the world goes on as one expects it would even if the film isn't the brightest of cinematic efforts. 5/10 - 6/10, maybe even a 7/10 if you have no reason to expect more than a casual evening's entertainment."

","I saw it on DVD. The cinematography is perfect! The vistas shown on the beautiful Greek island are almost film-like on widescreen HDTV. The extras are sparse, the music video by British tenor Russell Watson is pleasant, the director's commentary is ""minimalist"" but still valuable and interesting. Some of my comments, below, contain information from the director's commentary. I cannot imagine watching this beautiful film on old-technology VHS tape.<br/><br/>SPOILERS - Set in wartime 1940 through postwar 1947, the Italians with the help of the Nazi Germans have ""captured"" this peaceful Greek island. Nic Cage is Capt Corelli, who marches into the village with a mandolin strapped to his back. Later we learn from him, ""Everyone in our battery is a member of the opera society."" None have ever fired at an enemy. While WWII rages on elsewhere, they spend their free time on the beach, with half-naked Italian prostitutes brought over for them, frolicing, drinking wine, and singing. They hope to hang out until the war is over, and go back to Italy to resume their unencumbered lives.<br/><br/>The wake-up call comes when the Nazis shoot and kill several of his battery mates a day before they were to symbolically surrender to the Gremans. Finding that they can't trust the Germans, they decide to claim all the weapons they can and fight a last stand, Italians and Greeks against the Germans, with results similar to General Custer's. But Corelli survives, is doctored (John Hurt), and smuggled back to Italy. Meanwhile the doctor's daughter (Penny Cruz) and he have fallen in love, she doesn't know if she will ever see him again, as she studies to become a doctor herself. After the war ends a big earthquake destroys almost everything on the island, then Corelli appears again. He says to her, ""I tried to make myself believe I could live without you.""<br/><br/>Much of the story encompasses real events, although the mandatory love story is fictional. ""Titanic"" did this, ""Pearl Harbor"" did this. I suppose it is the only way to make a historical film interesting. I guess the writer of the fabulous ""Longitude"" didn't realize that!  :-)<br/><br/>An earthquake really did destroy most of the buildings on the island, but it happened in 1953. The community was not re-built, but virtually everything we see in the film were sets constructed then torn down during the re-enactment of the earthquake. The crew gathered and carted off all the debris afterward, leaving the island as they had found it. Many scenes were shot among the real ruins, as they have been since 1953.<br/><br/>I like this movie very much. The historical story was well-done, and the love story did not detract. The cimematography is superb. Cage as Corelli, Cristian Bale (of ""Newsies') as his love competition, Hurt as the doctor were all especially good in their roles. Cage even showed a bit of his singing voice, which was recorded live and not overdubbed in the studio."

I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners.  I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear.  Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, living in a island during the 40's, who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone.  John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also acted great.  He reminded me a greek in many of his reactions."

Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful.  But there were saving graces.<br/><br/>The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability.  Next, a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz´s father, the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as by Irene Papas, each as village elders, as well as by Christian Bale (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth-gnashing early on.  Finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed.  <br/><br/>John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing.  The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.<br/><br/>Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar.

","Hollywood strikes again! This is the third World War II love triangle this summer based around a woman who must choose between two soldiers that have fallen for her. Like ""Pearl Harbor"", the woman believes her lover is dead and falls for another man, and like ""Enemy at the Gates"", bad accents and poor character development plague the film. Fortunately, this one was based on a popular novel by Louis de Bernieres, written much earlier than the others and was perhaps the only script that truly deserved the green light. The story takes place on the Greek island of Cephalonia, where Italian and German occupation has taken over the otherwise peaceful town. A beautiful young girl named Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) falls for an Italian captain (Nicolas Cage) while she believes that her fiancée, Mandaras (Christian Bale), died in battle. Mandaras returns only to find that Pelagia has given up on him and had already fallen for the mandolin-wielding captain.<br/><br/>Cage and Cruz, while having proven themselves in other films, do not pass for Italian or Greek respectively. The true stars are supporting actors John Hurt, who plays Pelagia's father, Dr. Iannis and Christian Bale (Mandaras). Both have passable Greek accents and seem to fit the parts.<br/><br/>Directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love), the film looks great. The scenery is beautiful and the battle sequences are shockingly believable and have an impact. The wide range of emotions in the two-hour span of the film works well, but main problem is that the two main actors just aren't magnetic enough to be believable. While the film had a lot of potential with a winning story, the miscasting is just too hard to look past. It is worth catching in the theatre for a matinee, otherwise just wait for the video."
"emj999","Null","1","3","28 October 2001"," *SPOILER*: good 'film', BUT why make pointless and unnecessary changes to the book?
","I loved the book, and saw the film on the same day that I finished it, which perhaps was not the best time to have given it a fair viewing.<br/><br/>I have read the first 20 reviews that loaded on the top page of the IMDB's comments board for this film, and most of them seemed overwhelmingly positive.  Normally I wouldn't bother other people with my own paltry views on these matters, but since only one other person even touched upon what I found most distressing in the film, here goes...<br/><br/>Why make pointless and unnecessary changes to the book?  I was expecting, of course, that cuts, and even perhaps changes, would have to be made.  [If truth be told, I am not at all sure of the success of the writer's idea at the end of the book of introducing several new characters in such a short space of time, and zipping through so much of the other characters' histories in the last handful of pages; but that's a different matter.]<br/><br/>I simply don't understand why the following changes to the book were made, aside from which, I thought the film was very good in many ways, and successfully captured the atmosphere that had been conjured for me in the book of the island and its people.  The casting I found very accurate, and the acting ranging from the perfectly acceptable to the magnificent.  These are just some of the anomalies that bothered me in the film:<br/><br/><ul><li>Mandras becoming an unselfish hero in the face of his spurned love, instead of the outcast killer, political troublemaker and rapist that he became in the book, eventually ignobly committing suicide [never an action, in my opinion, capable of inducing sympathy].  In the film, it is not only Mandras who discovers Corelli dying in the dark after the German treachery, and brings him to the doctor, it is Mandras who arranges his flight from the island.  Admittedly this was done partly because of the excision of the British agent who effected the escape in the book, but I see no need for Mandras to have been turned into such a hero in the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The suggestion, if not statement, [it's not clear whether she is fantasising or remembering] that Pelagia and Corelli made love.  It is central to the book that she remained a virgin all her long life, and the she and Corelli never consummated their love, admirably exercising restraint that is all too often absent in films these days.  It seemed a very low cheap Hollywood trick indeed to introduce the sex element so gratuitously into this film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fight scenes seemed woefully out of place in what was otherwise a 'peaceful' film about the war, and gratuitously inserted for the gratification of the action brigade film-goer.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The quiet excision of the homosexuality of Carlo, which means that his subsequent saving of Corelli's life is almost nonsensical.  [The excision of the campaign in Albania means that Carlo's character would become much harder to expand, but nevertheless, it could easily have been possible.]</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The excision of the great fat priest's character, who undergoes a change in the book charting in many ways the other changes taking place during the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great comic potential was lost in the film's treatment of the explosion on the beach.  Likewise the search for snails, and also the excision of the pine marten.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The execution of Mandras's mother [who ought to have looked far uglier].</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The hanging of the Greek girl in whom Gunter had expressed an interest at the dance.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The survival of the doctor in the earthquake, which mysteriously takes place six years earlier in the film than in the book.  [I haven't researched it, but I wonder in what year, if any, the island suffered such an earthquake, and why it would need to be changed for minimal dramatic impact?]</li></ul><br/><br/>After producing what he must have known was such a wonderful book, I wonder how de Bernieres could have signed away the rights to the script, as he apparently did?  The Germans were very clearly the bad guys in this production, with the Italians seeming innocent and playful for the most part.  Even Gunter seemed merely weak and cowardly in not at least affording his old friend a swift and painless death as he lay crushed and bleeding to death in the sweltering sun; he had been a much more sympathetic character in the book.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the film, as a film distinct from the book, well-shot and decently acted; but for anyone with an ounce of imagination or interest in finding out more about this subject, PLEASE make sure you read the book first, so that you may carry with you the beautiful and poignant images of the book, so sadly missing from the film."

Not even at the end she did a good job, after so many events, after years she finally gets to see Corelli again and she couldn't change the same face of stupidy we had to bear during the whole film. Anyway, Cage was very good in one of his best characters; Hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching.

I liked most of the plot considering, of course, it was pure fiction which is ok. The love story was predictable but interesting. I did not like the portrayal of the German officer. He was a wimp and whether we like it or not I doubt that any wimp made it to the rank of a German captain during World War II> His portrayal at the surrender ceremony was ridiculour. If a mayor of a Greek town had acted in that manner in real life the German would have known how to handle him and he would not be alone; he would have had a squad of men with him. The mayor using the F word was also ridiculour. Do people in Hollywood think they always have to have this word in every movie they make. The mayor could have been defiant in another way and it is doubtful if the Greeks in 1945 even used the word although they may have had other expletives just as strong. I liked the music in the movie and would have like even more of the mandolin playing. The Italians during World War II were not known to be very adept at fighting so it was rather difficult to accept them as being more interested in making music and first and then turning in the last part of the picture to being expert combat soldiers. I thought it was very unrealistic to have the German soldiers making their assault on the island in modern landing craft similiar to LSTs of World War II> Hey, the U.S. Navy in World War II had the amphibious ships for D-Day and in the Pacific. The Germans did not have that kind of capacility. Yes, they could have landed troops from ships but not the kind shown in the picture. The ending was quite pat, but in the larger sense it was a good ending because like most good Hollywood endings it left you with an upbeat feeling. I gave it an 8 in the review.

","to do the impossible; make a European movie with an American film style, wide screen, special effects, major musical score, stars chosen over actors.  Nevertheless, he should be commended for this enjoyable cinema story- telling.  Nick Cage is an Amercian of Italian ancestry, and his trained accent may be forced, but how can anyone NOT like Nick Cage.  He has screen charisma.  He's not really beautiful but he lights up the screen in all of his work. Penelope Cruz is another matter.  Who cast her as the salutable Bella Bambina??  She's cute.  Yes, I'll give you that, she's cute and has nice curves for a 98 pound wonder.  She's a competent actress.

That was a salutable bella bambina, not Penelope.<br/><br/>But Mr. Madden should be commended for making this flick which will surely lose money in America but may do well in Europe (I hear they like Amercian movies which is why the French keep trying to outlaw them), and I hope his close times with Cruz were worth the losses entailed in the miscasting.

But the basic fact remains the same; the Germans occupied the areas held by the Italians at the time of their departure.  This is, after all, entertainment, and not a treatise on Italy's role in World War II.<br/><br/>As well, the variety of accents in the film, from Penelope Cruz's Spanish accent to the vaguely Italian one of Nicholas Cage, has been criticized. However, unless one is prepared, where one is making films with a non English-speaking setting, to use just native speakers as actors (in this case, Greek, Italian and German) with subtitles for all, there is no good solution for the problem.  The results here are as good as can be expected, and a lot better than I have seen elsewhere.<br/><br/>The whole thing makes me wonder to what extent I should trust reviewers.  A few weeks ago, having read glowing reports, I went to see ""Sexy Beast"", and loathed it.  As far as I was concerned, it was just the largely incomprehensible rantings of a sociopath, and more incomprehensible talk from his unpleasant associates.

Well, CCM is one of the most romantic wartime films since English Patient, but, unlike the English Patient with its dramatic heart wrenching- mind-altering ending, Corelli goes past possible perfection and heads into ""enough already"" territory. A film afraid to let down any part of an audience (here the Hollywood ending portion of you), often alienates the audience that would have embraced it; this is Captain Corelli's Mandolin.<br/><br/>It's a terrible shame, because Nicholas Cage was excellent- once you got over his accent and desperately stopped imagining his other less, shall we say, moviestar roles that sit in your memory caves making you smirk with each uttered ""bello bambino"" he presents from his adorable lips. Face it no one takes him serious and Captain Corelli could have changed that...<br/><br/>The sexy sleepy eyed mankabab can act. Imagine that! But his filmmakers ruined his glory by foregoing a dialect coach, and leaving a rancid taste of week old mozzarella by way of the unnecessary, ongoing ending which muddied up the awe and left the audience bitter, once again. Think Artificial Intelligence, positively brilliant till Spielberg had to ad that last 30 minutes...<br/><br/>Capt. Corelli takes place on picture postcard beautiful (thanks to cinematographer John Toll) Cephalonia (Kefallonia), Greece right as the Greeks have had a small victory in WW2 over in Albania. Hitler doesn't take to well to this small defeat and orders the allied Italians to ""move in"" on the Greeks. It's war stuff I won't bore you.<br/><br/>On this small, but strategically placed island we meet a beautiful (I, personally, think she looks like a chicken) girl Pelagia (Penelope "" I don't even have to change my last name if we marry momma"" Cruz) and her father, the island doctor (a brilliant John Hurt). Pelagia has agreed to marry her studly Greek boyfriend, MANdras (studly Christian Bale) when he returns from the war.<br/><br/>They are young and in love, or is it just lust? He's off and she is left alone to worry and wonder as to his faith because Mr. Sensitive, Mandras, never so much as etches his ""X"" into a letter and she fears he is gone forever.<br/><br/>Meanwhile her father, in dire need of medical supplies, agrees to house a captain from the Italian army that's been sent by the allies to secure Cephalonia. More war stuffThe captain, named Antonio Corelli (Nick - remember to call Emily Blunt-Cage) is a life-loving, free spirit caught up in a war with his childhood friends not hell-bent on killing anyone, as, I imagine many young men are in a war. Capt Corelli will only shoot you if your opera preference is Verdi, then he has no mercy, and will not be held responsible for his troop's reaction. It's a little joke, as his men are all singers or musicians and part of an opera club back home. He and his bellowing Italians almost make war look fun.<br/><br/>Pelagia and Capt. Corelli get off to a bad start. She thinks he's an ass for being so happy while war is all around them. He thinks she's adorable when she yells. So you know love is sneaking in through the goat's cheese poop of circumstances surrounding them. Naturally Mandras, her betrothed love, returns just as her heart and head is filled will wild Rhesus monkey sex thoughts of the charming Capt. and herself alone on one the many romantic island beaches partaking in some mixing of two ancient cultures under the Grecian moon.<br/><br/>But, before the two men can battle each other the war takes a turn and Hitler is no longer cozy with the Italians. He's sending other Italian squads north to concentration camps and Capt. Corelli must make a decision involving trust and his future.<br/><br/>As they say in Italian as the last drop of Chianti Classico Castello di Volpaia is sipped from the roman goblet, ""il partito è sopra""<br/><br/>
Sure, I'm biased about Cage- I adore this fellow. Admittedly, I'd like to wrap his tilapia in tzatziki and slowly undress him like the fine-layered moussaka he is. I also think he's become easy pickin's for the meaner-spirited press. Yes, he's the chairman of the board at the Nicholas Cage School of Acting where the motto is: ""one expression equals all expressions,"" but he really did a good job in Corelli and it will go unnoticed and ridiculed. He's no Benicio del Toro or Gary Oldman in the impeccable dialect/accent department. It seemed Nicky's education on Italian accent pronunciation probably involved simply popping in couple of Coppola's scenes involving a Godfather movie or two, while he slurped down an espresso. Next time he'll invest a little time. But still, he was, as always, enjoyable to watch and a helluva lot better than expected!<br/><br/>
Christian Bale looked his usual dangerous sexy self. I think I need a fix of American Psycho. He's a talented fellow who commands his screen.<br/><br/>
John Hurt, what can I say that hasn't been said in his long career? He's an ever-morphing actor who, no doubt, hires a dialect coach when on call for a ""foreign"" role. Ahem.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz didn't suck. I admit I don't understand the Hollywood hubbub around her. I think she resembles Ringo Starr in drag quite frankly but, I'm not a clam diggin' gal or a red-blooded man so, I'll leave it at that. She tries to be all pouty a little too much here or her performance would have been much better. I have liked a couple of her works so I'll spare her the verbal ballet.<br/><br/>Snack Recommendation: Ouzo and Chianti, served with Porcini Pasta, Pancini Risotto, Patissada di Polenta, dolmades, for dessert, La Nociata and Baklava (walnut kind!)<br/><br/>

","Well, after finally seeing Captain Corelli's Mandolin here in North<br/><br/>America (I noticed it was playing in France in June), I must say I<br/><br/>was very disappointed.

Nicholas<br/><br/>Cage is horribly miscast as the free-spirited captain, Penelope<br/><br/>Cruz is obviously gorgeous to look at, but doesn't quite hit the<br/><br/>emotional high notes that say, Kristin Scott Thomas did as the<br/><br/>woman torn between two lovers.

","""Capt. Corelli's Mandolin"" is an old fashioned Hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity, and supposedly no Americans.  The story takes place on a Greek island during WW2.  The Italians arrive to take over the island, but with German supervision.  There is a romantic triangle made up of a Greek couple and the Italian captain.  Nice performances by all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet."

","Once you can get over Nic Cage playing an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not war, you can get down to enjoying this beautiful-looking film.  This could be used as an advert for tourism in the Mediterranean.  John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz isn't bad, as you might expect.  Christian Bale's character is somewhat one-dimensional, which is a shame.<br/><br/>The main drawback of this film is the adaptation from the book - having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots, I feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline."
"loukia12","Null","1","3","18 May 2001"," Good but not a masterpiece!
","Although i can't say i was thrilled, i quite enjoyed watching this film. Filmed entirely on location, using many locals as well as many professional greek actors, the director succeeded in conveying the atmosphere of the time(Cephallonia in the 40's) to the audience. The dramatic, unspoiled landscape of the island provided some of the most magical scenes of the film,despite the fact that it did not receive any help from the music score, which was surprisingly bland,unemotional and overally unsatisfactory,especially towards the most dramatic final scenes. Moving on to the plot, i was pleasantly surprised to discover that many of the historical inconsistencies and inaccuracies found in the book, were omitted.Predominantly, i am referring to the depiction of the greek partisans, who were presented as brutal animals by the author of the book,that only contributed to an eternal, internal strife, and failed to offer any actual help to the enslaved greeks. In reality however, the partisans liberated significant parts of Greece during the 4 year german occupation, as well as helping the allies in many instances.Internal strife and civil war did not broke off until after the liberation of Greece.In the film the partisans and especially Mandras were presented in a more realistic and complex manner.However i was very disappointed at the way the actual love-affair was presented. I have already seen the film twice and despite all my efforts i failed to realise exactly when did Pelagia and Corelli stopped disliking each other and fell in love.Furthermore, the first 45 or so minutes of the film,consist of various events crammed in badly sewn together scenes, which make it quite difficult for anyone to actually enjoy the film, since all are busy trying to figure out what is going on.Moving on to the acting, i will agree with practically everyone who has seen the film, that Cage was horribly miscast(to put it mildly)as Captain Corelli.He failed in every way to convey Corelli's sensitivity,love of life,but also confusion when faced with the brutality of the germans.All that he was able to convince us of, was that he can't sing(notice a shot of his back when he is suppossed to be singing at a high note). Cruz on the other hand was very good as Pelagia, but unfortunately, her great acting was overshadowed by Cage's feeble attempts to act. John Hart's performance was rather mediocre. He provided respectable consistent acting throughout the film, but lacked originality and depth of emotions. Irene Papas on the other hand was excellent, and her performance really added life and passion to all the scenes she appeared in(which were rather limited i am afraid).Finally, Christian Beale, was very good as well, as Mandras, and managed to convey the two conflicting sides of his character. Generally, this was a good enough film, which however could have been a masterpiece had the script been more consisted and had the acting been more substantial."

It is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in Cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli. Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise."

","To make a film out of De Bernieres book was always going to be an impossible task. However, the film that did end up being given the title ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" is very good. It is not the book, it does not have many of the characters and most of the sub plots. Nevertheless, it does capture the feelings of the island and the main characters. The film is visually stunning and the acting is not too bad either. Nicolas Cage, who plays Corelli, does have an accent problem but you soon forget it and just enjoy the film. Penelope Cruz (Pelagia) is good and plays her part well. However, John Hurt emerges as the true star in this film. His Greek accent is amazing and his acting superb. Overall, this film is very good and deserves to be watched."
"jediknight","8","1","3","8 April 2002"," a great love story with beautiful actors
","To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:<br/><br/>The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple. So the only thing that could save the movie, which (an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning) would either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!! In the latter part of the movie I even liked a rather broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who don't speak Greek that's OK, and she even looks like a Greek girl). Overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony (fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments:)<br/><br/>I give it 9/10. You should see it!"

","When I first heard of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, I thought, ""Great, another boring, awful love story. I hate Penelope Cruz. I hate Nicholas Cage. I hate sappy, sentimental love stories!"" When I heard that Christian Bale was in it, I was interested. I have been obsessed with Bale ever since I saw him in Newsies, and have been following his career closely. This was one of the few movies of his I hadn't seen, so I rented it. And I was pleasantly surprised! The movie is laden with tender, sweet scenes on the backdrop of beautiful Cephallonia (I think that's the island). The visuals and cinematography are spectacular. The story is rich with the beauty of the island, and the charm of the natives. I really enjoyed the scenes of dancing and Greek parties.  The leading stars are great, I have to admit. Nicolas Cage plays his part as Captain Corelli wonderfully. He has that innocence and starry-eyed romanticism that carries the role. And Penelope Cruz, who I thought had no acting ability, shines as Pelagia, the simple, beautiful girl, daughter of the town doctor. She is believable and gorgeous. :) And Christian Bale, my favorite actor of all time, has much more screentime than I initially thought- it was great! He is awesome, as per usual (and looking mighty fine, might I add <wink>). I found his scenes believeable as well. His talent goes beyond words. :) All in all, CCM is a sweet, simple movie with plenty of powerful scenes. If you don't like love stories, give it a try. If you don't like Penelope Cruz, give it a try. And if you're pretty sure that you're ready to travel to Greece, definitely check this out!"

","My Mum said that I would prefer to watch this, (rather than Jack Nicholson's Wolf at the time), and I wonder if she was right. This unfortunately I did not find all that great, even from director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love). It is all about Nicolas Cage as Captain Antonio Corelli and Penélope Cruz as Pelagia who meet each other in a city involved in the Second World War, and they fall in love slowly, and there a lot of German Nazis about. That is pretty much it. Also starring John Hurt as Dr. Iannis and Christian Bale as Mandras. The things I do kind of like about it though are Cage's Italian accent, the moments where he plays his three stringed instrument (the mandolin), and that bit on the beach where they blow up a big round thing. Apart from that, pretty pointless watching it. Adequate!"
"bertodecordoba","4","1","4","27 May 2008"," Loved the story BUT, it took me 3 attempts to get through it all
","Okay, I finally just got through the whole thing. I wanted to see this movie because I knew it had musical connotations and was about being in love with Penelope Cruz. Which isn't hard to do.<br/><br/>When there is a good script and good story you would think that ""top"" actors like Nic Cage and Christian Bale would seriously buff up on their local talk. If you are going to do a foreign movie in English with an accent of the local language then you got some serious work to do. Nic apparently didn't do enough training for his accent. He goes from one sentence saying something like: hey man, surfs up dude!, to aye mama mia, no hay pizzaria. If you pay attention to his accent it is all over the place.<br/><br/>If you watch an A actor like Leo Dicaprio, he will seriously study the local vernacular and slang and bring it into his character and make the audience believe it. Look at his accents in Blood Diamond or Gangs of New York. He nails it. These two guys Nic and Christian completely blow it. It gets better towards the end of the film but come on guys, do your homework. Jeezus, it is so distracting and hard to get into a movie where the characters have clearly not done their homework.<br/><br/>My overall feeling about this movie is very conflicted. I loved the story and loved the classical guitar piece that Nics' character recorded but, the accent thing I obviously cannot ignore. They should have done this movie with real Italians, Spaniards, and Germans and kept it real, or otherwise brought in an actor that does his homework like Leo Dicaprio. So there.. That is what I think, take it or leave it...."

As far as war movies go it is somewhat irrelevant. But as a combined love in war movie you could do worse. The accents are somewhat annoying and occassionally distracting but with an ensemble cast that's always going to be a problem.

"khatcher-2","5","1","4","2 April 2002"," Photography, music and battle scene save the day
","Penélope Cruz just laps up the camera from every angle; those deep Spanish eyes and that so sweet face, and long dark hair compete with the breath-taking scenery of the Greek island. But from there to being a competent actress leaves somewhat to be desired, though there were some intense moments of interpretation here and there. Nicolas Cage is well able to carry out dramatic rolls (Leaving Las Vegas, qv) but it would seem that in this film he was either a little uninspired or bewitched by the Enchantress, or simply the chemistry just did not nucleate into anything worthy of such an evidently intense story-line. One just did not feel great things for them; indeed one felt a bit sorry that Mandras (Christian Bale) got shoved to one side, though he also did not come up to great expectations but appeared a little more authentically cast. Ever since `Empire of the Sun' I have been anxiously awaiting excellent parts from Bale; am still waiting. However, the battle scene in the village was excellently done, comparable to the best of Spielberg. Beautiful photography from John Toll, as near as good as in `Braveheart'. The music is also worth mentioning: Stephen Warbeck has done his homework and synchronised well with the mood of the film. The Italian soldiers singing extracts from Verdi and Puccini was good fun, and some moments of Captain Corelli playing his mandolin were even poignant. Whether Cage was really playing the instrument or only miming he did it very well. All in all, an interesting couple of hours in which the leading actors did not come up to much, though the supporting cast were mostly fine. Nice to see Irene Papas: it seems centuries ago I saw her with Anthony Quinn in `Zorba the Greek'  was it centuries ago? Must go now and try to find the book."

","To be honest I wasn`t expecting much from this film and seeing as it gets off to such a slow start I thought my instincts were going to be proved right , but CAPTAIN CORRELLI`S MANDOLIN soon picks up and becomes an entertaining romantic drama set against the backdrop of the Second World War. I do have a beef with the  storyline though and seeing as it involves the central plot it`s quite a big beef: I found the romance between Corelli and Pelagia unconvincing . I don`t know if it`s the fault of the editing or the screen adaption ( I`ve never read the book ) but how did the romance come about ? Yeah Corelli is a likable cultured man but he`s still an Italian officer who`s taking part in the fascist occupation of Greece , he`s the enemy so why would a woman previously in love with a Greek patriot and partisan fall for him ? All this happens without any explanation and damages credibilty ."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","0","4","21 July 2010"," Disappointing, but definitely watchable
","If you haven't read the book, I recommend you do so, it was truly beautiful, heart-breaking, funny, incredibly romantic and had interesting characters and left vivid imagery in your head. This film from Shakespeare in Love director John Madden is definitely watchable, but it was also a disappointment.<br/><br/>Starting with the good things, the scenery, costumes and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. On top of that the score is absolutely marvellous, Madden's direction is pretty good-though he has directed better especially with the Inspector Morse episodes he directed- and the story is a beautiful and interesting one, with some sweet, funny and touching moments.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, it is a mixed bag really. Christian Bale does well with a character that could have done with more development, while John Hurt is even better, Hurt is a brilliant and underrated actor, and playing one of the more intriguing characters he is wonderfully dignified. However, Nicolas Cage is a miscast unfortunately-right, I have nothing against Cage, he has been in some good films and has given some good performances but he has also been very inconsistent. While his role here is not his worst film role(ie. his role in The Wicker Man remake was much worse), his character felt somewhat cartoony complete with an accent that didn't really work as it feels overdone. Penelope Cruz is better though, I did have a problem with her accent (too Spanish for my liking), she does have a nice character to work with and looks amazing.<br/><br/>While the acting was a mixed bag and the score and scenery amazing, there are several flaws that stop Captain Corelli's Mandolin from being better than it was. Other reviewers have commented on its resemblance to the book(or lack of it), but there were other things wrong that were more significant to me. Also the book, while wonderful, is quite an ambitious one to bring to screen and I do accept that it wasn't 100% faithful(there have been films that try to do that and don't quite work as a consequence), so while I applaud the film for adapting it it could have been better. The pacing is very languid so the film takes a while to get going, until the final battle segment which felt rushed, while the dialogue is on the sappy side of things. Then there are characters that feel sketched over, I was too disappointed at how Carlo was treated, while some of the secondary characters are rather clichéd and perhaps stereotypical.<br/><br/>Overall, disappointing but definitely watching for the scenery, Hurt and music especially. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","It seems that whenever Hollywood runs out of ideas it turns to the latest best-selling book. Then having cast the wrong people, taken out the best scenes, ignored the readers' favourite characters and completely changed the ending, they unleash the final product on a public who loved the book but are destined to hate the movie.<br/><br/>Following Bridget Jones' Diary and The Hole, the third such adaptation this month alone sees Nicholas Cage star as Captain Corelli in the movie based on Louis de Bernieres' novel.<br/><br/>Corelli is officer of the Italian army occupying the Greek island of Cephalonia during World War Two. Despite the initial suspicions of the locals, the charm of the Italian soldiers soon wins them over. Central to the story is the love affair between Corelli and local girl Pelagia (Cruz).<br/><br/>Considering that this is the focal point of the film, the chemistry between the two leads is minimal to non-existent. Cage and Cruz simply do not sit well together and at times openly appear uncomfortable on screen together.<br/><br/>
It doesn't help that the characters falling in love seems entirely improbable from what we are shown. They say very little to each other for the first hour and a half, and what they do say is generally hostile. Then, before you know it, they're busy declaring their undying love. It just doesn't wash.<br/><br/>You can perhaps ignore that, plus the fact that the story veers from the book. You can possibly even see past the number of real-life deaths in the war that are completely skimmed over. The main thing you can't overlook however is just how boring the film is for most of its duration. The action doesn't pick up until the Germans arrive, and aside from an astonishing and evocative scene with the firing squad, the rest of the action is instantly forgettable.<br/><br/>It seems that director John Madden (Shakespeare In Love) has made the same mistake as the BBC did with soap flop Eldorado: a decent plot has been sacrificed for a lavish location. <br/><br/>It's difficult to work out just what audience the film is aiming to draw. A majority of the book lovers will detest it's meddling and general cinemagoers will be put off by the sluggish pace. Overall it's well filmed but with a lack of interesting plot, poor performances from its leads and a lethargic style there's not too much going for it.

Mussolini never surrendered to the Allies.  He had resigned in 1943 to be succeeded by Pietro Badoglio who surrendered to the Allies in September of 1943, whereupon the Germans moved into all parts of Italian occupied Europe not yet occupied by the Allies.  As I mentioned, Rome did not fall until June 5, 1944, one day before D-Day.<br/><br/>The battle between the Germans and the Italians could therefore not have taken place upon the fall of Rome, nor was the Italian surrender to the Allies by Mussolini."

Whilst the doctor treats this pragmatically, as an opportunity to get medical supplies from the Italians' quartermaster, his daughter finds her loyalties sorely tested.  Should she stay faithful to her newly returned war hero fiancé, or succumb to the charms of the mandolin-playing captain?  Before these matters of the heart can be resolved, Italy surrenders and the Germans launch a full-scale invasion.<br/><br/>At first, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a heart-warming tale of Italians and Greeks learning to live together in, if not harmony, then at least a kind of relatively peaceful co-existence.  The performances from the entire cast are superb, with John Hurt, in particular making the most of his part as the wise and witty Iannis and Penelope Cruz making a perfect Pelagia. Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's brash, but also gentle and cultured, Captain Corelli is a bold piece of casting by director John (Shakespeare In Love) Madden.<br/><br/>An A-list Hollywood actor sticks out like a sore thumb in a character driven film such as this but that's exactly as it should be.  Given the effect the character has on the people around him, he ought to look and feel slightly out of place.  After a few years of him seeming only to have appeared in thrillers and action movies, it's good to see Cage getting to grips with something that stretches him a bit more as an actor.<br/><br/>Also excellent is Christian Bale.  His performance as the simple-hearted Mandras is light years from the slick yuppie of last year's American Psycho but he's totally convincing, even when he looks a little too much like Demis Roussos for comfort.<br/><br/>Having set up characters you really care about and shown you enough of Cephallonia to have you mentally packing your suitcases for next year's holiday, the Nazi invasion sees the film perform an about face.  The action in the third act puts war films such as Saving Private Ryan to shame by being so much more emotionally affecting, because you're seeing people and places you feel that you know personally being blown up and shot to pieces.<br/><br/>As one of the (apparently) few people who haven't read the book, I can't comment on whether Captain Correli's Mandolin is true to the novel but it is a terrific film and I wholeheartedly recommend that you see it."

","As someone who hasn't read the book, I was very impressed with this film. I got the chance to take part in a question and answer session with the director (John Madden), and he explained that there were reasons why he couldn't stick rigidly to the book. By all means i believe that the film has romanticised the book, but I thinkit works well. I thought Nicolas Cage was very good as was Penelope Cruz as the loyal Pelagia.<br/><br/>Madden seems to have captured the light and feel of the Greek island perfectly. I also liked the use of the local cephallonians (bet ive spelt that wrong!!) they bought the local character into the film perfectly. Watching Captain Corelli's Mandolin has inspired me to now start reading the book, a film that does that can't be that bad."

","What with recent book to film adaptations being disapointing at best I approached Captain Corelli's Mandolin with some caution. Thankfully I was not disapointed. It is a wonderfully moving well written, directed and acted film,with Nicholas Cage in partculary enchanting in the title role.The film takes place on a small Greek island during the second world war in 1940 and tells of the story of a infantry of Itallian soldiers who arrive on this small peaceful island. Complications ensue when Captain Corelli falls for the daughter of the local doctor, who is engaged to a local soldier who is fighting in Albania."

","The first of this year's blockbusters is a major disappointment. The main problems with the film are the dubious accents of all the main actors and the complete lack of on-screen chemistry between the lovers, Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz. The only person to come out of this sorry mess with some sort of credibility is John Hurt.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is completely miscast as Captain Corelli. Penelope Cruz is a fine actress but is not called upon to do much here except look enchanting and vulnerable, which as you would expect she does with ease. Let's hope that she doesn't foresake her film career in Spain where she has had considerable success, for the bright lights of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I am unable to make any comparisons with the film, but I guess that those people who have will be in for a shock.<br/><br/>The film does have one good thing going for it and that is the photography which is stunning.The Greek Tourist Industry will be anticipating a rush on holidays to it's islands this summer.<br/><br/>The film will do well at the Box Office due mainly to the usual Hollywood Hype, but it remains to be seen if this can be sustained once ""word of mouth"" gets around."
"chrisgreseque","6","0","1","5 May 2001"," Not since 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' have I felt cheated by the ending of a film.
","Everyone who has read Louis de Bernieres's fantastic book will agree that we have been deprived of a perfect ending to a perfect story, thus a great cinematic moment. Without the intended end I felt totally robbed.<br/><br/>Many will say that it is not advisable to see the movie adaptation of a book one has enjoyed so, because one feels inevitably disappointed and 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' unfortunately doesn't escape this widely accepted truth. To cram such a rich book in two hours is admittedly no easy task and many incidental, yet succulent passages are bound to disappear; yet all controversial aspects have been deliberately erased.  All references to communism (Mandras joining the partisans is a significant theme in the book) or homosexuality (Carlo's love for Captain Corelli) have been omitted. This suggest the clear intend of the film makers: Making a commercially successful film at the expense of the story, and that is a real shame... but let's face it, isn't it what Hollywood has always done and continues to do even more: treating us like children who have to be shielded from potentially 'controversial' themes.<br/><br/>Of course if one hasn't read the book, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is first class entertainment.<br/><br/>The photography is glorious, the music superb (especially Pelagia's March) and the acting is quite impressive. No-one will deny that Nicolas Cage is a perfect Corelli, as well as John Hurt who makes a splendid Dr Iannis (even if he appears at time a bit too youthful at times). Penelope Cruz is simply radiant with beauty and strength. Given that most aspects surrounding Mandras are absent from the film, Christian Bale, sporting a very decent Greek accent, manages nonetheless to convey the great sense of loss his character suffers when Pelagia ceases to love him. In the book, Drosoula (played by Irene Papas) is supposed to be an ugly old hag which couldn't possibly qualify the amazingly youthful and energetic Papas who hasn't lost her magic touch. Only David Morrissey strikes a discordant note as Weber, the SS man. He sounds far too British and posh to be a convincing nazi."
