"Victor Field","Null","46","54","9 April 2004"," It would have been impossible for this or any movie to be as sweet as Jessica Alba, but that doesn't keep it from trying.
","Any comparisons between ""Honey"" and ""Glitter"" are probably due to both movies having script-work by Kate Lanier (who, funnily enough, isn't listed on the completed movie)... and, of course, to their having slightly similar plots. Except that ""Glitter"" is likely to be more of a black mark on Mariah Carey's book than ""Honey"" is on Jessica Alba's.<br/><br/>This movie about a kind-hearted young woman in New York who uses dancing to help the people in her neighbourhood (the people that she meets when she's walking down the street... sorry, couldn't resist) and who's plucked from a nightclub to become the Paula Abdul of the 21st century - she even has a little mole on her face - is aptly named; it's as sweet-natured as its title character and has little if any benefit on your system, except to slip down nice and easy and leave not very much behind. It's filled with all the realism you'd expect from the producer of ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats,"" but it's not quite as much fun as either. Part of it is a personal thing (the Rodney Jerkins-executive produced music that permeates the movie isn't my thing, rhythmic though it is), but the thin, originality-challenged scripting and silly dialogue are more of a problem; when our bartender-by-night/dance-teacher-by-day heroine tells a kid ""Your flava's hot"" it's a little embarrassing, although in fairness ""Honey""'s street talk doesn't make you wince as much as some other examples of this kind of thing.<br/><br/>To be honest, the movie pretty much goes in one ear and out the other; there's not a single truly dramatic moment, with the setbacks coming on cue (when Li'l Romeo's character gets arrested it, and many other moments in the movie, plays like a less-than-brilliant After School Special) and the characters are right out of Cliches Central, from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer. (And note to the filmmakers: as anyone who's ever watched MTV, VH-1 et al will confirm, music videos don't credit the choreographer on screen... regardless of what the one that plays next to the movie's end credits might say.)<br/><br/>
But it's impossible to really hate ""Honey""; the movie's too harmless and good-tempered for anyone to get into a hissyfit over its drawbacks, and though the R&B-flavoured cameos mean a lot of people who see this movie will probably be going ""Who's this Tweet person?"" Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes. The dancing's also good, which is one of the main reasons to go and see movies like this; and though it doesn't actually seem to have anything like a narrative drive (it just seems to end instead of climax), there have been worse movies from music video directors, e.g. almost anything directed by Russell Mulcahy.<br/><br/>Oh yes, Jessica. She doesn't quite seem like the streetwise type, but she isn't supposed to be; she looks the part and comes off reasonably well, as well as having the edge over Jennifer Beals in ""Flashdance"" in that she actually does most of her own dancing. This isn't really the best vehicle for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception of ""Paranoid"") to be an unbearable experience. All she has to do is improve her choice of scripts..."

","Honey was a film I hadn't heard much about. A few people had mentioned it if only as a passing Jessica Alba conversation. It took me some time to actually sit down and watch it but I was pleasantly surprised. I admit I am not a fan of hip hop music which was a big reason I hadn't bothered to see it.<br/><br/>Honey is the story of dancer and nighttime bartender Honey Daniels. She dreams of making it big in the world of dancing and she has the moves but hasn't been discovered yet. By chance she is noticed by big time music video director Michael Ellis who launches her career by putting her front and center in some of the biggest music videos in the industry. As her fame grows she loses touch with some of the things most important to her, her neighborhood, her best friend, the kids she used to teach dance too. She tries to juggle both but it becomes a challenge. Ellis introduces her into choreography and she begins to write the dance moves and further her fame. Finally she finds a balance when she realizes she might be able to help get some of her neighborhood kids off the street by putting them in music videos. Unfortunately she quickly discovers Michael Ellis never wanted her for anything more than sex and he fires her when she doesn't give it up and on top of that blacklists her in the industry so no one will work with her. She returns to her neighborhood where she discovers the drop in center where she taught dance has closed and now she desperately wants to open up a dance studio where the kids can dance and have fun safely off the streets. In order to raise the money to buy the space for the dancer center Honey organizes a huge dance show with the kids performing. With the help from her neighborhood and the kids she will succeed in all her dreams.<br/><br/>Any hip hop fan will appreciate this film from cameos alone. The film is chock full of musical cameos from Missy Elliot to Jadakiss. It's true that plot is a little thin in the film but quite frankly it was much more of a plot than I thought it would be. I had the film pegged as a Flashdance, Save The Last Dance type but it was less about the dancer and more about her love for the kids. It was actually rather uplifting and their final song of the film was very cool and made me smile. I've read some less than favorable reviews on this movie but for me it came as a surprise that it wasn't horrible. The cast is alright but they don't really hold up the movie as much as the story does. Jessica Alba is decent in the lead role, and Lil' Romeo does a great job in his role as Benny, the troubled kid from the streets. It doesn't have a lot of depth but if you enjoy hip hop and want something uplifting, it's worth seeing. 7/10"
"pri_e","6","15","21","3 July 2004"," not that bad...
","After reading a lot of the reviews on this board, I thought this movie was going to be really bad however I found that this movie isn't really as terrible as some people have made it out to be. Jessica Alba plays Honey Danies, a hip-hop dance teacher hoping to make it as a choreographer, for someone who didn't have any previous dance experience, she sure does a fantastic job! Mekhi Pfifer is good in his supporting role as the barber with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>This movie is something that has been done many times before so you can't expect an oscar nominated screenplay etc etc. However, its something you can enjoy and if you are into the music or dancing, then this is definitely something for you<br/><br/>a 6/10"
"claudio_carvalho","8","27","43","17 September 2005"," Delightful and Enjoyable Feel-Good Movie  A Homage to Hip-Hop and for Those Who Fight for Their Dreams
","In a poor neighborhood, the choreographer Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works in a record store during the day and as a bartender in a night-club in the night-shift, and teaches dance to teenagers of her community. She dreams to be successful as a video-clip dancer. When she meets the video director Michael Ellis (David Moscow), she believes that her dreams have come true. When Michael discloses his real intentions with her, she decides to struggle for making her dreams really come true.<br/><br/>I have just watched ""Honey"" because of the name of Jessica Alba in the cast. Fortunately I did not pay attention to the unfair and very underrated IMDb User Rating. ""Honey"" is indeed a delightful and enjoyable feel-good movie. Certainly it is not a masterpiece, and it will never be indicated for an Oscar, but it is not its intention. ""Honey"" is, first of all, a great homage to hip-hop, with the participation of many stars such as Tweet, Missy Elliot, Blaque, Jadakiss, Ginuwine among others, and awesome dance choreographs. The story has a good message that everybody must fight to make the dreams come true. The stunning Jessica Alba is wonderful in the role of Honey. The story may be corny for bitter viewers, with most of the characters being nice; horrible, for those who have prejudice against poor people or hip-hop; or great for a viewer that appreciate a great entertainment like me. The music score is fantastic, and the DVD released in Brazil by Universal is outstanding, full of wonderful extras. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Honey  No Ritmo dos Seus Sonhos"" (""Honey  In the Rythim of Your Dreams"")"
"Buddy-51","Null","20","32","14 August 2004"," well-intentioned but silly film
","Credit `Honey' with at least having its heart in the right place  even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life  a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these strive-and-succeed tales, Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors, setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on (in other words, `put out or pull out').  But the always-undaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rose-colored eyes. Filled with a righteous zeal and determination, she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street, channel their energies in a more positive direction, and turn their lives around.<br/><br/>Only the most Scrooge-like curmudgeon could object to the positive, laudatory, pull-yourself-up-bythe-bootstraps message the film is trying to convey, and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not, in and of themselves, make for a quality film, and `Honey' is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her  from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project  all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus, `Honey' is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.  <br/><br/>Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress, though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams, as the adorable, gap-toothed eight-year-old Raymond, who steals the show.   Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","2","21","34","1 February 2008"," Oh, are you fo' real?
","I got a three pack on a DVD at Wal Mart for ten dollars a few weeks ago and Honey was on the cover, never saw the movie, wasn't really interested when it came out, but I figured why not see it for ten dollars? Sounds silly, but who knows? Sometimes you find little treasures here and there that are cheap, plus, I remember that this was the film that really introduced Jessica Alba to the movie business industry. Of course, she's really huge now, and judging from this film, Honey that I watched last night, I have to say other than her looks, I am surprised she made it this far. I don't mean to sound horrible on the film or anything, but this just seemed like a giant rap video for me and the plot was way too average and predictable with some cheesy street slang.<br/><br/>Honey Daniels has three jobs: a bartender, a sales girl at a CD store, and also a dance teacher at her mom's little business to keep kids off the street. But more than anything, Honey wants to be a music video back up dancer. Her wishes come true when a director, Michael, welcomes her to the dance floor and makes her a choreographer. All her dreams are coming true, until she realizes that she forgets the more important things in life that mean so much to her. She eventually wants to open a club of her own to help out the neighborhood kids.<br/><br/>Honey has the typical street slang which I didn't find attractive, you just can't take it seriously. Alba, she's such a pretty girl, BUT, I'm very sorry, the girl cannot act, I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy or compassion for her character, she played off as this naive little thing, when she could have played it more smart and strong. Not to mention what was the whole Missy Elliot dialog? ""What is this? This? This? Ugh? Ugh?""... it was supposed to be funny, but Missy comes off flat. Mekhi should have had more screen time, the guy is the only one with talent in the film. The dance moves are good, but I just wish they wouldn't have made this into a giant rap video.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I thought it was a great movie with a good storyline about a girl with a dream of making it big, helping out those who can't have that life. Yes, a little predictable at times, but the thought was there. The movie faced a lot of issues, from drug use and dealing to just generally believing in your dreams and no movie is complete without the fairytale love story. The dancing was awesome and Jessica Alba was amazing as Honey Daniels. People will give up their dreams if things don't turn out the way they wanted them to, but Honey stuck by hers and accomplished something she'd always wanted to. I think she is an inspiration for many."

","I thought Honey wasn't that good!! Only because it was soooooo predictable! Due to the dancing i thought it was o.k!! Jessica Alba is a great actress as in 'Sin City' and 'Fantastic 4' i've never seen 'Sin City' but i have seen 'Fantastic 4' which is a great movie! Anyway back to Honey, Jessica Alba is great in this movie. I only seen it once and that was last week it was the first time i had ever seen the film! And i thought OMG (O my god!!) this film is sooooo predictable!! Sorry to any one who thinks it's fantastic!!!! I'd have to say the best part would have to be the ending!!! I love the song!!! And the dancing it superb!!! Thanks to the directer who made this film! The ending was great!!! And the choreography is amazing!!!"
"jpschapira","7","13","20","22 October 2005"," The star of the show
","Jessica Alba is the star of the show; in this movie and in Hollywood since I don't know when. Her situation is something to detail about. Personally, I look at her and I think she has acted her whole life. Everyone talks about her everyday as if she had decades in the business, but she doesn't. I could say I believe she's done over ten films, when this movie was probably her fifth important role. She did a TV show I never saw for two years, but even before that, her name was on the poster of the movies she appeared in. She is a star by nature, a leading star; and ""Honey"" is the evidence that proves my statement. <br/><br/>When the film starts, Honey Daniels (Alba) is working at the bar in a disco serving the usual free drinks to her best friend Gina (Joy Briant): ""One, please"", the friend says, and two guys standing right by her get closer: ""Make that three"". Honey, with a big smile in her face, tells the guys: ""Today is your lucky day"", and then Gina interrupts: ""Don't get to excited though; she'll not be here much longerShe's gonna make it"". So the guys ask how she's gonna make it.<br/><br/>Right away we find out Honey dances; and that she dances awesomely well. If Alba did her own dance moves I don't know for sure, but it always looks like her; in the dance floor, in the videos, in the dance lessons. OK, the film: Honey has a great talent for dancing and she could be a classic ballerina but she prefers to teach hip-hop in a place her mother owns. She goes to auditions, she works hard, and she ultimately gets recognized.<br/><br/>But Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson's story is not about ""making it""; it is about the good-hearted people who fight for what they want, don't sell and don't quit. I don't even know if this is a veridical portrait of the hip hop world, but the video shoots seem real and I guess the artists/directors relationships should be how the movie shows them. What I wanted to say is that in the music world, mostly with hip hop (which I consider the easiest market today), when people make it, it goes over their heads, and they leave everything behind.<br/><br/>Although not Honey Daniels; she'll not fall into temptation, and she'll be there for the ones she cares for. It may sound too formulaic, but it's beautiful. Debutant director at the time Bille Woodruff, with previous experience from musical videos, shows us the nice face of his characters' world. Everything is shiny, everyone's happy, everyone's smiling. Yeah, sure some bad things happen, but everything will be ultimately worked out.<br/><br/>Great casting work with the youngsters, especially with Zachary Williams as a little boy, Raymond, who needs someone to watch over him; and Lil' Romeo in a tremendous and talented performance as the teenager Benny, who debates himself about being a gangster or a normal child. This plus Missy Elliott's cameo and Mekhi Phifer in the most charming performance of his career, and the some of the best lines as: ""You peoples? Playa, playa, how'd you swing that? I've been trying' to be her peoples for weeks; ain't had no luck"". <br/><br/>Not enough? Alba looks gorgeously beautiful in every outfit she wears and her acting skills are way above the film's requirementsShe's stunning now and it is only the beginning."
"TerminalMadness","1","10","17","3 October 2004"," Even Alba's looks couldn't save this mess...
","* out of **** stars<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah we've seen this before over and over. Small time dancer looking to make it to the big time breaks into the big time through luck of chance and communicates with kids through dance, while her parents hate what she does urging she get into another more distinguished profession, she begins breaking it big time, cue cameos from hip hop stars, and becomes a little too big for her friends, falls in love with the guy from the hood but is torn between her career and her man, la di da, and while I really wanted to like this movie, simply for its appeal and the first twenty minutes which really had me amped, this is pretty badly done. <br/><br/>The film, which is a retread of so many films with the same story and themes along with plot elements that are badly recycled from movies like ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", and I swear to god ""Sister Act"", has nothing new to offer. So we have Honey Daniels (Marie was taken), who loves to dance, the girl loves it and she teaches dancing at the local community center during the day, whether for pay or free it's never indicated, but she works at the bar at night, where does the chick get her energy? And where can I buy it? And, by luck of fate, is recruited by a video director after winning in a dancing duel (is there any other?) with a rival dancer and begins her career in the music video industry.<br/><br/>Now it's never indicated if she plans on being a dancer, a video dancer or just a teacher, but she has the best of intentions! The really hot neighborhood girl with a heart of gold, don't ya just love them? And we're never sure if the boys hang around her to dance, because she's nice, or if because they're trying to catch a peek at the good. And she begins to get more famous in the video industry with her skills choreographing dancers and becoming a hit in the industry.<br/><br/>Now the plot resolution is a bit thin and very jumbled here with a story that goes everywhere including a romance with the local barber whose badly set up with no back story and they get involved with one another. The problem is there's no conflict between Alba and Pfeiffer's character and their romance, there's no obstacles or chemistry so their relationship and focus of, is just boring, so inevitably Pfeiffer has no reason to be here other than as a plot device.<br/><br/>Then we witness a lot of sub plots involving the neighborhood kids including Lil Romeo who plays a local kid on the way to juvie with a life of crime, and we witness Honey get into the life of a music star directing videos, and of course canoodling with ""famous"" hip hop stars like Ginuwine and Tweet, and she experiences the same conflicts you'd expect like facing off against obligatory villains, and, suddenly out of the ballpark, comes this odd sub-plot where she conveniently stumbles onto an abandoned gym for sale and wants to raise money to teach and have the kids get off the streets and on the dance floor, but she doesn't have it, so she makes a bargain with the bank to give her thirty days to raise the money. Why thirty days? You naive fool, to stretch out the movie.<br/><br/>So, we have a plot development in the second half that should have been the focus of the entire film (raising the money for the center) while we tread through really bad sub plots and under-developed characters including her mother who has no emphasis and wants her daughter ""to see everything in the world"". Considering they're a low class family, it's pretty impossible to travel around the world, and we never know if the mother pressures her daughter because she's an overbearing witch, or because she wants the best for her daughter. Some mothers would accept a really fine, really beautiful, smart, talented and popular dancer whose good with kids, but, parents, you just can't please them sometimes.<br/><br/>So, Honey decides to raise the money for her kids and with a lot of plot holes including one big one involving Lil Romeo's character committing a crime, a lot of cheesy elements like a running gag with musician Missy Elliot searching for Honey to have her in her video which wore thin really quickly with Missy's over acting, not to mention there are the always lovable villains of the story which aren't needed but they're there to get the plot moving.<br/><br/>Poor Jessica Alba is so far - fetched in her ghetto fabulous get up and horrible slang she delivers in every other word and her delivery just wasn't believable and it's hard to swallow her as a girl from the Bronx while her character is oddly drawn to the local neighborhood kids who are really annoying, there's even a really badly done scene in the barbershop where Honey meets Chaz played by Pfeiffer. So after the dumb hokey climax that really didn't make a lot of sense, and closing credits that really didn't register, we realize we've wasted a valuable amount of our time, only to catch a glimpse of Jessica Alba in a leotard. It's why I watched."

"MovieManMenzel","2","8","15","9 December 2003"," A lousy hour and forty-five minute music video with one of the worst scripts ever.
","Poor Jessica Alba, her movie career is not starting off good with this extremely long music video. Jessica Alba's TV series Dark Angel was canceled last year and Jessica has now begun her career as a movie actress. Will she make it? Well we will see. I think as long as she doesn't have any more movies like this, she should be fine. I'm sure by now everyone is wondering why this movie is so bad. Well continue reading to find out.<br/><br/>As I walked into the theater tonight to watch Honey, I had a bad feeling about it. I like Jessica Alba, she is very attractive and played her role as Max on Dark Angel very well but to me this movie did not look very good. I had a free ticket for the movies, so I figured what the hell. So I sat down and watched the movie. Honey is about a girl named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) who works in a club at night and the center (centa as they say in the movie) during the day. All her friends think she has the `moves' to become the world's hottest dancer. Honey is supposed to be poor and live in section 8 but she looks to well dressed and happy to be living in section 8. But that's not important to the filmmakers. Well to continue on, Honey then one day gets a visit from record manager Michael Ellis (David Moscow) at the club, who discovered her because he has spies, who visit the clubs and videotape girls dancing so that he can discover new talent. Honey does not believe who he is at first and then of coarse realizes he is a big manager in the hip-hop industry. Honey then becomes a mainstream superstar, and forgets about her friends and blah blah blah, we already seen this before. The funniest thing to me is this, the movie all of a sudden tries to be a family film by showing street kids, selling drugs and Honey trying to make them discover that their better than that and should all be dancers. The movie gets worse as it goes along and it tries to become way to serious and family oriented. It's final moments remind me of something out of sister act and it is really bad.<br/><br/>As for the acting, well Jessica Alba tries; I guess I can give her that. It's a bad script, she tried to make it work and show she has some talent, but her character had way too much `slang' dialog, which to me made it really bad. David Moscow, who played Duncan on my favorite TV show Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane, was horrible in this film. I mean his role was laughably bad. I laughed at him being the token white guy in the movie and trying to talk like he was from da hood.  To be honest, his character made this movie. It wasn't supposed to be funny but I cracked up every time he came on screen. As for Lil Romeo, who makes his feature film debut here, he is off to a lousy start. He was so annoying in this film. His challenger in both the music and entertainment world, Lil Bow Wow was off to a better start with Like Mike, which was a very likeable movie. The movie also has a lot of other hip-hop and R&B artist cameos including Missy Elliott, Tweet, Shawn Desman, Ginuwine, Jasakiss & Sheek. There is enough hip-hop & R&B music and cameos in this movie to make it watch able for the hip-hop & R&B fans in the world but sadly I don't fit into this category.<br/><br/>The script was horrible. The dialog was like something a five year old would write. The script was like Glitter except they realized it was like Glitter half way through which is why the second half of the film was all about getting kids off the street and moving them into the dance studio. It's part Glitter part Ghetto Oliver and ends with sister act. It's really sad how the writer wrote this screenplay and didn't realize how bad it was.<br/><br/>
As for the director Billie Woodruff, who is a music video director should stick to the music videos. I guess he was trying to make a hour and 45 min music video but why go pay $5 to $10 bucks to see a music video when we can watch MTV at home for free.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Honey is a total waste of time. If you're a fan of hip-hop & R&B or club dancing then maybe you will like Honey but for anyone who isn't into that music or dancing then this movie offers nothing. It's a very confused movie that never knows its target audience and has one of the worst scripts I have ever seen made into a movie. My final rating for Honey is a 2/10."

","I've seen many less entertaining films than this. Replace Alba and the music & dancing though and I've seen maybe two or three.. As a movie this is really a disaster. The plot is extremely predictable and acting for the most part far from good. Also the fact that there may only be half a dozen people on this earth that can pull off lines like ""your flavour's hot!"" doesnt contribute (and Jessica for sure isn't one of them). I read someone before commenting that the video director character didnt seem to have depth. I'd say his looking down and fiddling with his electronic gizmo all the time made him look somewhat unsure of himself, which added to his all evil act just about made him the most complex character seen here. So if you think you'd enjoy the music, or if you just want an excuse to watch miss Albas pretty face for a moment, or you're a hardcore Disney fan you might bear the 90 minutes of Honey show. Otherwise you'll see it for what it is; a great display of a movie executed with zero ambition."

The only one I knew was Missy Elliot and she come off like some kind of hip hop clown girl. If I were her I would be beating the crap out my agent for getting me involved in this thing. All the other rappers at least seem ""normal"" for rappers. They literally just lend their face. To spite what street cres' they might bring, they could have been played by any wanna-be. Fans of the artist will be left uttering two words. ""That's It?""<br/><br/>If you're interested in Alba's hot dance moves, just watch the commercials. That's pretty much all of them. I was an am still a huge fan of Dark Angel, and I love Jess as much as I can love any woman I don't actually know. BUT... Her acting isn't there. She doesn't have the emotional commitment she had playing Jessica Simpson on Mad TV. Honey, the character, comes of looking like a good hearted ditz. As an authentic Bronxite I can assure you there is no such thing as ""Honey"". Living here give you, if nothing else, a strong survival instinct.<br/><br/>Mekhi Phifer wanders through the film with his ""Hey, Cool Aid!"" smile. There is ZERO chemistry between him an Alba.<br/><br/>Lil' Romeo could team up with Jake Lloyd and do ""Attack of the Cardboard Cutouts."" Boy should stick to music because every line out his mouth sounds like some one claiming they didn't fart, when we all know they did.<br/><br/>David Moscow plays the villain and is the only person in the whole film that shows a realistic emotion. Even he's victimized by the script. After being a semi-likable sleazy music video director, he turns into complete asshole when ""Honey"" slaps him after a drunken, unwanted advance. He's still got the best acting in the film.<br/><br/>Joy Bryant is probably the most interesting new faces in the film, although the script has her as some street hood bitch pulling an ""Original Cindy"" best friend role to Alba. She's one to watch however.<br/><br/>The real dreadful part is the music. I don't mean the Hip Hop either. The Hip Hop was actually survivable, and I don't like that musical style. No I'm talking about the original music between scenes. It's like the worst buy-out music from a bad 80's TV movie. It's so bad me and my friends couldn't avoid laughing at it. It's like it was cut in from some other film and totally blows the continuity of style with the film. I can't believe any one but Al Smithe took credit for that.<br/><br/>The real problem is the script. Sitting at the restaurant talking after, we came up with no less than 30 plot devices that could have made this a kick ass film. But the writer avoids drama like the plague, instead pounding us with the same god awful cliché's we've seen on every TV drama we've for the last 30 years. The story is SO one dimensional it's almost delusional. The dialog is painful listen to. I don't know why they let writers who perpetrate these horrors... HAVE FINGURES! The is THE worst example of screenplay work I've ever seen. Drama, is always about conflict. The conflicts in this movie are unbelievable. Not in the over the top way, I mean they just don't hold true.<br/><br/>Billy Woodruff's direction is visually unimaginative, but competent. There are some scenes where a particular camera move almost gave some feeling. He might be good for doing music video's but he need WAY more practice to do feature films. Of course, given the written material he was shackled with, it could be said he pulled off a miracle in directing.<br/><br/>I thought this film would be a bunch of thugged out fools delivering 'tude to show how ""hype"" they are.<br/><br/>I didn't even get THAT! It would have been more interesting if it was filmed as a Mockumentary on video, and it sure would have been cheaper.<br/><br/>The movie lacks anything even close to a soul with character's so massively undeveloped that you end up not caring enough to even dislike them.<br/><br/>
If you MUST see Jessica, hey, it's your money. Otherwise, wait for this to be an afternoon special on free TV.<br/><br/>I give it 1.5 out 10 stars."

","This was a very good movie. My favorite part was when Honey's friend snatched out Trina's hair at the beginning of the movie. Now that was funny! Honey is just a typical girl in the music world that wants to make it in the future as a video girl. Not just any video girl, but a dancer. There were many obstacles that approached her, but she don't let it hinder her from making it. She takes it as a lesson learned. She later becomes a choreographer and makes it big. People like Missy Elliott wanted her to organize dance routines for her. Her own mother does not like what she does. But she does her thing for the children in her community, so that they would not grow up, waking up, looking forward for the bad things in life. She is a life saver to some, like Lil' Romeo and his little brother. Through it all, she becomes successful no matter was brought in her way. She became her own woman."

","This movie, if the director had cut out all of the acting and concentrated on 90 minutes of music videos, it would be immensley more entertaining. Ms. Alba was at the screening I attended and admitted she did not know how to dance prior to being signed for the movie. This was very evident in the movie when she was surrounded by actual dancers. The plot was extremely contrived and is full of ethnic stereotypes. From the evil Black drug dealer to the rich White yuppie drug buyer. Interestingly enough, Ms. Alba's Hispanic roots are completely ignored, perhaps to escape any comparison to Jennifer Lopes as she repeatedly stumbles over the ethnic slang that predominates the dialog. The screen play could have used a little bit more humor to counter balance the sometimes dark subject matter. The ending made little sense and reminded me of a scene from ""The Brady Bunch"" as they had to put on the 'Big Show' to raise money."

"Rocco3000","1","5","11","6 December 2003"," Terribly generic and predictable film
","I just saw this movie last night. And I loved watching it, only because I love my gf and if she is happy with something then I am. If I wasn't with my gf, then I would have hated this film and never ever have seen it, for it is a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Well, maybe not. This movie is really for for two kinds of people only. Anyone under the age of 10 and people who love hip-hop culture and the icons that go along with it(my gf is the second obviously lol). I like hip-hop music and all but a movie that is just trying to cash in on the current hip-hop craze will just not do it for me.<br/><br/>First the writing was horrendous. Characters were all one-dimensional, and were really just plot devices, and had no depth or feeling whatsoever. The dialogue literally sounded like it was written by a 10 year old, which is why 10 year olds would love this movie. It was extremely predictable! Actually I knew what was gonna happen throughout the whole movie before it even started. As I said it is a movie about hip-hop culture and if you know anything about that then there will be no surprises. But I guess that is why it is written like that because you are not supposed to be using your brain throughout the movie, just your instincts and hormones. Watching the women in tight revealing clothing dance like they are having sex with the air, and watching everyone else get into fights.<br/><br/>The acting was equally bad. I'll never forget the guy during the opening credits who is talking to Honey asking for a free drink. It honestly sounded like he was reading those lines off of cue cards. And I wouldn't be surprised if he actually was! Everyone was bad! Bad! Bad! Bad! Maybe the only screen presence that was mildly entertaining to watch, was Missy Elliot. Although, she only had two 1 minute scenes (sorry M.E. fans), she was funny.<br/><br/>Billie Woodruff's directing was also equally unimpressive which I have to say was surprising given that he is a music video director, and the music video scenes were just so bland, and booooring. I guess being a good music video director just doesn't translate very well to being a good movie director.<br/><br/>Please if you are considering watching this movie, save the $10, and go see either Last Samurai (although severely cliched and laden with egotistical stereotypes, I'm sure is still a LOT better than Honey), or What Alice Found (Amazing drama, with top quality acting, writing and directing, even though it doesn't have all of the hype and mass marketing of Honey or Last Samurai). But then again if you are under 10 or you just go crazy for anything associated with hip-hop culture, then go out and see it now, cause you will love it!"

I don't know if Alba is trying to have some sort of Latino vibe going on, but it seems almost offensive. <br/><br/>There was some sort of thing going on about her teaching kids how to dance, and trying to weasel them into a Ginuwine video.

","I have just watched ""Honey"" because of the name of Jessica Alba in the cast. Fortunately I did not pay attention to the unfair and very underrated IMDb User Rating. ""Honey"" is indeed a delightful and enjoyable feel-good movie. Certainly it is not a masterpiece, and it will never be indicated for an Oscar, but it is not its intention. ""Honey"" is, first of all, a great homage to hip-hop, with the participation of many stars such as Tweet, Missy Elliot, Blaque, Jadakiss, Ginuwine among others, and awesome dance choreographs. The story has a good message that everybody must fight to make the dreams come true. The stunning Jessica Alba is wonderful in the role of Honey. The story may be corny for bitter viewers, with most of the characters being nice; horrible, for those who have prejudice against poor people or hip-hop; or great for a viewer that appreciate a great entertainment like me. The music score is fantastic, and the DVD released in Brazil by Universal is outstanding, full of wonderful extras. My vote is eight."

Any faint hope of conflict was either wiped away within 5 minutes, or danced away. When entering this movie, I thought that it was centering around the main character getting her big break in music video dancing, however when she reached that goal within the first 30 minutes, it seemed the movie just draaaaaagged on for the next hour, with the odd interruption of an exciting dance sequence. When we finally see a good conflict, it turned out to be simply the end of the movie, and not a good conflict at all. So in total, you start the movie, see a faint glimmer of a plot, have that glimmer die within 20 minutes, watch an hour long music video, then have it end. How great."

She is supposed to be a dancer in music videos, but her look pretty much did not fit the role, she is good looking but, her body was too skinny, rear was too flat, and chest was not big enough, for the role she was supposed to play.

In fact, there's nothing about it at all-this is just Hollywood fullfilling its overdue community-service hours, truly and sweetly.  Jessica Alba goes from a dark angel to a street angel, flashing her beatific smile and her glistening abs and her beatific navel as she balances a meteoric dance career with the Bronx 'hood.  So supposedly superior are her dance moves (standard club gyrations mixed with ballet flourishes) that she captivates the hip-hop industry in mere weeks, after being plucked from clubworld by a powerful video director. Honey is fixated on stage cameos at the expense of its very short dance sequences and the idol-worshipping understates the movie's anti-bling moralism.  Despite some sizzle with her love interest, the beautiful Jessica Alba ends up a *major sigh* desexualized mouthpiece for lines such as ""I see kids go from bad homes to bad schools and back"".

I anticipated Alba to give a show that not to forget for the decades. This is now obviously a decade old flick and disappointed with her character, especially with her dance moves. But young Alba in a sexy pose on the poster, no one can just ignore it from watching.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it. Since I'm watching it delayed, I should not compare it to the present scenario. Even though it has been only 13 years, in which all the fields rapidly advanced, so the dance. I suggest you just go for it with an empty mind if you want to see it. Soon I'm going to catch up with its sequel, but I know it won't be as decent as this one.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Honey Danels (Jessica Alba) is trying to make it as a dancer in NYC. She's a bartender at a nightclub and teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center. Video director Michael Ellis is taken with her dancing. He makes her a star dancer and then a choreographer. Gina (Joy Bryant) is her best friend. Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) is a barber trying to keep the youth center going. When Honey rejects the controlling Michael's advances, he cuts off her career at every turn. Meanwhile she's trying to keep Benny away from the pull of the gangs.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba has the acting chops for this simple dance movie. This is very much a simplistic dance movie. There is limited edge. Alba doesn't have enough street in her. It's nothing new. The dancing from Alba is good but not acrobatic. Although complaining about this movie is like kicking a new born puppy. This movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body and it's perfectly watchable."

","In a modern day fairy tale the film Honey takes the audience through a ""Cinderella Story"" with a hip-hop twist. The story is crowded with incidents and subplots showing the negative side of growing up in bad neighborhood but also a young woman's attempt to liberate young kids to leave the temptations surrounding them. The main character struggles for personal success in changing environments but soon finds out that behind every promise of progression as a dancer lies an ulterior motive.<br/><br/>Every fairy tale finishes off with a happy ending but before that can be accomplished a conflict or series of obstacles needs to occur. A major issue in the film is the little opportunity presented to the children growing up in a bad neighborhood in New York's East Harlem. Honey Daniels, played by Jessica Alba, teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center and encourages the local kids to attend to keep them off the streets and out of trouble, but the temptations of drugs and violence swarm around them. The drug dealers are constantly looking for willing users, new users and possible future sellers to carry out their ""transactions"" on street corners, specifically targeting the youth. The obvious leader of a group of young kids whose views of right and wrong are obstructed is Benny, played by Lil Romeo. Benny is a dancer who has the most influence on the kids and a tighter relationship with Daniels.<br/><br/>In the film Daniels dreams of stardom in the world of dance are answered by famous music video director Michael Ellis, played by David Moscow. Casting her in a music video Daniels takes over the choreography and she is encouraged by Michael to make the transition from dancer to choreographer. But Daniels sudden success comes with a price with Michaels refusal to take no for an answer to his sexual advances and then tries to sabotage her career by blackmailing her out of the business.<br/><br/>In the end all conflicts are resolved and the promising youth in the Bronx are provided a dance studio made possible through a dance benefit. Personally, while the choreography by Laurieanne Gibson, who also plays Honey's nemesis in the film, and music, may be enough to grab Honey's target audience of urban adolescents, the film is extremely predictable and filled with horrible acting performances. But if you enjoy a fairy tale including all the good, the bad, the ugly, captivating choreography and catchy beats, then Honey is for you."

","Part Fame, part Flashdance and part 8 Mile, Honey is a movie about an aspiring dancer who makes it to the big times only to realize that fame and fortune are no substitute for helping neighborhood kids.<br/><br/>
Jessica Alba plays the title character Honey Daniels, a hip-hop dance teacher at the local center by day and a bartender and dance floor extraordinaire by night.  It is during one of her late night dance floor gyrations that she is videotaped by an assistant for a famous music video director that sees Honey's talent and immediately hires her to be part of his dance pack.   <br/><br/>At first, Honeys dreams seem to be coming true.  She is working with top hip-hop talent doing what she enjoys the most, dancing.  And it is not long before the director's confidence has Honey choreographing the dance troupes. <br/><br/>Ahh, but wait for it, here comes the necessary plot diversions to stretch out the story and give us that warm Hollywood hug of a character that defies the odds and follows her dreams.  <br/><br/>First, there are the street kids Honey meets while leaving the nightclub one evening.  These kids are talented and do dance moves that had my bones creaking just watching them.  Honey is enamored by the children and takes on the crusade of trying to keep them off the streets and in her studio where the two groups could learn dance moves from each other.<br/><br/>Then there is the evil video director (Michael Ellis) who at first seems sincere in giving Honey the fame and opportunity but later turns when she shuns his sexual advances.<br/><br/>And finally, in-between and vying for Honey's attention are her best friends who get pushed aside when fame overcrowds Honey's datebook and the local barber (Mekhi Phifer  8 Mile), who pursues her affection and eventually wins her heart.<br/><br/>Honey is one of those films that if you can't relate to the music or the class of characters being thrust in your face with rhythmic impulses, you are probably not going to enjoy it very much.  The characters are all pretty to look at, but we've already seen pretty in Coyote Ugly and Dirty Dancing to a better result.<br/><br/>It's not that Honey is a terrible film, it's just that it isn't very original.  Did we really think that her friends wouldn't be estranged only to reappear at the end in loving homage?  Did we really not see the Mekhi Phifer character and Honey teaming up to try and raise money through a benefit concert?  And the director who seeks sexual payment for his given opportunitiesof course he was going to blackball her and then see the error of his ways and apologize later.  Been there, done that.<br/><br/>Maybe I just don't get it.  I wasn't raised in the hood, nor have I aspired to be something that only costs a few thousand dollars and my dreams to accomplish.  Funny though, this movie made me wish I was.  The kids all wear clothes and shoes that I only pass in the shop windows or when looking on-line at things I can't afford.  And if I had the encouragement of absolutely everyone around me to try and put on some kind of benefit that might reward me for being a good person, well giddy-up.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, not everything in Honey is negative.  Some of the songs were tap toeing and the kids were definitely cute even if they were from the typical type casting of young-kids-from-abused-families-that-peddle-drugs. <br/><br/>
But to review the movie as a whole, Honey is probably an appropriate<br/><br/>

","Our honey needs money, moves and fame. Alba plays an upbeat dancer seeking what many teenage mtv video afficiandos desire: face and body time in front of a camera, success on a diet of limited talent. While admitting a partiality for mainstream dance films generally -- I saw and enjoyed Billy Elliot as well the ribald Can We Dansu (Can We Dance) --, this film had one mortal flaw: the film's heroine cannot dance. It was simply clear throughout the film that every background dancer to be shown the moves by Alba could already shake her booty better. The rest of the film held few surprises and traded on the usual cliches. The innocent girl with the golden heart wanting to ""make a difference"" and give the local kids a ""better life"". The decent boyfriend whose main role in the film was to be... a decent bf. The vapid pretty, pretty vapid girlfriend, ticked because the two couldn't go shopping together. The manager, just sleazy enough to want to debauch her, but not so sleazy as to be threatening or even interesting. The kids from the hood looking like they just stepped out of a pimple-free middle class suburban day school rather than outta the bronx.  The film I saw which most resembled Honey in target audience was Save the Last Dance (2001) starring Julia Stiles. While not as good as the two first mentioned dance films, it still beats Honey by miles. I might have written a better review for Honey if the film had had more ambition. But why search for excuses for a film made with little love and even less savvy. No Honey, please, not tonight."

","Honey is a film that stars Jessica Alba together with Mekhi Phifer, Lil' Romeo, Joy Bryant, David Moscow and features performances by Tweet, Jadakiss and Ginuwine. This is a feature debut from music-video director Bille Woodruff. <br/><br/>Honey is a girl from the streets who works in a record store, teaches the occasional dance class at a community center, and treks downtown every weekend to hit the clubs and try out some new moves. There, she meets a music video producer who offers her a chance to be a choreographer. But at a price she eventually learns she's unwilling to pay. Determined to pick herself back up, Honey goes back to the inner- city of her youth with plans of starting a dance school.<br/><br/>Honey is the usual Hollywood silliness, executed with sincerity but not much imagination. For some reason, Alba's sexy gyrations are supposed to be more empowering than other dancers' sexy gyrations, while being no less titillating.But nevertheless, it provide some lift to this corny and formulaic movie."

But if you're watching this movie and expecting a proper storyline, believable characters and any sort of surprises in the plot... you'll be very disappointed! Its a very predictable movie, and most of the characters are very two dimensional and there are some very cringe-worthy lines (""Your flava's hot!"").<br/><br/>BUT... its still good fun, and the dancing is fantastic. A good movie just to drift along to, and if you're into hip hop and rnb (like I am), you'll enjoy the music and cameos as much as I did.

","Despite what everyone else appears to think (points to IMDb rating) I thought it was pretty good. OK, so it won't win any awards and its racial overtones grate a little, the dance routines were great and the songs were catchy. A decent enough performance from Jessica Alba as Honey ""Mary Sue"" Daniels. The rap stars were a little pointless and the asshole director's sudden character change was sublime at best, unbelievable at first. Perfection for a 7-to-10-year-old wannabe-dancers, and for 13-16-year-olds seeking a fluffy undemanding chick flick,<br/><br/>Not fantastic by any means, but it's worth a look."

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>I really didn't think Honey was that bad. As far as sunny predictability, yeah it's all that and then some, but as far as being dreadful it isn't. While Honey may seem to predictable, to contrived, and to by the numbers sunshiny, it isn't a bad way to pass some time though it's by no means a must see.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Jessica Alba's performance as Honey though she seemed almost to good to be true at times. While the movie was clearly designed to be Hollywood feel good in the way it went about things, the movie was at times very much fun to watch as well as being very well paced and interesting despite it's formula feel. I liked it a bit more then Coyote Ugly or even Flashdance in a way. Sometimes it's fun just to watch a relaxing feel good movie-and one thing you know about Honey is that even when negativity is introduced, things wont stay negative for long-not in this movie's world.<br/><br/>There really wouldn't have been a way to make this movie less predictable I don't think, because it's plot almost demands a happy by the book ending. I wouldn't call this a great movie but would give it a 6.5(wish we could rate by .5's here on IMDb). It isn't going to win any awards but there isn't anything that stands out about it to be dreadful and it's a cute, uplifting little movie. This is rated on here a 3 or 4 and that really is a little Harsh. My vote is 6.5."

WRONG!!! <br/><br/>but... in all fairness, i give it a 3 because Ms. Alba is the sole reason for picking up this movie.<br/><br/>But... twenty minutes into this movie, I quit watching. It was a terrible waste of time, I think Jessica is drop dead gorgeous but even then she doesn't save this film from blowing so much.<br/><br/>first, let me just start off by saying that this film lacked a plot. its plot was too predictable and a no brainer. second, the acting... i'm sorry but even a 10 minute skit by seventh graders is more believable. After watching this movie, Saw's acting seemed a lot more credible, in fact, dare I say, compared to this movie, Saw was Oscar-caliber.<br/><br/>it's a pity that jessica can't act, maybe she should switch over to being a model, as she fits perfectly.<br/><br/>all in all, this movie is mainly for kids who still dream big, i for one don't dream big anymore so don't really care for this. and it's also for those who love hip hop and dancing, which i figure i'm too old for. if you aren't any of the above, watching this is going to be a complete waste of time. and also, if you're none of the above, seriously, DO NOT watch it if you've got nothing else to do, that's how bad this is."

","The dancing is fun, and Jessica Alba was very pretty. Aside from that, this movie was on the lower end of OK. I spent the second half of the film wanting to slap Alba's character for being too sugary sweet all the time; I kind of blame Alba for that one. She wasn't helped a whole lot by the screen writing, but still, she could have toned it down a little. Then again I'm not an actress, so maybe I should shut up. It was kind of fun to watch Honey succeed in the business world without turning sleazy. Still, I really wouldn't bother with this film unless A) you really love watching movies with dancing in them B) have a mad crush on Jessica Alba or anyone else in the film (her boyfriend is hot) or C) you've just taken Nyquil and you need something to zone out to."

However i think Jessica Alba is fantastic, she gave 4 out of the 6 points i gave it...she brang the movie to life, had it been any other actress it would've got a 2...because the script was un-realistic, and so is the story, ""a girl from a bad neighbourhood get's suddenly picked out of a huge crowd for some un-known reason...all she did was one routine and suddenly she's a mega-star, there was loads of other girls in the club with 'flava', as the script writer might say. However, i can't get enough of the movie, simply because of the ending scene...the dancing was excellent and the song to go with it is a mind-blowing combination...it gives me goose-pimples whenever i watch it, it is ""I Believe"" by YOLANDA EVANS, absolutely amazing dances and it was excellent...Well Done Jessica Alba, she made this movie for me!"

","I watched this movie with a cousin of mine. She is into this sort of thing - acting like your hip-hop, dancing, and clichéd teen drivel. But even she couldn't take it. Jessica Alba is totally miscast as Honey, a character that is some sort of Latino, but Alba is too white to play. Honey wants to be a dance choreographer, but encounters obstacles, such as a horn dog mentor who wants her to sleep with him, or she'll be blacklisted. Along the way, she tries to help Lil' Romeo's character, a young man on his way to a life of crime. Really. This movie is totally ridiculous. Lil' Romeo tries to pull off a grown up and tough persona but fails. Miserably. So does Alba, who, between this and Dark Angel, has lost the ability to act. People could say that this movie is good because of the dancing, but I see the choreography as contrived and over-sexual to make up for the fact that it lacks the same things this movie does: any sort of groove or flavor. This movie, while not the worst, could be a slight train wreck, right down to the cheesy and predictable ending. If you're a teenage girl who like hip-hop and teen movies, go ahead and watch this. If you're anything else, stay away."

Honey Daniels, played by Jessica Alba(Dark Angel), is a 22 year old dancer, who works three jobs...at a local club, a music store and as a dance teacher, for young kids who live out on the streets. Her dreams have been put on hold because of where she lives, and the fact that she can't seem to get her mom to respect her. Until the day that she's discovered dancing in her club, by famous video director, Michael Ellis, who starts hiring Honey to choreograph all the hottest videos, including Tweet, 3rd Storee and Jadakiss and Sheek. Honey develops a friendship with a young troublemaker and his little brother, Benny, played by Lil' Romeo, and Raymond.

She also finds herself falling for Chaz, played by Mekhi Phiefer(8 mile), a local barber shop owner. Honey soon finds herself in confusion of who she wants to inspire, what she wants to do, and how to get there. This film has the most amazing dance moves, and shows you a little bit of what goes around on the street life.<br/><br/>Appearances by: Missy Elliot, Tweet, 3rd Storee, Jadakiss and Sheel, Ginuwine, and Shawn Desman."

","i'd say that honey is probley ma favorite movie it says a lot about kids on the street and how most of there life's are and ""...if a man takes a woman out on a Friday night in her heels and she can't bring her homegirl, he trying' to get some booty."" just joking. but this movie tells a lot of real life and i'd say it's a definite must see.and that if any1 is talking trash about this movie then they got really bad taste and haven't been out there and see how much this goes with real life.some people are so up there wanting to be famous they don't see how much there decisions affect other people like honey found out. some guys are like Micheal who just want some ""booty"" not the real under the looks. (i know that happens to me sometimes) this is definitely a good movie, i think anyone would be crazy not to like, i mean we got people at my school quoting some of their stuff."

","i think this film is quality. It's interesting. I think the film could be improved by ending it different. I think they should end with Honey teaching in her dance studio, being happy. And also see what happens with her job with Missy elliot when she comes walking in at the end. I would also like to see if Benny (lil romeo) keeps out of trouble once the dance studio has been opened. The film was entertaining because it had loadsa recent music in it and its all outgoing and not boring parts. Anyways thats all i have got to say about the film i just think it's class and i would love to do something like that to do with dancing. I hope there is a second part to the film to see how honey goes on to progress."

","Ye gods, lots of bitter folk reviewing this. It is nowhere near as bad as the other reviewers would have you believe.<br/><br/>Alright, let's break it down - it's a hip-hop movie, so of course:<br/><br/>* It involves street dance.<br/><br/>* It involves kids being kept off the street through the sheer power of dance and corn-rows.<br/><br/>* There is, of course, a predictably attractive heroine with a heart of gold (why aren't there ever ugly heroines with hearts of gold?)<br/><br/>* There is an evil bad man who offers the heroine one thing but then tries to give her another.<br/><br/>and wait for it!<br/><br/>* there's a fund raising DANCE at the end!<br/><br/>... but aside from it being a predictable hip-hop flick, it's a FUN hip-hop flick. Terminator 3 was god-awfully predictable too, yet for whatever reason people don't rip into it quite the same way as a predictable movie not in the action genre.<br/><br/>This is most definitely a chick flick. You'll need to enjoy dancing to ""get"" it, or at least go with someone that does (that you can relate to). If you're bitter, or can only enjoy movies where people explode into technicolor displays of blood and guts - then of course you're not going to like a feel-good dancing movie, stay far away, why are you even reading this review?"

","Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) plays a Hip-Hop dance teacher at an inter-city community center, with dreams of making it big in the music video business. Surprisingly early on in the movie, She gets her big break--a cocky, fast-talking Video director sees her dancing in a nightclub and offers her a part in his video... To me, it seemed that Honey's sucess almost came too fast, and too easy--before you know it she's choreographing videos for major Hip-Hop recording artists... Then I start to see, as the plot unwinds that success <I>wasn't the whole point</I> of this film...but rather, what that success could cost you...<br/><br/>Soon Honey finds she has no time for her boyfriend, her best friend, or the children she tries to keep off the streets... And the shady producer who <I>seemingly</I> made all her dreams come true, expects something from her in return...<br/><br/>When she doesn't give into the lecherous director's demands, he breaks promises to her--giving her job to her old rival.<br/><br/>The true test of Honey's character is how she rises above it, to find success on her own terms.  To make not only her own dreams come true--but the dreams of those around her.  <br/><br/>I liked this movie.  Surprisingly it had a lot of heart.  THe one thing I would have changed would have been to put her best friend Gina more front and center.  As well as her boyfriend Chaz.  They're too far in the background when they should be showing how important they are to Honey...<br/><br/>The acting of David Moscow (Michael, the shady producer) left much to be desired.  <br/><br/>THe kids were cute, and the dancing was great!<br/><br/>I'm glad it wasn't just a trite movie like Flashdance was.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 out of 10. :D"

","An opinion from R. Deniro movies fan. 'Honey' is not the Movie that drives you crazy, makes you cry or makes you want to try to become a hero and save the planet. When I read the description I thought that ""Coyote Ugly' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200550/, has similar plot and got a slightly higher grade. One of those movies which make you flow into a fairytale atmosphere and go out from the darkness of the reality. Really sweeeet. Of course you know that everything is going to have a happy end. I liked the performance, actors, dancers, soundtracks. And yes, you can predict the plot of the movie but it does not spoil it.

","Well many people didn't like this movie, but I thought it was a inspiration for all dancing children. I am a young teenager and I would love to dance or be a choreographer. It would be a dream come true, the actors in the film were excellent, Jessica alba was a excellent dancer and a excellent actress. This is going to be a hip-hop hot movie, it has been the best movies around since bring it on. Lil Romeo is such a great dancer and such a great actor. Many people have had that experience and many people can follow the story lines easy. People might find this movie different and like a whole waste of time, but it might be. People like me who are mad about dancing and would do anything to just be near a great dancer or be a background dance, this film is a great inspiration to us.<br/><br/>If I lived in America right now I would audition for ""Honey"" no problem. It is my dream that when I am older I will move to America and meet lil- Romeo. My family know how mad I am about the film; they see me when I watch it. I know everything there is to know about it and more. People think they are fans of movies and they know everything, but they dint until they have seen me! This film is going to be around for a while and is going to get a lot of rating. The people who are in and who have took there time out to make this film ""THANK YOU"" I don't know where I would be today. Still thinking it is too much work and far to hard for me to find out what I want to do be a dancer. But know I no it isn't so hard after all.

","I think that Jessica did a way better job in Dark Angel! That's all I have to say. I don't know why she lowered herself to such a low level. Maybe she was bored. The film was really predictable and kinda choppy. I think that they should have gone into more detail about her relationship with her man, or they should have just left that out completely. It didn't really help the plot any. I liked it though because I like to dance and the dances were great and fun to watch and learn from, but other than that, I really wouldn't watch the whole movie the whole way through again, just using the scene selection is good enough for me! Some say that it was a waste of time but I don't. I think that if you were entertained just a little, than the movie did it's job. Jessica did look out of place when she talked. And the whole ""Flava"" thing was kinda weird, but, it could have been worse. They could've had her sleeping around to get where she wanted to be! :("

"howie73","1","1","4","20 July 2005"," Honey....I lost the plot.
","An incredibly awful hip-hop themed dance movie with as many clichÃ©s as a daily soap-opera. Alba plays the lead role of Honey Daniels, a would-be hip-hop dancer, who suddenly changes career direction to become an in-demand hip-hop video choreographer. This is where the movie fails from the very start. We are led to believe Honey's fortune is in dance, not a behind the scenes role. Thus , her ambition and drive is negated by the backtracking nature of the script which was obviously written by marketing executives wanting to capture the hip-hop zeitgeist. Alba is also problematic as Honey. This girl is not ghetto enough it seems, and she comes across as too sickly sweet to be a dancer/choreographer of any magnitude. With Alba, you feel you are watching parts Halle Berry would have thrown away in the bin. Worse still, Missy Elliot makes an embarrassing cameo that should add some much needed credibility points to her resume. Honey...I lost the plot would be a better description of this awful movie."

The one thing that annoyed me the most after seeing and buying this film was that I couldn't dance like that (I am currently able to so this comment is really for space filling).<br/><br/>The end routine for the fundraiser is brilliant and made me cry.

The story was feasible, idealistic, and very formula.  But, as bad as the critics crushed this movie, I don't see what was so wrong about it.

"callanvass","4","0","1","27 September 2013"," I thought it was a below average film, buoyed by Alba's charming performance.
","Jessica Alba is a good hearted young woman, and a talented dancer. She becomes close with her mentor Michael (David Moscow) He becomes a little too close for Alba's liking, and Alba is forced to do things the hard way, and make it on her own, without his help. What is it with dancing themed films? I don't understand the appeal of them. They look cool, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Step-Up, and its second sequel to a certain extent, but I don't get the infatuation with them. This came out before Step-Up, but it has nowhere near the competency that Step-Up has. It's thoroughly predictable, the dialog is pretty laughable at times, with plenty of tough street talk. It comes across as groan inducing more than anything else. Every time Alba would utter the line ""Your flavor is hot!"" I would cringe. It wasn't very convincing. That criticism aside, I have to commend Alba for the most part. This film is very mediocre, but it could have been a complete mess if it wasn't for Alba's charming performance. Her genuine character, and determination was very easy to empathize with, and she made this movie a lot easier to digest. It doesn't hurt that she's drop dead gorgeous, either. Mekhi Phifer (Chaz) disappears for too many stretches for my liking. His love story with Alba was underdeveloped, and came across as phony and quite awkward in my opinion. Romeo Miller is extremely annoying as Benny. His gangster act got old quickly. I realize he was just a kid at the time of the release, but kid actors can be quite intolerable. David Moscow plays a great sleaze ball<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: If you insist on watching this. Your viewing experience will be buoyed by Alba's solid performance. It's not a very good movie though, and if you're into the dancing thing, I'd suggest watching Step- Up (the first one)<br/><br/>4.8/10"

But that's still kind of embarrassing.   You usually couldn't get me to touch one of these movies with a ten foot pole. The whole ""dancing"" genre just does not appeal to me in the least. But there's exceptions to every rule, and Jessica Alba is an exception to every rule. So against my better judgment, I gave Honey a try.<br/><br/>Every imaginable cliché from this kind of movie is conveniently collected here in one neat package. The impossibly sweet and sunny heroine with a heart of gold, who achieves her dreams of dancing, but must deal with the sinister pitfalls that come along with success. The stern, disapproving parent, who is totally convinced that their child is throwing away her talent. The rift that grows between the main character and her friend, as her career takes off. The perfectly diverse, multicultural cast. The whitewashed, sanitized view of ""urban culture"", where the only bad guys are the drug dealers (whom the precious children are saved from in the end, of course). And the horribly unnatural ""slang"", that no real person on earth actually speaks like. Some of the meager entertainment that Honey has to offer, comes from how forced and hilariously awkward the dialogue is.   <br/><br/>Your tolerance for all that could possibly be much higher than mine. I'm the guy who automatically turns up his nose at any dross like this, churned out just to appeal to young urban (a.k.a. black) people. Surprise, some of us are immune to this kind of derivative, pandering nonsense.    <br/><br/>What I am thoroughly UN-immune to, though, is attractive young actresses. The star of this movie, in particular. So maybe I'd better climb back down off my oh-so-high horse. Getting to see Jessica Alba half-dressed and dancing around suggestively - holds some appeal for me. Not nearly enough to rescue this movie, but enough to make me not rip it out of my DVD player and throw it in the garbage. What can I say? I'm male."

The part about Honey(Jessica Alba) being a good samaritan plays a big part near the end, but after the first hour, I was bored and just wanted it all to end. When I first saw the trailer, I was interested but nothing I wanted to rush out and see. But finally got around to watching it, and although the movie isn't that bad compared to other dance flicks out there it's nothing special either.

She is 'attacked' by a gang leader but kind of... walks off... and then jokes about buying some mace. Wow! I wish more ghettos were so covered in marsh-mellows and honey-flavoured-muffins! Good to see a rap movie staying so true to its culture.<br/><br/>The emotional manipulation in this movie is just nauseating - she attempts to help a kid getting involved in gangs by getting him a hair cut. Good job Jess: you've shown him what important; heaven forbid that he grows up thinking that only looks matter. Her final advice to him is just genius: ""Don't go back there."" This movie should be a used as a textbook for social workers: It has single-handedly solved the problems of child delinquency and gang warfare.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the movie, the 'bad guy' fires all the kid dancers (after a truly ridiculous set-up) and then then ""Honey"" feels sick and nauseated as a black dancer gyrates next to a car. What?!? She has just *directed* and *choreographed* whole sequences of lewd trashy dances, and now she takes the moral high ground? Reflect on this: the movie is morally bankrupt, but it hides this from the audience under a thin veneer. ""Honey"" builds a career by objectifying women and flinging them around half-naked in front a camera like pieces of meat. But that's OK 'cos shes fulfilling ""Her dream on her terms."" Yeah good.<br/><br/>I know! Let's really save the movie by starting a charity to get young kids to learn how to be sex slaved media whores in (c)rap music videos! That will really tug at the heart strings of the prepubescent audience who fantasise of being a sing-star. Heaven forbid we do anything to complicate or question their rancid desires which will only lead to heartache. Let's pander to them to get more bums on seats. (Scantily-clad ones, preferably, that are ready to flaunt themselves in front of a video of dissipation.) It's not just that there is no acting or talent on display. It's not just that the characters are shallow and say stupid things like ""I'm just your friend, not a main character in this stupid movie"" (OK I made some of that up). It's not just that the plot is horribly contrived: ""Oh, I happen to know thousands of millionaires desperate to throw their money at your stupid cause."" It's that this movie is crap, but just refuses to admit it. If it did, we could have had a masterpiece on our hands, like Crossroads or Glitter. But alas."

She dreams of becoming a professional dance choreographer for music videos, and one day she gets the opportunity when dance video director Michael Ellis (Big's David Moscow) casts her in his latest video, and many there after. Soon Honey wants to change from dancer to choreographer, but success comes at a price when Michael is trying to make sexual advances on her, and she leaves. She has plans to buy an empty building to become a new dance school/centre, and even though Michael is back in her good books, and offers to help pay for it, she refuses and says she can raise the money herself with a special fund raising dance evening. Also starring I Still Know What You Did Last Summer's Mekhi Phifer as Chaz, Joy Bryant as Gina, Lil' Romeo as Benny, Lonette McKee as Mrs. Daniels, Zachary Isaiah Williams as Raymond, Laurie Ann Gibson as Katrina, Judi Embden as Mrs. Strom, Anthony Sherwood as Mr. Daniels and hip-hop star Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott. Alba is fit and likable, and the dance routines are well done, but the story isn't completely gripping or interesting, with corny dialogue and stereotypical characters, but worth a look. Okay!"

","Jessica Alba gives Jennifer Lopez a run for her money when she stars as real life choreographer Honey Daniels, a gifted club dancer who rose from Hood rags to Hollywood glory when she is discovered by a high profiled but over ambitious music video producer. The screenwriter should have paid more attention to the finer details rather than just writing overblown dance scenes that feature Alba trying her best possible to imitate the dancer she plays in the movie. There is almost no substance as we are taken to the streets of Harlem Newyork to watch where Honey was discovered, watch her humanitarian side (which takes a back seat) to her dancer side, to her meeting famed celebrities and working with them etc. etc. Joy Bryant, looking as skinny as ever plays Honey's best friend and there are many cameos from superstars like Missy Elliot, Ginuwine, Tweet, just to name a few and other co-stars include: Mekhi Pfeiffer (Honey's love interest), Romeo (one of the street kids whom Honey helps out) amongst others. Oh and if you're looking for that Christina Aguilera Song that played in the trailers of the film to be featured prominently, look again. The song is barely in the film. It's all good though."

","Throughout life people will dream of things that they wish they will one day become. IN order to achieve your goals you will need a lot of dedication and you need to be able to put a lot of hard work into what you do. Within the movie Honey, a romantic drama directed by Bille Woodruff, the main character Honey Daniels is a hip-hop dancer in New York's East Harlem who dreams of making it big as a music video choreographer. This movie can be categorized as a fairytale because it has a big dream that becomes fulfilled through hard work and faith. <br/><br/>Honey teaches hip-hop dancing class at a local youth center. It's a free class and she encourages and invited local kids to attend. She wants these kids to get involved with her classes so she can help to keep them off the streets and out of trouble. A famous music video director, named Michael, soon spotted Honey, after she was done working her bartending shift at a local nightclub, dancing at a club. Michael saw a lot of potential and talent in Honey and casted her in a music video. After seeing all of her talent not only with dancing but also with choreographing she asks her become choreograph the music videos that he in charge of. <br/><br/>Fame is coming in Honey's direction and soon her name is out and people are requesting her as their choreographer. Michael takes Honey out to a black and white, fancy, party and tries to make sexual contact with her. Honey refused to do anything with Michael, and Michael took away her job and started to try to sabotage her career by blackballing her. <br/><br/>In the end Honey gets what she wants and raises the money to buy a studio for the kids she used to teach hip hop to at the center through a dance benefit they put on. She ends up becoming happy and getting what she wants and what makes her happy. This is a traditional fairytale.<br/><br/>The movie Honey is a fairytale. The movie contains a dream that the main character, Honey, pursues and is extremely dedicated to. Then a conflict comes up and it seems like all hope is lost for her, and she came this far for nothing. But, as in all fairy tales, there is a happy ending in which the main character is able to regain what they once had despite what the antagonist is planning."

","Anyway, a comment about the movie that has OBVIOUSLY been touched before: It's a great dance movie. Dance people will like this movie. It has good dancing. It has OK music, especially the Tears for Fears cover that surprisingly was at passing level. The movie also has the same clichés that some dancers might have faced. It also contains a lot of clichés that a lot of other people can understand since they don't know how to read. Especially about clichés: I love how the characters are very argumentative and how they always have the perfect thing to say. The clichés work in such a way that my figure skater friend will like Ice Diaries, and hopefully she's not reading this review right now. Who cares if Jessica Alba can't act - I can relate to it! So basically, big movie lovers will attack this movie, or as my sister calls this movie, ""a video."" It's a dance movie for the sake of a dance movie and not because it was made to be a movie. If you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Which then leads us to better questions: Should movies be made for purposes like this? And because this movie was made for this intention, should it be disrespected? Was this movie even made with an artistic and aesthetic purpose in the first place? It's up to you.<br/><br/>I also hate how EVERYONE in the movie is stick thin."

","I'm surprised that Jessica Alba hasn't had bigger roles in other films. While Honey won't win any Oscars, Alba made the best of what she had.<br/><br/>The film involves Alba, playing the character Honey Daniels, trying to make the big time as a music dance choreographer. The plot is predictable- Honey tries to reach the top, but won't do it by leaving the people she cares about. In the end, it turns out how you expect. The middle ending. She doesn't win, but doesn't lose. What we call in England a score-draw.<br/><br/>The lack of a climatic ending takes the brass off what was a decent movie. Alba was the perfect character for the role- having the ability to be funny, sexy, classy, girlie, clumsy, amongst other things. There are a lot of notable cameos, including Missy Elliott. Also look out for Lil' Romeo (Benny) and Zachary (can't remember his surname)who plays Raymond. Alba leads the cast well, and her command of the role is impressive. She has to beware that she won't get stuck in the dance-teen-chick-flick genre. It'll be interesting to see her in bigger roles. She is rumoured to be in other films such as Fantastic Four and Sin City, roles which should ask more of her as an actress."

Jessica Alba is a good actress and put a lot of effort into this film, so I'll give her credit for that, Joy Bryant was a disappointment, because I originally liked her performance in the film 'Antwone Fisher' and Zachary Williams was a sweetheart (You just wanna cuddle him!)<br/><br/>The movie starts off like any good Hip Hop film, in a club and we are introduced to the lovely Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba). Now Honey is a struggling dancer who wants to make it big, part time she teaches hip hop at a community centre, works at CD store and is a Club bartender. Sounds interesting? Yeah kinda.<br/><br/>One night, a big time producer Michael Ellis (David Moscow) comes to the club and offers Honey a chance to dance in a music video. Cue the straight hair, fake tan and black spandex.

Yes, you guessed it he only wanted 'one thing'.<br/><br/>Then for the rest of the film Honey decides to do something worthwhile, she holds a fund raiser that'll raise money for a new dance school for the kids.<br/><br/>All in all, I'll give it a 10/10, because I left the cinema feeling good about myself. <br/><br/>This is the kind of movie you would watch with your girlfriends at a slumber party or at a pre-teen's birthday party.<br/><br/>Thank you"

","A bunch of very mean IMDb voters gave this movie a ""1"" vote. It is not that bad a movie. Mostly trite and predictable, it features a cute Jessica Alba and a heartwarming story of inner city kids getting a chance through hip-hop dance. Its most reasonable rating is around '5'.  <br/><br/>SPOILERS - Honey (Alba) is a natural dancer and choreographer, gets ideas by watching street kids, such things as playing basketball or jumping rope, but has trouble getting dancing jobs. Music video director sees her on TV, seeks her out at her job as a bartender, gives her work, lets her show her talents as a choreographer, until he comes on to her at a party, she slaps him, he drops her and blackballs her, no one will hire her. Eager to find a place for the 'hood kids to dance, she uses her money as a down payment, stages a benefit performance, people come to her aid, hip-hop artists insist on using her, she IS a rose growing in the concrete.

"dee.reid","6","0","2","16 June 2004"," ""Honey"" is sweet, but is otherwise empty. 6/10
","I typically try to stay away from movies like ""Honey"" because they appeal to such a limited audience. It's basically music video flash and glitter - the ""Flashdance"" of the 21st century, made for a braindead audience raised on MTV. I was raised on MTV unfortunately, so naturally I fit into this film's demographic, which is why I did like this movie, though it faded from memory very quickly after viewing it. Jessica Alba is sweet, to say the least, and she truly comes alive as Honey Daniels, who dreams of being a music video choreographer. She storms the dance floor in the local club and eventually gains the attention of a prominent music video director who wants her to work with him on his projects. Of course, this puts a strain on the life she already has with her friends and family, as well as her commitment as a dance teacher at the local community center.<br/><br/>This movie resembles ""Flashdance"" in a lot of ways that are too numerous to mention, but that did not stop me from liking ""Honey."" Jessica Alba gives a great performance and I'm probably sure it was her that kept the movie from going off the tracks. Unfortunately though, it is her and only her, plus a few exciting dance sequences that really make this movie memorable. That is why I rated it a ""6."" Nonetheless, this movie is good for a Saturday night with some friends if you have nothing else to do."

","Having the opportunity to see Alba on screen again was enough of a reason for me to rent this movie, even though the reviews had been less than wonderful.

I can't wait for the Alba to be given an opportunity to really act. She has great potential but she hasn't yet been given the opportunity to display any of her talent (except her beautiful good looks - men want her and women want to be like her). All in all, the acting here isn't fantastic and the story isn't something we've never seen before but it does contain some really great dance scenes and some not so bad moments as well.<br/><br/>7/10 An entertaining evening!"

Some dancer becomes famous overnight and then something bad happens. However the movie still turns out to have a happy fairy tale ending. The plot was totally unrealistic. I know Missy Elliot isn't the way she is portrayed in that movie. And why did they have Lil Romeo to play in the movie? They needed a young teenager who actually know how it feels to be poor and living in the ghetto. They needed to give Joy Bryant more lines in that movie.

","Jessica Alba must have something, because she keeps drawing me in. This time, I wasn't quite as disappointed as I have been in the past.<br/><br/>""Honey"" is a reworking of ""Flashdance"" and other dance oriented films, but this time it has a social message. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it is a good message.<br/><br/>Honey is a talented hip hop dancer who teaches her craft or rather, teaches her hobby to other kids.<br/><br/>But as Honey herself quickly finds out, the market for her skills is a limited one and some of the people she has to please to cash in on it are pretty rotten people.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, she would sacrifice anything to give other kids in the ""hood"" a chance to dance. But exactly why that is, or what it is supposed to accomplish, is never spelled out. It seems no more realistic than teaching every African-American boy to play basketball. Unfortunately, there are more of them in one high school than there are openings in the whole NBA and most of them don't have a chance of making a living at it. So, if they sacrifice everything to follow their dream, what happens when the dream doesn't pan out? Because it doesn't for most basketball players, just like it doesn't for most aspiring hiphop dancers.<br/><br/>Don't stay in dance class just to stay off the street, go to school and learn something useful! You're chances of making a living as a hiphop dancer are almost nill.<br/><br/>That's about all there is to say about the film.<br/><br/>Jessica seems to dance very well, but I am no expert on hiphop. But she seemed fine to me.<br/><br/>Her acting here seemed a little better than in her last couple of features, but she was better cast.<br/><br/>She remains beautiful and engaging and you want to like her. <br/><br/>We'll see what she does next."

I'll agree it was predictable. But unless you're watching some crazy horror film, most stories do have happy endings. This movie is very motivating for people who dance, because it makes them want to get out there and do something with themselves instead of wishing you could do certain things. It makes you want to try to learn new things. Make that's a feeling that can only be described from a dancer's point of view.

"Chris_Docker","7","0","1","17 March 2004"," Make the world a better place with dancing?
","Review for non-dancers<br/><br/>Silly formulaic rubbish - dance obsessed teen who has a fairly hollow life (outside of her desire to dance and be nice to kids) goes through predictable scenarios in her Flashdance/Save-The-Last-Dance-style 'rise to success'. She's a girl from the Bronx who makes good. About as original as a woolworths cover album, but maybe kinda nice as a nice, saccharine-coated hip-hop eulogy firmly aimed at the teen market, as long as you can accept its emptiness without wanting anything more.<br/><br/>
Review for dancers<br/><br/>From the first few minutes of this movie, the dancing and music starts pumping and hardly lets up till the end. Most dance movies have a fluffy story interspersed with some cool dancing, one or two have a fluffy story with overly drawn-out dancing, whereas this one hangs on a feelgood story that requires large amounts of snappy dancing in almost every scene.<br/><br/>You know that emotion when you see a dancer spin, and from the flick of her hands and hair, sparks fly off and light up the room. Her enthusiasm is so high that just watching her makes you want to give up that day job and do anything that is vaguely music/dance/keep-fit related. You want to just let the light shine out of you every time you dance - for the thrill of it, for the joy it can bring to others, as an affirmation perhaps of life itself.<br/><br/>Ballet-trained Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works hard just so she can dance - whether it's coaching local kids at hip-hop or bartending in a nightclub so she can dance for free after her shift. Her aim is to break into MTV-style dance videos.<br/><br/>(plot spoilers - next para only - short synopsis)<br/><br/>When she eventually gets the break, she not only dances but starts producing fabulous choreography for Missy Elliott style numbers for television. The big boss drunkenly tries to get her to sleep with him - and chucks her out when she refuses. She wants to found a dance school for the kids in the Bronx but with her wages cut she has to perform a benefit dance show to raise the cash. The video producer begs her to go back when the recording artists start demanding her but she sticks to her principles. The benefit fund-raiser dance is success, her parents are proud of her, former competitors and worried friends all bond with her, and the kids on the block get their dance school which keeps them off the street life of petty crime.<br/><br/>Admittedly if you don't like hip-hop / streetdance / breakdance the film may do nothing for you. If you do, but only dance partner dance, you may feel inspired or even take some of the movements, and practice them to add to your current dance moves. There's plenty of funky moves and some cool choreography.<br/><br/>The lead character's humanitarian spirit also brings out one of the highest aims of dancing - to make the world a better place in some small way. Dance should not be divisive - it might be the highest aspiration of the free spirit to communicate joy and bring others together using a language beyond words, beyond social class, age, gender or other things that divide people. Looking at it like this, for those who choose to do so, it gives some meaning to our 'obsession' with dance.<br/><br/>I notice hip-hop is being increasingly taught  not an easy dance but fabulous for adding those split timing add-ons. It's also often taught as a work out (check out ads for streetdance'). Timing is tight  fashion is motion  movement is meaning  communication is flow  sex is attitude  feel the rush  <br/><br/>Or just go and see Honey . . ."

I'm only 13, and I wished I could have seen those movies in theaters, so Honey was my big chance. I figured it would be cheesy, but it was WAY better than I thought. Even the two gangster type guys sitting behind me in the theater liked it. However, it could have been better. The same guy who wrote Glitter wrote Honey, and Honey was a big improvement.

Granted, it ripped off many movies - Sister Act 2, Glitter and Save The Last Dance, but I thought that 2/3 of those movies were good in the first place. The 2 main child characters of Benny and Raymond were strongly performed, and Jessica Alba held the whole movie together like she understood the character.

It's no-where near original, they overused the word honey in the songs and dialogue, they didn't go into parts of the story deep enough - such as Honey's blossoming romance, her relationship with her parents, child abuse and troublesome teens. -Ok that sounds like there's a lot wrong with it, and it's true.

","Alright, so we've seen this plot before  girl has job, boy meets girl, girl has chance at a better job (thanks to boy's offer), girl takes job (and leaves those who really mean the world to her behind), boy reveals himself as a jerk, girl must decide on old way of life or new ... yup, we've seen it before.<br/><br/>The thing is, without giving too much more of the plot away, we need movies such as this, where the good guys win, that drugs can get you into a big mess of trouble, that material goods (money) are ends to a means (a better life), and through some creative thinking your dreams can come true.<br/><br/>Aside from the been there-done that plot, the acting surely is far from that you'd see in the truly great movies. Still, it works. The characters are believable and you find yourself wanting to cheer for the good guys, that the shady video producer ""gets his"" and that the most vulnerable will eventually catch on to the good way of life.<br/><br/>Still, this is only memorable for a little while, and that's why, on my scale of 0-5 stars, it gets a 2 1/2. It's alright, but cliched and forgettable."
"Spanner-2","4","0","2","17 December 2003"," Silly formula claptrap
","A formula yarn with Jessica Alba (of TV's ""Dark Angel"") as a young girl in Brooklyn whose goal is to have an inner city dance studio... she winds up being a music video dancer and then a choreographer seemingly overnight due to a sudden friendship with a sleazy video producer... and then she winds up having to put on a show with the neighborhood kids to get the dance studio... About as formula as you can get... but watchable because of Alba's genuine likeability.. Still, pretty silly stuff. GRADE: C-"

"Blaze452","10","0","2","8 December 2003"," Although it's predictable, it doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable
","This movie was very enjoyable, even though the plot is very similar to many of its predecessors, it was a sweet movie, and i liked it.  Jessica Alba truly shined during this movie, and i liked the way it played out.  Its a good inspirational film, with drama, comedy, and all thats in between, i give it an A-"
"Flight32","Null","0","2","7 December 2003"," A lot of dance, a lot of heart.
","'Honey' deals with the balance between success and social responsibility. Jessica Alba plays Honey Daniels, a hip-hop dance teacher at a New York city youth center.  Honey rockets to success with her unique style but starts to loose her connection with the community she loves.  Believing that success is a debt that must be repaid, she uses her new found fortune to start a dance center.  When her new world takes an unfortunate turn Honey is left without enough money to complete the center.  'Honey' is full of hip beats, strong dancing, and a lot of heart.  The topics are relevant, the story inspiring, and by the end the characters are more than images on a screen. The climax is touching and worthy of applause."
"rcavellero","8","0","2","7 December 2003"," As sweet as they come!
","In a time when films get more depressing in nature just for the holiday season. Honey stands alone as a prime example of goodness in this holiday season targeted obviously at youth but enjoyable to a huge majority. The story is extremely cliche and predictable. But hey who cares in a film you walk out of with a huge smile on your face. Although it has hints of campiness straight out of showgirls and glitter. It doesn't fare as bad as them.  Actually it's quite entertaining and the film's weak aspects are highlighted by decent performances, fabulous choreography and good chemistry.  Jessica Alba does what she can with the role. Some of the lines are a little cheesy but overall the film delivers more than it's supposed to. So for anyone whose looking for a nice, timid night out at the movies. Check out Honey, it's as sweet as they come."
"agacyb","7","0","2","5 December 2003"," Enjoyable, but not for the serious buff
","I'm not in the demographic that should love Honey, but I enjoyed it. I certainly wouldn't recommend paying night-out prices for it, but it'll be a decent rental, and was very enjoyable for my 11-year-old daughter (the one who insisted on seeing it on opening day) -- she gave it a 9. Jessica Alba plays a Mother Teresa-as-hottie type character (think Cameron Diaz as ""Mary"", minus the comedy), Mekhi Phifer as a barber (as IF!), and a few cute ghetto kids who dance... all pretty much 2D stuff, but as eye candy it works for kids or innocuous dates. The movie's been compared to Flashdance, and I guess one could hardly fail to notice the homage in Alba's off-the-shoulder 80s style. Alba is part Jennifer Beals for the new millennium and part Jennifer Lopez pre-J.Lo attitude and Affleck, but she's gorgeous and she's got all the moves. You could do worse."

","""Honey"" gets a credit for not trying to become an average good-old movie. It was an inspirational hip-hop musical.  Really good musics.  Loved Missy Elliot and her presence in there. I like this kind of movie once in a while. It reminded me of Flashdance in the beginning, but this movie was bit more driven than that.  School of hip-hop, Jessica Alba version."
"hoversj","6","0","1","21 December 2003"," Sweet as its name.
","This movie is sweet - which fits Jessica Alba, since she's very sweet (get her and Charlize Theron in a movie together and we'd all get diabetes).<br/><br/>Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have felt right at home in this movie, with the idea of putting on a big show to raise the money for a Good Cause.<br/><br/>It's not a deep movie, and not an ""important"" movie, but it's very watchable, the dancing is pretty cool, and who could forget the line<br/><br/>Honey's best friend: ""You're not ducking? You're ducking like a bobblehead doll!"""
