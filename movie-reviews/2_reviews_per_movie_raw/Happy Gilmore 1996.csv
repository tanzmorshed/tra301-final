"ccthemovieman-1","9","85","101","30 March 2006"," To Be Remembered Forever: 'Happy' And Bob Barker Trading Blows
","A ""pro"" golfer duking it out with veteran game-show host Bob Barker right in the middle of a tournament. That scene alone makes this one of the more memorable comedies of the last 30 years. Almost everyone I know has either seen or heard of that scene and everyone laughs at it.<br/><br/>It IS ludicrous and that's what makes it so funny. In fact, most of the movie is totally preposterous, totally unbelievable and totally wacky, which is Adam Sandler's trademark in these comedies. He's low key but violent, as he was in Mr. Deeds, Punch-Drunk Love and a few other films.<br/><br/>Here, Sander is even more vocal and violent than normal and definitely more crude, which is saying something since this actor usually doesn't play guys with a lot of class. ""Happy"" is a hot-tempered hockey player who can hit a golf ball 400 yards so he tries his hand on the PGA tour to help raise money for his grandmother. I just shake my head even writing that last sentence, it sounds so stupid....but this is a stupid movie with an incredibly stupid story but is hilarious, for the most part.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a golfer would appreciate this movie more than others, because Sandler says and does things we'd all like to do on the links at times but, thankfully, don't. In short: this is a crude but very funny movie."

","""Happy Gilmore"" is the Adam Sandler movie to see. If everyone had to see one Sandler movie before their lives were complete, I would seriously hope this is the movie they see. It's nice to see golf and hockey in a movie again. I don't think there is another movie out there that makes me laugh as much as ""Happy Gilmore"" does. You have Happy, the ultimate hero, fighting to win a life of security for his grandma. There's Shooter McGavin, the villain you love to hate, who attempts to foil Happy's quest. And then there's Mr. Larson, Happy's 8' tall monster of a former employer, threatening Shooter at every turn. Hey Bob Barker is in this movie! It doesn't get much funnier than Mr. Price Is Right insulting our hero. Well maybe Ben Stiller's part in this movie is funnier, as he corruptly directs a retirement home. It doesn't matter what's the funniest. This whole movie is one hilarious moment after another."

","Adam Sandler has a very funny movie here that works like no other since Caddyshack.  Sandler plays a lazy guy who has to save his grandmother's house from being removed.  So, he starts to play golf in a way that only Sandler can.  He is also instructed by Carl Weathers (who memorably played Apollo Creed in Rokcy), and wathcing his scenes I had to leave the theater from laughing so much (he had a wooden hand and it always gets knocked off). Sandler knows how to keep people rolling in the ailes, and this proves it. A++"
"Mr-Fusion","8","6","6","25 February 2019"," Violence, hockey, vulgarity ... all the good stuff!
","My favorite Adam Sandler movie.<br/><br/>I just think it aligns perfectly with his comic persona. He seems to fit this character perfectly. It's the kind of adolescent silliness that I gravitate toward. I can't tell you how happy I was that my 9 year-old seemed to approve (""That was a very good movie""). And she's way more mature than her old man is.<br/><br/>It's not just the character of Happy Gilmore that's memorable here, but also Shooter McGavin, and Christopher McDonald deserves credit for making the entitled jackass a solid villain. Same for Carl Weathers, and you would think he'd be slumming it here, but he sure doesn't show it.<br/><br/>Best of all? Out-of-Nowhere Bob Barker; secure enough in his celebrity to openly parody it with a free-for-all fistfight.<br/><br/>Tell me ""The Price is Wrong, b***h!"" isn't one of Sandler's best lines."
"d-crowder","Null","33","44","6 October 2004"," Slapstick humour that does not need you to think but with excellent timing.
","Adam Sandler may not be the all-round actor who can deliver many different comic performances but he does have a certain comic style. Happy Gilmore is a failed Hockey player who cannot skate and has a lack of any self-discipline. His life seems to be a complete failure until he finds out he can hit a golf ball over 400 yards. At first you might feel little empathy for Happy as he obviously deserves all the bad luck he gets from the way he treats his friends. But the introduction of Shooter to the screen suddenly makes you root for the underdog. The plot is thrown together to get the most out of Sandler and his antics on screen. Some of the scenes are totally unbelievable particularly when a car is driven on to the golf course to run down Happy! But no matter how many times I see the film it can still make me laugh."

","Okies....here we have the indisputable King of mediocrity but one thing you gotta say for Sandler - they don't come more unpretentious! He delivers what you expect and in HAPPY GILMORE he came up undeniably with his best film!<br/><br/>As the wannabe hockey great in dire need of an anger-management course, Sandler discovers by chance his prodigious golfing talents - but using a hockey stick! In a performance best decribed as R-rated Jerry Lewis, Sandler is a hoot as he takes on Bob Barker, the establishment and Shooter McGavin - golfing's hissable ""Mr Smarm"" (An Oscar-worthy turn from Christopher McDonald)<br/><br/>Carl Weathers turns in a blinder as Sandler's newly come-by coach with an unfortunate earlier run-in with a hungry croc! If you don't find anything in this film funny, you're a dead person! Like many devotees, we have watched this film countless times - it just improves with age!"

The timing is just perfect. It's a great movie to watch with friends for the first time, especially for the fact that you will be quoting lines with them randomly for quite a while. I have seen it over 30 times, and I still laugh. This is Adam Sandler at his very best. Great random characters, such as the ""Jackass"" man, the homeless guy, and very best, Bob Barker! To tell you the truth,""It'll make you laugh until you hyperventilate"". There's not only great vocal humor, but the visuals and especially the body language coming from the actors is classic.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","28","44","29 July 2006"," It's not Caddyshack, but it's quality comedy
","Happy Gilmore is Adam Sandler's only standout performance in a long list of half-assed, unfunny comedies. But this is it, the real deal. This is the film that all other Sandler films make references to, quote and celebrate, in case you ever wondered where phrases like ""It's all in the hips"" (as said in Little Nicky) and ""You eat pieces of sh*t for breakfast?"" (quoted everywhere) came from. Well, Happy Gilmore is the birth of these phrases as well as the birth of a comedic star. It is also just all-around solid comedic entertainment and a crash-course in golf. Or rather, 101 Things Not To Do On The Golf Course.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is Happy. But this is only his character's ironic name, because Happy is really quite angry and extremely frustrated at getting nowhere in his amateur hockey career. He slips into golf by what can only be described as a fluke, and is able to take out his aggressions on the golf-court, setting records for longest drives ever as he aggressively hits the ball. The anger he has is advantageous here, but a big problem when it comes to putting - and an even bigger problem when it comes to dealing with smug competitors like Shooter McGavin (superbly played by Christopher McDonald).<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore thus follows Sandler on the golf-court, where 90% of the film takes place. Happy is one of those rare characters in films that you desperately pull for and end up hating all of his competitors and enemies. In this way, Happy Gilmore is a very effective film as it establishes a hero-feeling with its main character, in spite of his flaws. I can't think of many other films in which I've wanted the lead character to win as much as in this one. On top of that device, you have such gems like Adam Sandler beating up old man Bob Barker on the green, Adam Sandler screaming at a golf ball asking it ""Are you too good for your home?"", and Christopher McDonald in one of the most hilarious and subtlety comedic performances of the 1990s.<br/><br/>So Happy Gilmore is the Godfather of all Sandler films, as well as the only truly good one. It borrows somewhat from Caddyshack in the goofy golf sense so it can't be considered truly original, but it IS original when it comes to Happy Madison productions.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jaysilentbob37","7","28","44","2 July 2006"," A film that I treasure.
","This film is the one that introduced me to one of my favorite actors, Adam Sandler. His movies are mostly hit-or-miss gag machines, but this is one of his movies in which nearly every gag works. I almost miss the old Adam Sandler. The old Adam Sandler character would be a man who acts nice, but turns violent and angry when he doesn't get his way. Now he plays a mild-mannered every-man who makes little wisecracks. Not that the latter isn't funny, but the former is what he'll always be remembered for, and this is a perfect example of an Adam Sandler's true comedic side.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a nearly unlikeable loser who after a strangely traumatic childhood, grew up to be a raving, anti-social lunatic, who happens to be obsessed with hockey. He constantly tries out for hockey teams, and proudly holds two league records (Most time spent in the penalty box, and he was the only person in history to ever take off his skate and try to stab somebody). One day, his girlfriend dumps him, he doesn't make the hockey team, and the IRS repossesses his grandmothers house which he grew up in. Soon, he discovers that he has an incredible talent for golf, with a record breaking long drive. Unwillingly taken under the wing of one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), and becomes a golf sensation due to his long drive, and extremely rude behavior, much to the dismay of the leading tour money winner, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). A bitter rivalry and a race-against-time ensue, as Happy tries to earn back his grandma's house, and beat Shooter.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a movie that I truly adore, and will always cherish. There are many quotable lines, and hilariously random scenes and/or characters. One of the funniest ones is a cameo by Ben Stiller as a cold-blooded orderly at an old folks home, who treats the citizens like inmates. One of the funniest comic bits in any Adam Sandler movie is the sequence in which Happy gets into a fistfight with Bob Barker, the host of ""The Price is Right."" For some reason, Bob fails to notice the heckler who's most frequently uttered word never fails to affect Happy's game for the worst. <br/><br/>Another hilarious thing about this movie is how many of the characters in the movie manage to play their parts and keep a straight face, even when Happy is assaulting innocent people for the smallest reasons, and cussing out the golf ball when it won't go ""home."" Happy is one of a group of quirky characters in the film, but much of the humor comes from the reactions of the serious characters, and/or the extras when Happy does something stupid. One hilarious example of this is when Happy repeatedly screams out every word that can't be said on TV, well... on TV. The overall premise of the film is fun, and the film delivers non-stop laughs. Sit back and enjoy the classic Adam Sandler vehicle. I highly recommend this film, and give it 10/10. <br/><br/>It is proudly rated PG-13 for Language and Comic Sexuality. Sex: 4/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 5/10 Drugs: 2/10"
"thesar-2","7","3","3","27 July 2015"," Don't Look Now, I'm Finally Happy
","A follow-up to his miserable Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore is actually one of Adam Sandler's best comedies he's done. Maybe they got the right script, the correct director or just that Sandler dropped his loud, incoherent, obnoxious and incomprehensible gibberishÂ…a ton worked here and I found myself actually (and FINALLY) laughing out loud in one of his comedies.<br/><br/>I do my best to keep an open mind during any movie, and I devoted this weekend to spend more time with Sandler's more well-known films I hadn't seen. Even though, I didn't have high expectations for this. It didn't help, the opening credits were fairly lame and I thought: here we go again. But, then, the comedy began to work with Sandler's first couple of strokes of the golf balls. I started to uncontrollably laugh and enjoyed myself for the remainder of the flick.<br/><br/>Granted, it's not the most original movie, and it relied on the usual antics, movie tricks and clichÃ©s. Still, I enjoyed the ride despite knowing how it would play out.<br/><br/>Sandler works best when he doesn't lower himself to sudden, expected and whiney outbursts. Much like modern-day Melissa McCarthy; when she's not ""Tammy,"" she's pretty damn funny. <br/><br/>If I hadn't just now watched this movie for the first time in 2015, I would've had a renewed faith in Sandler, despite his already failing grade in 1996. Unfortunately, he would continue to make an enormous amount of garbage that would certainly make his movies a(n unintentional) laughing stalk in the industry. That all said, he's had a few gems, and I completely recommend this one."

","This movie was my first introduction to Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I tend to avoid popular comedies because I rarely find them worth the trouble (or expense). This was a movie that was bundled with another, in the 'previously viewed' bin.<br/><br/>I can't recall the other movie (wasn't worth the time it took to watch it) but this one was hilarious.<br/><br/>I have since purchased the DVD and viewed it enough times to make the wife groan whenever I reach for it. I have yet to show this movie to any friends or family and find one who didn't like it. The movie is basically about golf (as evidenced from the picture on the box) but you don't have to know a thing about the sport to enjoy it (I didn't). I love movies, but its been a while since I enjoyed one so much."

","Time and experience has made me loath to watch nearly any movie starring an SNL alumni. Yet every now and then one rises from the comedic swamp that is actually better than the rest of the stable. This is one of them. I avoided seeing this movie until now. After viewing it I was pleasantly surprised. I admit that I didn't expect much so I was quite ready to 'diss' this movie. And, indeed, there are places where you're not sure something was supposed to be funny or not, but the movie doesn't dwell. The pacing keeps it alive and interesting. It's good to see Richard Kiel again. Carl Weathers is a hoot with his wooden prosthetic hand and obviously longer arm. He should do more comedy. And Bob Barker!! A great and memorable inclusion. The only real disappointment was the rather abrupt ending. It didn't go off with a bang - it faded. Abraham Lincoln? Why? Why not. His sudden brief appearance for no reason is always funny. Bottomline: if you find the need to watch a movie from the line of SNL players - this is a good recommendation. I didn't kick myself afterward like I have with Will Ferrell flicks, etc."

"eric262003","8","4","5","30 July 2013"," Back In a Time When Sandler Was More Risky
","Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was ""Billy Madison"" and this one here ""Happy Gilmore"".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career. For the past decade and a half, Sandler's movies have been simple in plot, but they are never short on entertainment and you become quite passive over the surreal moments. ""Happy Gilmore is by far no exception to the rule.<br/><br/>Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a young energetic hockey player with a big problem, he can't skate. Happy is raised by his grandmother after his father was killed after a severe slap shot to the head. When government officials discover that his grandmother owes them $270,000 in taxes. they raid her house and repossess every on of her belongings that even includes the house. And that they'll only get it back if they can find a way to pay the money they owe.<br/><br/>With his hockey career being null and void, Happy seems his chances of getting back her loot is virtually impossible. As the movers carry their possessions, one of the moving men starts up a bet to Happy that happy couldn't strike a golf ball farther than him. Much to even Happy's surprise he actually has the amazing ability to to drive the ball well over 400 yards. This inspires Happy who continues to gain impressions on spectators including Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who was an ex golfer whose career was cut short by an alligator bite. on his hand.<br/><br/>Chubbs persuades Happy to compete in a local tournament and if he succeeds, he will be eligible to compete in the PGA tournament. And so Happy emerges victorious and brings a volatile demeanour and mean drive as well as a very strong fan following. But his short-tempered attitude almost gets him kicked off the tournament due to his gratuitous cursing and destroying clubs. With the help from Chubbs he progressively tones down his act and even his payroll starts to materialize. During the tournament, Happy becomes a hated rival by a top player named Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) McGavin takes the sport seriously while at the same time looks down on all the competitors due to his condescending nature.<br/><br/>There is not very much thought put into the movie, but that could all be forgiven because it's hilarious and brilliantly scripted. and after ""Billy Madison"" this is the second funniest film that Sandler ever performed. This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss out. It's hilarious, easy to follow along and even if you don't like golf it's still fun to watch."

"coledrew","8","2","2","26 October 2016"," Happy Gilmore
","Happy Gilmore is a great movie. It's a great movie for many reasons, the plot is fantastic, the script is awesome and Adam Sandler is hysterical. The 1996 film starring Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald and Carl Weathers is a classic. Directed by Dennis Dugan, it is one of his bests along with other films like Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, both Grown Ups 1 and 2, Just Go with It and Jack and Jill. Being produced by Robert Simonds, this is also one of his best known films. Other notable films produced by Simmonds are Cheaper by the Dozen and The Pink Panther, This Means War and Big Daddy. Happy Gilmore is a rejected hockey player with a really hard slap shot. He gets cut from the same team every year but still tries out. He finds out that his grandma, who raised him as a child, house is being evicted. While playing around with some golf clubs he learns he can drive a golf ball really far. With help from his friend and trainer, Chubbs, he works his way up to the PGA tour in hopes to win enough money to get his grandma's house back. His antics attract an unusual crowd to the PGA tour which is good for business but other top golfers like Shooter McGavin think he's an embarrassment. Making $41.20 million dollars, Happy Gilmore is another one of Adam Sandler's best movies. The comedy was rated 7/10 of IMDb which is lower than what I believe it should be. I would rate the movie 8.5/10. 30 year old Adam Sandler is hilarious in this film and the acting over all is very good. Another reason I love this movie is because I think they did an awesome job attracting all audiences, I watch this movie with my family all the time. It attracts people of all ages. My younger cousins and my grandma and grandpa both love this movie as well. Over all, this movie is a classic. It has a very funny plot that is easy to follow for everyone. The actors assisting Sandler do a great job supporting him throughout the film. There are many hilarious scenes and quotes from Happy Gilmore. Most people have seen the movie already, but if you have not you definitely should soon."
"Floated2","8","2","2","9 August 2016"," Enjoyable Older Sandler film
","Happy Gilmore is an early film of Adam Sandler's during his 1990's era. The spirit of the film and the title character played by Sandler are every bit as enjoyable as many have considered this film to be. Happy is the ultimate chip-on-his-shoulder leading man, who settles every argument with a punch in the nose or a biting wisecrack. He has a short fuse which is shown that the slightest spark can set him off, occasionally with great results. He is a lifelong hockey fan, and he wants desperately to play with the pros, but he has one problem which is he can't skate. However after one day occasionally fooling around with golf with a few friends, he is noticed by former gold legend Chubbs. From there on, Chubbs tells him that Happy is a great and has talent, though Happy doesn't want any part of golf since his goal is to become a hockey player. Happy Gilmore does have several decent laughs and Adam Sandler plays the character as needed. For a comedy the plot works well enough and the pacing is good. It isn't too long and it is quite enjoyable for those of fans of this sort of comedy. As a rewatch 02/27/20' Happy Gilmore remains an enjoyable and fun positive watch."
"CinematicInceptions","7","2","2","22 March 2015"," Prototypical Sandler movie. Well blended comedy with memorable characters.
","Although it isn't the most incredible cinematic work to ever come out of Hollywood, it is understandable how Happy Gilmore is one of the mostly widely enjoyed comedies out there. It lacks a good story and has all of the trademarks of a standard Sandler movie, but it hits several areas of comedy that can please a lot of people with different comedic tastes.<br/><br/>The storyline is structured much like Billy Madison with Sandler starting off as a burnout and going through some trials to achieve a goal and beat a villain that comes up partway through. Several points of the story feature rather far-fetched outcomes to hopeless scenarios. The plot is pretty weak in its gradual development with Shooter McGavin, and the movie might have been better off without any plot, but even in comedies, there has to be some kind of plot.<br/><br/>None of the characters, like the storyline, have a whole lot of depth. Sandler's character has a much different personality from Billy Madison, but he, as always, has some goofy remarks, witty remarks, over the top antics, and spats of anger. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the character that all other Sandler characters are based off of. Grandma, Virginia, Chubbs, and Shooter McGavin have personality, but not arcs. Grandma losing her house is basically the driving force of the story, and we can see that she matters a lot to Happy. Virginia is primarily present to keep Happy from letting his hockey instincts get out of hand, and ends up as his girlfriend without realistic reason. Chubbs is a pretty likable character and is a rather pivotal besides. Shooter McGavin, while not an interesting villain like Heath Ledger's Joker or action movie villains, is still a great antagonist because of his ability to be such a hateable and passive-aggressive jerk. There are also a lot of small but memorable characters that Happy plays golf with or around, such as Bob Barker, his two caddy's, the obnoxious fan at the celebrity tournament, Mr. Larson, and the guy that talks about the golf ball's energy.<br/><br/>As I said before, the comedy reaches several regions, though it maintains a constant goofy and blatant feel. Some of it's crude, but not as much as in, say, Anger Management. There is a good balance of situational and verbal humor. Basically every character, big and small, that has a line brings some kind of comedy in their screen time. Even the golf channel announcers, who are scripted like real sports announcers, contribute humor. Probably what sets this movie apart is its ability to bring a diversity of comedy into each individual scene. Not everything in every scene will strike you as funny, but there will probably be a couple of laughs in each.<br/><br/>A quick word on the execution. The visual quality and cinematography with Happy's insane shots are nothing special, but somehow add to the general mood. The acting and scripting are debatable, as in most comedies, but you can tell that every actor fits their respective character.<br/><br/>Again, this is pretty much the prototypical Sandler comedy so if you have liked any of his other movies, apart from maybe Airheads, this should be at least somewhat enjoyable. It doesn't take a high IQ to appreciate, and can be seen under almost any circumstances. I would recommend watching it on a road trip if the audience isn't too young. If you don't mind a little ridiculousness, it's worth a rental. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","Happy Gilmore - Synopsis The 1996 classic, Happy Gilmore, directed by Denis Dugan tells a story of a man in his mid-twenties with no real future. Happy Gilmore is the main character, played by Adam Sandler. Happy only dreams of becoming a professional ice hockey star, the main problem he faces is he cannot skate very well. When he is not chosen for the hockey team he beats up his coach. Then soon after he is dumped by his girlfriend and his grandmother's house is seized by the IRS. He now needs to make $250,000 to pay back all the taxes. This becomes his driving force throughout the whole movie. He decides to take up golf when he hears from a veteran golf pro 'Chubbs' that he could earn ""the big bucks."" Chubbs also agrees to be his coach. Happy goes through one of the amateur tournaments at his local golf course, the Waterbury open. Happy wins this tournament which gives him a birth onto the professional tour. His style of play is very unorthodox, and very similar to his ice hockey strokes. He becomes known for his long drives and the lack of care for the golfing etiquette. Happy goes through the movie, rising through the ranks of the pro golf and soon he finds his main rival, Shooter Mcgavin. Shooter was the best player on the tour and loved all of the attention he would get, and when Happy came onto the scene, he stole some of Shooters fans. The rivalry became very personal when Shooter bought Happy's grandmothers house and says he will burn it down unless happy beats him in the tour final tournament. This heated rivalry brings out a dark side in both players, playing tricks on each other as well some very un sportsman-like conduct. At the end of the movie Happy wins the tournament and gets the house back. Happy Gilmore is MPAA rated PG-13, however it contains a high amount of violence and bad language which makes it more suitable to a higher MPAA rating."

","If you are someone who is looking to watch an Oscar winning movie, or movies like Pulp Fiction, The Matrix, or Inception, then this is not the movie for you. However, if you want to have 92 minutes of non-stop laughter, with hilarious line after hilarious line, you must stop what you are doing and watch ""Happy Gilmore."" There are endless scenes and lines of the movie that will make you literally ""Laugh out Loud."" For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet-considering it came out in 1996, I don't know what you are waiting for. In ""Happy Gilmore,"" director Dennis Dugan takes the conventional sports movie and throws a completely different twist on it. Personally, I think that if Happy Gilmore could've wrote the movie he would've made himself the most successful hockey player instead of a great golfer. The comedy ""Happy Gilmore"" takes arguably one of the funniest and loudest actors in history, Adam Sandler, and throws him into the calm, peaceful and serene game of golf. Who knows what could possibly happen from this? From the moment the movie opens with a captivating seen about Happy's past, one would never realize where the movie ends up going. The spin the director puts on the movie makes ""Happy Gilmore"" become one of the greatest sports comedies of all time.<br/><br/>The audience is able to see in one of the first few scenes of the movie what type of character Happy Gilmore is and where the entire movie is going to end up. Right away the witty humor of Happy Gilmore is shown during hockey tryouts when he has this life long dream of becoming a professional hockey player when he can barely skate. Players and coaches mock him, but one thing that emerges from this, is his determination and will to succeed. This is one of the greatest character traits that Happy has and this is shown later on in the film. The movie is almost ridiculous in which you take a guy whose dream is to play hockey and put him in a situation where he needs to learn to play golf in order to succeed. The funny and ironic part about the whole situation is that golf and hockey are almost opposites. Although you get a glimpse of a hockey arena in the first scene the remainder of the movie takes place primarily on the golf course. Approximately 90 percent of the movie is seen on the golf course, and it is here that the great personality of Happy Gilmore is portrayed. One could make the argument that Happy Gilmore is actually crazy. Happy has such anger, rage and aggression toward everything and everyone involved with the game of golf. His ridiculous abilities to drive the ball further than any player has done before, paired up with his ridiculous stance for driving and putting, leads other to laugh and mock him. Most people would be able to ignore these distractions, but not Happy, he would go scream, punch and kick anyone that rubbed him the wrong way. He would constantly scream at his clubs and the small white golf ball various things such as, ""Are you too good for your home?"" This is extremely atypical behavior to see from anyone on the golf course but this is what contributes to the eccentricity of the movie.<br/><br/>Happy plays the role of an underdog but not a typical underdog like in the movie ""The Replacements"" or ""Remember the Titans."" His role as an underdog is quite odd and eccentric and because of that so many people root for him to win. Happy Gilmore is a stand out character in the world of sports movies because of how different he is than other sports underdogs. Due to the fact that he is not your typical underdog, he has this great ability to emotionally bring the audience into the movie, to both sympathize with, and cheer on throughout the movie. In the sport of golf he would typically be a person golf fans hate, but because of the eccentricity of the movie, Happy is the perfect underdog candidate. The director juxtaposes Happy Gilmore with the antagonist of the movie Shooter McGavin who is the exact opposite of him.<br/><br/>The movie would be nowhere near the same if it wasn't for Christopher McDonald playing the role of Shooter McGavin with sheer brilliance. Shooter McGavin comes off as one of the cockiest, most arrogant players on the PGA tour and McDonald does a perfect job portraying this. Through Christopher McDonalds acting, the viewer is able to get a clear understanding of how obnoxious and rude Shooter McGavin is. Shooter McGavin could be compared to that of Tiger Woods (in his prime) and is the standout favorite to win the PGA Championship. Although his golf abilities are on par with those of Tiger Woods, his attitude and demeanor is nothing like that of Tiger Woods, which is respectful and classy. People in the movie and those watching at home, develop such a strong hatred for Shooter McGavin and find just seeing him an extremely bitter sight. Christopher McDonalds ability to play the role of Shooter McGavin greatly enhances the movie as a whole, as well as his conflicting battle with Adam Sandler."

I rank this movie as his 3rd best ever in my opinion. Big Daddy comes in 2nd and the Water Boy is my favorite Sandler Movie. Many great actors have made their great career starts on SNL.

","I've enjoyed listening to Adam Sandlers CD's, and I found Billy Madison ammusing. I expected Happy Gilmore to be much the same. I was a little disappointed. The movie had its moments, but the majority of the movie consists of Happy beating up everyone, breakin' out into swear-a-thons, hitting balls very very far. This might appeal to most true Sandler fans, but I thought it was like listening to the TOLL BOOTH WILLY (There All Gonna Laugh At You) over and over agian for about 90 mins. <br/><br/>6 out of 10"

The great thing is that he's only one of a number of great performances in this movie.  Carl Weathers is also very well done as the former pro whose career was cut short by a hungry alligator.  Ben Stiller is decent as the evil retirement home intern, and whoever it was that played Shooter McGavin was about as annoying as could be (which means he played his part well!)...<br/><br/>I heartily recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh.

"bob the moo","Null","7","12","19 October 2003"," Average comedy with energy and a few genuine laughs (but mostly goofball ones)
","Frustrated ice hockey player Happy Gilmore will never make it into the sport despite his intense hitting strength and aggressive game.  When he is seen by ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson, on a driving range, Happy is offered the chance to enter a golf contest.  When his Grandma's house is repossessed, Happy enters in order to make money quickly.  However soon it becomes about more than money as pro Shooter McGavin tries to show him up.<br/><br/>Those watching an Adam Sandler comedy usually are prepared for the type of humour that they are about to experience.  I know I didn't sit down expecting clever, witty word play or an intricate, playful script that toys with my emotions. No, I knew that I was ready for the man-child's clowning and lots of dumb, silly jokes.  So I actually quite enjoyed my time spent watching this film as I knew what I was getting into.  The plot is simply dumb but of course that's the point!  The fun is supposed to be in watching Happy getting where he's going rather than wondering if he'll come out on top or not.<br/><br/>The jokes are pretty run of the mill for Sandler.  They all have a certain quality that will raise a vague smile often enough to enjoy, but doesn't really ever make you laugh out loud more than a handful of times.  Of course for lots of times, Sandler's overacting (or overreacting!) makes things funnier and he does an OK job with the material.  The actual role is the same one he always plays and is not hard for him.  Guest is better with witty support but Sandler pretty much runs the film without ruining it.<br/><br/>While it didn't totally grab my full attention and have me rolling, it was amusing and light enough not to have to concentrate on  which is what I was looking for on a cold Saturday afternoon.  Not really worth checking out if you can't stand Sandler, but neutrals on the subject (such as me) will find it passable enough comedy. Die hard fans will, of course, love it to death but fear not, for a vengeful God awaits them!"
"StevePulaski","5","4","6","26 November 2011"," The price is right, but the payment is short
","Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is often cited as ""Sandler's funniest film."" I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned.<br/><br/>The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world.<br/><br/>What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade.<br/><br/>There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clichés, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego.<br/><br/>It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, ""things didn't go my way"" kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character.<br/><br/>Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy.<br/><br/>When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor.<br/><br/>But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been ""humor, come on down!"" Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers. Directed by: Dennis Dugan."

I've lost track how many times I've seen this film, but it's still funny every single time. Bob Barker scrapping with Happy was hilarious. All supporting actors were perfectly cast. The writing - specifically turning a slow paced sport like golf into a comedy, was executed to perfection. This one is in my top favorite films of all time and a gem in my DVD collection.

","A temperamental aspiring hockey star with no talent finds he has a gift for the game of golf and uses it to make enough money to buy his grandmother's house back. This has light- hearted sports comedy written all over it. Toss in the comedy of Adam Sandler and then you go from light-hearted to wacko and borderline stupid. Either way, ""Happy Gilmore"" is about as easy to watch as rain drops on a window.<br/><br/>Like all collaborations between Sandler and director Dennis Dugan, ""Happy"" is full of strange characters (grandmas, midgets, awkwardly tall people) and stuck up, obnoxious antagonists (like Shooter McGavin) that make you like Sandler's terribly flawed character merely by default. Like many of his earlier films, ""Happy"" is one of Sandler's angry roles, where the physical comedy reigns supreme. Not his best gig, but amusing enough. The scene where he is learning to putt and takes his frustration out on a mini-golf robotic clown head pretty much sums it all up.<br/><br/>There are a few humorous nuggets from this film that have a high place in the list of top Adam Sandler comedy lines/moments, like the fight with Bob Barker accompanied by the timeless ""the price is wrong, bitch."" Other than those few great lines and funny scenes, there isn't a whole lot to love about ""Happy Gilmore,"" but it acknowledges that and doesn't waste your time at just 90 minutes long."

","Adam Sandler is rapidly becoming my favourite on-screen comedian. He has this knack of doing incredibly stupid films that nevertheless manage to put a big stupid grin on my face for the whole show. This one has all the Sandler trademarks: a daft plot, a pervading sense of (mostly) innocent fun, incredibly funny supporting cast, plenty of cameos, cartoon-like laws of physics, references to his other films (or is that vice-versa in this case?). His characters tend to start out unlikeable (such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison), but the viewer ends up rooting for them anyway as the film progresses and the character's good side is revealed. There is usually a positive, inclusive feeling to the comedy style: just about all the characters in the film (even the sleaze-bags) are treated well by Sandler's character (once he gets over his temper tantrums in this case), which puts these films head and shoulders above the derisive, divisive style of humour that seems so common elsewhere these days. Sandler's characters tend to only make headway when they are being good, which isn't a bad message for the kids in the audience. Yet there's nothing saccharine or Disney-esquire here. While some gags are a bit predictable, there are still plenty of surprises and some outright lunacy that keep it fresh. Even once you suds out what the Sandler formula is, the films are still enjoyable to watch. Sheer fun!"
"GOWBTW","8","3","5","17 February 2006"," Barker vs. Gilmore: That's what made it great!
","This is one Adam Sandler movie that'll go down in the history books. He plays a ex-hockey player whose slap shot makes him a golf pro. I mean he's no Tiger Woods, but with a few lessons he'll be good. Happy Gilmore(Adam Sandler) would be playing pro-hockey, since he couldn't skate, his swing was the strong point of it all. I mean, if a person could swing, doesn't make him useless. Since Gilmore's skating handicapped him from the dream sport, golf club shaped like a hockey stick keeps him from being disillusioned. Chubbs Peterson(Carl Weathers, ""Action Jackson"", ""Predator"", and The ""Rocky"" Movies) is Happy's mentor. A football player-turned actor lost his hand to an alligator. Happy did get his revenge on the alligator, but his payback claims Chubbs' life as well. Then my favorite scene of all time is ""The Price is Right"" host Bob Barker battling Gilmore in a brawl, which I think is outstanding, and hilarious as well. This movie is what Barker calls is his ""revenge"" since he took karate lessons from Chuck Norris. WHAT A PAYOFF! That's one game-show host I wouldn't p--- off! All the way, this movie rocks. See it for yourself. Being a ""Price is Right"" fan, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Rating 3 out of 5 stars."

","Happy Gilmore is one of my top ten favorite comedies and brings out what little humor their is in golf. It's the best golf comedy since Caddyshack (1980) and really puts you in the golfing spirit. <br/><br/>Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is the grandson of loving grandmother Gilmore (Frances Bay). He is in love with hockey but can't break into the roster of the local hockey team. After being cut he returns home to find his girlfriend leaving him. After a crazy night with a Japanese lady, Happy gets a call from his grandma saying that she is being evicted.<br/><br/>Happy doesn't know what to do so he takes her to the local nursing home run by a psycho orderly (Ben Stiler). Happy goes back to the house to make sure everything is going alright to find the movers playing golf. Happy tells them to go back to work but say that they're on break. Happy says that if he can hit a golf ball past the two guys than they go back to work.<br/><br/>Happy does more than that by hitting the ball 300+ yards and hitting two people at the end of the street. Happy, after meeting Chubbs (Carl Weathers), goes to the Waterbury open where he nearly kills his caddy because he thinks he's getting robbed. After winning he is on the pro tour and ready to get his grandma's house back.<br/><br/>Along the way, Happy must deal with pro Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), Bob Barker (Himself), and hostile fans who he ends up beating the hell out of. Happy is kind at heart but has problems with anger when frustrated or unhappy. One of the funniest scenes involves Bob Barker saying he should be working at the snack bar and Happy head butts him.<br/><br/>The story is just plain old fish out of water story with some unforgettable laughs. Happy's official caddy is the best part as a hobo bathing in the 8th holes pond or washing his underwear in the ball washer.<br/><br/>This film is funny, it's attractive, and it really brought Sandler into acting. The golf scenes are pretty well filmed and accurate with real golf. Chris McDonald is sinister as the hostile pro competing for the Gold Jacket and Richard Kiel is hilarious in his cameo as Happy's ex-boss turned loving fan.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore.

Sorry to The Wedding Singer fanboys. Yes that is a funny movie, but it has some sad parts in it. Just like 50 First Dates, The Wedding Singer is more of a romance movie than a comedy.<br/><br/>Saying The Wedding Singer is Sandler's best comedy would be like saying Punch Drunk Love is his best comedy. Both are great movies, but they're certainly not Sandler's best comedies.<br/><br/>Back in the day, my favorite Sandler movie was The Waterboy... of course I was 15 years old when it came out.... but now that I'm a grown man I cant stand to watch The Waterboy. Yes, that movie has funny parts in it, but it just did not age well at all. I would rather watch Going Overboard than watch the Waterboy.

","1996's Happy Gilmore is often regarded as one of Adam Sandler's best comedy, a film with a solid fanbase. It is deserving of that status, being more tolerable then his later offerings.<br/><br/>Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, a Bostonian man who aspiring ice hockey player who has no skating abilities and anger management problems, but has a killer slap shot. When his grandmother's home is repossess by the IRS Happy turns his talents to golf and quickly becomes a sensation. But his angry persona and blue collar roots results in Happy making enemies on the Pro Golf Tour.<br/><br/>Despite the praise Happy Gilmore received it is a standard Sandler film, having moments of violent slapstick and angry outbursts, a mega-douchy villain, a love interest and having some sort of family element. Fortunately Sandler's more crass and overly sentimental material is not evident like it is his later films, nor is its message as harass like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Happy Gilmore's problem is simply the humour is not funny or consistent enough. There is no dept the humour on offer or the slapstick lacks invention. The best moment is when Happy has a fight with Bob Barker but it is really a joke for an American audience. The most noticeable thing about the film's direction is its exaggerated sound effects when Happy hits a golf ball or when someone gets hit.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore has a standard sports movie storyline which in the perfectly acceptable for a comedy; it gets the job done even its story is predictable. At least there was some variation because of the family story, Happy's attempts to romance the tour's head of PR and the clash of culture between Happy's unfiltered personal style compared to the refined, upper class world of professional golf. Happy is responsible for a working-class, beer drinking audience coming to watch golf, wanting a show and outbursts, shaking up the natural order of the golfing world.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore was made before the worst excesses of Sandler's career, but his shtick was hardly great to begin with. There are many better comedies of this style out there."

","Happy Gilmore begins with some amusing character background and plot setup before moving into the storyline. Once Happy joins the PGA, things get funny fast as he brings silliness and antics to the golf course much to the ire of the other professional golfers. Of course, Happy learns some life lessons along the way, and teaches others a few, keeping the story light through the Happily Ever After ending.<br/><br/>Acting was pretty good with Sandler delivering his usual. McDonald was also in character as Happy's nemesis and did nicely. Bowen played nicely with everyone else and Bay was amusing as always. The remainder of the supporting cast was solid and entertaining.<br/><br/>Camera work, sets, and backgrounds were good and consistent with a high budgeted film. Physical effects were of the slapstick variety, as is normal for a Sandler flick, and good. Dialogue was campy and silly yet kept the movie entertaining. Sound and soundtrack were both well done.<br/><br/>Overall Happy Gilmore is an entertaining comedy that moves long nicely with plenty of laughs. Those wanting intellectual stimulation will be a bit disappointed while those just wanting some good laughs will likely enjoy the film quite a bit."

After all those years I can still clearly recall every one of my favorite scenes. It's pure ridiculous crap but it was surprising, different, and hilarious to my adolescent male mind.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is nothingness, a weakly contrived excuse to string together a sequence of events comprising a movie. The script is pure idiocy really, but it is an absurdly satirical idiocy, and absurdity can be really hilarious if it's done right.<br/><br/>Really, it's like a stand up comedy routine presented as a narrative, it's all about Adam Sandler getting laughs as a true comedian, not a wannabe actor."

Not knowing golf made the movie better for me.<br/><br/>Watching (and hearing) the soaring golf balls made me laugh every time. It reminded me of Herman Munster hitting the baseball and beaning Leo Durocher 4 blocks away. The first time I ever saw Herman do that, I was rolling on the floor for several minutes. This movie reminded me of that and I was once again on the floor when Adam Sandler did it with the golf ball. By the way, Herman had me on the floor again when he kicked a football several miles away.<br/><br/>I just saw that the movie will be on TV next week (I think TNT or TBS). I truly hope that they do not cut out too much.<br/><br/>This was a very pleasant movie and I suggest you watch it with a youngster -- say a 12 year old. They will love it!"

","When I first saw a movie with Adam Sandler I thought he was funny. The first movie I have ever seen with Adam Sandler in it was Waterboy. When I watched Happy Gilmore I thought it was better than any other of the movies I have seen. He acts so stupid in that movie. He is a golfer and yet he is really good in golf. I hate golf and I loved this movie. Not only do I like Adam Sandler, but i also like Christopher McDonald. In this movie he played Shooter McGavin and did a really good job. My favorite part of the movie i thought was when Shooter McGavin had to hit the ball off of Frankenstein's foot. It was funny. I thought it was unfair that Happy Gilmore had to hit the ball through that tower that fell over the hole. But he hit it in the hole and made it. He was awesome. If you haven't seen this movie yet you really need to see it. You might like it."

","Billy Madison is a hair funnier than this movie, but Happy Gilmore is a bit more entertaining than Billy Madison. It's very funny, and entertaining. I give Happy Gilmore *** out of ****"
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","3","17 April 2002"," Adam Sandler has never been a real favorite of the critics, but Happy Gilmore is undeniably one of his most successfully hilarious comedies.
","In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>
There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here, as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green, and for the most part, this comedy scheme works pretty well here. Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression, clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. Indeed, some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go (`PIECE!! OF!! MONKEY *beep*!!'). <br/><br/>So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things, but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face. Luckily for the movie and for its fans, this is not the most important element of a movie like this. It's not very likely that a slob like Happy, who doesn't make the hockey team, is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right, and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back. You would think that, having seen that he can make that much money, he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house. A noble cause, obviously, but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent. But who cares? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections. <br/><br/>Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary, and there is clearly some overdone product placement, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film. Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film (although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2, when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing), and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified (although just barely) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts (or lack thereof) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing. As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments, Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are. They want fame and recognition, he wants money and beer (and Virginia, the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film).<br/><br/>
There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that, as much as I personally enjoy the movie, simply fall flat (many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie, or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament, or anything involving Chubbs' prosthetic hand) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to. Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character, despite all of his destructive habits, and the film is peppered with other notable performances, not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs, the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore, and Christopher MacDonald, in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin. <br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler, which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here, so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected. Sandler does not make award-winning films, and chances are he never will, but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable. It is, to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up, a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema. It's a lot of fun, but there's no nutritional value."

","Recipe for a prime Adam Sandler comedy: dream up a ridiculous, one-note concept, plaster it with silly side gags, stretch the whole thing to fill ninety minutes and... somehow succeed in spite of yourself. There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing.<br/><br/>Sandler in the mid-90s was a roiling ocean of slapstick brilliance, totally superficial and meaningless but all the more endearing for it. Here, of course, he's the brainless hockey player turned golf pro, capable of driving the green on a par five but allergic to any semblance of a short game. It's a role catered to his strengths - quick temper tantrums, wacky fight scenes, childish infatuations - and he still plays them well. All the fleeting extraneous bits land, too, from Carl Weathers's absurdly long false hand to Lee Trevino's frequent, often wordless, cameos to Christopher McDonald's delicious overacting as the stuck-up front runner, Shooter McGavin.<br/><br/>It doesn't look great (actually, the budget must've been pretty tight) but that's hardly the point. This one remains a simple dose of energetic fun, twenty-odd years later."

That coupled with the fact that the film gives us one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Golf antagonist of all time, Shooter McGavin. The polarizing attitudes of the two really sell this and make it a fun movie.<br/><br/>For me, the only downfall of this movie is that we are supposed to believe that all it takes to be a golf pro is the ability to hit the ball really hard...I know, I know, that's what makes the movie comedic, but you can still have a comedy that exists in the real world (it's my opinion).<br/><br/>A fantastic film and it's Sandler at absolute best will definitely watch again."

","Did you know that Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert's partner, walked out of this movie? Ebert stayed, but wrote in his review:<br/><br/>""Happy Gilmore"" tells the story of a violent sociopath. Since it's about golf, that makes it a comedy.""<br/><br/>He also complained that it was more of a product placement for Subway sandwiches than a golfing movie.<br/><br/>It's kind of ironic,in this case, that it has a 7/10 on IMDB and may arguably be known as Adam Sandler's best work. While I prefer Billy Madison, I agree that this IS when of his finest works.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is about that person, who has a huge passion for hockey. He plays, but he does not really have good skills. But he does have good skills with golf, and when he learns he can golf to save his Grandmother's house, he goes on a golfing tour against a pro golfer. The problem is his temper gets in the way.<br/><br/>Any one who has seen an Adam Sandler movie can know what to expect: Stupid humor is the main thing.

Example:<br/><br/>""I eat pieces of (crap) like you for breakfast.""<br/><br/>""You eat pieces of (crap) for breakfast?""<br/><br/>""Ummm...NO!""<br/><br/>There is also pretty strong language too. Happy throws a fit on TV, and he is bleeped numerous times(I once counted and got 62 bleeps.) Sometimes I am shocked that this got a PG-13 and not a ""tame"" R(think Planes Trains and Automobiles.)<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is not one of the greatest movies ever but it could be considered one of the greatest comedies.

I know a lot of people think his comedy is strange, or too dry, but I get it. The same goes for any comedian. It's in the small nuances of Mr. Sandler's delivery, and his facial reactions that crack me up. The way he can deliver a put-down, or insult is priceless. He's always at his best when he's playing himself, instead of a forced scripted character, and also when he has the same crazy friends in his movies. This is one of the rare movies, like ""Star Wars"" that I can watch over and over again. Great job!"
"tommywiller","10","1","1","21 February 2017"," 'Happy Gilmore' Hilarious and Heartwarming
","Dennis Dugan, the director of 'Happy Gilmore,' did a remarkable job of making a comedic movie into a movie that you could truly relate to the characters and the story lines. Dennis Dugan also the director of 'The Benchwarmers', and 'Don't Mess With the Zohan', consistently can make the viewer amused, but these movies serve no justice to the plot of 'Happy Gilmore'. After watching Dennis Dugan movies, you are often left clueless on the point of the movie. With 'Happy Gilmore' you leave with the laughs and grow close with the characters, and the stories behind each character.<br/><br/>In the move 'Happy Gilmore' there are multiple story lines that completely compel the audience. Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler), is the main character and deals with a tremendous amount of adversity throughout the movie. First and foremost, Happy's Grandmother, whom he loves dearly, loses her house. Happy's mission is to get the house back to his Grandmother. Secondly, Happy meets his crush Virginia (Julie Bowen). Happy does whatever it takes to win over her heart. Lastly, Happy needs to overcome the antics of his arch nemesis Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Along these seemingly reachable goals, Happy deals with an outrageous amount of setbacks to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat. Nothing is given to Happy, he needs to make everything happen himself through shear willingness, and devotion to the tasks he has at hand.<br/><br/>With these main story lines, Dennis Dugan hit the jackpot. How could you possibly go wrong with a man seeking to find the money to buy his Grandmother's house back? Also, no one can dislike a man going after the woman of his dreams. These story lines could've easily been thought of as 'boring,' or 'not original,' but Dugan dressed up the plot and the story lines into an adventure that has never been seen before.<br/><br/>Dugan's best decision was making Adam Sandler the main act. Adam Sandler as an actor always impresses me, and in this film he goes above and beyond. Sandler never has any trouble making people laugh in his films, but in 'Happy Gilmore' he's able to relate to the audience with his true feelings for the ones he cares about. I could sincerely feel the struggle that Sandler's character was going through to get the house back to his Grandma. Supporting actors such as Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Frances Bay, Ben Stiller, and Carl Weathers do a great job to make Happy's emotions come alive. 'Happy Gilmore' listed as comedy, family, and sports genres could truly also be listed as a romance, and an action film. This movie truly encapsulates and brings out the best of all genres. Each scene, line, emotion, and expression contributed to an unforgettable ending."

A kid gets hit with a baseball machine, and air conditioner drops on an old lady. There isn't much of anything I didn't like about the movie.

This is an absolutely no brain movie of course, with a plot as daft as it sounds - a failed/angry ice-hockey player takes up golf to earn money to save his granny's house from being repossessed - and of course he becomes a cause célèbre to the golfing curates.<br/><br/>Sandler has and always will be an acquired comedy taste, making this very much one for his fans only. And truth be told this is basic Sandler where he's shouty and sweary, and he certainly improved on a filmic level from this point on. So what you gonna do? I laughed a lot, but you see I'm a Sandler fan (though there are some films of his I positively hate), it cheered me up and sometimes that's all I want from one of his movies. 7/10"

","Ever since he was a young boy, Adam Sandler wanted to be a hockey player. His hot temper and uncontrollable rages fit the sport, but then he is taken off the team. When the IRS takes his grandmother's (actress Frances Bay) house for back taxes, he vows to make enough money to buy it back. Ultimately, he takes up golf to win the tournament money. But golfer and rival Christopher McDonald has something to say about that. (Christopher plays his role memorably and mercilessly well.) For some reason, I had been avoiding Adam Sandler movies like the plague, since most of his humor is usually childish, infantile, dumb, silly, etc. I must have seen something years ago to have come to this conclusion, But recently I decided to watch a few. After finding out that this movie and ""Billy Madison"" were his best, I saw them. I think most people would agree that the highlight of this film is Bob Barker and him duking it out on the golf course. But parts of this seemed too silly and/or dumb, like him trying constantly to shake Carl Weathers' wooden hand. My main criticism of this film is that most of its one-liners, jokes, or scenarios fall flat resulting in little to no reaction other than shock, which gets in the way of enjoying the film, along with his almost-hostile disposition due to his love of hockey. But he does agree to cool it down and act more professional. A lot of people would say to take ""Happy Gilmore"" for what it is, not to think about it too much and not take it so seriously and just enjoy yourself and let it come over you, the whole experience. A second viewing is needed for this experiment! Oh, boy!"
"colevasic","6","1","1","11 December 2015"," The Typical Comedy
","We all know what a comedy is and we can all predict the plot of the movie before even finishing it, wouldn't it be nice if we had a comedy where we didn't know what was going to happen? Or if the movie surprised us at the end? Happy Gilmore isn't an exception. Happy Gilmore is about this guy who is kind of struggling with living and his grandma gets kicked out of her house which really upsets him. During the process of moving his grandma out he comes to find that he is really good at golf, but not in the normal way he isn't necessarily, ""professional"" he just runs and hits the ball and it just soars through the air. This guys name is Happy Gilmore, Happy ends up going to the big tournament where he must face off with the best golfers in the world, here he faces many challenges and has to learn to be a better golfer to win the tournament and use that money to buy back his mothers home. This movie is just like any other cliché movie that the main person overcomes the challenge, or the hero wins the war, etc. <br/><br/>The biggest struggle Happy has to overcome in this film is his biggest competition, a guy named Shooter McGavin who is a real professional golfer who has been doing it a whole lot longer than Gilmore. Happy Gilmore isn't completely taken by surprise with golf because he has been playing hockey is whole life which basically involves the same swing technique and everything that golfing does. But Happy realizes that he won't ever have the chance to win the tournament unless he seeks help from someone who knows what exactly they are doing. The person that Gilmore goes to and seeks out is a guy he knows as Chubbs, who has a fake arm because it got bitten off during a golf tournament by an alligator. This movie is definitely one of those, ""dirty secret comedies"" where the humor is just kind of dumb comedy but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it definitely is a funny movie! This movie is attracted for its simplistic representation and I would concur, because you already know what basically is going to happen before the movie even ends. The main part of this movie is that Happy has to beat Shooter McGavin in a tournament in order to pay for his Grandmas house so she doesn't have to move out. Whenever there is a plot like this in a movie, you know that the main character or hero is going to come through with the challenge and everyone is going to live happily-ever-after.<br/><br/>The tournament starts out fair and they keep playing through it, eventually everyone is eliminated except the two that face off in the end. It comes down to the last hole and Shooter swings an impressive hit that puts him ahead a little bit, as long as Happy doesn't get it in in less amount of hits. Unfortunately, an accident happens with a bystander and a big tower falls down blocking the course, Happy wants people to move it and go again when its clear, but Shooter says the rules say that once you start a hole you have to finish it. Gilmore takes this and has a flashback to when he went mini-golfing with Chubbs and how he had taught him to be the ball and to just relax and take a breath. Gilmore does just that and he ends up using the fallen over tower to his advantage to hit the ball like you would hit it if you were playing mini-golf, the ball bounces all over the place and eventually finds its way into the hole. This scene is very dramatic as you can imagine and when it goes in everyone goes crazy and starts cheering and celebrating. Gilmore gets a prize jacket and a trophy, but more importantly he gets money that he later uses to save his grandmas house.<br/><br/>This is why I am not super impressed with this movie; it is funny but very predictable. But to come from the other side, it is just a comedy, ""a dumb comedy"" more specifically so it doesn't necessarily need to have some super in depth plot or some big surprise that happens. That's the whole point of this movie, it's just like a dumb comedy that makes you laugh even though it might seem un-intelligent or looked down upon. Even thought this movie might have a normal plot and is nothing special, it is still a good movie and it definitely made us laugh. <br/><br/>I think the characters were chosen very wisely, the actual actors that played the characters and the actual characters themselves. They really complement each other and they build on each other, the main character wouldn't be the main character without his supporting characters and those characters really did help Adam Sandler in this case. For example, when Gilmore goes to the mini-golf course with Chubbs (Carl Weathers) they really improve Gilmores skills and help him basically win the tournament in the end and this is a key point in the movie. I think the casting director really hit it on the head. <br/><br/>In conclusion I would say that to criticize this movie for having a cliché plot would be unfair and if that is the only thing I got out of this movie that would be a lie. Because this movie is a first of its time it is a classic. This movie is a knee slapper and I would say a classic, lots of people know what this movie is and have probably seen it. In the end this is still a very funny movie and I would recommend to anyone."

With the exception of Joe Flaherty, every character is well cast. There are many laugh out loud scenes. I think the scene I laughed the most at was when happy was playing in his first tournament and there was a guy that kept saying ""pathetic"" and then Happy beats him up. I watch this movie every time it is on because of how it just makes me happy. I fast forward over Joe Flaherty every time I watch this. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor."

","Everyone Needs to Laugh In the movie Happy Gilmore, the director Dennis Dugan portrayed the typical golfer as being a very calm, cool and collected individual. Then within a few minutes, the golfer was swearing up a storm and wishing golf had never been created. Dennis made sure his viewers felt different emotions throughout the movie: at one instance you're laughing, then you're angry, sympathetic, sad or even empathetic. Happy Gilmore is a must see movie, because of its excellent plot development, acting and cinematography. The movie starts out as Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) getting cut from the Boston Bruins. From there, his grandma (Frances Bay) begins to lose her house because she wasn't paying her taxes. As the movers are moving furniture out of the house they find some old golf clubs and decide to hit some balls. Well Happy tells them ""it's easy to hit a golf ball"" so the movers bet him that he can't even drive the ball 100 yards. Happy lines up and drives it 400 yards down the street. From there he's told to try out for the tour, but he's reluctant to do it until he realizes he can win a lot of money playing golf and pay for his grandma's house. Happy picks up the sport and begins winning until he runs into Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) who's out to destroy him because Happy isn't ""right"" for the game of golf. Shooter and Happy eventually battle it out for grandma's house at the tour championship. One of the main reasons Happy Gilmore is a classic is because of its exceptional plot development. Every scene from the movie seems to flow with each other and there is no scene in the movie that doesn't play an important role in the movie. For example, before the tour championship begins, all the players have dinner together at the clubhouse, then the very next scene is the players playing at the tournament. Viewers never have to ask themselves, ""Why is that scene in there?"" Or ""What does it have to do with the movie?"" In addition, the plot is consistent throughout the whole movie; Happy is playing the game of golf to get his grandmother's house back and that's it, there's no side plot. The second reason Happy Gilmore is one of the best movies ever made, is because of the acting. For example, Christopher McDonald, while on and off the course is always walking around arrogantly; his shoulders tucked back, chest out and his smooth strides as he walks. Christopher is showing the viewers that he is the best on the course at any given time; almost like he's God. In addition, when Christopher is talking to somebody, he often has a tone in his voice; like that of a person thinking, ""Did you just say that to me?"" This really entices the viewer because the viewer feels some type of emotion toward Christopher. The most important reason Happy Gilmore is a must see movie is because of its excellent cinematography work. For example, when Happy lines up to make a big putt, the cameraman puts the camera low and looks up at Happy to show how crucial the putt is. Also, towards the end of the movie, Dennis plays some slow; suspenseful music when Happy needs to make a putt to beat Shooter McGavin. Making the viewer feel like there heart was going to beat out of there chest if he didn't hit that putt. If I was any person looking to watch a comedy or a movie based on golf that has a feel good story at the end, then I would highly recommend seeing Happy Gilmore. I would give Happy Gilmore a rating of 4 out of 5 stars because of the pure comedic value that Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald bring to the movie. I would argue that Happy Gilmore, wasn't just funny, but it helped jump start Adam Sandler's career, because think of all the movies he made after Happy Gilmore."

","Adam Sandler, before he was infamous for making some of the worst movies of all time! This is one of the Sandler movies that people add as an exception after insulting Adam Sandler's film career. I mean, it is really funny! It's unlike most of Sandler's other movies because of how hilarious it was, and Sandler was actually pretty good in the role, as, pretty much, a sociopath who plays golf!<br/><br/>Although it is very funny, the movie is predictable, and it is really a by-the-numbers 90s comedy. It has the bully character, the unneeded romance, an old lady ""sidekick"", etc. I mean, if you just gave me a detailed synopsis of the plot, without any major spoilers, I would probably be able to tell you exactly what happens in the movie, plot wise, but that doesn't make it bad, because it's funny, and, in a comedy, that is all that really matters."

","Happy Gilmore (1996): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Carl Weathers, Christopher McDonald, Bob Barker: Not nearly as funny as Caddyshack, which worked due to its views of golf stereotypes. A name like Happy Gilmore indicates that he was the apple of his grandmother's eye but it never sustained his inner torment. He plays bad hockey but when his grandmother is forced into a nursing home by the I.R.S he promises to win her home back but he does so through golf. Carl Weathers coaches him then he feuds with champion Shooter McGaven. The idea of one's talent translating to unfamiliar places works as a plot but much of this is repetitious, predictable and stupid. Directed by Dennis Dugan who brought the world Problem Child. There are moments of visual flare but much of the humour is obnoxious. Nonetheless some viewers may relate to Adam Sandler as Gilmore whose willingness to help his grandmother is met with the struggle to maintain one's temper. Julie Bowen is basically a romantic prop to be won over. Christopher McDonald as Shooter is the high class antagonist. Weathers holds strong as a coach with a wooden hand due too an attack by an alligator. Bob Barker appears long enough to have a golf confrontation with Happy and beat the snot out of him. This is certainly no Caddyshack but it would be a great candidate for several cracks with a golf club. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","I don't know why this movie got bad reviews. Granted, some of Adam Sandler's movies aren't great, I'm looking at Jack And Jill, but some are fabulous, like 50 First Dates and then some are really good like this, Big Daddy, Click and Just Go With It. I really like this movie and I think it's a lighthearted comedy a lot of people would like.<br/><br/>This movie is about a hockey player wannabe. He discovers that he has the most powerful golf drive in history, and decides to join the P.G.A. tour to make money, so he can save his Grandmother's house. Adorable. The downside is, his mentality is of a hockey player, not a golf player.

","Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is desperate to be a professional hockey player but he's horrible at skating and can't handle the puck. He does however have great intensity and the hardest shot. His grandma (Frances Bay) hasn't paid her taxes and they're confiscating her stuff including her house. He discovers that he can really hit the golf balls and starts hustling golf. Golf pro Chubbs (Carl Weathers) takes him under his wing to join the PGA tour. Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) is the arrogant star golfer. Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) is public relations for the tour.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is still funny at this point. There is something endearing about a young idiot who still has lots to learn. The compelling part is that his character grows. He's an angry dude and a hilarious one. His character is one that the audience can root for while at the same time laugh at. Sure it's stupid but that's the fun part."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","11 October 2014"," He's in the wrong movie . . .
","Sometimes during bad movies I daydream about what it would be like to transport certain movie characters to other movies and see how they would fit. 'Happy Gilmore' is a movie that I would like to see in a whole different genre. It stars Adam Sandler as a hockey player with a volatile hair-trigger temper. This is a comedy but I was wondering what it would be like to see how a director like Mike Figgis or Tim Robbins might present him in a drama. In a drama he might fit but in a comedy Happy Gilmore is a very depressing character to watch.<br/><br/>Happy has a talent for being able to slap the puck with great power but he has two left feet when he gets on the ice. He doesn't make the team, which doesn't make him happy (he slugs the coach). Happy's grandmother has been evicted from her home by the IRS, leaving him to seek another source of income.<br/><br/>One day he discovers quite by accident that he can hit a golf ball for great distances and because golf doesn't require skating, he's perfect for the game. This leads to a rather depressing fish out of water story in which Sandler's violent temper invades the solemn game of golf beating up anything and everything that makes him mad. The much celebrated brawl between Sandler and 'Price is Right' host Bob Barker didn't work for me, maybe I just didn't get the joke.<br/><br/>The movie isn't that hard to predict. We know that Sandler will prevail and win the tournament and the girl's heart but he is so hateful and violent that it's hard to root for him even in a movie this predictable. As I say, I tried to imagine a dramatic Happy Gilmore and how his temper would lead him down a path of self-destruction. Instead he is stuck in a crowd-pleasing comedy and it's the movie that self-destructs."
"robbybarr","Null","1","1","1 October 2014"," Happy Gilmore
","A statement made in the spectacular comedy Happy Gilmore is harder to accomplish than originally thought by the main character. ""Just let me put the ball in the hole"" (Happy Gilmore). Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore; he is a hockey player turn professional golfer in a matter of days. Gilmore is forced to find a way to make a lot money to save his grandmother's house. His Grandmother is his only known living relative. In the movie, Happy discovers that he can hit a golf ball more than four hundred and fifty yards, which if farther than anyone has ever seen. However, the golf course Happy brings unsportsman like conduct and rowdy fans to the sport of golf. His loud fans and his own outrageous out bursts make for a great comedic movie, making Happy Gilmore a must see for comedy fans.<br/><br/>One of the areas the movie shows a comedic tone is with Happy's outrageous outbursts. In a hockey game, it is not uncommon for players to slam each other around, or even throw a few punches. However, in golf a player must hold their anger and frustration inside and act gentlemanly. The best way to explain how Happy acts is: ""a man who's persistently angry, both lashing out at and fueling his rage towards his physical outlets"" (What Would I Do Differently). Happy is seen in the movie breaking objects, punching the other golfers, swearing at the ball, and celebrating his good shots with ridiculous dances. On several occasions he punches people for mocking him or making fun of him. Other comedic parts come from when he yells at the golf ball for not going in the hole. The people in the crowd are stunned that a man would have the audacity to say such terrible things on the golf course. The president of the golf association meets with the head of personal affairs asking for Gilmore to be kicked off the tour. The head of personal affairs will not allow this because Happy is bringing in many more new fans to the sport of golf. Happy is allowed to stay, but only if he remains able to control himself. He is able to maintain his new gentler attitude for a bit, but finally after one of the fans is especially rude towards him, and his playing partner makes an insulting remark, he cracks and gets into a fight with none other than Bob Barker, his partner in the match. His actions get Happy suspended for one month, but the new fans love the fighting and hockey-like atmosphere so they continue to show up to golf tournaments. Many of the new fans now see golf as hockey, a sport that can be tailgated and celebrated, all due to Happy Gilmore's wild antics. Hockey is known for hard hitting and fights on the ice. Golf on the other hand is thought to be more of as a gentleman's sport; there is etiquette to how one must behave while others play. ""Players should always show consideration for other players on the course and should not disturb their play by moving, talking or making any unnecessary noise"" (USGA). When at a tournament and a player is hitting the ball the spectators are expected to be silent and considerate. In the movie Happy's fans either do not know this piece of important information, or simply just do not care. They are all loud and bring noisemakers to the course and play them as though they were at a hockey game. Being loud and obnoxious is disruptive to all the veteran players who are not used to such shenanigans. The fans bring beach balls they bounce around during the game, again something one does not see at a golf event. Although all the fans are ridiculous it makes for a great comedy. It shows a different side of golf that is never seen. The movie shows how golf would be different if people treated the sport like hockey or football, where tailgating and being obnoxious is allowed. The sport of golf would be much different if people were allowed to act the way Gilmore's fans did on the golf course. The reason this movie is a must see for comedy goers is because the movie shows the differences between two widely different sports. The way Happy acts is different from the way a golfer is suppose to act, and this contrast makes the movie hilarious."

The kid getting hit with the baseball is also very amusing and Sandler's antics keep the film moving at a steady pace. The real noticeable good acting performance comes from Christopher McDonald the movie would not have worked without him. He supplies both the bad guy role and the darker comedy role to make it plausible for the audience. Probably the best role he ever has done and he is funny just as funny as Sandler.

"paul_mampilly","7","1","1","6 January 2005"," ""Till The Night Closes In.........."". Sandler at his best.
","Golf, who would ever thought it would be funny at all. It is very easy to imagine what was going through the minds of Hollywood studio executives when someone said they have got an idea of a comedy which mainly involves golf. It is a narrow genre, however the last time such a movie has been made was Caddyshack. However since I have not seen it, Happy Gilmore is still going to be one of my favorite golf comedy movies.<br/><br/>PLOT SPOILERS The plot is really simple. This rubbish wanna be ice hockey player has this phenonomenal talent for whacking a golf ball for more than 500 yards. He decides to take up golf, only for the fact that he needs to get money to pay off his grandmother's debts and get her house back. He sets the golfing world alight and is seen as a new and unconventional hero of the green. His temperament and his amazing drives brings in rowdy crowds, which does bring the game to disrepute but the ratings seems to hitting the roof all the time. Everyone seem to like him apart from the current golf champion, Shooter McGavin, who seems to be jealous from this newcomers popularity. So Shooter decides to get Happy to play him for the championships.<br/><br/>This has to be Adam Sandler's best movie that he made. I thought that the Wedding Singer was his best, but that has to be given to this movie. He is so funny as Happy Gilmore, and I would have to say that the greatest scene, is when he starts singing Exile's song. It always cracks me up all the time I see that. The rest of the actors were OK, but to be honest this was Sandler's film. However, I would have to say Ben Stiller's cameo deserves another viewing, as he acted as the sadistic nursing home co worker. Julie Bowen does a moderate job as the love interest, and strangely enough looks like my old biology teacher, which is seriously weird but alluring nonetheless.<br/><br/>Anyway I absolutely love this movie, and I have to say that I am a convert to Adam Sandler. However this does not mean that I just only like really stupid movies, but he is a great comic."
"Travis_Bateman","7","1","1","19 July 2004"," As a non-Sandler fan, I liked this one!
","I'm certainly not a big Sandler fan, as all his comedies seem too alike...except this one. Happy Gilmore. Basic story. Happy's grandmother is booted from her home, which Happy's grandfather built by hand or something. Happy stumbles upon a great golf swing of his, no doubt due to the fact that he is also a hockey player. So Happy works his way up the circuit and makes money, friends, and enemies along the way in his mission to get the house back, and you can imagine the square peg in a round hole scenario you get from having a hockey player in the golf world. Now unlike the typical Sandler comedy, the supporting cast is just too good to make this typical. Christopher McDonald is hilarious as the arrogant veteran golfer, Shooter McGavin, as he steals nearly every scene he's in. Carl Weathers is good as Chubbs Peterson, the golf pro with a wooden hand anxious to train Happy. Also look for Bob Barker's cameo, Ben Stiller's sleazy character, and even Richard Kiel - who played Jaws in the James Bond movies.<br/><br/>Surprisingly there's never really an unentertaining moment and all the jokes and gags seem to hit more often than miss. Check this out, even if you don't care for Sandler's other movies, you may like it. I give this a 7 or 8."
"sthapns247","10","1","1","8 February 2004"," Possibly the Funniest Movie Ever
","Now I'm not one to throw around the ""____est Movie Ever,"" but I'm not afraid to use it here.  I don't judge movies on one large spectrum, like many people; I judge them according to what they are supposed to do.  A war movie should appeal to my emotion on human life; acting is not necessary.  A drama should have good acting and a story that matters and is conveyed well. (Hardest to pull off.)  A comedy is just for entertainment.  The acting can be hit or miss, the story should only exist to make funny stuff happen, and it should get funnier every time you see it.  ""Happy Gilmore"" is like the word ""wiener"" in the sense that no matter how many times I'm exposed to it is still makes me smile, giggle, chuckle, or roll over crying.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has a unique comic style.  It is like a combination of Chris Farley and David Spade, two of the cast members he grew up with on Saturday Night Live.  He can be the straight faced, sarcastic person Spade usually is, but he can also do excellent physical comedy and has an enormous amount of energy much like Farley.  All this comes together in this movie to make the lead character funny just thinking about him.  A hockey player playing golf that glides through life and flips out every once in a while... We've all wanted to be Happy once in our lives. (Whether the name or the adjective applies to you is irrelevant.)<br/><br/>The story is there only to make the funny happen.  Gilmore is a failed hockey player and those scenes are awesome.  He then meets an ex-golfer with one hand... Wonder why he's an EX-golfer?  This is played into the whole ""Old, seasoned pro teaches the upstart, reluctant newbie to defeat the bad guy and everyone lives happily ever after.""  But the story is not really important because it's a comedy and it's funny.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very good in this movie.  There are so many little things that are said that you have to watch it over and over to catch it all. There are so many one-liners and classic scenes... This is by the number one movie I quote with my friends.<br/><br/>Comeos are also important in a comedy movie and this one has the greatest cameo of all time... Bob Barker.  When you see the movie you'll see what I mean.  This also plays into the irony that has to be in a comedy movie, but needs to by styled in a way that you can't see it coming and when it happens you let out a fast, unbelieving laugh and then forget about it... It's how these movies work.<br/><br/>All this comes together to make a movie that gets better the more and more you watch it.  The movie exists to amuse and it does this better than any other movie in history.  Some people may say that this movie is not the ""Greatest Comedy Movie"" because it's stupid and senseless... I just look at them and laugh because they don't know what comedy is. (See that was irony.)<br/><br/>There is no reason for you not to like this movie unless you look at it the same way you look at ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Saving Private Ryan..."" Don't, its not a drama or a war movie, it's a comedy movie... The best comedy movie ever for that matter.<br/><br/>NOTE: Watch the VHS or DVD because it is terribly censored when it is shown on TV and it really detracts from the over all mood of the movie."

"Rob_Taylor","7","1","1","1 October 2003"," Harmless fun and entertaining.
","I must admit, I sat down to watch this movie expecting to see the Sandler trademark character who has mental/emotional problems. Whilst this is true to the extent that Happy Gilmore has chronic anger management issues, it falls short of the usual ""character who has no grasp of the real world"" which so often has predominated in Sandler films. Instead, Happy is savvy enough to know when he's being mocked and more than Happy (no pun intended) to beat the crap out of anyone who does so.<br/><br/>The story is entirely predictable. However, you don't mind this, as with such films, the fun and entertainment comes not from being uncertain what is going to happen next, but rather from the anticipation of what you know will happen in due course.<br/><br/>All the cast give great comic performances, though I felt more use could have been made of Sandler's homeless caddy. For the most part he just stands around. Likewise, Ben Stiller's minor role of the evil nursing home attendant ended rather abruptly. I was expecting a showdown between Stiller and Sandler over the former's treatment of Sandler's grandmother, but it never happened. I suspect this was a cut-scene, as I can't imagine the two of them not seeing the great potential in such a confrontation.<br/><br/>The only really negative thing I can say about this movie (and it is really a generic failing of Hollywood that I've noticed in several movies lately) is the reliance on audience knowledge of cameo characters in order to get laughs. Just who is Bob Barker? I have no idea and I suspect a lot of the non-American audience will have no idea either. To me the whole fight scene on the golf course between Sandler and Barker was nowhere near as funny as I imagine it would be if I had any inkling of who he (Barker) was.<br/><br/>But overall the film delivers plenty of gentle humour and the occasional guffaw. Well worth a look, even if you've been turned off by Sandler's characters in the past. For me, Sandler has taken a turn (albeit a modest one) in the right direction with his characters here."

","It puzzles me that this movie stays funny over time, while the other Sandler films fall flat.  It's on a par with Caddyshack and Animal House, two other good SNL alumni films, and shares with them a similar array of short crude skits. Part of the success comes from the cameos, displayed rapid-fire. Richard Keil reprising his role from Silver Streak (this time shot with a nailgun instead of a harpoon)....Bob Barker sending up his TV persona...Carl Weathers reading a golf magazine, muttering ""that's good, it's all in the hips""....Joe Flaherty's insistence on eating at chain food restaurants...Ben Stiller's conniving nursing home orderly.  And then there is the guiding philosophy of the film....who but a golfer would ever WANT to wear a green jacket and plaid pants?  Behond all the money and image, golf is a sport for crazy people, and Happy spoofs it well."

That's because this movie is just plain funny.  Adam Sandler plays what he plays best, a guy whom seems like a jerk, but ends up being really sweet.  Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, a low-luck hockey player with no skill, but an incredible slapshot.  His parents are both dead and the person he goes to for advice or comfort is his grandma.  She, however, hasn't paid her taxes in years, and gets her house repossessed by the bank.  Happy stumbles on golfing, and finds that he has an extraordinary talent for driving the ball incredibly far.  To get money, he joins the PGA tour.  His lead rival, Shooter McGavin, buys Happy's grandma's home to make him quit, but they drive a bargain.  If Happy can win the PGA tour, the house is his again.  The results are hilarious.  This movie is an Adam Sandler must-see, right up there with ""Billy Madison""."

Anyway, Sandler is a complete loser that tries to become a hockey player.  The movie opens with a Wonder Years type sequence, in which we see Happy's youth years.  Flash forward to a hockey try out in which he kicks the coach's @$$.  I don't know about other people, but I thought that was hilarious.  That and the scenes where the people get hit by his first shots and the kid trying to take a baseball. The actors go about their routines so well that I just can't help but laugh.  Happy's first victory wins him a spot on the pro tour, trying to get enough money to get back his grandmother's house from the IRS.  Along the way, he meets his foe, Shooter McGavin.  The attitude Shooter carries does make him very unlikable and really makes you proud to see his butt get kicked.

","Recently I screened Adam Sandler's THE WATERBOY, and quickly concluded that the movie is completely throwaway, a bland knockoff of Sandler's earlier debacle HAPPY GILMORE.  Yet, I see that the movie is setting box-office records, and the high school boys I work with are lauding it as some kind of comedic standard.  Am I missing something?<br/><br/>To investigate this possibility, I re-viewed Sandler's first hit, BILLY MADISON, and also HAPPY GILMORE, in which Sandler plays a bellicose dimwit who wants to become a professional hockey player but discovers his slapshot is more effective on the golf course.  With a brash temper and an extraordinary long drive of over 400 yards, Happy becomes the star of the current pro golf tour.  The premise of the movie (and its single joke) is that while Sandler behaves like a juvenile, precocious jerk, he shakes up the stuffy golf establishment and produces some desirable demographics for the television ratings.  Essentially, the sheer spectacle of his rantings is meant as a babbling apologia for nonsense.  This is what makes Gilmore the best representation of Sandler's on-screen persona, and so I'd like to briefly discuss HAPPY GILMORE in terms of its implicit cultural impact.<br/><br/>Gilmore joins the tour reluctantly, motivated by the IRS confiscation of his grandmother's house.  While she quietly waits at a nursing home, Happy brassily tries to claim enough prize money to buy her house back.  We're supposed to laugh at Happy's nonconformity, the way he curses out golf balls when they don't drop.  Yet when the movie eventually sentimentalizes Happy's rivalry with a pompous pro named Shooter McGavin, it becomes not anarchic iconography, but just another dumb, predictable sports movie-one that has disturbing cultural implications.<br/><br/>Sandler is the ingratiating performer from ""Saturday Night Live"" known for his beaming ignorance and babyish vocal inflections.  His entire act seems derogatory in a post-modern way, as if he's asking the audience why it wastes its time watching him.  Sandler doesn't act, he grins like a moron, yells a lot, and clobbers things.  Like Jim Carrey, he views a movie set as the most glorious playground ever.  Making a movie allows Sandler to revel in the fact that he can do anything he wants.  Unfortunately, what he wants to do is indulge his pathetic junior-high fantasies.  HAPPY GILMORE is an exercise in wish-fulfillment for Sandler's lewd and violent creepiness. Sandler wants to punch out hecklers and an alligator?  Write it into the script!  Sandler wants a scantily-clad girl on his arm?  Create a sexy dream sequence!<br/><br/>It's easy to berate and dismiss them for their infantile idiocy, but movies like HAPPY GILMORE and THE WATERBOY don't just tell dumb jokes-they take on a spirit of sophomoric iconoclasm that is insultingly oppressive.  Recent brainless travesties, like DUMB AND DUMBER, IN THE ARMY NOW, ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS, and Sandler's own BILLY MADISON, depict a fraudulent mythology of acceptable rage, impatience, and violence.  They are tediously bawdy and cartoonishly brutal.  Unlike Chris Farley's movies (which share some of their inanity), these ninnyfests make no attempt to appeal to an audience's good nature.  Instead, they gleefully wallow in their mean-spirited adolescence, relying on audiences that confuse crassness with craftiness.<br/><br/>These movies skewer intelligence, knowledge, and sincerity in the name of the crude common man.  Gilmore becomes the champion of everyone alienated by elitism: it is class warfare led by simpletons.  Their revolution consists of revenge; revenge through cruelty and humiliation.  Most dismaying is that these movies actually seem to believe in their implication that the sympathetic little man is always a moronic freak.  That's a harmful double lie:  First, intelligence (or lack thereof) is not a mark of social status. Second, there are no little men-people are all the same size.  There is tyranny in stupidity.<br/><br/>The best moment in HAPPY GILMORE comes while Gilmore is participating in the Pepsi Pro-Am.  Paired with Bob Barker, an increasingly agitated Happy knocks the game-show legend flat on his back.  That's a typical gag in movies like this (abrupt violence as humor), but when Barker rises and proceeds to pummel Gilmore the joke is turned in on itself.  Suddenly we're witnessing Sandler's hateful malice backfiring on him, and the movie earns its sole laugh."

"MartinHafer","6","3","7","1 March 2009"," Formulaic and dumb....but worth seeing for one scene.
","HAPPY GILMORE is a very shallow and formulaic film. Despite some odd twists (such as a hockey player somehow making a great golfer), the overall plot structure is very, very familiar. In many ways, this film is like CADDYSHACK combined with the typical ""poor guy makes it big"" film--with few major surprises. So, when Gilmore ends up having his big golf game at the end of the film, don't look for anything particularly novel or surprising.<br/><br/>So far, it sure sounds like I am not big on this film and that would certainly be correct. However, part-way through the film, there is one of the singularly funniest scenes I can recall seeing in a film in recent memory. DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND MY SPOILING THIS FOR YOU!!! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!! During a celebrity golf tournament where celebrities are teamed with pro golfers, Happy is paired with Bob Barker. Repeatedly, Happy makes a nuisance of himself. It becomes so bad that the usually nice persona of Barker disappears and they have a UFC-style fight that is very funny. After all, seeing a very elderly Barker in a fight is funny--at least in a silly and unsophisticated way. And sometimes I could use this sort of laugh.<br/><br/>So, while the film is far from great, there is enough to see and enjoy that I mildly recommend it. Plus, for parents it's one of the few films that kids like that you can watch without feeling your brain cells rotting away--like it would if you were forced to watch LITTLE NICKY!"

","I am not a particular lover of Adam Sandler, but out of all his movies I would rate 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore as not only his two shining moments but two of the funniest and enjoyable films I have seen.<br/><br/>Sandler plays the title character, a deluded hockey player of limited intelligence and unlimited instability, who due to the repossession of his Grandmothers home, reluctantly takes up pro golf in order that he can win enough money to settle with the IRS and reclaim the house.<br/><br/>The only problem with this plan is that his golfing skills are on par with his abilities as a hockey player, which leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The only thing he has going for him is his talent for driving the ball over 400 yards using his hockey slap shot.<br/><br/>He turns to one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson played to comic perfection by Carl Weathers, to iron out his short game in order he does not lose his long driving advantage when he reaches the green.<br/><br/>He also takes on board the beautiful Virginia Venit the tournament's PR, who helps Happy control his almost psychotic temper and focus more on his game. I don't know about you, but with someone as gorgeous as Julie Bowen next to me, golf would be the very last thing on my mind! She must be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in the movies.<br/><br/>The film offers run of the mill Zero to Hero schmaltz and from the word 'Go' we are left with no uncertainty of how it will turn out, but his journey to the final championship, is a cleverly written comedy with strong performances from all involved most notably by Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's arrogant and devious opponent Shooter Mcgavin.<br/><br/>McGavin will stop at nothing to finally win his much coveted Gold Jacket and his interplay with Gilmore as he tries all sorts of ways to have him removed from the tournament is hilarious, and provides the film with most of the gags.<br/><br/>However what I found to be the most gut wrenchingly funniest moment in the picture, was the old man at the ice rink as he solemnly mimes the words to Endless Love. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Look out for a wonderful and hilarious scene where Happy has a violent punch up with American game show host Bob Barker and a great cameo from Ben Stiller as the sadistic nursing home orderly.<br/><br/>One question though.

","I'm not sure why I put myself through crappy comedies that I know very well going in will be crappy. I can't imagine why I subject myself to that. Maybe it's my own sick form of punishment. Maybe I hold on to a little hope that the film might be good. I don't know, but with Happy Gilmore I got exactly what I was expecting. It's a stupid, goofy, brainless comedy that has all of the cheapest and lamest kinds of jokes rolled up together in a big ball of suck.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a wannabe hockey player who finds out he has a ridiculously strong golf swing. He uses this ability to compete in golf tournaments, saving the prize money for his grandma who was recently evicted from her home because she owed the IRS $270,000. Happy gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations on his way to the money, encountering all sorts of strange and eccentric characters both friendly and not so friendly. However, the result of all this silliness... not funny.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a film that tries so desperately to be funny. That's all it wants to accomplish. It only wants to make its audience laugh, and that's what any comedy film like this should want to do. But Happy Gilmore fails at doing that, at least for me. It's not funny, only stupid. It's your basic Adam Sandler idiocracy that is just as unfunny in this film as it is in the rest of his screwball comedies.<br/><br/>The film has all the things that make a screwball comedy what it is today. It has a ridiculous plot, unbelievable characters, and impossible character relationships. These are the things that seem to make these kinds of comedies tick, and there is really something wrong with that. Then you add the fact that the character of Happy is a total jerk and incredibly unlikeable it just sets up Happy Gilmore to be a disaster of a film. I may have laughed once or twice, and I didn't hate the film enough to turn it off, but it really is an awful film."
"DaRick89","7","2","4","1 July 2012"," Consistently funny, but carried by an over-the-top Adam Sandler
","You don't have great expectations of a movie like Happy Gilmore. You see the cast and you realise that how much you will like the movie depends on how much you like Adam Sandler and his antics. Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. <br/><br/>The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things.<br/><br/>The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like ""you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?"". I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. <br/><br/>The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad. The music used was also good. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the film's basic nature DOES mean that I can't rank Happy Gilmore as being anything more than an above-average comedy despite it being consistently funny. I would also not recommend it for those who dislike Sandler. However, I would recommend it for most other people. <br/><br/>3.5/5 stars<br/><br/>P.S: Some of the deleted scenes are as good as the rest of the film."

","I cannot say I am a fan of Adam Sandler, while I do find him irritating in general, he has done some decent movies. Happy Gilmore is one of his better movies, though I would personally put The Wedding Singer and Spanglish over this. But it is better than Little Nicky and the Mr Deeds remake, that I can tell you. The story is predictable and holds no surprises, the script is somewhat uneven and the ending struck a false note with me. However, while it is of no cinematic value, the cinematography and scenery are above decent, and the slapstick action and sports sequences do have its amusing moments and when I say amusing it was actually amusing. Adam Sandler is delightfully goofy and a lot less irritating than I usually find him and Julie Bowen is a nice romantic interest. Overall, not exceptional being a bit of a no-brainer, but it is an amusing knockabout sports comedy. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing. Sandler in the mid-90s was a roiling ocean of slapstick brilliance, totally superficial and meaningless but all the more endearing for it. Here, of course, he's the brainless hockey player turned golf pro, capable of driving the green on a par five but allergic to any semblance of a short game. It's a role catered to his strengths - quick temper tantrums, wacky fight scenes, childish infatuations - and he still plays them well. All the fleeting extraneous bits land, too, from Carl Weathers's absurdly long false hand to Lee Trevino's frequent, often wordless, cameos to Christopher McDonald's delicious overacting as the stuck-up front runner, Shooter McGavin.

Sandler plays Happy Gilmore as the same character Sandler has ever played: a mercurial, boyish, sweet-talking violent sociopath. Some of the setups are mildly amusing (the fight with Bob Barker) but most off-putting to me, besides the violent rages Happy flies into every 30 seconds, is the blatant product placement. ""Happy Gilmore"" genuinely feels like an infomercial for Subway. I wonder if they funded the whole movie."

","Writers Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler give us one of the most disappointing comedy movies of 1996. I have no idea how Dennis Dugan has agreed to direct such a story, most of which is just random scenes that are supposed to be funny. Unfortunately most of it is just not in place.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a rejected hockey player, who tries to become a MVP in golf so that he can save his grandmother's house, which she's going to lose due to not paying back taxes. He then joins the PGA Golf Tour so he can get the money needed to help his grandma. Henceforth, the movie shows its full ""potential"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Gilmore has a big rival in the face of the self-assured and envious Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who will do everything to stop Gilmore from winning the 1st place. Happy's advantage is that he can shoot golf balls for far distances, which ultimately makes him a podium challenger.<br/><br/>I don't know whether the things that happened after Happy joined the Tour were written with the intention to be funny or just the writers put some random sounds and stuff not knowing what they were doing. When the golf balls are shot we can hear a sound, as if somebody shoots with a 45mm gun. While the ball is in the air, it seems like it's a Boeing 747 plane with an engine fail.<br/><br/>The only moment in the movie that I actually laughed is when Happy, the sociopath playing golf, started hitting the alligator that was not an actual alligator, but a dog, judging on its coherent, typical dog barks. A car (VW Beattle?) runs over Gilmore with about 30-40 km/h and what happens? He's just having pains in the right shoulder, which he moves with not problem at all. After 5-10 shots he again shoots the balls with the same power as he did in the beginning. Adam Sandler is half a Superman in this movie - he even beats a man who can actually be his grandfather by means of age.<br/><br/>A very predictable movie. It's only worth watching it just to see the alligator scene. 1/10 for Sandler, 4/10 for the movie."

","I had heard about this film, because of the leading actor and the theme of the film, I certainly wanted to see it, from director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Grown Ups). Basically failed hockey player Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is looked after and living with his grandmother, he has no direction in life and his grandma owes money from taxes to keep the house. One day while at a driving range he is bet on that he can't hit a golf ball far, and that is when he discovers his talent to hit a ball a hundred feet away. Retired pro golfer Chubbs (Predator's Carl Weathers) spots Happy and this newfound talent, and he tells him that a lot of money can be made going pro, at first he is reluctant but he enters the debut championship. He manages to win and is ready to go to the real championships to play professional golf, alongside such high profile players like the egotistical Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Happy slowly becomes a talking point, not just for his skill to hit a ball far to the hole, but for his temper tantrums and frequent swearing when he goes wrong on the course. He is of course earning loads of cash and the fund needed to pay for the house is slowly being raised, but there is the obvious low point when he is forced to stop playing. Chubbs gives him back some confidence on a mini golf course, and even though his one-handed friend dies, Happy is determined to beat Shooter, they bet with each other to win the championship for ownership. So the big championship match comes round, Happy trails for a little while, letting Shooter gloat and be a bastard, but in the end the hero prevails, and Happy and his grandma get their house back with the prize money. Also starring Julie Bowen as Virginia Venit, Frances Bay as Grandma, Allen Covert as Otto, Robert Smigel as IRS Agent, Bob Barker, The Spy Who Loved Me's Richard Kiel as Mr. Larson, Dennis Dugan as Doug Thompson, Joe Flaherty as Jeering Fan and Lee Trevino. Sandler as always is the fun often moody slightly odd hero, McDonald and Weather also do well in the two main supporting roles, there are some good typical slapstick jokes, and you can enjoy the golfing moments, it's not such a bad sports comedy. Okay!"

","A hockey player, turned into a golf ace, is the premise for the movie. Dennis Dugan has delivered a funny comedy, even though it doesn't break any ground on this genre.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is somehow controlled in the film. He delivers as Happy Gilmore, a man that takes up golf as a way to make enough money to save the family home. The grandmother will lose the house because of the expenses of paying for the nursing home, where has gone. The nursing home is ruled by the maniac Ben Stiller, who terrorizes the lady. It's strictly a formula movie that can be played by the numbers. Watching it without any expectations proved to be better than resisting the inanity of the screen play.<br/><br/>The funniest moments are the scenes of Mr. Sandler with Carl Weathers, the man with a wooden hand. The two actors are immensely funny. Without a doubt, the best thing in the picture is the sequence involving Bob Barker playing Gilmore's partner. Mr. Barker is hilarious as the man that realizes how bad Gilmore is and wants to teach him a lesson for ruining his chance in the tournament.<br/><br/>The film is mildly funny. If nothing else is playing, it's worth a look."

","""Happy Gilmore"" is a funny comedy; perhaps Sandler's finest (I know, it's not saying much, but...). <br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, an impulsive and crazy hockey player with a slight problem: He has absolutely no skill at hockey whatsoever. So after Chubbs (Carl Weathers)--an ex-golfer with a missing hand--sees Happy's slapshot, he immediately thinks that this will be it. He can give back to the golfing community. He's lost his hand, so he'll teach another person to become a pro. So Chubbs offers Happy a deal: Chubbs will coach Happy how to play golf at no cost. Happy refuses, until his ninety-something Grandma loses her home to the IRS. ""Why didn't you pay your bills?"" Happy asks her. ""Because,"" she says, ""I didn't have any money!"" So Happy looks into golf and realizes how much money one can make out of it. He immediately gets back to Chubbs and agrees to let Chubbs teach him how to play golf, in a last ditch effort to gain back his Grandma's home. So Happy takes his rough-life to the golf course and single-handedly dismantles what golfing is all about: He turns golf into a ""cool"" sport, instead of an ""old"" sport. He verbally assaults both caddies, spectators and golf balls, throws his golf clubs into the distance, dives under water in a pond to retrieve a missing golf ball, and tackles an alligator on a golf course. Yep, it's Sandler all right. And the best thing about Gilmore is that not only is he a TERRIFIC golf player, but the ratings on the television have gone up major points. Just as everything is starting to turn out for Happy, another problem wanders along. Evil golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) has purposely bought Grandma's house to tease Happy. So Shooter makes a deal with Happy that if he wins the final competition, he gets the house back. If he doesn't...he's pretty screwed.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler isn't the greatest comedian in the world, but he is looked down on pretty fiercely by the elderly. I would feel sorry for him, but the younger crowds adore him; besides, it's hard to feel sorry for someone when they're single-handedly making fun of you and don't seem to care what you think. But regardless of Sandler's personal life and personality, he fit the persona of Happy Gilmore like a glove. I mean, really, who else do you expect to be shouting at people and throwing golf clubs about in a film like this? Exactly. Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>There are a lot of stupid things in this movie, including the mandatory on-the-side-romance. But I must say, it's not as tragic as the romance in ""Billy Madison.""<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel the movie took the easy way out a few times, and kind of cheated the audience. For example: In one scene they are going over the ratings, and the ""main golf guy"" says the ratings are so high that they won't get rid of Gilmore. This is while a television is playing with Happy swearing and throwing golf clubs around. The golf administrators seem pretty pathetically shallow to just say, ""Hey, the rating's are up! He's a keeper!"" when Happy is doing that. This may sound like real-life marketing, but when you see the film, you'll know what I mean. Another thing is how almost everything and everyone other than the main characters are a bunch of shallow freaks. The movie plays a lot like ""Billy Madison"" in that sort of way. Many of the characters--other than Happy and the main cast--are shallow idiots. Unfortunately, sometimes this results in the audience being treated as an idiot as well. And then there are certain bits that are just too dumb, even for a slapstick of this measure. For example, in one scene, a maniac drives his car onto the golf course and runs over Happy. The way it is done os so over-the-top that you can't help but think, what were they thinking? But it's not a biggie: I don't go into films like these expecting an epic. I just wish they would put a bit more thought into it.<br/><br/>""Happy Gilmore"" may not be the most thoughtfully inventive film to come out of Hollywood in recent years, but that doesn't matter in a film like this. I go into a movie like ""Happy Gilmore"" looking for two things: One, some good laughs. Two: There is no two. I just want good laughs, plain and simple. And ""Happy Gilmore"" delivers that happily, no matter how much you hate Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

Sandler also ends up with another hottie, too, yes that ice skating scene was intimate. Going pro, he's also stealing the thunder from current champion (Mcdonald).

"weekealex","8","1","2","27 September 2013"," A Hockey player wannabe who becomes a golfer
","In the movie ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996), Adam Sandler is the main character. The film director is Dennis Dugan. In this film, Happy Gilmore has no direction in life; he is a failed hockey player. His dream was to become a professional hockey player but he cannot skate; he then becomes one of the best golfers in the town. Happy's grandmother, who he was raised by, soon finds out that she is going to lose her house. So, after realizing that he has these amazing golf skills, Gilmore joins the P.G.A. tour to try to win money to save his grandmother's house from getting bought by someone else. He finds out about his spectacular golf drive while he is at the driving range one day. He becomes the star of the crowd and everyone loves Happy. His rivalry is named Shooter McGavin who thinks Happy Gilmore is a joke and an embarrassment.<br/><br/>In this film, I think the primary message would be that Adam Sandler is a failed hockey player but soon finds his passion in golfing and helping out his grandmother. Although Sandler's dream in ""Happy Gilmore"" was to become a famous golfer, he realizes that golfing is his true strength. Even though you might want to be one thing in life, sometimes it does not always work out and you end up finding something much better. Adam Sandler happened to do just that. I also think that the director really wanted viewers of the film to see how much Happy Gilmore loved and cared for his grandmother. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the whole film was enjoyable. Adam Sandler is my favorite actor which is one of the reasons why I chose to write about this movie. I love Happy Gilmore's sense of humor in the film. He was always goofing around on the golf course. I also liked how much he cared for and loved his grandmother. Family is important to me and I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler love his family in the movie."

","Just as a note, the day that I am writing this, January 20 1999, is the day is which Adam Sandler's new movie, the Waterboy, hits the screen. It is one that I have to see, just to find out what a ""Madoolaoblongorla (sp?) is. But this isn't a commentary on the Waterboy, that comes when I see the movie. No this is a commentary on Happy Gilmore, which I think is one of Adam Sandler's best movies, though I reckon most of them are pretty good.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is about a guy named Happy Gilmore. He is an ice hockey fanatic and really wants the play. The problem is that he cannot skate, but he does have very good ball control. Still, they don't want him on the team. Things get worse when his grandmother is forced out of her house due to unpaid taxes, and while the removal guys are moving stuff out, they make a bet with Happy to hit a golf ball. It lands up that he can hit the golf ball over 400 meters and as such manages to get himself into the pro-tour. On this tour though is a man named Shooter McKay, who wants to win the yellow jacket. McKay is the bad guy: he is a conservative arrogant snob who has a way that golf should run, and the game does not include Happy Gilmore.<br/><br/>What Happy Gilmore does though is that he adds new life to golf. His antics and his psychotic attacks attract a huge crowd and the ratings soar. The thing is that Happy has a big problem controlling his temper. When the ball doesn't do what it is supposed to do, he freaks out at it. When somebody gets in the way he will beat them up, and this draws a huge crowd. As such the golf board is very unwilling to let him go.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie. It is also a very popular movie. One of the video stores I go to claim that it is often out, while another said that their copy went to Movieland Heaven. It has some good quotes though the comedy more deals with Happy's actions. There is slapstick, which is actually pretty cool, but the comedy comes more out of the things Happy says and does. It is a great movie and I can see why it is so popular.<br/><br/>Favourite quote: I eat pieces of sh*t like you for breakfast.<br/><br/>What? You eat sh*t do you?"

And you can tell it's slapstick right from the beginning. And from the beginning I mean the opening credits. It's pure slapstick. But it's funny as hell and I really enjoyed it.

Even after seeing it at least five times, it stay makes me laugh out loud! <br/><br/>A word of advice: This is a movie to watch with a group of people who also like to laugh. It will be a lot more enjoyable the more you laugh and the more you know other people think it's funny too. That being said, it's not the type of movie you'd want to watch if you're looking for some deep message. It's just a simple story about a new golfer with anger management issues who tries to win back his grandmother's house. But it is HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>To demonstrate the type of humor used throughout the film, imagine a quiet, peaceful golf course filled with proper people there to enjoy the sport. And then there's Happy. He comes to the course dressed like a bum, has no idea what he's doing, and treats the game as if no one were watching. For example, he frequently gets mad when the ball does not go in the hole. Once, in my favorite scene, he gets down on the ground next to the ball and says, ""SON OF A B**** BALL, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO TO YOUR HOME?! THAT'S YOUR HOME! ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR YOUR HOME?! ANSWER ME!"" and then begins freaking out even more.<br/><br/>So, I guess, if you don't like that kind of humor, this movie's not for you. But if you think that it'd be funny to watch a psycho golf player on the course and dig an inspiring story of love and determination on the side, check this out. It's become a classic in my mind, and out of all the great comedies I've seen, none of them seem to compare with this one.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler, you are a genius.<br/><br/>With love, <br/><br/>Simba Jackson"

But this one is special, like Airplane, Caddy Shack, Stripes, etc.<br/><br/>First off, Sandler's rants slay me. ""Don't you want to go home! Are you too good for your home??"" His sudden violent impulses are just plain silly. They are meant to so outrageous as to be funny. He has funny lines, and delivers them with perfect timing. He's a born comedian, love or hate him, and this role perfectly suits him. And he's quite likable just like the Hansons' in the movie slap shot. I think because we all want to vent our rage sometimes. It's not like he's mean to people who are nice to him. Or rude. He just has a short temper.<br/><br/>Carl Weathers as Chubs is priceless. I think there's real talent in how he delivers his lines. He plays this passionate person who denied his own shot at fame, wants to make Happy great so he can feel part of greatness. His part is played almost totally straight. I almost wish he had more lines in the movie.<br/><br/>People have complained that the movie is basically a bunch of gags. What's wrong with that?

","This 1996 film, starring comedian Adam Sandler, was released the year after ""Billy Madison"", also starring Sandler. I didn't see either of those two famous films from start to finish until years after their release. I saw all of ""Billy Madison"" for the first time in 2003, and don't recall being too pleased. I finally watched ""Happy Gilmore"" in 2006, and definitely thought it was better than its predecessor. Watching ""Billy Madison"" again this year, I was more impressed than I was before, but still found some of it a tad embarrassing. Overall, it was a mixed blessing for me that time. After my second viewing of that film, I watched ""Happy Gilmore"" again, and I definitely still prefer it. In fact, it may have been just a bit better to me than it was the first time.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a wannabe hockey player who was raised by his grandmother. He has failed in his attempts to make the professional league due to his lack of skating skills and trouble controlling his temper. His grandmother hasn't paid her taxes in years, and owes a total of $270,000 to the IRS. Because of this, she is evicted from her house (a house which Happy claims his grandfather built with his bare hands), and is forced to live in a retirement home, which is secretly run as a sweatshop! Happy must find a way to make $270,000 in time, before the house is sold, and discovers how far he can hit golf balls. Soon after ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson sees his skill, and leads him into professional golf, only because Happy knows this is a chance to make money and save his grandmother's house. He turns out to be a huge hit on the pro golf tour, but his aggressive tendencies may be a problem here as well, and golfing champion Shooter McGavin is determined to bring him down! <br/><br/>Sandler played the same kind of character in this film as he did in ""Billy Madison"", a goofy, immature maniac. Both films are pretty silly, but this one doesn't get QUITE as puerile as its predecessor (for example, no pants wetting gags here), and while not every single gag in this film made me laugh, none of them actually embarrassed me, which some of the gags in Sandler's 1995 film seemed to do. In ""Happy Gilmore"", the comedian made me laugh quite a few times, sometimes hard, with his antics in the lead role, involving slapstick and insanity. Highlights for me included his tirade on the golf course and some fights he gets into, including one with game show host Bob Barker. While Sandler provides most of the humour, some of the other cast members can also be funny, such as Joe Flaherty in his bit part as the ""Jeering Fan"", there to make Happy Gilmore's game more difficult.<br/><br/>During Adam Sandler's film career, he has had some big hits as well as flops. It seems this one turned out to be one of his successful films, which I would say it deserved to be, unlike, let's say, the 2002 feature-length cartoon, ""Eight Crazy Nights"", which deservingly tanked. As usual with films starring the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian, this one is crude and rather juvenile, though certainly not as juvenile as some of his other films. I guess that's one of the things I like about it. Unlike some of Sandler's comedies, including ""Billy Madison"", and even more so the rather disgusting ""Eight Crazy Nights"", this one doesn't tend to overdo the puerile humour.

","Happy Gilmore is a hilarious movie! I like Adam Sandler's early movies and this or maybe Billy Madison are his best. I can't remember every seeing another golf comedy except Caddyshack and it is completely different from Caddyshack even though they both are kind of screwball genre comedies. Adam Sandler is very funny in it and all the supporting characters are funny too. I don't want to give anything away if you haven't seen this movie but I've seen the movie twelve times probably and I still laugh my butt right off every time I see the Bob Barker scene. If you don't mind stupid, dumb screwball comedy you'll love this movie it is very funny even though it's pointless and very low brow. It won't ever win awards but it's just a fun movie."
"mr_popcorn","7","1","2","1 September 2008"," Review: Happy Gilmore
","Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player with no direction in life. His grandmother is evicted from her house for her failure to pay back taxes, and his girlfriend has left him. He makes it on to the pro golf tour with the hope of making some money to save his grandmother's house, but is challenged by the favorites on the tour, Shooter McGavin.<br/><br/>This is one of the better Happy Madison flicks I've seen and this one actually made me laugh. The best scene has got to be the cameo of Bob Barker who went ballistic on hot-tempered Happy Gilmore. That scene is classic and it will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>The Happy Madison shingle has been a big disappointment nowadays with the release of vile spew Zohan and terrible unfunny Chuck and Larry. I'm glad I got to see this one because honestly, I'm starting to lose the faith with Adam's comedy posse. Let's just hope Happy Madison's next outing is a lot like Happy Gilmore and a little less of Zohan and Chuck and Larry."
"RainDogJr","Null","1","2","13 July 2008"," Hockey Player?
","Golf is pathetic and I wouldn't like to watch a film about it yet Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) thinks in a similar way so we are going to have some fun. He is a so-called ice hockey player but he can hit golf balls as nobody and he needs a lot of money for a good cause (his grandma) so why not joining a professional golf tour. You know when a professional football player or any player of a decent sport is asked about their beginnings they always mention things like "" you know I love to play it since I was a kid in my neighbourhood with all my friends"" and stuff but when a golfer is asked is like ""well my family owned a country club so"" and stuff so for obvious reasons golf is for me extremely boring and the golfer himself or herself is pathetic. So imagine when Gilmore enters in the golf world, he is the punk rocker of golf, doesn't dress with Lacoste but with AC/DC t-shirts, uses for caddy a vagrant and is the only one followed by the masses, the new working class hero and since it doesn't really matters if he doesn't win, since there is always a big check, he is going to have some fun. The tag-line of the film is ""He doesn't play golf... he destroys it"" and I really appreciate that but of course he will not be the punk rocker of golf all the time since he has to win the money for his grandma and eventually he will learn how to really play golf with the help of Chubbs (Carl Weathers), a character with some terrific moments. The weakest part of the film is the ending because reminds you that this is not that special and that you can know what is going to happen in films but by that I have already laughed in many scenes and I think you will have too.<br/><br/>I like Sandler but I'm not his biggest fan yet of course I do have enjoyed some of his films so after reading many positive things about ""Happy Gilmore"" and founding its DVD very cheap (mostly for this) I'm here writing that I enjoyed it but it doesn't stand up from the rest of Adam Sandler films that I have seen but at the same time it is an excellent choice if you are looking for an entertaining and light comedy with a memorable cameo of Bob Barker (as himself) and a hilarious cameo of Ben Stiller! (as a true bastard)."
"general-melchett","9","1","2","8 February 2007"," Very funny...
","It is not at all realistic, and it isn't even that original either. But boy, I enjoyed Happy Gilmore - probably because it's so damn funny! If you don't find people being hit by golf balls and falling to their deaths or a bloke shouting the word ""Jackass"" repeatedly funny, you're not a real person! It is predictable from start to finish, but at least Happy himself feels like a real person (even if his golfing escapades are out of this world), and the whole film does revolve around him being a rather good-natured person who occasionally breaks. From the very start of the film, you know it's going to be mostly puerile humour with a bit of sport thrown in, but if it is enough to bring you to the floor in fits of laughter, then Happy Gilmore has done its job! 9/10"
"kittiwake-1","8","1","2","8 November 2006"," Great fun
","I'm an Adam Sandler fan. I'm also a mom. Sometimes, I want those things to be able to mix. This is one movie I was comfortable sharing with my 12-year-old son. (Parents, please watch this one before you let your kids see it if you are conservative!) He gets a kick out of watching Happy overreact to the things that happen to him in this flick. My son also knows not to take Adam Sandler movies seriously. That's one of the great things about him. He can enjoy a movie that isn't considered ""Oscar quality"" and not put it down just for that reason. I found this movie hilarious and watch it often. Some of the cameos were cute. Check out a famous game show host golfing with Happy. The acting was a bit wooden, but game show hosts don't get their job for their acting talent. You'll recognize actors that Sandler casts in all of his movies. (And why not? Ron Howard does it, too!) The plot was cute. If you hate golfing, don't worry. This movie isn't all about golf. That's why it's called ""Happy Gilmore"" instead of ""Golfing with Happy Gilmore"". I think Happy is the ""dark"" side of all of us. Little holds him back from expressing his opinion when things aren't the way he thinks they should be. It's a great ""unwinding"" movie. Had a bad day? Happy does the acting out for you. (If we all acted like Happy, this world would be a strange, violent place. But, since we aren't like Happy, we can live vicariously through him as we watch him do the things we only daydream about.) I watch this one when I just want to laugh. (It really is the best medicine!)"
"gavin6942","7","1","2","24 September 2006"," Fast-Paced and Relaxing Sandler Film
","If you don't like Adam Sandler, you won't like this film. But that should be obvious. This one is not as laugh-out-loud funny as ""Billy Madison"" nor as subtle in its witty humor as ""Wedding Singer"", but is one of the easiest to watch for just winding down after a long day.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a hockey player who has no future in hockey. So he becomes a golfer instead (not unlike the guy from ""The Cutting Edge"" who became a figure skater). Luckily, he's a very good golfer because he needs the money to save his grandmother's house from being repossessed so she can escape from Ben Stiller's sadistic nursing home.<br/><br/>Again, you won't get any over-the-top laughs like the singing clown from ""Billy Madison"" and no obscure references like ""Wedding Singer"", but lots of little jokes to keep you going. Most memorable is the fight between Adam Sandler and Bob Barker, which is probably not only one of the film's best moments, but no doubt created a resurgence in ""Price is Right"" fans among the college age demographic.<br/><br/>And then there's the appearance of a ghost of Abraham Lincoln, which is either completely nonsensical or some very subtle racial joke. Oh, and then there's the midget on the tricycle. Does it make sense? No, but it does not have to.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film is not worth owning (I'd rather own ""The Wedng Singer"") but is still one of those you can watch again and again because of its light and fluffy nature (sort of like Jell-O). And who doesn't want to help save their grandmother?"
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","2","9 September 2006"," Happy 40th, Adam!
","Since today is Adam Sandler's 40th birthday, I decided to comment on one of his movies. ""Happy Gilmore"" is one of two movies in which he seeks to make something of himself in sports (the other is ""The Waterboy""). This flick basically has him doing his usual stuff, and anyone who gets in his way gets pounded, all tied around his desire to do something for his grandmother (Frances Bay).<br/><br/>Still, I can imagine how much fun they must have had filming some of those scenes. If absolutely nothing else, the ""Frankenstein's foot"" scene should make the whole movie worthwhile (although the Bob Barker scene is pretty neat also). It just goes to show that sports don't have to be all about machismo; they can just be silly. Also starring Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, Carl Weathers, Allen Covert (who most recently appeared in the Sandler-produced ""Grandma's Boy""), Robert Smigel, Richard Kiel, Kevin Nealon and Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>One more thing: why'd they film an Oregon scene in Washington?!"
"moviemonster92","7","1","2","30 July 2006"," Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Happy Gilmore""
","Adam Sandler is a genius. He has made so many great and funny films with basically no plot. I think he enjoys playing dumb characters or characters that learn a lesson at the end of the film. Some of his best performances to date are ""Big Daddy"" and ""50 First Dates"". Here he plays an ill tempered Hockey player who real wants to play the game. When his Grandma (Frances Bay) forgets to pay the mortgage Happy comes to the rescue. He gets help in the form of a black guy who had his hand bitten off by a 'gator. So Happy decides to win some money by playing golf. Along the way he makes an enemy in Shooter McGaven (Christopher McDonald) and catches the eye of a love interest Virginia Vennit (Julie Bowen), all the way headed to win the championship game and to get his Grandma's house back from Shooter. One of the most famous scenes in this movie is the scene where Happy and Bob Barker get into a huge fistfight. This is a very ""Happy"" and dumb comedy from Sandler and his crew that goes up there with some of his other sports movies like The Waterboy and The Longest Yard. All in all this was a very dumb and entertaining movie that should become a favorite of everyones over the years.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

It's easy, he's a hockey player who plays a mean game of golf. That's right, golf. Except those times when fans are taunting him or running onto the golf course, that is.<br/><br/>And when you add a celebrity television star who can beat the crap out of him, it's just that much better. Bob Barker plays a cameo role in ""Happy Gilmore"" who gets fed up with Happy's game of golf, which ends them up in last place.<br/><br/>The only reason Happy even played the game was to help his sweet old grandmother get her house back. And of course, to kick butt on the course as well. With help from Chubbs.....anyway. Shooter is not much of a sportsman when it comes to losing either.

Basically, it is an absolute classic, for the average viewer unfamiliar with the Sandler-esquire subtle timings and completely random-style comments throughout, the film may be wasted. But the movie does not disappoint. Adam Sandler does what he does best, presumably playing a character close to his own personality once again as a sportin' nutter. The sub-characters are just as hilarious, and the film is a well produced, while still being a non-stop selection of whacky moments and endless quotable lines...Ben Stillers semi-cameo role as nursing home attendant is genius, as he uses the old folk as cheap labour for hustlin' textiles in their sewing time, and is a proper Bastard to them all...'you can trouble me for a warm glass of SHUT THE HELL UP!' Definitely get hold of the movie, vastly underrated , and i reckon pretty much the best Adam Sandler movie out there (tho i do appreciate they are all funny for their own reasons), if nothing else it'll entertain.

I would have a preferred a greasier (popular) anti-hero to play 'Shooter' but that may well have taken the point away from Stiller sending up the 'looser' movie. Being English, and a cricket fan, I can identify with Stillers legwork and arm swing in hitting the ball. It's a classic 'leg forward, bat following' technique. I wonder where he learnt that.

"reviewer77","9","1","2","5 November 2005"," The greatest sports comedy... ever!
","Watching Happy Gilmore for the first time after a year or two, I was struck by just how funny the whole film is. For some strange, strange reason, this film was given horrible reviews by most 'big' critics. It scores only 58% approval on RottenTomatoes.com, and an even less impressive 31% on MetaCritic.com. I think I can see why  it is exactly the sort of film people can point out all the weaknesses in and feel superior too. This is a shame, because Happy Gilmore belongs on any list of the greatest sports comedies of all time.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore, an unsuccessful hockey player whose grandmother has not paid her taxes in years. When the IRS takes over her house, Happy has no choice but to put his grandmother in a nursing home for the time being. In one of his most underrated roles, Ben Stiller plays the supervisor at the nursing home. This is a man who is almost comically evil. When an old lady complains her fingers hurt, he replies, ""Aww, well, now your back's gonna hurt, because you just pulled landscaping duty!"" While at the driving range, Happy discovers he has a strange talent  he can drive a golf ball 400 yards. Realizing that winning the PGA tour could allow him to buy his grandmother's house back, he teams up with retired golfer Chubbs (Carl Weathers) and becomes a golfer. Julie Bowen stars as Virginia Venit, Happy's love interest. And, in an absolutely brilliant performance, Christopher McDonald plays Shooter McGavin, one of the most memorable comedic villains ever.<br/><br/>The film is constantly funny, charming, and well paced at an hour and a half. You can watch this film over and over again, and it will not get old. This is Adam Sandler's best comedy."

As movers are doing their thing, the golf clubs and balls spill on the lawn, Happy hits one a mile and they comment that he could earn money!

Happy (Adam Sandler) destroys all golf traditions. In his first tourney he gets a caddy who he tackles because he thinks the caddy wants to steal his clubs. In a later pro-am tourney he is paired with Bob Barker, they get into a great fight on the course, Barker ends up putting his lights out.<br/><br/>Happy's love interest is Virginia (Julie Bowen, who plays on the TV show ""ed"")who is publicist for the tour.

Happy agrees to pull out of golf if he loses. <br/><br/>Happy goes to his new friend, old golf pro Chubbs (Carl Weathers) to actually teach him how to play well, instead of just relying on driving the green of par-4s to score well. Chubbs had lost his right hand to a gator, which re-surfaces later and leads to Chubbs' fall from the second story window. <br/><br/>Happy gets grandma's house back, he and Virginia end up together, Shooter fails to win the championship one more time. This is not high art, doesn't even have a good moral to it. What I like is the inventive ways they debunk some of the myths of golf and have fun with that.

Vast improvement over Billy Madison(1996) and a little more mature.  The scene with Bob Barker is my favorite in the whole movie.

","'Happy Gilmore' stars Adam Sandler as a want-to-be hockey player who discovers that he is actually a born golfer. He decides to join a golfing tournament in order to save his grandmother's house. Humor and golfing antics follow in his quest.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays similar characters in his films, and this one is no exception. While some of the comical events are funny, Sandler and that sense of humor just fails to do it for me. If you are a fan of Sandler and enjoy his films, then you will probably like this one. If you don't like him, then don't bother. Yes, there are a few bits that are funny, but it gets old quickly and it is certainly not the type of film you will watch over and over again because once you have seen the jokes and know what is going to happen, the appeal has worn off."

","If you only see one Adam Sandler movie in your life, it should be ""Happy Gilmore."" This is the quintessential Adam Sandler movie, the one he has been trying to recreate ever since.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the so-called ""smart comedies"" of the past few years, ""Happy Gilmore,"" doesn't pretend to be anything it's not--namely a low- brow comedy. The movie's admittedly banal set-up is simply a platform for the comedy.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is pretty much the same character Sandler played in Billy Madison: a lovable everyman. Despite his mother walking out on the family after getting fed up with his father's obsession with hockey, and his father dying after getting hit with a puck at a hockey game (all this is in the first couple minutes of the film, so there are no spoilers here), Happy doesn't give up his dream of being a professional hockey player. Happy has an incredibly powerful shot, but he can't skate. After failing another tryout for a pro hockey team, he decides to make some quick cash hustling a golf driving range until next year's tryouts. When his grandmother is in danger of losing her house due to back-taxes, Happy decides to join the golf tour to get the money to save her house. With the help of a retired pro (Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from ""Rocky""), he quickly becomes the star of the tour, threatening the determined pro, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald, playing the cartoonish villain he plays in every low-brow comedy).<br/><br/>Adam Sandler would probably be the first to admit that this is not a great movie. But it is still funny and succeeds in every area it was meant to. Happy's outbursts are often hilarious, especially when he ends up in a fist-fight with Bob Barker. Ben Stiller provides some good laughs as a heinous nursing home attendant, and I especially enjoyed Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond movies) as Happy's former-boss- turned-biggest-fan.<br/><br/>Recently coming off ""Saturday Night Live"" and releasing his classic comedy album ""What the Hell Happened to Me?"" only days earlier, ""Happy Gilmore"" is Adam Sandler at his comedic height, which he himself has yet to top."

","I get it, I really do. He grew up as a Jew in Conservative, Christian America. He's not the only one who got screwed up by it. Look at Seinfeld, Mel Brooks, or, if you want to see a case where the individual got *really* warped, take a gander at 'Weird Al' Yankovic. I understand, but I still can't get into Sandler's aggressive style of humor, where it seems like those least deserving of pain and whatnot are first in line to receive it in copious amounts. Not big on sports flicks either, and the ""underdog defeats the pro"" crap is the worst kind of them, hands down. Apart from that, Dennis Dugan, who helmed the two most hateful movies I have ever seen, Saving Silverman and National Security(sexist and racist, respectively, both in the extremes), is undoubtedly my least favorite director. Why did I watch this? It was on TV, and I knew I'd have stuff to say, as I took it in years ago, when my tastes were less refined, and even *then* I couldn't stand this. If you've read this far in my review, you basically know what kind of... piece, and I'm not saying of what, this is. The Stiller thing needed a pay-off, am I right? On the plus side, it's nice to see Richard Kiel work again(Jaws from two Bond films), and his T-shirt rocks. If you're into this kind of comedy, you'll probably enjoy yourself. The acting is good. It's shot and edited well. There is moderate to strong language in this, as well as disturbing content and mild sexual content. I recommend this to fans of those who made it. 6/10"

Then one day, his grandmother's personal belongings and the house she had lived in were both being confiscated because of not paying taxes for a long time.<br/><br/>That became the reason why he make the unexpected move of from someone who had always wanted to be an ice hockey player to a professional golfer, in order to get back his grandmother's house. He immediately wowed the audiences with his long shots and the occasional eccentricity he displayed on the golf course.<br/><br/>But with all the hype surrounding Gilmore's popularity, someone is not happy at it. He is Shooter McGavin. The professional golfer who has so used to winning titles is facing the threat of someone who does not fit into the golfing world. He tried ways to topple Gilmore and while initially the former had succeeded, Gilmore decided to buck up ahead of an important tournament.<br/><br/>Well, whatever happened to McGavin...is almost everyone's guess.<br/><br/>It may be crude at times to see Adam Sandler (who played Gilmore) fighting like an ice hockey player on the golf course whenever someone provoked him, but overall, the movie is just funny.

","I want to like Adam Sandler. Maybe I do like Adam Sandler. After all, he was charming in The Wedding Singer, which only just stood up to a second viewing. Then again, for every Wedding Singer, there's a Waterboy - the comedic equivalent of what Jim Caviezel endures in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is unusual because it is one of the few bad films I've actually sat through until the end. So how bad is it? Well, I would be exaggerating if I said that it was bordering on a crime against humanity, but it would be a mild exaggeration. I am unreliably informed that the US dropped copies of the DVD on Falluja to destroy the spirit of the rebels there. It is the sort of comedy that produces a sort of existential pain, a shiver in the soul. It is about as funny as bowel cancer.<br/><br/>The main character is irritating and unpleasant and impossible to feel sympathy for. It isn't enough that we have to root for this idiot, we also have to turn all of his opponents into overblown villains. Quite why a champion golfer would need to descend into villainy to defeat an erratic novice is beyond me, but then, we wouldn't root for Sandler if his opponents were nice guys, now would we?<br/><br/>Then there's the love story, although to call it that is a crime against romance. Basically, Sandler's character bumps into the only female character that isn't his mother, and the two fall in love - because a) he's the hero, and b) she's the only female that isn't his mother. It's enough to make you ram your private parts into a blender.<br/><br/>I can't say whether this is the worst comedy I've ever seen - usually I turn a film off if it makes me want to climb into the oven with a box of matches and a copy of Finnegans Wake - but it is bad. How bad? Toothache on a first date is bad; finding out that every one of your male ancestors had a penchant for little drummer boys is bad (I would imagine); Happy Gilmore is, dare I say it, much, much worse. Only the Marquis de Sade would enjoy watching such a painful film... but even he would feel dirty afterwards.<br/><br/>Score: 2/10 (OK, it should really be 1 out of 10, but since making a comedy about golf is very, very brave indeed, I gave it an extra pip)"

","While calling a movie Adam Sandler's best may be damning it with faint praise, this is pretty well-done as dumb comedies go. Sandler is in his element as the goofy hockey wannabe trying to raise money by using his 450-yard drives to win money on the PGA Tour. Playing off the indignant Christopher McDonald, a pro on a hot streak bothered by the popularity of this working-class hero, the comedic timing here works out well, and there are some good scenes when tempers flare (a notable one with both McDonald in a bar and TV's Bob Barker).<br/><br/>The movie will become a lot funnier if you happen to play golf, or even watch, it, because the antics of Sandler on the golf course (he plays in a Boston Bruins jersey and putts like he's using a hockey stick) are ridiculous enough to be funny. There are some good laughs from various places on the course, and Ben Stiller gets some chuckles as the insane and sadistic orderly at the nursing home Sandler's Grandma is staying in while he tries to win back her house.<br/><br/>As a final note, you can't hit a golf ball that far like that. I've tried , my friends have tried, anyone who plays golf and has seen this movie has tried. Everyone just hits a 50-yard worm burner. <br/><br/>Standard Sandler fare, but good for a few laughs."

","Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, a constantly rejecter hockey player wannabe. Due to way overly late unpaid taxes, his mom will lose the house that Happy grew up in. Gilmore has no clue how to raise the money, so he puts his grand mom in a nursing home overseen by a cruel orderly (an uncredited Ben Stiller). Later, back at his grandmothers house, he tries to get the movers to get back to work by out distancing them in golf strokes. When he finds out that he has an amazing golf swing and can get money for it he heads to the putting range to have people pay to watch him. This is where he first catches the eye of Chubbs Peterson (a hilarious Carl Weathers), who wants to enter Happy in some pro tournaments. Happy is hesitant at first, but his need for money wins over. However he has quite a temper, which leads to the pro golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) to loathe him. But Gilmore has Julie Bowen as a love interest who tries to keep him cool. This is a hilarious Sandler vehicle from way back when he was still funny. It has a great many lines that you'll find yourself quoting with friends months afterwords, non-stop hilarity, and a very memorable fight with Bob Barker.

","Another predictable piece of fluff from Adam Sandler. As long as there are 15 year-old boys, Sandler will have an audience for his movies. Yell a lot, make jokes about bodily functions, toss in a bit of mindless class envy and a ""girl"" (never a strong woman) for Sandler's character to sweep off her feet, and you have the basic formula for everything the guy has been in since he left Saturday Night Live. I'm not blaming him or the people that line up to pay good money to watch this stuff -- he makes lots of cash and the people lining up get mindless entertainment. For the most part his attempts at humor are as harmless as they are limited, and a little mindless fun never hurt anybody.Sandler is a one-trick pony, though, and if he doesn't learn some new tricks pretty soon, he'll become the Jerry Lewis of his generation -- a guy who exhausted his one-trick repertoire early on and spent the rest of his career as a caricature of himself. Jim Carrey seems to understand that phenomenon and while he's no Henry Fonda, he has at least expanded from the ham-handed humor that marked his early films into a few roles of some depth. Maybe Sandler doesn't care to expand --he certainly has no obligation to do anything differently and he's making money hand over fist, so it's a fair question to ask why he would want to change. Makes no difference to me, but it might to him when the notion of what's funny changes (as it will) and he hasn't adapted. Then we can all look forward to the Adam Sandler Labor Day Telethon."

The funny moment in this movie for me is after Happy Gilmore exclaims ""The Price is Wrong!!"" to Bob Barker (host of The Price is Right) ,  then Bob Barker gives Happy Gilmore a roundhouse punch to the jaw. Does this mean I wish I could give Mr. Sandler an uppercut, not for this mild mannered person. However I would like to ask Adam Sandler to stop using the same character for his movies.

Countless errors & ignorance of rules.

Unfortunately however, he AGAIN managed to irritate beyond belief with his usual trait, ie his idea of comedy consisting entirely of talking in a slow gormless voice.

","Review: 'Happy Gilmore' 'Happy Gilmore' starring Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald is a film about a rejected hockey player who tries his hand at golf to save his grandmother's house from being repossessed. Directed by Dennis Dugan, released in 1996 this is an Adam Sandler classic and definitely one of his best films but that's not saying much. 'Happy Gilmore' is an aspiring hockey player but he is always been rejected. When he learns that his Granny's house is going to be seized he joins a local golf tournament under the management of 'Chubbs Peterson' played by Carl Weathers. He wins the tournament and earns his place on the pro golf tournament. As I said Adam Sandler puts in his usual crude, juvenile performance but this time it actually works especially in comparison to his other recent films like 'Jack and Jill' and 'Grown Ups'. This film was released when Adam Sandler was putting out his best films like 'The Water boy' and 'Billy Madison'. Adam Sandler has plenty of experience playing characters like 'Happy' because in all of his films that I have seen he plays the same character. Christopher McDonald puts in a fairly decent performance of Happys' rival and reigning champion of the pro golf tournament 'Shooter McGavin' an arrogant and pretentious man. As I said he plays him pretty well. Bill withers puts in quite a funny performance as 'Chubbs' Happys' mentor and eventually friend. In comparison to his performance in 'Rocky' as 'Apollo Creed' he plays a much more comedic role showing his versatility. My favourite scene in 'Happy Gilmore' is when 'Happy' has a fight with Bob Barker from 'The Price is Right' who is playing himself. This is a pretty iconic scene in my opinion as most people I know, even if they haven't seen the film will know of this scene. I think that is what id best about this film, the back and forth between characters, Happy and Bob Barker, Happy and Shooter McGavin and Sometimes even happy and Chubbs. Another great scene that really sticks out to me is Happys' dream sequence. It's really uniquely shot and funny at the same time. All in all I criticize Adam Sandler's performance but this is truly his best film. I first watched this film when I was very young so I am quite nostalgic about it. I would like to see Adam Sandler try his hand at serious acting or going back to his roots to films like 'The Water Boy' or 'Happy Gilmore' because films like 'Jack and Jill' aren't working. Adam Sandler has proved he actually can be quite funny with the right actors around him supporting him. I give it a 6/10 it probably should be a 5/10 but I feel very nostalgic about it."
"The_Light_Triton","9","0","1","3 October 2016"," A Comedy that's only blotched by one single flaw
","Adam Sandler, whether you love him or hate him, he still makes movies and this one is arguably his best. He crossed the blue-blooded traditions of golf with the rabid, blue-collared style of hockey, and brings about a comedy that is still loved to this day.<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a failed hockey player who has a sweet heart but a short temper. That, and a slapshot that could send a puck through 6 inches of Kevlar. While his grandmother's house has been repossessed by the IRS, But in his words ""A house my grandfather built with his bare hands."" Happy learns that his mean slapshot translates into a 400+ yard golf drive, something that has never been seen before. With a few strokes of luck, Happy gets an opportunity to get his grandmother's house back by joining the golf tour, With the support of tour coordinator Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) and legendary golf pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) but he's got a rival in Shooter McGavin (Christopher MacDonald) the leading money winner who has never won a gold jacket, as well as a lifelong enemy in Price is Right gameshow host, Bob Barker. <br/><br/>Now this movie is downright hilarious. From Happy's antics on the golf course, to his unbelievable showdown with Bob Barker, It is a riot of laughter and humor. But as I mentioned in the summary, There's one single flaw that this movie could've done without.<br/><br/>In-film advertisements. If you didn't notice, Pepsi and Subway commercials are littered throughout the film. The arena where Happy tries out for his local hockey team has Pepsi clocks. Happy brings Subway home for his girlfriend. Shooter asks specifically for a diet Pepsi from Virginia. Happy Gilmore is teamed up with Bob Barker on the Pepsi Pro-Am. Happy gets $50,000 from doing a Subway commercial, and gets free Subway for life. There's Subway logos littered all over the tournament championship course.<br/><br/>And it gets worse - if you watch the heavily censored TV version of this movie, the editors removed almost all of the product references in the movie's dialogue, but the worst edit is the logo on Happy's subway shirt. The editing they did is blatantly obvious. Other movies had obvious product placement in them too (GMC trucks in Lethal Weapon 2, Pepsi in Home Alone, McDonalds in Big Daddy) But here it's overdone.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's a comedy that's achieved a cult status and it's possibly the best film Adam Sandler's ever done. Now if we could all just forget about Jack & Jill.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I had not seen Happy Gilmore. People were shocked when I would say this but I also had zero desire to see it and the more time that passed, the less I wanted to see it. It seemed like it was in that vein of comedy that I didn't care for at all. I don't hate Adam Sandler, but I hate when he does stupid so I lumped Happy Gilmore into that. My wife insisted we check it out when they added it to Netflix so we gave it a try. Not only was Happy Gilmore not terrible, it was actually quite funny and silly but in all the right ways and you can actually see Adam Sandler's charisma that has made him a comedy staple for the last couple of decades. This was far better than his fare as of late. I even was especially impressed with that infamous and ridiculous fight between Happy and Bob Barker. Someone told me just before I watched this that I had to because it was a staple of 90's cinema and I scoffed at them. Well I take back my scoff. For all it's ridiculousness, it is a quintessential 90's film and it's the perfect type of movie to just turn your brain off and have some fun.<br/><br/>Sometimes its hard now to figure out why Adam Sandler is so successful. But when you go back and look at Happy Gilmore you see the type of guy that came out of Saturday Night Live with a ton of talent. Happy is a great character full of anger and uncontrollable outbursts and he's funny and commands attention. Its not an Award worthy performance, it's just a fun role. A good part of the success of the movie is the supporting cast. Christopher Mcdonald is absolutely perfect as the egotistical nemesis to Happy. McDonald is always good at these types of character roles and this is no exception. Julie Bowen (now known for Modern Family of course) is decent as the love interest. Her character is very one-dimensional but she does alright. She certainly doesn't flex any comedic muscles in the role. Frances Bay, another great character actor, is perfect as Happy's beloved Grandmother. Some other faces to watch for are Bob Barker (of course), Ben Stiller, Joe Flaherty, Richard Kiel and Allen Covert to name some of the stronger supporting roles.<br/><br/>Director Dennis Dugan has had a very interesting career. He has done a lot of Television and a lot of silly comedy. Then he seems to have hitched his ride to Adam Sandler and hasn't looked back since. I don't know if Dugan feels comfortable in the genre or what but this was one of his better films with Sandler so I guess he deserves credit. I'm not sure he has much style, he just sort of uses his cast decently and tells his story. Happy Gilmore is a dirty adult comedy but it's also not toilet humour for no other sake so I can respect that. I laughed a lot and had a good time so I eat my words and I admit to Happy Gilmore's deserved legacy in 90's film history. 8/10"

","The earlier Adam Sandler films, are the best. All Sandler films are harmless enough. The early ones are comical, joyful and unrealistic. This comedy ticks all those boxes. Happy Gilmore (Sandler) is a terrible hockey player with a mean swing and serious anger issues. Taking up golf under the wing of an expert (Carl Weathers), Happy smashes his way through tournaments to raise money and save his grandmother's house. Current golfing champion Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), hating the media attention Happy's receiving, plans to cut his golfing time short. Sandler's on top, ridiculous form, his anger delivers the hardest laughs. Happy Gilmore's story produces that comic edge with its unbelievable, can-do attitude, like a script originally for an animation. The comedy heavily outweighs the plot. Happy Gilmore is easy- going."

"mike-macblane6","8","0","2","4 July 2013"," The Best hockey/ golf movie ever!!
","When it comes to hockey and golf, there's a known correlation that brings the two sports together. The second I hear the name Happy Gilmore (Adam Sander), I immediately think of the hockey player turned professional golfer Happy Gilmore. The screenplay in each scene describes every part extremely. The dialog is hilarious you'll be remembering these quotes for days. Every time I see him in his movie I think why I can't ""hit a golf ball 400 feet."" That's something I could never do. Happy Gilmore finds away to hit the golf ball that far.<br/><br/>The reason I say that is because Happy Gilmore finds out that his grandmother's house is being repossessed and finds a new hobby, golf. Happy's grandma hasn't paid her taxes in over fifty years so the government has the right to take all of her possessions. While at local golf course Chubs Peterson, an old golf pro, somehow finds Happy just to drag him into the world of golf. A classic quote that Happy says during when Chubs first meets happy while he's in a batting cage, ""Three hundred and sixty-four more days until next year's hockey tryouts, gotta toughen up!"" Then Chubs says, ""By god son, you're making me sick!"" One of the best quote's in the entire movie. He wanted this for his grandma. His grandma meant the world to him. He thought that each tournament he was in would give him money to put towards buying the house. Happy won the invitational tournament, but a lot of it was just on pure luck. He'll have to rely on luck through the entire pro tour.<br/><br/>Throughout this, Happy Gilmore learns that as he enters into this pro tour that he's going to be introduced to his new reason to play golf. That was to beat his new rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). Shooter McGavin was the leader in tournaments won and money earnings. People began to notice that Happy Gilmore is a character of his own. Tournaments began to be sold out every time and he started attracting people that you normal wouldn't see at a professional golfer's tour. They just want to see Happy Gilmore perform and do well along with his bizarre behavior. A long time former employer, Mr. Larson appears in one of the tournaments. He's there to cheer for Happy not Shooter. Throughout the rest of the tour Shooter is tormented by him. A quote that'll keep coming back to was what Mr. Larson says at two tournaments of which he was at and he takes Shooter McGavin's nine iron and bends it saying, ""Shooter haven't you forgotten your nine iron???? HAHAHAHA!"" At tour championship Mr. Larson shows up again but when appears there, Shooter McGavin hits the ball into the crowd. The ball all of a sudden lands on Mr. Larson's foot, he shouts, ""Is this your ball?! It struck my foot!"" Shooter asks the tour director if he can get a drop, but the tour director says that he has to play it as it lies. So Shooter hits the ball of Mr. Larson's foot, Mr. Larson says after that, ""That's too thus far Shooter!"" Shooter answers back, ""Oh you count?"" Then Mr. Larson fires back, ""And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking lot!"" The crowd goes, ""OOOOOOOOOO! Better run Shooter!"" Best part of the movie by far! Shooter McGavin decides he needs to get even with Happy Gilmore by hiring the Jackass Man to get Happy Gilmore off the tour when Happy is playing with famous television game show host, Bob Barker. Happy just needs to develop his short game to be able to beat Shooter McGavin. He realizes that he needs Chubs, so he goes back to him to work on his short game and pleads that he knows everything. The one thing he points out is he needs to find his own ""Happy place"". His grandma is included with what he's thinking about in his happy place because she makes her grandson very happy. There's one more tournament and that's the Tour Championship, but I can't let any details about how this ends. I'll let you find out for yourself.<br/><br/>This movie really is a movie for the ages. You'll be remembering this movie probably the rest of your life. Adam Sandler really is a character to watch for in this movie alone. The rival between Happy Gilmore and Shooter McGavin is almost an unforgettable rivalry that will be ever to be shown in a movie. I can promise you this movie will not disappoint. It's a movie to die for. If you hockey or golf then this movie would be a perfect fit for you. I hope you enjoy!"

Carl Weathers as Bubbsy is terrifically over the top and Happy even manages to get his wooden hand destroyed but he gets the alligator he did it. There are also hilarious cameos by Richard Kiel as Happy's ex boss complete with the nail from the nail gun Happy fired at him and causing him to be sacked of course and Ben Stiller as an abusive care home assistant. My favourite scene is Happy's fight with his playing partner at a pro-am tournament who is the guy who presents the Price is Right. ""The Price is Wrong bitch"".

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","2","21 September 2010"," Mindless Entertainment
","I suppose in many ways Adam Sandler has something of an advantage over other film comedians because nobody goes into a Sandler movie expecting a bellyful of laughs, so they're not particularly disappointed when they receive exactly what they expect. Perhaps that is why this average comedy – which appears to have been sponsored by Subway – from the so-called funny man enjoys quite a high rating on this site.<br/><br/>Sandler plays the title character, an aspiring ice hockey player whose enthusiasm for the sport vastly outweighs his ability. Shortly after failing once again to win a trial with his local ice hockey team he discovers that his Grannie has been evicted from her home for tax evasion and must raise $275,000 if she wants to get it back. Rather fortuitously, Happy accidentally learns that he has a rare talent for golf and determines to win the house back for Grandma.<br/><br/>Yeah, doesn't sound too great, does it? And the truth is it isn't a great film, but Sandler keeps the annoyance quotient on low so that his character comes across as quite likable despite some rather obvious anger management issues. Many other reviewers identify the fight that breaks out between Sandler and his celebrity partner as the highlight of the film, but as the guy is unknown in Britain much of the humour from that scene is lost. Fortunately, the rather lovely Julie Bowen is on hand to provide some entertainment for the eyes when the humour levels drop, and Christopher McDonald as Happy's hotshot golfing nemesis puts in an enjoyable performance.<br/><br/>I don't think this one will last long in anybody's memory, but it's entertaining enough in a mindless kind of way."

","To me, ""Happy Gilmore"" is Adam Sandler's best work. If you've never seen it before, you'll be laughing your you know what off throughout the movie. I only wish Sandler had continued making stuff like this instead of turning out bombs like ""Little Nicky"", ""Mr. Deeds"" and lest we forget, ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"".<br/><br/>Happy Gilmore is a wannabe hockey player, but there's just one problem -- he's not any good. Sure, his dad taught him the secret of slapping the greatest slap shot, but Happy's inability to skate well pretty much renders him useless in the hockey rink. After the IRS threatens to take his grandmother's house away after her failure to pay her taxes, Happy is determined to earn enough money to buy back her house from the government. He soon discovers his talents are better suited to golf than hockey, and earns a slot on a professional tour. From there, hilarity ensues. I won't give away any more than that.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend checking this one out, but I'll admit that I've seen it so many times over the years that it's not as funny now as it used to be, namely because I know it by heart and know everything that's coming before it happens.

"johnnyboyz","4","0","9","4 February 2010"," An unhappy viewing experience which sees some rather disturbing material play out under a guise of adolescent comedy.
","Happy Gilmore is one of the more distasteful sporting comedies you'll see, a film that tries to take sociopathic behaviour; marital problems; care-home abuse as well as rage and render each of them content that we may or may not find funny. The film's opening sets the tone in both the misjudged humour we'll be spending the next hour and half sitting through and the cold detachment from the piece we'll feel, when a mock home movie is established to be in the capable hands of an individual before they are killed at an ice hockey match. What happens next is the same 'home movie' aesthetic of the sequence, but this time with an 'invisible' shooter of the material. Such a ploy, after establishing a rather nostalgic tone to the piece before horribly killing of the camera operator, sets up the alienation the film has from the real world and will go along way in detaching us from the daft reality of its own – we feel disconnected from the off after <br/><br/>I doubt there are many people in the world named Happy, but Happy Gilmore's Happy Gilmore is named-such, and he's played by Adam Sandler. I think Happy is, in fact, Happy; but the things that make him happy are things that do not necessarily make the rest of us so – it is the same relationship the film has with humour. Happy's life is built around conflict and pain. Throughout the duration of the film he'll be in direct competition with a rival sports star; he'll have a disagreement with some Ice Hockey coaches over whether he makes the team; he'll partake in stylised S&M sessions with one of those automated machines that pitch baseballs in full public view and a wrestling match with an alligator I suppose captures that insane rush for conflict and adrenaline that he so badly craves.<br/><br/>But Happy's chief, overall source for conflict is with the state itself, when it is realised his Grandmother's scenario is that she must leave her house of many-a decade and move into Ben Stiller's prisoner of war camp-like run nursing home because of unpaid taxes. Consequently, big bucks on the pro-Golf tour seems to be the only way in which he can raise said funds. There's something quite pleasant, quite heart-felt about having to take up something new and as difficult as Golf for sake of those close to you, in the sense you're doing it all for them – but Happy Gilmore renders Golf something the lead has to do out of necessity, mocking those that play before taking it up himself and failing to undergo any significant on screen changes in terms of attitude. One wonders whether, at any point, he was ever enjoying what it was he was doing. In taking up Golf, antagonism born out of a rivalry with tour veteran Shooter McGavin (McDonald) arises, as does a friendship with Chubbs Peterson (Weathers) and a tour PR manager called Virginia Venit (Bowen) acts as a love interest.<br/><br/>I think Happy was in love before; his relationship with a girl at the beginning is observed as he talks dirty down an apartment intercom as his girlfriend walks out on him for unspecified reasons. Given his temperament, something that we come to learn more of as the film progresses, I think it may have been because of one or two instances in which he struck her, but the harsh realities of why this relationship is now off is completely ignored when a frat-boy sight gag is inserted into the sequence. Later on, he'll be asked about what happened between them and he'll lie to them that she died. So, are we sort of behind Happy because he wants to help Grandma out? Or are we anti-Happy and his antics because he, quite possibility, beat up his ex-partner a few times? Then again, we probably dislike the character of Shooter McGavin more than Happy – a man that feels Happy is destroying Golf but then contradicts himself in hiring an individual to put Happy off his game. Everything clashes and just ends up being a bit of a mess, systematic of both the film and its content.<br/><br/>Within the universe of the film, Gilmore can complete a round and head onto the next tour stop without ever having to face both the disturbing the peace and assault charges which would surely have been brought against him in the real world. The use of violence and destructive behaviour for sake of laughs is woefully misjudged in Happy Gilmore, turning fits of rage and destruction of objects items of near-slapstick. One sequence sees a fistfight between an elderly man and Happy on the golf course; one that should have ended in the hospitalisation of the elderly man and a jail term for Happy. However,the need for violence-infused laughs wins and this is not the outcome. There's something really distasteful in watching a fight between two people being taken to the level it is when, in reality, one of the two parties would be dead from their injuries.<br/><br/>One wonders what Happy might've done, given his predicament involving his Grandmother, without the sport of Golf. He may have become a foot-soldier to a local crime boss – forever being sent out to break the fingers and arms of those that owe the kingpin money. Happy's describing of swearing, fighting and breaking things as ""fun"" captures the film's overall tone, and acts as a pass-key for the less informed viewers of the sick spectacle that is Happy Gilmore to additionally have fun – we're even treated to what it's like inside Happy's head, in which a bikini-clad Virginia and unicycle riding midgets rule the roost. For all its stupidity and ineptness, the final insult is that it all boils down to a 'final green' climax, in which very basic rules of Golf are twisted for sheer dramatic effect. A sad and depraved effort."

","The Professional Golfers Association should define its sport in two era's. That is the time before Happy Gilmore, and the time after Happy Gilmore. Before Happy Gilmore, golf was still the ""guy in plaid pants"" type of sport. A game meant for people of affluence and social position. Happy Gilmore re-kindled the Caddyshack affect, advertising to the young, and not-so-affluent crowd showing us that golf can be both fun, and colorful. The golfing technique that Happy Gilmore uses is funny, and entertaining. His frustration with the game is understandable and is easy to relate for anyone who plays. I know after watching this movie it made me want to golf more, it especially made me want to try out his unique swing and see if I could actually hit a ball like that, which I didn't.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler uses his unique, SNL type comedy to drive this movie. The story has a defined plot, with defined characters. This is a remarkable difference to many other, comedies with other SNL actors. Sure, there is some definite points, like where he is pummeling spectators or interacting with other SNL cast members, like Kevin Neeland but, this movie actually delivers both good laughs, and good entertainment. It is a great story which takes some ""kid"" who just wants to play hockey, and ends up being a phenomenal golfer.<br/><br/>It has been a few years now since this film was released but, I know plenty of guy's, and ladies who started golfing after watching this movie. It's not so embarrassing anymore to tell your friends you went golfing last weekend, on top of that it's not so embarrassing to go to he golf course wearing a flannel shirt, and shorts.

Happy( Adam Sandler) has a well under par golf performance, but a spectacular acting one as he hits the spot every time.<br/><br/>As a rejected Ice Hockey player, Happy discovers his golfing talents and ex-pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) helps him progress. Gilmore with his popular 400 yard drives is aiming for the hole-in-1's to raise the money required to get his grandmothers house back. Happy's talent and rage creates the media interest that he needs to join the Pro tour. Competing with bitter rival Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) on the tour, they have their ups and downs to say the least and the practical jokes keeping coming.<br/><br/>Comical moments are throughout this box-office spectacular such as the soaking of Gilmore on the green at 9pm where he expects to meet the other pros' and his rival Shooter is to blame. Gilmore's anger and rage threatens his place on the tour which Shooter encourages his being thrown off. But due to the public interest and viewing figures Gilmore brings he remains on the tour although the outburst the fight with Bob Barker isn't the best moment for Gilmore.<br/><br/>Gilmore's anger is a key part to this comical film as several times throughout the film he lets himself go as he relieves his anger. Such as at the mini golf course he decides that the clown that keeps laughing at him when he misses a put would be better without a big red nose. Or the fight on the Pro AM with Bob Barker after they come last and Bob isn't pleased or the pushing of Happy's caddy but none the wiser Happy believes it's just someone pinching his clubs.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has yet another comical film but this has to be rated as his best performance yet in a positive acting career. This film is a sports comedy which is a must-see although the rating of 12 is appropriate as there are some sexual comical references. Gilmore has made this a must-see and the film is well worth a top spot at the box office as Gilmore bring a whole new life on golf."

","Stars: Adam Sandler, Carl Weathers, Julie Bowen, Chris McDonald, Allen Covert, Richard Kiel, Dennis Dugan, Joe Flaherty, Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I really do not find Adam Sandler to be funny. I have yet to see a movie where I actually find him funny, but this was one of his better tries. Adam Sandler plays hockey, then golf player, Happy Gilmore trying to raise money for his grandmother. In order to learn golf, he gets help from Chubbs, played by the scene stealing Carl Weathers. Adam Sandler plays a jerk, yet he is surprisingly likable and you are rooting for him in the film. If you're a fan of Sandler I highly recommend this. If you aren't a particularly big fan of him, this will kill an hour and a half. Also noted is Ben Stiller in a hilarious cameo as the Senior Home worker.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 95 mins. PG-13 for Language."

","One of my favourite comedies Happy Gilmore (Sandler) is a wannabe hockey player, who'll clearly never make it. One day he's chatting to some movers and places a bet over who can hit a golf ball the farthest. Happy smacks the hell out of it, and soon realizes this newfound skill may be able to help him out, most of all with his grandmother faced with losing her house. Before the wins start rolling in though, Happy must get his putting and wild temper under control.<br/><br/>Will happy get his game together in time to save grandma? take a wild guess.<br/><br/>An excellent movie full of laughs and memorable moments. Sandler is in excellent form, but many laughs come from the support cast as well, especially Ben Stiller and Carl Wethers. Well worth seeing."
"chikinlikinlou","3","0","5","8 November 2006"," Dodgy in parts but a rounded movie that deserves acknowledgement
","Some jokes that aren't funny and dodgy acting but an all round Adam Sandler film. With its cast of highly unemotional actors and a cringe-worthy 'happy place' containing a midget on a bicycle, that I think is meant to crack some laughs, Happy Gilmore has a rather bizarre feel to it. The 'bad guy' is just ridiculously bad and the good guy is all too naive and innocent. Not to mention 'Happy's reaction to the death of a good friend is acted as if he had merely scratched his thumb. But a movie that deserves its own category 'the Adam Sandler' it is rounded and i believe that all movies deserve to be watched, so watch this movie with a very open mind. Enjoy."
"CreamEliscious","7","0","2","6 January 2006"," Sandler's Medley of Horrific Comedies Comes to an End
","Adam Sandler is a hilarious man, there is no doubt about that, and I would like to thank him for finally making a quality movie. Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and especially The Waterboy were simply humiliating, low-budget comedies with no humor save the odd inappropriate pun or a flat-out dumb joke. Now, however, he seems to be making more... sophisticated movies, which will help his career far more than his previous works. Happy Gilmore is somewhat predictable, but despite that fact, after watching it I was still grinning because of the random midget-on-a-tricycle daydream. This movie is very funny, and maybe not Oscar-worthy, but sure to give your average fun-loving crowd a laugh with it's classier romance and side-splitting hilarity."

","hey my names Desmond Carson and i have to say that happy Gilmore is my favourite film of all time. Apart from the comedy value of it which was pure classic Adam Sandler the guy just gets to me every time and I seem subtly drawn to his cute little smile in every film I watch. I don't know why it is but he just gives me a weird little tingle every time I watch him that I've only experienced once before in my life with a man I loved dearly but I really just think Adam Sandler is a beautiful god and really should have won an Oscar for this film because it was easily the sexiest film of all time. I've never been so interested in golf in my life and this film actually made me take up the sport to try and find a guy who's bum was just as cute as Adam Sandler's in that film Awesome ten out of ten"
"djkeith3984","10","0","2","18 June 2005"," Best 'Sandler' Movie Yet
","Being an Adam Sandler fan, I like pretty much anything and everything he does. Some I like more, and, of course, some I like less. ""Happy Gilmore"" is just a ""Laugh Out Loud "" comedy, if I can steal such a cliché' phrase.(Which I use so often) The reason I say that is....some movies make you chuckle, smile, etc....but when you actually ""Laugh Out Loud"" ,that's a funny comedy. I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie and the intro where Happy is doing the voice over giving you the back story on his life. I was in tears laughing so hard. (Theatrical/DVD/VHS version)(TV edit was cut bad.) If you haven't seen it, shame on you. This just became available in a deluxe 2 disc set with ""Billy Madison"".(A good comedy but not as good as ""Happy"") Check it out. God, I hate that Bob Barker!!!!"

","When you buy an Adam Sandler movie, you're buying a brand, usually you know what you're going to get. Simple humor, occasionally funny voices, a regular guy doing something great, either on a big stage event, or merely passing high school. Happy Gilmore may be the most consistently funny of the Adam Sandler movies as a failed hockey player finds out he can hit a golf ball 350 yards and tries to earn enough money to buy back his beloved grandmother's house from the IRS. Simple plot, surrounded by funny performances from Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies) as golf teacher Chubbs and Christopher McDonald as the smug professional golfer Shooter McGavin. And just for fun, Lee Trevino makes brief, and funny, appearances throughout the film. The signature scene of the film is when Happy Gilmore (Sandler) plays golf with Bob Barker (yes, that Bob Barker from The Price Is Right) get into a fistfight over who is play golf well or not. It would have been in poor taste if Happy were to beat up Barker, but since it goes the other way around, it has a certain comic genius to it and saves what could have been an uncomfortable moment. The golf highlights are all long shots and fancy editing, Gimore slices almost every tee shot, but through the magic of movies, we don't see that happening. It's funny throughout the movie, not laugh out loud funny from start to finish, but there are a lot of chuckles, the story is cute, and it is not as crude as other Sandler movies are. It's sweet, cute, and most importantly, funny enough to maintain the entertainment value all the way through."

","Happy Gilmore was not a happy man.  He lived a life filled with pain and suffering.  Be it not making the hockey team, or having to find ways to save his grandmother's house...life was a constant struggle.<br/><br/>But life began looking upward when Happy ran into Chubbs, a black man who I occasionally confuse with Lando Calrissian.  Chubbs teaches Happy how to play golf, and Happy is happy...once again.<br/><br/>He hits the ball a lot and saves the house.  In the words of Adam Sandler, ""Whoopity doo.""<br/><br/>Thank you."

","No Happy Gilmore is not the classic film some people seem to think, but it isn't a stupid piece of garbage like other people think. I think a lot of people really do like this movie, and if more people would give it a chance, it would probably become remembered as a 90's Animal House, or Caddyshack. Even the biggest Sandler haters just might get something out of this."

Adam plays the part of Happy down to a tee (yeah OK, that *was* cheesy, but it was *so* easy) and the supporting cast play their parts great, too.<br/><br/>Brainless and immature humour for sure, but when it's as funny as this, who the &%#! cares, right?"

","Happy Gilmore is a funnier golf comedy than Caddyshack. It's about a hockey player who has a killer slapshot that just never scores. So when his Grandma loses her home to the IRS, Happy discovers his killer slapshot turns into an even better drive on the golf course. So with the help of a golf instructor, he enters the PGA tour hoping to get enough cash to help granny. This is my favorite movie. It even has cameos by Lee Trevino and Kevin Nealon."

"helenaduberry","7","0","1","21 January 2001"," Silly, moronic and downright funny
","Adam Sandler isn't a popular one with the critics thanks to duds like Airheads and Mixed Nuts. And while I enjoy his recent crop of movies, many do not, which I think is a shame. This has a lot of jokes, and while most are funny, some don't come off with good effect. Happy Gilmore is an amateur hockey player renowned for his violent ways. When he is introduced to golf, he uncovers a talent he never knew he had. The supporting cast is good, with Carl Weathers (Predator) superb as Chubbs the one-handed golfing coach. Yet you feel Sandler has to do a bit more to raise a smile. This is funny but at times a bit too lame for it's own good. 7 out of 10."
"t_brown_17","Null","0","1","21 November 2000"," A funny, time-wasting Sandler vehicle
","This is a pass-the-time, laugh-every-few-minutes Sandler vehicle that comes off marginally better than his first effort, BILLY MADISON, and marginally lesser than THE WEDDING SINGER. Sandler's gentleness is his greatest quality on screen, and when he takes to screaming to no avail, it all seems unnecessary. Here, he gives ample amounts of both, explaining the hit-or-miss feel of the film. It's a funny movie, though. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a few cheap laughs."
"emm","5","0","6","11 November 1998"," HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HO HUM!!!!
","The best you can do is laugh out loud and see this only once. Any comic like Adam Sandler will impress and entertain you with stupid jokes and one-liners, and that's what flatulent comedy is. It's something that we take for granted to escape the dark realities of the world in which we live, but that's also the problem when you have thousands of other motion picture comedies and sitcoms that duplicate each other. What difference does a TV & film star make in pulling off a success story? Take a good hard look at HAPPY GILMORE and you can see why somebody stole the ingredients from CADDYSHACK in making another lame 90s comedy film. It sets no revolutionary boundaries to make it a worthwhile pleasure. The one thing that saves this from being any worse is the scene with Bob Barker in it. I guess Hollywood will never learn!"
