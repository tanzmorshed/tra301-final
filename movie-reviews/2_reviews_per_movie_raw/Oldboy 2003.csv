","Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps."

","To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.<br/><br/>When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. <br/><br/>I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. <br/><br/>My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!"

","I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!)"

","I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!"
"johnny-08","10","301","461","22 July 2007"," Excellent in it's sickness
","I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.<br/><br/>To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.<br/><br/>On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.<br/><br/>That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.<br/><br/>I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10"
"Desertman84","10","47","65","26 November 2010"," A Korean Masterpiece
","Oldboy is one hell of a movie. It is a film that is characterized by surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion. The theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person. After viewing it, it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on what I have seen. It was simply a masterpiece. <br/><br/>It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you, this film is not for everyone. Especially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge, it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin respectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional depth that one could sympathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. And the soundtrack was mesmerizing. <br/><br/>This is definitely a must-see especially for people who love another kind of entertainment. I could have given this a 11 out of 10 rating if only I am allowed to."
"max8791","9","375","592","21 April 2007"," One of most well-made films I've ever seen
","I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.<br/><br/>When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.<br/><br/>Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange."
"tetsuoisleet","10","594","969","6 September 2007"," Pass by the ""Boo"" comments.
","After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.<br/><br/>:::::::::: Bottom Line :::::::::<br/><br/>If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like ""challenging"" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your ""brilliant"" reviews."
"lucas739","9","258","417","17 March 2007"," Great film!
","I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)"
"gdmvy","10","210","340","29 August 2007"," Amazing Movie
","Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene, but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him. He doesn't question it either.<br/><br/>To me this was one of the greatest depictions of Oedipus or other Greek characters I've seen this decade in a movie. Nothing is new. If you liked ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Blue Velvet."" Consider this one."
"ryuakamrvengeance","9","297","494","7 March 2007"," One step ahead of America
","Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Many people accuse this film of being ""unrealistic"". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema."
"maciusp","9","55","89","19 February 2008"," A masterpiece for the cinema fanatics.
","The first time I watched ""Old-boy"", I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn't quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.<br/><br/>2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Old-boy"", and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.<br/><br/>Knowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don't think there's 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.<br/><br/>Don't be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don't be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It's worth it."
"dj_bassett","Null","688","1275","24 April 2005"," Didn't like it much at all
","Armond White of the NY Press has called it a ""virtuosic stupid movie"". I think that's exactly right.<br/><br/>Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory -- there's an extended flashback about 3/4 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I've seen. The acting is standout. Hell, I even liked the score.<br/><br/>But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.<br/><br/>SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small -- although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae-Su's magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let's assume all this is beside the point, and that we're supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB (probably the closest reference).<br/><br/>The movie doesn't make any sense thematically, either. What's it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy's sexual relationship with his sister is just fine, the problem seems to be Dae-Su's big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this: the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true (?); Dae-Su becomes convinced that he was, in fact, at fault; Dae-Su cuts his own tongue out; Dae-Su pleads that Mi-do never learn the truth; Dae-Su even ends up brainwashing himself via hypnosis to forget the truth -- or ""keep his mind shut"", in a sense. I mean, huh? This is a pretty juvenile kind of ethics, to be blunt about it. Although Dae-Su is the protagonist the movie really doesn't seem to be on his side. It also hints at a weird kind of passivity: for all of the hammer swinging and octopus eating, Dae-Su doesn't really do all that much: things are done to him, and eventually he begins to internalize the abuse given to him.<br/><br/>Is it about the futility of revenge? One would think, particularly with the references to COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. But leaving aside the notion that Dae-Su's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mi-do doing anything, really, but take their lumps or try to fight back, the fact that Dae-Su is considered by the movie to have really ""done"" something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember, in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent. His motives are as pure as revenge ever gets -- that's why Dumas's ultimate critique, his ultimate notion that revenge even for the Count is wrong works so well. The force is seen in isolation. Here, though, it seems more a case of Dae-Su learning how ""bad"" he really is. He shouldn't take revenge because he really IS at fault.<br/><br/>I guess you could argue that the movie shows revenge is futile from the bad guy's point of view. Then why are we watching Dae-Su at all? Maybe the point is that everyone feels themselves righteous until they realize the true dimensions of their ""sin"". But I don't see a lot of people facing up to facts in the movie: I see a lot of denial, in fact. Dae-Su admits to his relatively ""minor"" sin but can't face up to his ""major"" one.<br/><br/>After I saw this I read some interviews with the cast and crew, and apparently some of this vagueness is intentional -- we're supposed to be left unsure. Well, the movie is successful in that, but I think it's an unworthy goal, an abdication of the artist's responsibility. People have bristled at the charge that this movie is nihilistic, but if that really is the point, that the movie's supposed to throw up it's hands and say, ""hey, I dunno, you figure it out"", then that truly is nihilism.<br/><br/>Ah well, I could go on, but I won't bore you. A virtuosic stupid movie indeed, I think: often amazing to watch but underneath the surface just a whole bunch of muddleheadedness."
"RagingDraugr","9","4","4","29 September 2019"," Gloriously Chaotic And Savagely Emotional.
","If you want to have my thoughts on this film be expressed in greater detail than I ever could, go check out YourMovieSucks' review of Oldboy. While its predominately about the (apparently) abhorrent 2013 American remake, it also goes over what makes the original so great and it also helped me to understand its plot, symbolism and messaging far more clearly.<br/><br/>In essence, I think what makes Oldboy something special is just how purposeful everything is. There's so many little things than go into developing and crafting it, it's simply astounding. The way the narrative unfolds is both a joy to behold and is also utterly no-holds barred with how far it goes in depicting graphic violence and imagery; but again, with purpose, as Oh Dae-Su (the main character brilliantly performed by Choi Min-sik) becomes a 'beast' satiated only by revenge whose motivations, though clouded by rage, are sympathetic. And the cinematography captures it so well with such impressive variety complementing the story damn near perfectly. A good example is when Oh Dae-Su is first imprisoned, the camera's perspective is low to the ground with an extreme close-up of the hatch he's sticking his head out of, desperate for help and the knowledge of why he has been imprisoned. The audience has just as much information as he does (which is very little) and both the plot and cinematography carries this mystery throughout in so many ways to the point where you notice things in earlier scenes that play a part in the grand scheme of the narrative.<br/><br/>And despite his excessive flaws, the audience can still sympathise with Oh Dae-Su and can understand his perceptions of himself as a shameful monster driven mad by a lack of human companionship, which speaks volumes of the film's incredibly strong characterisation. There's also plenty of intertextual references going on. Most explicitly, the film in-part adapts the myth of Oedipus Rex, whose events echo the major plot twist of Oldboy (though it's retold in a far more uncompromisingly brutal way). My main hangup with this film is that I thought the hypnosis thing that acts as a crucial plot device seemed like a bit of a cop-out...? Maybe cop-out is too harsh a word, but it seemed like a lot of Oldboy's events were predicated on the idea of hypnotic suggestion which I found to be difficult to suspend my disbelief over, even when considering all the other ""outlandish"" occurrences within the film.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 - Maybe I'm wrong about the hypnosis thing and it makes perfect sense. In which case, it might be a 10/10. Either way, it's a gloriously chaotic and savagely emotional revenge film that's well worth a watch (if you're not of the faint of heart)."

"JagsFanJay","10","227","411","15 August 2007"," More people need to see this film!
","In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming. <br/><br/>It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis. If you want to stay true to the Asian vision, I even think Jackie Chan could be a candidate."
"MrVibrating","10","76","129","20 October 2007"," Complex, challenging masterpiece that puts Hollywood to shame.
","While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichés and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.<br/><br/>Oldboy has an extremely intelligent and edgy script, which will make you think and question your morals. It would NEVER be picked up in Hollywood. Even the initial concept of being locked up for 15 years without apparent reason would be deemed to strange for the audience. Thankfully, the Korean producers could see the brilliance of the script and give it a shot. It's budget is some $4 million, which is amazingly well used.<br/><br/>Oldboy is very much the child of it's director, Chan-Wook Park, who's name should warrant a lot more fame than it does. The camera-work and pacing is amazing. There are virtually no dull moments. The fighting scenes are used to compliment to movie, not to give a reward after half an hour's boredom.<br/><br/>The lead actors are no less amazing. Min-Sik Choi is a perfect anti-hero. Unlike the Western antiheroes, he even has the looks of an everyman, which makes his transformation so much more spectacular. The lead actress is a bit understates in my opinion, but memorable never the less. The best one is by far Ji-Tae Ju, the charismatic villain. He dominates every scene he's in, a sort of Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.<br/><br/>Music and choreography is great as well. All the details and the grit makes the movie really come alive. At the end, you are in awe, a rare feeling for a movie. The feeling stays with you for days. Occasionally you will think of the movie and shake your head, unbelieving someone could actually pull it off.<br/><br/>So do yourself a favor, watch Oldboy. You will not be disappointed."
"jacktalking","10","32","51","27 August 2009"," Probably the best Korean movie ever made
","From the ""Vengeance"" trilogy by Pak Chan-wook, Oldboy is probably the best, followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Simple story, ""low budget"" and actors you already know from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Although I am a fan of Korean movies, when I've heard about this movie and it's plot for the first time, I thought ""oh my god, another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie"". I watched it for the first time two years after it was released. And to be honest, I was surprised. Since then, I watched this movie more than ten times and I still find it interesting. To me, Oldboy the best Korean movie ever made. Maybe best Asian movie in the last 20 years.<br/><br/>I recommend you to watch this, along with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. You'll be also surprised to find the same actors.<br/><br/>10/10"
"schnofel","5","656","1267","29 September 2004"," A rather disappointing effort
","Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. <br/><br/>And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.<br/><br/>In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped, but you know the story, so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself, the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment, I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.<br/><br/>And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks (full of bad pathos) and explanations. To keep the audience interested, we get gruesome scenes of murder, self-mutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked, these scenes are well done, but serve no greater purpose. It's all a so-what comic extravaganza.<br/><br/>Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment, courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today. I liked (among other things) the infamous hallway scene, the actors, the fight with the bodyguard, the revelation of the Secret and the sequence of Oh Dae-su leaving his bad self behind at the end. Small pleasures, indeed."
"ironhorse_iv","8","8","10","16 July 2015"," Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Old Boys was very interesting!
","This South Korean mystery thriller neo-noir film is like a hammer. It always manage to hit the nail on the head. Directed by Park Chan-wook, and loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by 2002's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by 2005's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film follows the story of a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), who is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of lies, conspiracy and violence. With the help of a female Japanese chef named Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang) and one of his old computer friends, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji), Dae-su must find a way to piece together the scattered clues of who took his life away from him, while cutting down anyone who gets in his path. Without spoiling the movie too much, this film has a lot of twist and turns, that will keep the viewer, interested in the story. The movie is an extreme art-house film, often using tropes taken from previous psychological movies such as 1929's Un Chien Andalou (1929) & 1966's Persona. The film also has several parallels to classic stories such as William Shakespeare's to Titus Andronicus & French author Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The most famous one is the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex. Other works, like Ella Wheeler Wilcox's famous poem, ""Solitude"", played a big part in this film. ""The Man of Sorrow"" by Belgium painter James Ensor gave the movie, some depth with it looks. Classical music gave the movie, its ears. ""The Last Waltz"" by Frédéric François Chopin, and the first movement of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons: Winter"" are certainly used the best. The rest of the entire soundtrack is a work of genius. Not only does every title clearly applies to the events seen in the film when the track is played, but every track is takes their name after a famous film noir film. The acting is excellent for the most part. Min-sik Choi really put a lot of work, into this film. Not only did, he nailed it, with the emotional side, he trained for six weeks and lost twenty pounds to get in shape for the role of Dae-su, and did most of his own stunt work. If that wasn't extreme, enough, he ate four real life live octopodes as Dae-su in the sushi bar scene. While, it did provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. I saw nothing wrong with it, as long as he ate all of them. That scene was used, to represent, Dae-su hatred toward his enemies and I think Min-sik Choi capture that. Supporting character, Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee was great at being sinister, while being realistic. Director Quentin Tarantino was at the screening and was shocked to find himself crying for a character who had been completely despicable for the prior duration of the movie. That's how much, Ji-tae Yu got people to invest in the character. The only weak acting in the film, had to be Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do. I really didn't like her damsel in distress, manic pixie dream girl role. Still, this was a very powerful film. The movie was shot, superb. Great use of mirrors, as a symbolism of fragmentation of one self. I like how everybody is looking at another person, through a mirror. I like how shots of Woo-jin Lee, show how much omnipotent by wealth, he is. I like how Dae-su is shown as the common man. Getting back at the society, by hammer. It remind me of socialism ideas pitting against that of capitalism. Still, the most well-known shot had to be, the lengthy scene in which Oh Dae-su takes on over a dozen men armed with just a hammer. Given that the scene is nearly 5 minutes long, and is all filmed on one camera, in one take. The fight sequence took three days, worth of attempts to nail it. The violence in this film wasn't as violent, as some critics made it out to be. The torture wasn't too in- depth, as the camera cuts away, when things become way too gory. I found the violent to, pretty tame for a Rated R film. The story matter is indeed shocking. The whole twist toward the end is a gut-wrenching and sick. The movie ends with a gloomy ambiguous ending. While, some people might see this as a fault; I see it as thought provoking. While Dae-su is let out of captivity, he can only free himself, by finding out why he was imprisoned. Dae-su takes on many aspects of an Ubermensch on finding the truth, but ultimately his character has no control of his own fate and plays into his enemies' hands. By the end of the movie he is a very, very broken man. It's a great example of why human decisions are meaningless and choice is an illusion. One of the most important themes of Old Boy is the truth. Sometimes, the truth doesn't set you free. The only thing, that I can see as a fault of the film is how some scenes were very confusing. One of the biggest mistake, you can make, is watching it, with the English dubbing. It's horrible. It doesn't match with the lips on the screen at all. Unfortunately, you will lose a lot of Korean language drastically changed over those fifteen years, with it. You should watch it with English subtitle, instead. This movie help influence a Bollywood remakes in 2005 & an American remake in 2013. Overall: This dark Oedipian tragedy is somewhat enlightening. Drop the hammer, and give this a watch! You will not be disappointed."
"KScythe","10","6","7","20 October 2015"," One of my favorite movies
","This was the movie that got me into Korean cinema. This was in my opinion the best movie from Park-Chan Woo's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made. Around 7 years ago, I have been a huge fan of extreme cinema and I heard about Oldboy from one of my friends. When I actually sat down to watch it, I was completely blown away. This was not like any movie I have ever seen before. The storyline, cinematography, acting and soundtrack have exceeded far beyond my expectations. <br/><br/>The story follows a man named Oh Dae-su, who has been held captive in a cell of what seems to be a hotel room for 15 years. After being released, he tries to find his captor, find out his motives, and achieve ultimate vengeance. <br/><br/>The storyline seems simple enough, but the movie blows up in the faces of the audience with all kinds of unexpected plot twists. Not only that, but the story involves the audience with the characters in the movie by including very good character development and acting. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film, but the fact is that it's terrific and worth checking out. It will leave many with lots to talk about after finishing it."
"grdontom","10","47","79","27 July 2009"," Emotional, evocative and excellent.
","Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.<br/><br/>The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh Dae-Su is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors, he resigns himself to his fate, and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why, and the film basically charts this quest.<br/><br/>The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa, and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad, who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous, which I can somewhat agree with, although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message, and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.<br/><br/>Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese animé series, so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand, and the script on translation does lose some of its flow, as any animé or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father, this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film, and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching animé.<br/><br/>Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works, in particular the Pulp Fiction- esquire use of camera angles, and the famous dotted line sequence. However, Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy, being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or (where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 9/11) and has stated Park Chan-Wook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series, as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. Chan-Wook takes on a policy of ""trust the director"", and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible, however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Sozé twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>What really separated and elevates Chan-Wook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making, and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece, with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses, stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","120","218","4 March 2007"," One of the most gripping movies I have ever seen
","Oldboy is one of the most intense movies you will ever see. Breathtaking, brutal and easily one of the best revenge movies ever made. The acting is amazing, especially Choi as the main protagonist Dae-su Oh. All the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). Chan-wook Park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. The plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.<br/><br/>If you can't handle extremely strong violence, torture, sex and language and can't stand subtitles it's best you stay far away from Oldboy....if you can, though, then watch it! It's an incredible movie with some of the best performances, a moving score and a disturbing but unique plot with twist after twist.<br/><br/>5/5"

","This movie was awful, plain and simple. It will probably be revered by those who only see ""films"" and not ""movies"" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.<br/><br/>I was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies, perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.<br/><br/>The storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. He is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live, writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for it). All the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. His nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know prison has been hard on Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? Of all the things wrong with this movie, this one seems like the easiest one to fix.<br/><br/>And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? I sat through stupid dialogue, over-acting, gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (By the way - I'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems I was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out I was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).<br/><br/>Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly ""movie"" - one that you might actually enjoy."

","Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.<br/><br/>Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. And also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, I didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that I had to watch from the beginning to the end. To my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an Eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. Afterwards I will take the ratings from the Cannes film festival with more precaution, as while Oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.<br/><br/>I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message."

","I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.<br/><br/>I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. This is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. Horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the MTV aesthetics.<br/><br/>The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment I'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. But, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (Don't want to spoil your ""enjoyment"", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main ""hero"" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he ONLY trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) The truly ""outstanding"" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since Oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. The cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.<br/><br/>A feast for the S & M inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. Heavens, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't THAT bad.<br/><br/>The invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from Korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. I don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often I am ready to accept that a movie I didn't enjoy may be better than I was able to perceive.

"grzegorz-jan-dabkowski","1","618","1234","23 January 2005"," Totally forgettable flick ranging from ridiculous to disgusting
","This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:<br/><br/>1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.<br/><br/>2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. Psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.<br/><br/>3. Absurd casting. I don't blame the actors, for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is scarce logic in the script. However, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3-4?<br/><br/>4. To me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out to make no sense.<br/><br/>5. Some films apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. Having seen this film, I began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. I cannot put any other construction on the ending. <br/><br/>6. The film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. Violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. Purposes can be different and I don't want to enter into this broad subject. Let me just say I don't object to violence in such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Passion of the Christ"" or ""The Pulp Fiction"". In ""Oldboy"" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or aural). What for? I do not know. Personally, I don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. <br/><br/>In short, I do not recommend this film either as entertainment or ""food for thought"". Where it isn't silly, it is disgusting. Don't waste your time."

""Hypnosis"" is frequently used as a device to cause the main characters to act sans mental phenomena. (hypnosis or memory don't work at all like the way suggested, the movie versions of these concepts are deus ex machina only with a different label) There is room in a narrative of control for character development but there is little conflict between man and that environment in this story, only slightly above average fight scenes that are unconvincing. (it's a comic book universe where one man takes on 30 or 50 or however many people at once because he was training by shadow boxing in an earlier scene)<br/><br/>There is a reference to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (or rather an acknowledgement of borrowing from that tradition), and there are obvious parallels, for example the protagonist in this learns from watching TV for 15 years, the Count of Monte Cristo books and a wise prison companion. They've essentially added one big twist to that basic story but the only way to make it work drains it of character and meaning.<br/><br/>Decent acting from Min-sik Choi can't save this one.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff.

The ""intensity"", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. Let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. By the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of ""horror"", to continue to ""shock"" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera ""revelations"" already served up in big bunches. It would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash.

There is some obscure and, to a certain extent, amusing cult created around this thankfully forgettable thingy. Like a fanatic's mantra, the same meaningless adjectives and superlatives (""the best fight scene ever"" etc.) are being ceaselessly thrown at an ignorant audience, as if repeating something untrue ad nauseam would make it true in the end.

The problem with Oldboy is not its being a foreign movie, but its being a bad movie for any standards, be it subtitled or dubbed, Korean or American, Asian or Western, yin or yang, theatrical edition or director's cut (tongue pun, if any, unintended).

","Having just experienced the breathtaking Oldboy, I can only have words of praise. I have always been reticent to write reviews on IMDb but I feel this film was totally worth writing about, so this is my first review In many ways, it reminds me of the also fabulous Fight Club, mainly because of its grittiness, touches of surrealism and fantasy, and thickness of the plot. I had been constantly pushed by my friend to watch Oldboy and he had always insisted on its brilliance. For quite a while, I refused to watch it believing that it would simply be another excessively gory and graphic Asian film, but I was so wrong. I have read many reviews of people criticising it for its violence, and have to admit I am not a fan of gory movies per se. However, I am okay with the occasional gore as long as it is not the main focus of the film. In Oldboy's case, violence is just a small (and necessary) part of a much bigger all. The film takes you away on a roller-coaster ride of human emotions, a brilliant plot, and sheer brilliance. The acting is absolutely superb, from the smallest to the biggest character, and has you believing all along in the storyline. The directing is beautiful, with fantastic and dark photography and a sense of ""doom"" throughout the film.<br/><br/>Even though the plot is at the beginning difficult to grasp, eventually it is just impossible to stop watching as the film draws to its inevitable conclusion. Oh Daesu and his plight are the central themes, but the underlying theme is that of Asian society, its rigidness and the importance of saving face. Also interesting is the director's ambiguous position regarding revenge, which is treated as an analgesic and as something to be avoided both at once. Human endurance in order to achieve goals is also an important part of this film, as Daesu is put through hell and more in order to find out the truth and bring forth his revenge.<br/><br/>Even though this is not a film for the light hearted, or for those enjoying light-hearted entertainment, it is however a masterpiece and wonderfully original in a time when films are just looking to sell well at the box office. It is a must see for those who enjoy quality cinema at its best, and as such, fully deserves the highest praise. I have given this film 10 out of 10 and thoroughly encourage everyone to watch it, since it would be a tragedy to miss out on such fabulous film-making."

","After reading praise after praise about this film on the internet from mostly western viewers (such as the completely clueless Tarantino) and seeing as how it won a major prize at the most recent Cannes Film Festival, my expectations were naturally high when I finally got around to viewing it.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that I do not share in their optimistic appraisal of this movie.<br/><br/>After being imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons by an unknown person/persons, Daesu (Min-sik Choi) is naturally a bit upset and is dying to figure out who imprisoned him and why. Borrowing a page from M. Night Shyamalan's guide to movie surprises, writer/director Chan-wook Park (along with 3 other writers) attempts to craft a whodunnit that will keep you guessing and interested until the very end. Well, they only half succeed. I'll admit that I'm normally slow when it comes to movie surprises, but this one jumps out at you as soon as Daesu gets out of prison. It couldn't be more obvious unless the director was sitting next to you whispering it into your ear. From that point on, the movie really begins to drag as we watch Daesu meander from one place to the next in an unfocused attempt to find his enemy and discover the reason behind his imprisonment. Perhaps the main problem with the film is the severe lack of information given to both Daesu and the viewer. Rather than finding out the real truth on his own, he is essentially told everything in the end thanks to a well choreographed monologue. This is not a ""detective""-style story that gives you clues along the way. Some secrets and identities are revealed much too early, leaving only the unknown reason for Daesu's imprisonment the movie's last remaining attempt to keep the viewer interested. When we finally learn of the reason, it's a total letdown and should leave any experienced movie watcher either scratching their heads in total disbelief that someone actually considered this as a basis for a film or make you angry enough to stop the movie right then and there. With the movie's undeniably gritty sense of style and beautiful classical score, this should have been mind blowing. But it's not. It's pathetic. It's obvious the filmmakers really didn't know how to craft a film of this caliber, so they fall back on the ""H"" word (you'll catch the ""H"" word when you hear it in the film) to solve ALL of their screen writing problems.<br/><br/>Thankfully the movie does have some positive aspects. The lighting and color scheme really reflect the inner conflicts within Daesu. This is a dark film, and it shows. The cinematography is inventive and vibrant with clever scene transitions and unique movements. The aforementioned score couldn't be better. It's a great mix of classical pieces, original music inspired by classical pieces, and moments of pseudo techno/industrial music, and it certainly does a great job of infusing the viewer with a sense of doubt and depression. Min-sik Choi gives an extremely admirable performance as the mentally conflicted Daesu and handles all kinds of scenes from action to romance with a great sense of confusion and surprise. Finally the relationship between Daesu and the mysterious Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) is really quite touching, allowing for some nice dramatic moments.<br/><br/>That being said, it's ashame that the film's story couldn't match its style.<br/><br/>Chan-wook Park has directed some of Korea's best and most memorable films in recent memory, such as JSA and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, but Old Boy is simply a semi-interesting film. In the realm of revenge flicks, this is perhaps one of the more ambitious (which is definitely a good quality) films out there, but ambition can only get you so far, and Chan-wook Park just can't pull it off. Worth a look for film fans, but it's just not remarkable enough to be recognized on a global scale. Beware before you buy, for you could end up being sorely disappointed as well. 6/10"

","This movie was not at all what I expected. I thought I'd be seeing an intriguing mystery, but I was revolted rather than captivated. Eating live animals, impromptu dentistry with a claw hammer, incest, and self-inflicted violence are just a few of the visual atrocities one must watch in Oldboy. Add to that the ending of the movie, which was beyond the pale of perversity, and you have a movie experience you will never forget but wish you could. Overall, I wish I had never seen it and unless you enjoy extreme, gratuitous violence, implausible and deranged story lines that would test the strongest stomach, you should skip it too.

","I went to see this movie because it had a 8.6 rating at IMDb.com. How can people overrate it like that?<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes were sooo boring. The whole movie, you wait for something to happen which explains everything. And when that happens in the end, it's just a disappointment. The story is unrealistic, the dialogues are poor (and no they are NOT intellectual, for all wannabe-intellectuals - not only since the few wise sentences have to be repeated five times for everybody to remember them). The few messages could've been brought to the viewer in a much more entertaining way.<br/><br/>Like in David Lynch movies, Oldboy forces you to think about it, and think about it, try to find a deeper sense, and while you are watching you realize that there is none - and that's just poor."

","Oldboy is the kind of film that the cinema was invented for. It doesn't patronise or insult it's audience, it keeps the audience on their toes, constantly engaged in suspense, drama and mystery. Watching this film is an emotional roller-coaster. The cinematography is dark, yet breathtaking, the music accompanies all of the drama and action beautiful, in an almost operatic sense. It's graphically violent, but not gratuitously so, the acting is first rate and the plot is intricate, intelligent, filled to the brim with many philosophical and human ideas.<br/><br/>It's perfect for multiple viewings, it's a good laugh to watch with your mates, it was desired for the really big screen and the experience of watching OldBoy is unforgettable, right up until the very end.

"mbg147","1","150","291","28 November 2010"," Wow, this movie blows
","This movie is horrible. You don't find out the plot line in the exact order I'm laying it out, but in the end this is all that has happened:<br/><br/>Basically Incestuos Brother is having sex with his own Sister. The school finds out because Main Character sees them, and Sister kills herself.<br/><br/>Fast forward many years later, Incestuos Brother has Main Character's wife murdered, and Main Character kidnapped for like 10-15 years. MC is eventually released but he has no idea why, or who captured him. He meets Young Girl, they fall in love, and have sex. Then you find out Young Girl is Main Character's daughter. (yeah I know pretty gross) Incestuous Brother is all angry about his Sister killing herself because Main Character went and told the entire school about their forbidden relationship. So he's held this 20 year long grudge, in which he murders MC's wife, locks the guy up for over a decade, then orchestrates him having sex with his own daughter?????? Seriously, how can you not be completely turned off by this movie at this point? <br/><br/>I don't care how sad and bizarre your life is, or how desperately you need to latch on to oddball art, cinema, and music to make yourself feel unique and different than everyone else. There's really nothing enjoyable about this movie other than the cinematography. <br/><br/>Every plot ""twist"" it just gets more disturbing and overly complicated. A good plot twist should leave the viewer going ""wow, why didn't I think of that?"" not ""OMG what kind of sick %#@$% would even begin to think that?""<br/><br/>The acting is sub par, and the characters are lame. Main Character just runs around talking about claiming revenge the entire movie. OK, I think everyone can follow this line of thinking. Someone took away your family, and kidnapped you for a long time, yeah I'd want to go bash some skulls in too. But then every time he should actually act on that revenge he wimps out and instead of killing some fool he lets them go in some attempt to unravel this overly complicated mystery behind WHY this was done to him. Incestous Brother is just this smug, cocky, stereotypical evil genius the entire film. Its a role thats been done a million times over and yet fanboys of this are raving about how DEEP the characters are. Please.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the action, or lack there of. Every fight scene is: Guy misses main character with right hook, MC punches him. Another guy misses MC with right hook, MC punches him. Every once in a while they stray from the dodge right hook, counter punch sequence with the occasional: guy swings delicate piece of wood at MC which shatters against wall, MC hits him with hammer. So lame.<br/><br/>I was seriously angry I wasted a couple hours watching this and even angrier that it had such a high rating on IMDb. This movie should be ridiculed for the crap that it is."

","After having suffered through the major part of this film, I finally stood up and walked out of the theater. And mark my words, that's the first time I did that. With that not said that it's the worst film I've ever seen at the cinemas, but first there are the regular bad films and then there are the films that really overwhelm you in their surprising amount of empty meaninglessness. I was apparently misled by the great praise this movie has been given here in Sweden by reviewers that I normally trust, not to mention the award in Cannes.<br/><br/>The film does not work at any level, with a possible exception for the settings and the suggestive coloring. All I could see was a repugnant protagonist that stumbles from one out-of-place and pointless scene to another, maybe he was out to have his revenge on somebody, or maybe was he just adding to the confused and weak script with his own confusing actions, it does'nt really matter since the film did'nt really communicate anything substantial at all."
"xnrat","1","82","154","6 August 2010"," Why?
","Why? That is the main question about this movie. When I watched this movie it didn't yet have its devoted followers. I just wanted to enjoy an Asian movie a friend had recommended. And as I like many Asian movies I had fairly high hopes. As you can tell by my rating of it they were disappointed.<br/><br/>Why does this movie have such a high rating? What is there that I am not seeing?<br/><br/>It starts with a nice enough premise. A guy imprisoned for 15 years with no idea to the Why? and then, after suddenly being released, trying to find out what he did to deserve it. Well, that could be something! And it could have been. But, at least to me, it seemed the script didn't quite know where to go. Instead the lack of a coherent script is covered up in lots and lots of violence. And it is quite obvious that the violence is only used for shock and awe, which doesn't make a good movie.<br/><br/>The two big twists are utter letdowns. The reason for his imprisonment is a joke. They should've gone with complete lack of reason, like in Cube. But as it is, it is just dumb. And then there is this incest theme which also seems to serve no other purpose than to shock people.<br/><br/>Maybe I am too old to just watch a movie because it is shocking. I certainly don't think a movie is good just because it is trying very hard to break as many taboos as possible.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing that sets this movie apart from many other movies. No great achievements in acting, story, script, music, cinematography. Absolutely none. Yet it receives very high ratings. I really don't understand why."
"thomas196x2000","3","140","273","15 October 2006"," This was what all the fuss was about?
","I don't go to see a lot of movies anymore, despite the fact that when younger I would see easily 5 movies a week, two or three at the movies and the same in rentals.<br/><br/>Now, I usually only go to the theaters a few times a year for something special, and when I see an interesting DVD, I just buy it, I don't rent.<br/><br/>So, somehow I came across this film when reading things online and noticed a very high Rottentomatoes.com rating. (that should have told me something right there).<br/><br/>The ""Kafkaesque"" description intrigued me. A guy wakes up in a prison, everything is controlled, and literally years go by. He is framed for his wife's murder. Why? At first, the dubbing seemed distracting, a little too ""bright"", but I got used to it. In fact, right away, you could see a lot of effort when into the camera work for this film, and the music. It was compelling.<br/><br/>The story starts to slip when the guy gets out of the prison. First, this guy is hard to look at, just kind of wacky. He refuses to listen to another man (had he just been released too???) and when that man falls to his death, it is done for comic effect. I started thinking, uh oh.<br/><br/>Next, he meets a young woman and eats a live octopus. Not clear why. Perhaps a metaphor that those with the power will consume the lives of those that they can dominate. See, I remember film school too.<br/><br/>Anyways, the absurdity of why this guy was locked up, and who is really seeking revenge on who are plot details better left unsaid, but are actually quite disgusting. In fact, this movie is nothing like what I thought it would be.<br/><br/>I thought there would be a lot of stylized action. Either the director doesn't know how to stage action, or I don't know what. There could have been a great fight sequence at the beginning with the young punks, but the camera just turns away. Later, at the ""big fight scene"", Oh fights off literally dozens of guys with sticks, armed with only a hammer. There is no fight choreography, no real action, just a slow camera track. Oh is no fighter, but somehow beats up all on-comers, often not really connecting with them but they fall over anyways. At one point he is beaten down but just keeps going in a very odd fashion.<br/><br/>At another potential fight sequence, he is simply pushed down by another gangster, and cannot even coordinate standing back up again. By this time, I knew there was not going to be too much action by this guy.<br/><br/>This is not an action film. There is plenty of blood and guts, and the ""twist ending"" comes way before the end of the film. The lead character is so degraded, he begins to degrade himself. And when his ex-best friend laughs at how silly he behaves in his self-degradation, his laughing and attitude makes no connection to what he does to himself in the elevator a few minutes later. If this is all he had to live for, why not lock the guy up again? Here are the problems I have: <br/><br/>1) At some points, Oh can kill 50 people at once; the next scene, one guy can overpower him.<br/><br/>2) What's the point of the film? Incest is OK as long as you shut up about it? <br/><br/>3) Why would OH make the choice he did at the end, knowing who the girl is? <br/><br/>4) Doesn't a normal restaurant delivery service question bringing tons of food every day to a building that has rooms and screaming coming from it? <br/><br/>5) Wouldn't you eventually die after being gassed every night? <br/><br/>6) Hypnotism has limited powers, and only on people who WANT to be hypnotized. By now, everyone over the age of 10 knows that, so what was the deal here? <br/><br/>7) I don't buy films where the good guy or the bad guy are in some way omnipotent. Or where a character has to have chosen an exact path from a whole series of variables to arrive at the outcome that the other parties--and the script...are expecting. This was the problem with films such as Arlington Road, Seven, The Game, and dozens of other titles. I believe it is a result of lazy or untalented writing.<br/><br/>8) Never, ever go see a movie that Quentin Tarantino recommends!<br/><br/>So, if you thought this film might have great action, forget it. Martial arts fighting? No. A decent story? Uh uh. Nice shots of the mountains at the end? Yes."

As I really LOVE Korean food, I hoped I could say the same about the movie hailed as the Second Coming in some circles.

Harrowing, excellent acting with the true horror not coming from guns but from a shocking personal realisation at the end of the film. Sadly, as is always the case after a mass murder, the media and the public are looking for an easy solution as to why Cho Seung-Hui murdered American students on a rampage. He was pictured in poses which the press tagged as those struck in OLDBOY but these are used by any soldier, terrorist or nutter.

"chris-2512","6","280","578","2 August 2005"," Ugh.
","I saw Old Boy on a grey market DVD about half a year ago and fell asleep during the first twenty minutes. Since then, my friends have literally been begging me to see it to the end, so this Saturday I watched it on the big screen where I had no chance of escape.<br/><br/>Boy was that a mistake. Old Boy is by turns idiotic, horrendous and senselessly violent. It lacks the glee of the most basic revenge film. Even Kill Squad did it better.<br/><br/>Old Boy simply has no point to speak of. My question is: How did the director and scriptwriter screw up a revenge thriller? <br/><br/>Old Boy is very reminiscent of Takashi Miike's far superior Ichi the Killer. The difference between Ichi and Old Boy is one of extremes. Both films revolve around extracting brutal revenge. In this film, the eponymous hero seeks vengeance for fifteen years of imprisonment in a hotel room. In Ichi, Kakihari, a Yakuza enforcer, must track down his kidnapped Boss who may or may not be dead. Both Kakihari and Old Boy use torture to achieve their ends, but in Ichi the violence is committed by such dedicated sadists that it transcends itself and becomes Dionysian. Thusly, Ichi is far more violent than Old Boy, but far more aware. In Old Boy, the violence does nothing but communicate itself as alternately grotesque and depressing. <br/><br/>The end of this film is so unbelievable that it made me wonder why they didn't just let a seven year old rewrite it. It was that bad. If you thought the end of Ichi was head-scratching, wait until you see this one. You will feel so betrayed by Old Boy's cop-out you may never want to see another South Korean film again. <br/><br/>I think the ridiculous praise this film received (Ebert and Tarantino included) happened because NO ONE was comfortable recommending Ichi. Additionally, Ichi was not distributed theatrically in Ontario (Where I live) and was for a period, even banned. <br/><br/>Ichi is a more violent, more difficult film, but it's rewards are far greater than this misdirected piece of trash. How this film ended up at Cannes is beyond me. I think it was because of the reputation of Park Chan's much better ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"".<br/><br/>Most likely, nothing I'm going to write here is going to prevent the curious from seeing this film.

"LeroyBrown-2","8","17","27","3 February 2009"," As good and disturbing as expected.
","I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.<br/><br/>The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.<br/><br/>Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.<br/><br/>It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note. <br/><br/>Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film."

The only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.<br/><br/>Now, I realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap.

If you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. Just my personal feelings I guess.

"Chris Knipp","7","97","190","11 April 2005"," Revenge: a dish best eaten live?
","In Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' (which won the grand prize at Cannes in 2004 when Tarantino was at the helm), a rough-looking man is held by the cops for some hours after a drunk. A series of relentless jump-cuts show him misbehaving at the police station. Once bailed out, he suddenly disappears in a pour-down rain while his rescuer is in a phone booth. The next we know he's imprisoned in a tiny apartment-like jail cell, and is held there for.fifteen years! Again jump cuts take us through this experience, which includes pumped-in gas while he sleeps, self-tattoos of cross-hatching to remind himself of the years, a journal, a constant TV which is his only companion, imaginary swarms of insects, and personal martial-arts conditioning that includes punching the wall till his knuckles bleed.<br/><br/>Once released, having a taste for something other than the pot-stickers he was served all the time in his prison, our man stops at a sushi bar and asks for ""something live."" He's brought an octopus as big as two fists and he gobbles it -- live -- and passes out. The female sushi chef presiding at this event bonds with the man and they go looking for whoever imprisoned him and try to find out why. I forgot a man who jumps off the roof of the prison building before this: but nobody could keep track of all the hyper-kinetic, dark, grungy contents of 'Oldboy.' It's in Korean, by the way, and if you don't know Korean you may miss a bit of the dialog. It's got those subtitles that fade when the background's light, and they flick by pretty fast too.<br/><br/>What is clear is that as somebody taunts him, Oh Dae-Su's just in a larger prison when his captors let him out, and what he does is part of a maniacal scheme to do him far worse harm than mere physical confinement.<br/><br/>What's initially endearing about this accomplished but cartoon-like revenge-mystery action film, apart from Choi Min Sik's gonzo performance as Oh Dae-Su, the imprisoned man who turns sushi freak, is its obsessiveness, which Choi's intensity neatly underlines. The troubles begin when you realize that however maniacally determined Oh Dae-Su's pursuit of his tormentor and unraveling of his imprisonment's secrets are, it's all ultimately lost on us because it makes little logical, and even less emotional, sense. Or, where it does make sense, it's patently impossible.<br/><br/>Park Chan Wook is a clever and inventive filmmaker who like many of the other 'dark,' 'cool' filmmakers of today has a visual style that outstrips his ability to tell a story. Since you could have said that about The Big Sleep and many still do, it may be that critical head-shaking over 'Oldboy' will seem passé in time and the film will morph into a classic. It's been said already though that Park is pursuing cult status faster than he can keep up with himself.<br/><br/>The encrustation of the mechanical upon the living was Bergson's definition of the comic, and by that definition this movie should be a laugh riot. There's both elaborate visual trickery and intense real physicality -- witness Oh Dae-Su's consumption of the octopus. He really bites the thing's head off and chews on the still-writhing tentacles as they nervously coil round his cheek. The martial arts sequences are tricky and complicated; I doubt that the actor is doing all his stunts like Tony Ja in 'Ong-bak: Thai Warrior,' but his physicality is down to earth as he punches out one thug after another. No jumping, just punches and falls. But the images and their sequencing are most artfully manipulated. There's a sex scene, and an erotic scene, and a torture sequence involving dental extractions.<br/><br/>How Oh Dae-Su finds people and how people find Oh Dae-Su is pretty confused. There's a vague sense that those tormenting Oh Dae-Su are evil masterminds à la James Bond. They have gangster connections and there's a posh huge penthouse at the end. But our hero seems to have been held in a kind of rent-a-jail cell, and whoever ordered up this treatment was apparently connected with something more mundane than Goldfinger: simply a schoolmate who bears Oh Dae-Su an obscure grudge. When the school enemy appears, if I've got this right, he seems to be a decade or two Oh Dae-Su's junior. Does it matter? Well, cultists of the movie will want to explain everything. But not rest of us, because the people aren't real or specific enough for us to care. Choi Min Sik's a gnarly little dynamo (his wacko behavior fits better here than it did in the artistic biography Chihwaseon) and his nemesis is a tall, cool, godlike personage. That's the point. The contrast is enough.<br/><br/>Oldboy has hints of Tarantino and Tarantino's Asian martial arts sources, but although there's a lot of dialog, as far as one can tell the talk is very far from Pulp Fiction's priceless exchanges.<br/><br/>You think the idea's unique -- imagine being locked up for fifteen years without explanation -- but then you realize it's not only what happened to Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean, but essentially what happens to a lot of black men in America, only then it isn't the beginning of a hip nightmare film. The imprisonment of black men is the real tale of society's revenge on an undeserving minority, but Oldboy's maniacal and inexplicable personal revenge of one middle class man on another has no social significance; worse yet, it never acquires an emotional one.<br/><br/>Director Park Chan Wook is a director to reckon with -- some of Oldboy's sequences are hard to forget -- and he's found a worthy star in Choi Min Sik. But this disturbing, violent movie is clever without being intelligent."

When you find out the truth at the end, you will feel very sick, I promise you. I don't know why this movie tried so hard to mimic Japanese movies.

For what?! Please stop it with the references to Oedipus Rex, Beckett, Count of Monte Christo, Hitchcock or whatever. This is a C grade exploitation film, poorly cast, poorly directed, poorly shot, poorly edited, poorly everything. It is one small step better than another waste of film that came out a few years ago which I believe was called ""Audition"" I think by a guy named Miike Tadashi. (Too lazy to check now). The amount of attention that crap got blew me away. I remember when Japanese cinema used to be acclaimed for Ozu, Oshima, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ichikawa, Teshigahara and others. Those were real filmmakers. Miike is nobody.<br/><br/>That's as far as Japan goes. Surely there must be some South Koreans who are doing better things than this Sickboy. <br/><br/>The only reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the very initial premise IS indeed interesting but is handled so incompetently and sophomorically that you might as well be watching a snuff film. In fact, if the octopus counts, it is somewhat of a snuff film. Just as violent and just as juvenile as Tarantino but without his (for lack of a better word) ""talent"".<br/><br/>Basically a completely vile and disgusting exercise that should be relegated to the cutout bin."

","Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. However before Dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. Dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love & together with her help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...<br/><br/>This South Korean production was co-written & directed by Chan-wook Park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes while it was also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well not for me it isn't since as I can't understand why it's so liked & I would go as far as to say I pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like it as I thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe Oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever I thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that I would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I didn't warm to any of the character's & while I accept Oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like.<br/><br/>Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot I was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. The actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.<br/><br/>The budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in South Korea & New Zealand. The acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute chore to sit through, I don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly but I just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005)."

Because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. He went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. I have wondered: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is way too harsh.

So, what we do finally get here is a perfect 'screen of smoke'generated in order to prevent the viewer to see what lies beneath. There is, however, one thing that I noticed which greatly reassured me: the fact that the comments of the users who disliked the movie were found useful by a far greater number of people than the comments of the people who liked it: taking this into account, we get a far more accurate perception of the general feeling of the audience, a fact which is, unfortunately not reflected in the overall user rating, a user rating which would have been significantly different and maybe have sent 'Oldboy' out of the IMDb top 250, a better deserved place.<br/><br/>So, If I have a wish , this can be summarized in four words:<br/><br/>NEXT TIME, PLEASE VOTE!!!"

","I just saw this at the Philly film festival and I was amazed at how so many people were conned into thinking this was such a great movie.

In fact the guy who introduced OLDBOY said to the anxious crowd before the lights went dark that ""OLDBOY may be the greatest movie ever made"". I must admit I almost fell for it too. It looks beautiful and the director is nothing if not innovative and technically brilliant. However the praise goes only as deep as the razor thin plot line. To say this movie is contrived is a drastic understatement. I don't want to give anything away (why? I'm not quite sure) but lets just say this: the ridiculous ending to Park's OLDBOY is on par with the likes of Shamalan's SIGNS and whoever the moron was who directed last year's abysmal SAW. Now if you were amazed by the ludicrous 11th hour revelations in those movies (although SIGNS at least was pretty good up to that point) then you probably won't feel utterly cheated and let down by OLDBOY. I found myself saying ""good God they can't be serious!"". I can't really trash the movie for too many other reasons other than the weak story and atrocious ending. Everything else was pretty good, not #92 of all time and Cannes darling good, but decent and enjoyable. I actually cared about the characters which almost never happens in movies today, and the blood and violence which others have complained about I thought was a strong point. But the story! Come on already. I'm in awe that Quentin Tarantino, who can spin a story like no other, bought into OLDBOY. Another prime example of writers managing to stink up a great premise. One more thing, Park's earlier film SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, while also no masterpiece, was far, far superior to OLDBOY in my opinion. Worth watching."

"MaximumMadness","10","13","21","17 February 2012"," Park Chan-Wook's Masterful ""Oldboy"" is a Tour-De-Force of storytelling! My favorite film of all time!
","I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""<br/><br/>Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.<br/><br/>He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.<br/><br/>Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)<br/><br/>Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.<br/><br/>The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie! <br/><br/>This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get."

I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do) speak. If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away.

This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.<br/><br/>The acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough.

Then again, maybe this film was just bad.<br/><br/>I am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.<br/><br/>And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, I was expecting something interesting to conclude it. I won't discuss the ending, because I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that the metaphor ""Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same."" cannot be used as an explanation for everything.<br/><br/>This entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only.

","This film is not bad, but does it deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all times? I think not. When rating a film the most important thing should be, what is the film giving the audience and what is the message that the director is pushing across. In this film the message is not much smarter than your average horror flick, and the only feeling you have after seeing it is disgust. That's not really a bad thing, if it has direction. In films like Seven there is and it can be summed up really easy in the last sentences from Morgan Freeman. ""The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the last part."" Because Oldboy lacks a message like this the whole film becomes an empty vessel.<br/><br/>That being say, it might be one of the best empty vessels created. The photography is stunning, the editing is clever and the acting is at most parts really good. The story is smart, but becomes a little to smart at times. It's trying too much to live up to films like Memento, Seven or even The Sixth Sense where everything is revealed in the end. First of all I wasn't that surprised, but the worst part was that I really didn't care.<br/><br/>To sum it up: good film, but not even close of being one of the 1000 best films in history."

","OK, perhaps there is truth in the saying ""lost in translation"" because I absolutely do not understand why this movie has garnered the praise it has.

There is no cohesive story line, no attempt to give the viewer any kind of clue about what is going on. You are kept in the dark the whole time, which I assume is the point. But by the time the final credits roll, you want to borrow one of the hammers used in the movie and beat yourself over the head with it to stop the pain that the film inflicts on your senses from trying to make any kind of sense of it.<br/><br/>I have since gone back and watched this film again without the dubbed soundtrack and though I still feel it is way over hyped, I do not feel it is as bad as my initial review of it above.

Let's not even talk about artistic merit. Quentin Tarantino (maker of one, perhaps two great movies and a couple of good entertainments) is the most obvious salesman for the view that pulp junk, polished up and translated by cinematic trickery and fascinated with its own pop cultural hipness, is valuable (and Tarantino was on the committee at Cannes that gave this film the Grand Jury Prize). Park steals here from some of the greats (film noir specialists like Hitchcock, absurdists like Bunuel, masters of cinema cool like Kubrick), but lacks any feeling for what made *their* movies worth seeing. Put simply, it lacks wit (unless by wit you only mean slapstick), and its ideas are like bad homilies no one understands. I keep encountering this in the newer Japanese and Korean and Hong Kong cinema that seems influenced by Tarantino: comic book themes and characters pass through high-polish celluloid/digital trickery and a ironic pop filter (all borrowed). I hear Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, which I have but still haven't been able to force myself to sit through, is much the same. Avoid."

The camera perspective, color, and musical underlining are in fact brilliant, as is most of the acting; but this is a question of taste and not to be part of a rating.<br/><br/>What actually seems to be widely misunderstood is the ""story"" or ""meaning"" of this film. Actually, the point IS that there is none; that the main character is both almighty and powerless; that both violence and appeasement lead to nothing; that all characters are one-dimensional and completely determined by their surroundings; that every twist of plot seems to come out of nowhere. This movie is plain nihilistic - there is no point in trying to change anything, as the ending is already set up by some mysterious force. Complaining about senseless violence and sex scenes is just downright stupid in this context. Life can be perceived to be just like that, and this is the perspective this film wants to offer. If it doesen't correspond with yours, I understand it must be pretty harsh on the viewer.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Maybe, reading ""La Nausee"" by Sartre (or seeing the other two pieces of the trilogy, if you opt for graphical display) will help to understand the this masterpiece. If not, well, whatever."

","Some people people have described the South Korean film OLDBOY as challenging . For me the word "" challenging "" is perhaps most associated as challenging someone to a duel . You see a man walk down the street arm in arm with a woman who is far too good for him so challenge him to a duel . You cross swords literally and kill your opponent where hopefully the woman won't want his death to be in vain so she gives you her heart and soul for all eternity . There can be nothing more romantic than disemboweling or decapitating a man over a hot chick and if you think my way of thinking is grotesque or perverse please watch this film before casting any judgment over my character <br/><br/>OLDBOY is hardly original . Its central core revolves around an anti-hero gaining revenge against someone who wronged him . This is a story influenced by the western genre , the French New Wave and New Hollywood but one suspects this type of plot has been going on since before cinema . The protagonist Dae finds himself confined to a prison of sorts for 15 years where he's occasionally gassed by "" the gas Russians use on Chechen terrorists "" . Would that be the same gas that the Spetnatz used on a Moscow theater that killed a third of the hostages they were trying to save ? Right away you're drawn to an unlikely plot hole where if Dae is getting gassed over a period of 15 years surely his captors would eventually cock up and give him a fatal dose ? The premise of being confined for 15 years might have worked better in a short film if only because we'd either see the reason for it be revealed after 10 , 15 or 20 minutes or have it left totally enigmatic . Unfortunately we have to endure another 90 minutes of nonsense <br/><br/>The director Chan Wook Park insists on alienating the audience by introducing concepts such as graphic violence such as Dae performing dental surgery on someone's mouth without him being a qualified dentist , surrealism such as a woman seeing a six foot insect sitting on a tube train and most infamously of all animal cruelty where a live octopus is eaten . Park might deserve some congratulations on staging a fight sequence with Dae and a dozen protagonists that was obviously shot in one take but is so over the top , especially considering Dae has been stuck in a cell for 15 years all credibility vanishes after the first couple of blows <br/><br/>The big revelation at the end is to be fair in keeping the rather nauseating tone of the movie - Dae's nemesis is a former schoolmate who had sex with his own sister , got her pregnant and she committed suicide when Dae found out hence the reason for his imprisonment . Some people have complained about the schoolmate appearing 20 years younger than Dae but I suppose the years of solitary confinement have taken a physical toll on Dae . But there again Dae as I said can wipe the floor with a dozen thugs so has the confinement really been bad to him physically ? On top of that why let him out after 15 years ? Why leave him there for eternity or just kill him ? <br/><br/>For a film that has a high entry in the top 250 IMDb movies list OLDBOY is bitterly disappointing . Some people will claim because it's so different then it deserves its placing . The fact is there's nothing unique about it . The plot is something Jean Luc Goddard could have come up with decades ago and the graphic violence is an everyday occurrence on the torture porn sub genre . If someone wants something really challenging then just show me your girlfriend and a pair of swords and I'll give a proper challenge"

By the end credit rolls you will find yourself speechless by how disturbing yet gorgeous the movie was and how the director intentionally leaving us some unanswered questions. <br/><br/>My only concern is that I find some of the last part a bit too cliché and sentimental for my taste but it doesn't material.<br/><br/>This is Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece and one of the best Korean movie ever made.

Once the explanation comes, it's the lamest of plot devices. Hypnotism? Give me a break! <br/><br/>As to the engine of all this revenge, it all boils down to a minor schoolyard incident? No matter how I try to suspend my disbelief I can't imagine why Woo-jin Lee didn't just go punch the young Dae Su in the eye once the rumors started rather than build a grand 25 year long revenge plan (remember, he had to wait until Dae Su grew up and got married before he could even start!).<br/><br/>Lately I've felt that many Asian films get an automatic ""pass"" from the internet community. Throw an Asian director at something, make sure it's got a good helping of blood, torture, and sadism and you've got a guaranteed internet darling.<br/><br/>I find this troubling because I've been watching Asian films for many years now, long before the advent of DVD and the popularization of the internet. People have gotten so fanboyish over any new director from Asia that they are ignoring the actual quality of the film. Place this film in the US, give it a gun toting hero instead of a knife/hammer wielding one, and people would be complaining about the massive plot holes.<br/><br/>The camera work was inspired, the score was wonderful.

","For those who haven't seen the film STOP NOW I am going to give away plot elements although if you go to the message board the ""secret"" is revealed.My biggest problem with the film is it seems to be mainly an attempt to ""gross"" people out. What difference does it make if a crazy guy is so wealthy he can torture another guy for 15 years all due to a twisted incestuous affair? Not only is that whole plot line just dumb the only reason for it is so there can be some outrageous violence involving hammers and shears. I guess for many it's better than roll out the old serial killer and have him do horrible things to his victims but when it comes right down to it the only difference is this plot is just weirder. With the popularity of Saw I foresee many more wildly ridiculous plot lines just so we can have more violent set pieces. Anyway the film lost me when the guy bites into a live octopus and stuffs it in his mouth. I'm not interested in seeing this but I guess with ""reality"" TV this is the kind of thing I have to expect. And why is this movie in DTS?

"Teebs2","7","58","126","9 June 2005"," Stylish, Violent but Empty
","Oldboy (2003) is the latest, and possibly most critically acclaimed, of a series of films to come out of Asia, which are best described as ""Extreme"". They are all very slick, stylish, violent and taboo-breaking to an almost self-conscious level. In my experience they are also all largely unsatisfying at anything other than an aesthetic level.<br/><br/>In terms of sensation and brutal violence such films as Takashi Miike's cartoon-like Ichii the Killer (2001) or the brilliant Audition (1999) are unsurpassed by any Western cinema. Oldboy comes close with much tooth-pulling, hammer battering, tongue cutting and live octopus eating, but nothing which quite matches the sadistic, absurd violence in Miike's films.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why Oldboy won many people over, including Tarantino at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, as it is an effortlessly slick, stylish film with many technically accomplished scenes and flashes of CGI-enhanced imagery. Unfortunately, it's narrative is far less satisfying, and no amount of violence or visual trickery can disguise this fact. At best, the motivation for Oh Dae-Su's 15 year imprisonment is coherent, but taken to unbelievable psychopathic extremes. As in many of these extreme Asian films, the film provokes a visceral reaction, but it is narratively, and consequently emotionally, hollow. Worth seeing for fans of the genre, though if you're looking only for violence and gore there are many more Asian films which surpass this."

","I feel people somehow invariably overreact when it comes to this movie. Come on guys, it's just a movie, like it or leave it. It's not necessarily a 10 but neither does it deserve a 1. (For what it's worth, I gave it a 7.) How would I explain this split opinion? It depends very much on what one expects from it, as well as on the overreaction of some viewers who feel, perhaps rightly so, that the movie is way overrated on IMDb, so they feel like they have to overreact the other way, giving it a 1, while this movie is most certainly deserving of much more than 1 !<br/><br/>What would be my unadulterated view on the movie itself? It's not as bad as some posters write. At least one should acknowledge some very good camera-work and naturalist honesty in projecting a certain darkness that resides at the bottom of human souls. The main actor does a good job in most of the movie, I think, but the script gives him no chance but to overdo things toward the end, in hysterical tones which can easily grate on the educated movie lover's nerves.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I cannot understand for the life of me how such a movie made it so high on the IMDb rating system. It's really unbelievable how that could happen. Some viewers all over the world liked the movie but that still does not explain it. Perhaps the pride of some viewers couched in the same culture made them vote en masse with automatic 10's? Hard to tell.<br/><br/>Back to the movie now. I would say that within its own rather cheap genre (""B"" movie), Oldboy is an exceptional production, more attentively scripted, shot and acted than most. There is occasionally some really memorable touch in there, the trace of the hand of a professional (even if you may find the general tone of the movie gross and overboard). On the other hand, compared with most other movies that share comparable ratings, Oldboy seems to be woefully lacking in both substantial and stylistic qualities that would qualify it for such an unlikely honor. There are literally hundreds of 7 to 8 rated movies which are undoubtedly better than this one.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this type of ""B"" (from bloody but not only (-:) revenge movie _anyway_ (the ""country relative"" of the ""film noir"" genre), Oldboy will probably not disappoint you. If you expect to watch some kind of unqualified masterpiece, and you have the cinematic culture to understand what that really means, you might (and, I repeat, might) ask for your money back in anger.

","This film has no soul. Thats my main problem with the film really. It has no soul. Sure the film looks fantastic, sure it supposedly deals with the often popular and heady subject of revenge in a brash, bold way but it does it in a way that is needlessly gratuitous and wholly sensational. The long, side-scrolling fight scene which is very striking and original is entirely unnecessary and drawn out. A clear cut case of style over substance, which is apparent throughout most of this film. And it suffers heavily from a certain style of writing that seems to be symptomatic of substandard east Asian filmmakers. The idea that drama and powerful film-making are the result of a cumulative effect. That is, if you add enough elements that are recognisably powerful and dramatic, you will end up with a powerful, dramatic film. For example, suicide is very striking and powerful, revenge is dramatic, unrequited love is dramatic, a character unable of feeling human emotions is a powerful statement. The problem is that this film amongst other Asian films (eg. hero, Samaritan girl) tries to imitate truly powerful films, without an understanding of what made those films powerful in the first place, thus creating a dramatic atmosphere by carelessly throwing all these features together without the slightest care for how it effects the characters that it subjects these ""dramatic"" events to. What you are left with are alien characters, that no human being can possibly relate to or comprehend, that have no soul of their own, but are merely devices, allegories and playthings of the sensational directors that use them. In short what you have here, in this highly praised and touted film is the tyranny of plot over character and ultimately the death of character."

","Oldboy is a Korean film, so it has the Hong Kong feel, but there's something different to it as well. There is a feel of film noir, but it's also got quirky humor and the obligatory kung fu scenes (although not extended). The story begins with the protagonist being abducted and imprisoned for 15 years. When he gets out, he must follow the clues to find out why he was there. Things get really weird and really twisted.<br/><br/>What I thought about it: I really can't say anything about the over-dubbing that was sub-par because it's to be expected from foreign films. Of course when I turned on the subtitles, it didn't match the dialog - it seems as if the subtitles was a direct translation and the dubbing was a cultural equivalent with artistic freedom. It distracted me, so I turned it off. The acting might have been believable in Korean, but without actually hearing the actors' voices it was laughably bad - like some of the people you see on American Idol who put too much into their singing where it sounds ridiculous and not natural at all. The dialog and soliloquy were filled with pop-culture hackery. ""Laugh and the world laughs with you..."" and other stolen lines repeated ad nauseam trying to fill the story with philosophy, yet ultimately adding nothing to the story artistically or dramatically. Of course the twists, turns and revelations are all pretty original, yet it ends with the dreaded deus ex machina.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this isn't a movie I'd necessarily recommend to anyone unless you're interested in foreign films, Korean camp, or if you like movies that take you one way to throw you another when it all fits together."

For the whole last hour the viewer is bombarded with illogical plot devices, twists that have no real meaning either to plot or as a parable to the viewer, all stables of Manga, that do not translate well to film. Asian cinema does not like to paint characters with the sides of good and bad. The heroes are sometimes worse than the villains, they usually have something seriously wrong with them, either mentally or morally. <br/><br/>Many of the criticisms regarding this film come from viewers who are blinded by the conventions of Western Cinema. I was not expecting it to be a conventional film, where revenge is reaped with no sacrifice to the protagonist. I was expecting destruction and madness. The conclusion however is neither of those.

One of the most incredible performances ever by Choi (the acting all around is spectacular, but he stands out above the rest), great directing, the corridor scene is just pure glee, one of the most ingenious plots and story line twists of all time, and believe it or not, the movie is extremely funny in some parts (the whole, ""now let me tell you my story"" part is hilarious, just to name one example). However what really shows the quality of OldBoy is that it's not just a excellent conglomerate of all those things that make a movie good, it was how it affected you. OldBoy is a extremely deep and psychological movie on the level as well as the carnal level, and it gets better every time you see it. If you think you can handle the content, and don't mind subtitles, then this film is a absolute must see. Overall, this is quite possibly the best revenge drama of all time."

","There's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. Forced acting. Forced takes. Forced plot. Even forced photography. There's people who say ""the movie develops that way because it's from Asia"" but I don't see any kind of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.In a more personal way, I just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. It just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click."

"Mersault2112","10","5","7","1 July 2018"," This movie is incredible.
","Oldeuboi is currently, and has been for a while now, my favorite movie. Min-sik Choi plays his role flawlessly. This movie promises you an exciting experience right off the bat, and then entirely over-delivers and becomes something much more than you expected going into it. <br/><br/>You name it, this movie does it incredibly well. The cinematography is nothing short of artistic. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting and very emotional. The writing and storytelling are the best I've ever seen, and call back to classic tragedies and the tragic hero. I find that American audiences generally don't like this movie much because of it's nontraditional storytelling and ending. If you're interested in something you won't ever get out of an American movie, this will deliver. And don't worry about being bored, because not a second of the runtime of this movie is wasted. There is always either action happening on screen, plot being developed, or cinematography being shown off. Most of the time all at once. Even if you don't like drama, or don't like international movies, it can be appreciated for so many different things that everyone will find something to love about it. The fight scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen, and aren't even one of the main reasons why I love this movie. If you aren't very open to stories that are nontraditional or something you're not used to seeing in the West, you might take issue with this movie, to which I'd say you need to open up some more, because you're missing out on a great experience.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, Min-sik Choi is an incredible actor, and after watching Oldeuboi I watched two of his other films, ""I Saw the Devil"" and ""Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time"", both of which are incredible films that I suggest you go watch if you liked Oldeuboi or are interested in Korean cinema but want something other than Oldeuboi. Min-sik Choi delivers an almost, but not quite as amazing performance in both of those movies. Oldeuboi itself is a great dive into Korean cinema and what it has to offer. Watch this movie if you get the chance."
"stargazer-lea","10","9","15","19 February 2012"," A great intro to Asian Cinema!
","As a fan of Manga and Anime, it was only natural to give Asian cinema a go. Oldboy has been tossed around in conversation and articles and compared to numerous new Korean movies on a forum I frequent. So, I thought well, why not! The story is about Oh Dae-Su, a delinquent husband and father who we can tell is useless, a drunk. In the first scene we see him in a police station acting the fool. He is kidnapped and held against his will in an unknown location with nothing but a TV to keep him up to date with life on the outside world. Suddenly, 15 years after his incarceration, he is released. He is given 5 days, enough money to see him through and a cell to find out why he was kidnapped and by who.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic but with lots of twists and turns along the way. A slow burner to say the least. However, it doesn't feel like a long slow film. The slow scenes are broken up by action sequences which are thrilling and stunningly presented. The story is completely mesmerising. The discomfort with certain scenes is perfectly balanced with entertainment and the conclusion was so well thought out that the realisation fills you with a sense of disgust visually and mentally. The characters are brilliant. I believed every single one of them.<br/><br/>If I was to nit pick I'd say sometimes the colours and lighting was a bit too dark.<br/><br/>I advise even people who dislike Asian cinema to at least give Oldboy a go. The story is that good I forgot I was even reading the whole time. It became second nature. It is the perfect film for a newbie to foreign films. The dialogue is paced well enough that it's easy to keep up with.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes horror, shock cinema, foreign films or thrillers."
"zubdog","4","46","103","31 December 2006"," Not worth all the hype
","I am incredibly confused about how Oldboy managed to make IMDb's top 250. While the basic premise is promising, the plot is contrived and really doesn't make a lot of sense to me. The violence is grotesque, the cinematography is amateur and the choreography of action sequences reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic video. Furthermore the ""values"" expressed in this film just don't seem to transfer to Western culture at all<br/><br/>On the positive side other than the action scenes, Min-sik Choi does a good job with what he has to work with. He makes Oh Dae-Su's transformation from a mild-mannered businessman into a vengeful thug as believable as possible."
"heybradc","9","7","11","29 September 2011"," There are two ways to view it
","There are two ways to take this movie. You could take it as a total cheese fest that deals with uncomfortable subjects (incest) and completely ridiculous claims to the common people (hypnosis). For me however I took both of these subjects and accepted them within the movies universe because I like to feel apart of it. I got past the parts that seemed a little to far fetched (shadow boxing only for fifteen years and becoming an incredible fighter) and I found an amazing film. <br/><br/>It's beautiful. Every shot explains what is happening, it doesn't just serve as something to view as audio plays over it. When Oh Dae Sou is practically losing his mind at the end the camera is shaky and you feel just as confused and mixed up and completely unsure of what to say as he does (fun fact that scene was completely ad libbed even the song). When he is released and is walking out of the building as the lady complains about her sunglasses you see the camera in control and facing the front of him. And even as the man jumps and lands on the car (dog and all) The camera still shows his front view with everything else happening in the background. This shows he is in control, he knows what he is after and doesn't care who or how many people with blunt objects (and surprisingly no fire arms) stand in his hallway. Don't even get me started on the incredible hall way fight scene. It's one of the most realistic I've seen. I think they really just got a bunch of random joe's (or chins) off the street and said, ""here takes these sticks of plywood and go beat up this guy in there because he just raped twenty babies and I'll give whoever hurts him the most 100 dollars. Also if he says who has AB blood you, you, and you raise your hand okay? Good! Now get in there and do some damage! *smacks first random chins ass as he goes into the elevator).<br/><br/>The acting and character development is incredible. You really feel for oh dae sou and then you hate him. The whole time you feel sympathy for a man stripped of fifteen years of his life through his actions and his seldom behavior. When he turns into the raging Asian I actually feel a little scared he's not gonna take that hammer and bash through the screen and pull out fifteen of my teeth. You can feel the tension in the air when he firsts meets the antagonist. Then you find out he was just a total prick in high school just like everyone else. You even start to feel bad for the antagonist because of how much mercy he has and actually how much of a better person he is even though his last little move with the laser point was a little bit of a dick move. How often does the antagonist cry because of how bad he treated the protagonist? Since when does that happen? I thought I was supposed to hate the antagonist no matter what and have nothing redeemable about him. (waterworld, star wars, jason vorhees).<br/><br/>The revenge aspect is also the best I've seen. It inceptions you and give you a revenge plot within a revenge plot. It makes you feel that the protagonist and the antagonist all got what they deserved in the end. Mostly revenge plots go with little to psychological, mental, or role switching obstacles besides epic confrontations, injuries they must overcome, and a little bit of hostage negotiation (kill bill *love it*, faster *shudder*). Nothings wrong with it besides the fact that it's just not clever. You know stuff will go down but with Oldboy stuff doesn't just go down it goes up, sideways, diagonal, backwards, forwards, and a full fledged loopy loop where they drop you off at the top to try and decide where to go or which character to feel for.<br/><br/>In the end you find an incredible film with an incredible story and probably the most fantastic endings of all time. I'm trying to search my brain right now in the five minutes it took me to type this for a better movie but I can't find one. I even typed best movie ending in on google and the one I found wasn't' nearly as good! If you can look past the somewhat ridiculous claims it makes it might just become your favorite film."
"phunkysquirrel-1","10","7","11","5 December 2008"," Epic Movie of the Greeks with Direction alike to France's Best
","Imagine a Greek epic with a french director with scene transitions as good as seen in the City of Lost Children then you'll find this movie right up your street. The direction and characters are surreal as they are believable. The film is shot with subtle use of filters and really has no heroes. Everyone is in jeopardy! The film asks.. what is intent, how far do we take it ourselves and with that, how can we live with ourselves. Is there any more to live for? With extremes this beautifully shot movie takes us on a journey of redemption and condemnation! With this passion the director takes you on a journey of intrigue.. why was he locked up for years, who has done this.. what does he want. Then the movie twists.<br/><br/>This movie tries moral dilemmas to their limit. Indeed the director has now completed 3 movies focused around vengeance. This bar far is my favourite and his most complex work in his trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie however goes into another realm of ethical greyness. It touches in taboo areas associated with love and their eventual resolution. The movie's ending will leave you with this is the happiest ending or the sickest one.<br/><br/>Most people I know have thought this is a sick and twisted movie. I believe that only when we have seen ugliness can we really appreciate the foundation of the life we choose to lead, and accept its consequences! <br/><br/>++++ SPOILER TO END +++++ <br/><br/>There's one inconsistency in the movie, when the protagonist is stabbed his wound seems to move about on his back! One aspect which the best review to date has missed is that of intention. The scene before the finale a few seconds of tape is played. This details that a certain person was aware of a situation, ""you didn't know that""...<br/><br/>So his daughter knew that it was her father = although it is not explained how she knew this.<br/><br/>At the end, there's only one pair of foot prints in the snow. I don't know if this is open to interpretation but maybe it asks.. was there really someone else there? Did he need someone else?"
"Tubular_Bell","3","17","33","11 January 2011"," Never such abysmal content has been presented with such brilliant style
","If you've watched a few films off the Saw franchise, you probably know what it is to watch a ""torture porn"" film with a completely ludicrous, ridiculous story, with a style ripped-off from awful MTV videos. Oldboy is exactly like that, with the difference that the style is actually brilliant and gorgeous beyond words. But what's the use of great cinematography, mood and beautiful imagery when its sole point is to deliver a story like this? I have NEVER seen a story so richly pointless, absurd and unrewarding. Yeah, I can deal with films that make ""no sense"", that have ""no meaning"" or things like that; sometimes that's what the director is going for. But the trouble here is that you, as a viewer, is supposed to RELATE to this story, to feel attached to it, as if it could be actually happening. You're intended to connect with the protagonist, or something like that, and that is simply unimaginable. The story is written with the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, and that's ALL there is to it. Trust me: the twists and surprises along the way will give you no reward whatsoever, it's just there to shock and disturb you. And if you want to be shocked and disturbed, why not go watch films that address TRULY shocking and disturbing things that are happening around the world, instead of a stupid ""torture porn"" fantasy of a filmmaker? Yeah, Oldboy is not ""torture porn"" in the same strict sense as Saw and Hostel, but in the end, that's pretty much what's going on. And actually, it is doubly so: not only the characters are being tortured, but so is the audience. Ignore the hype and leave this Asiatic garbage aside. No, the beautiful cinematography is NOT worth it."
"zarplex2003","6","20","40","20 April 2007"," Way Over-hyped
","I thought this was possibly one of the stupidest, most melodramatic, over hyped movies ever recommended to me. First of all, I'll admit that I don't like the movie Se7en. If you DO like Se7en, then you may like Oldboy. However, I DO like David Fincher. In particular I like his use of still imagery, high contrasting colors, etc. This director borrowed a lot from that. I also like the scenes where the main character is stuck inside a prison for 15 years without explanation. However, when I learned at the end that he was put into the prison because an arch-rival of his wanted to go to an excruciating extent to seek revenge on him for what I thought was the most ridiculous reason, I was so ticked off. First of all, his arch rival dropped his sister off the bridge, okay? She could've lived, but he was being such a drama queen and decided to drop her off the bridge because she was being such a drama queen. And why was she being such a drama queen? Because the main character started a rumor that she slept with his arch-rival (that is, they had incest). So his arch rival killed his sister because he was being a drama queen because she was being a drama queen. And after he did that, he apparently thought it was worth sticking the main character into prison for 15 years and tricking him into sleeping with his daughter. How does the main character react when he finds this out? He apologizes in the most melodramatic way and proceeds to cut his tongue out. Uhmmm... he already slept with his daughter, I don't know why he felt it was worth getting his arch rival's apology so bad that he felt he had to cut his tongue out to get it. Also, they connect the main character eating a live squid with his arch rivals very well thought out plan to get him to sleep with his daughter. That was such a stupid attempt at trying to make everything have meaning within this movie. Why couldn't he have just felt like eating a live squid? I would've liked that better. I felt like the director just wanted to throw a lot of things that he felt were cool all together even though the main storyline is SO STUPID!!! And apparently people liked this SO MUCH that they're making a remake of this movie for the U.S. RARRRR!!! Well, now that I'm done venting my frustrations, I did like everything with the movie until they actually tried to make a pathetic excuse for a plot out of it. I wish there could've been a much better story as to why he was in prison for 15 years because that part was cool. But I just think the director was trying to do things because they were cool, not because it would actually be good when it was all put together. Editing is good. Production is good. Acting is good. I can't remember the music, lol. But I'm not interested in watching it again to critique it. Directing was good. Cinematography was good. But come up with a better plot please. For these reasons I think it deserves a 6/10. I think a less produced movie with more thought put into the storyline would've been WAY better. I'm already used to seeing Hollywood churn out overproduced movies. These things don't impress me."
"Kickstand_911","7","31","67","23 December 2006"," Movie, not very good
","I gave this movie a 7/10 because for me it was very original and I have not seen a whole lot like it before. That being said being different does not make it good. Being Korean and subtitled does not make it good either. Here are some problems that I had with the movie.<br/><br/>1. The actors are not very good. I did watch the subtitled version because that is the way you ""need"" to watch a foreign film, but the acting was still very deliberate and over the top.<br/><br/>2. The entire plot ""revenge"" was based on a false blame the anti-hero places on the hero. He knows what he did was wrong, and he knows he killed his sister but he takes it out on someone else in such a deliberate time consuming manner.<br/><br/>3. Why does Dae Su keep tunneling out of his ""prison"". Every time he attempts to kill himself the gas comes in and he is saved. Does he honestly think he can escape? That is insane.<br/><br/>4. Keep hypnotizing people to do what you would like them to do. This would make any movie more interesting, but is very unrealistic. Why doesn't any villain just hipnotize his nemesis into destroying himself. It is a simplistic way to arrange the events of the film into a desired manner.<br/><br/>5. How many Asian people are there in the world? Why are they all sleeping with their relatives? I for one am all for a remake. The main reason I am pro-remake in this case is because I feel that the acting was so poor in the first. They do it with Asian actors again for all care, it does not have to be an American re-make, however the acting needs to be much better."
"xkenjisanx","10","19","38","18 June 2007"," Dark and beautiful. I loved it
","First and foremost, I loved this movie. It had me glued to the screen and when it was over I felt satisfied and passionate, so much so that I decided to write this review. What I love about this movie is its darkness and how certain scenes, like when he is turning the pages of the photo album, just make your stomach drop.<br/><br/>Second, I really cannot believe the amount of people that dismiss this movie because of its violence. It just doesn't make sense to me. The only violent parts in the movie are the teeth pulling, the corridor fight, and the tongue cutting. I have seen much more violence in other films that have not been bashed this badly. And as for the octopus, I can understand how that would bring up some issues in the US and other countries but I think it would probably be considered even humorous in some Asian countries. I once saw a man bite the head of a snake off on the discovery channel but I didn't hear anything about that the next day. I actually liked the octopus scene, although it wasn't vital to the storyline, it was just very interesting to watch. I'm sure someone will, or has, come up with some type of symbolism for this scene, whether realistic or far-fetched.<br/><br/>I think what turns people off from this movie is the theme of incest or they simply didn't understand, and claim that the message of the film is to ""keep your mouth shut."" In my opinion this film was about blind love. Woo-jin Lee fell in love with his sister, society immediately disagrees and his sister is led into suicide. He then devises a master plan (very unrealistic but entertaining) to teach Oh Dae-su his feeling for his sister by tricking him into falling romantically in love with his own daughter. We see how Dae-su actually empathizes with Woo-jin Lee (even though attempting to kill him on more than one occasion) by wanting to be brainwashed at the end so he can continue his love with his daughter. By doing so he is showing that he actually wants to be in love knowing that she is his daughter, however, without having the pressures of society weighing over him. He fell in love with her, just as Woo-jin Lee fell in love with his sister. The only difference is that Woo-jin Lee knew it was his sister and Dae-su did not know it was his daughter. The reason why the relationship between Dae-su and his daughter actually works out in the end is because Mi-do is unaware and Dae-su is brainwashed, so society cannot judge them as the catholic school children judged Woo-jin Lee. This film could take another theme with the same message dealing with different social classes, races, or other things that society looks down on in relationships, but it would definitely not have the same impact as a taboo subject such as incest.<br/><br/>This is simply my take on the movie, everyone takes something different out of art, don't let anyone else define what you perceive.<br/><br/>P.S. - I do not agree with incest, it's a movie, the message is its beauty."

","** contains spoilers ** We can call formulaic a movie which develops according to a well-established, consecrated and successful formula and obey some kind of narrative pattern. It can be a good rendering or version of the established formula or a bad one. In either case, it lacks originality. The logical corollary is that any formula, no matter how brilliant and awe-inspiring it may be, is prone to be depleted sooner or later. When you sit through a movie and you find it disturbingly boring without knowing the reason, it may well be the case that you've seen it before  one, twice or a dozen times. That's exactly the problem with 'oldboy': from Freud's works and Kafka's Process to Angel Heart, Memento or Spider, we've already seen or read way too many stories about someone who's trapped in a mysterious plot without knowing why, forgets a good deal about his life and then goes to hell in order to discover what's going on with him  just to find out in the end that the big secret lies in his own past, usually a dirty or tormented past which has been done away with by the character's harried mind. What changes from a movie to another - apart from the camera work and all the formal qualities which a movie may or not possess  is the past dirtiness: a murder, a rape, an incestuous relationship.

After he is finally released, he tries to find out who imprisoned him and what their motives are. The first part of the movie is very good. The plot is a little bizarre but you simply want to know what is going on. Once the puzzle start coming together, things are falling apart. The movie may still work for some as a morality tale, but those who desire at least a little bit of realism (and the first half of the movie certainly encourages this expectation) will be sorely disappointed. This is certainly not the first movie that uses hypnotism as a cheap and highly unrealistic plot device for mind control, but in the 21st century one should expect the authors to know better.

I did not like it because I thought it took away from the continuity of the movie and its straightforwardness.<br/><br/>When I said the plot is too complicated I meant not only that but also that its a very unrealistic plot in which characters do not act the way, I think, people would act in real life. Its just dumb sometimes.<br/><br/>There is also a pretty tasteless sex scene that is just painful to look at.<br/><br/>I feel like this movie is intentionally glamorized by the director and does not reflect real human emotions. I feel like he was copying Fight Club or similar movies made in the west."

","This movie was highly regarded and I was expecting to see something unique and appealing. Unique - yes.

Why oh why did the main character cut his own tongue off and bark like a dog? Was 15 years not enough? Everyone has spread rumors. The guy's sister was a psycho. She killed herself because she was nuts. Not because of the rumor. She was the one having sex with her brother in the first place, so you knew a screw was loose in the first place. She was bound to kill herself, rumor or not. If this movie was made by someone with a brain, the main character would have beat down the incestuous brother after he found out that he was screwing his own daughter due to 15 years of hypnosis ordered by the sister-screwer.<br/><br/>The reaction of cutting out his own tongue is a unique one because 99.99999% of people wouldn't have done that in that situation. Most people would have been like, ""What is wrong with you, you psychotic sister screwer? You lock me up for 15 years and hypnotize me to screw my own daughter as revenge for a piddly high school rumor? Seriously?"" And then you would have beat him down into the ground, pulled out his teeth and thrown him out of the window. It would have been a much better ending to an overdone and overly gory (this is coming from someone who likes Saw movies) movie. I know I'm not the only one to think this because the other people watching the movie with me completely agreed that the main character was stupid for cutting out his tongue and barking like a dog."

","An alcoholic father and husband is captured and kept in captivity during 15 years without knowing why. When he gets out, he's hell-bent on revenge and discovering why he was imprisoned. This is a powerful movie with strong dramatic performances. It's intense and constantly keeps you on your toes. The story is amazing and full of twists and turns until the very end. Speaking of twists, the film is a bit twisted in itself by the themes it portrays. It does make us question what is moral and acceptable in revenge. The directing is bold and inventive.<br/><br/>There's a long fight scene without cuts in a corridor that's practically an anthology piece. Other memorable moments involve teeth and a tongue. Notice how the director often plays with our expectations showing relatively little but creeping us out nevertheless. The story also plays with our perceptions of the characters, making them more or less sympathetic. The main character has quite the character arc transformation, completely changing physically and psychologically during the course while keeping the viewer on edge because he's a bit unstable... So, it's overall quite fascinating, intellectually stimulating, viscerally gripping, and heartily recommended provided you don't expect a simple, typical revenge movie and you keep an open mind.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 out 10 (remarkable)"

","This movie let me down. I'd read promising reviews for it online and actually found it in the 'employee picks' section of the rental store. I'd already seen Park's ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", so I had an idea of what I was getting into. Oldboy is better, but not by much.<br/><br/>The graphic violence seemed cheap and unoriginal. I think the movie tries not-quite successfully to be shocking in the same way Miike's ""Ichi the Killer"" was. Actually, some of the best scenes in ""Oldboy"" (e.g. the penthouse one) reuse elements from ""Ichi"", which is a better movie that came out 2 years earlier (2001).<br/><br/>The story has an original twist I didn't see coming. That may have been because I nearly fell asleep before the surprise was revealed. The plot beckons back to events that happened in high school (the title 'Oldboy' = 'alumni'); this was a mild detractor for me since 'high school drama' strikes me as trite. If you can stomach high school awkwardness and are already reading subtitles anyway, you might be better served by 'Battle Royale'. I'm told Park's ""Joint Security Area"" is nothing like ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" and ""Oldboy"", which means there is still a fair chance I'll check it out."

","Oldboy, is a Korean film although it is dubbed into English. The film is about a man named Oh Dae-Su, who is kidnapped and locked in a private prison for fifteen years.

Oldboy, has good performances from everybody in the cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction. The film starts off with a very interesting premise and the visual look of the film is great but the story seems to go downhill as the movie moves along. One of the big problems I had with this movie is that I had a really hard time understanding it and I found it very confusing and muddled. When the movie finally got near it's ending time I found the film too long and it got boring and I felt like it could have ended a lot sooner. Also in some ways the movie was kind of pointless to me and it really left no impact. I thought I would like this film quite a bit because of very good reviews it has received and some recommendations I have gotten for the film but other than it's visual style the movie did nothing for me.

","Just saw it, and it didn't bore me a single second. Still a bit of counterpoint to the raves here might be in order (though a couple of others have done so already). The visuals were great, the acting top of the top-shelf, and the premise very promising. But maybe just a bit too promising.<br/><br/>The basic idea is great in its claustrophobic simplicity : locked away, but why and by whom? The plot does not follow the usual developments, i.e. you soon know by whom. This in itself is not a problem, but the thing is that the plot from then on becomes a warm-up for the twist. Now I don't care much about twists anymore. Building up the suspense... like listening to a romantic symphony ending (often lasts 5 full minutes). As a consequence, the final ""kabam!"" (finding out that you f***ed your daughter) comes a bit as ""so what?"" because at that point the style has taken over from the story. At a point you stop caring about the characters. Why? because you don't get a clear view of how he is still caring about his daughter before the revelation; because the flashbacks are too superficial to feel what the characters then must have felt - the final one is over-pathetic.<br/><br/>Still I thought the last twist was the better one, and hardly anyone talks about that one! Because it refocuses on the film's main theme, which is not so much revenge as the nature and use(ful)(les)ness of memory. The whole idea was for the brother and sister to commit suicide together! As she says ""if you're afraid, just let me go"" - and he does chicken out and lets her go (although very unwillingly). So at this point he realises that he too has played a role, not so much of letting her go, but of chickening out on his sister in the final hour. The fact that the main character cuts his tongue off for his daughter kind of confronts him with what he himself couldn't... I guess...<br/><br/>I guess, because the final monologue in the penthouse is rather confusing and doesn't seem to do justice to the build-up of the movie. A little bit of moderation would have done miracles. The emotions of the characters jump around so much that the twist drowns in it, and the grand finale, despite being somewhat unpredictable comes off as something you knew all along, nothing special.<br/><br/>But all this aside, it is among the better revenge movies with a memory-thing (what do these asians have with memory?!)... still could have been much better had style & form not gotten the better of the story development in the end.<br/><br/>If you need an additional push to go see, know that Hye-jeong Kang is one of those exceptionally beautiful women that only Leonard Cohen can say something reasonable about.

What you see is the story of Dae-su, who has lost everything he had, deprived of his freedom for fifteen years and naturally wants revenge against whoever is responsible for everything he went through. On the other hand you see the ''bad guy'' behind the Dae-su's imprisonment, another complex character who has his own understandable reasons for what he did. And we have a girl caught in the middle of the pandemonium. While everyone thinks that this film is about the twist, I can assure you there is way more than that. Everything about the story does make sense, and without any plot holes (which is a huge plus).<br/><br/>I can write about the stylish camerawork done in the most Park Chan-wook way possible, but that has also been mentioned. The smooth and colorful cinetography that makes you feel every second of it like you are there inside the film, surreal sequences to explore the emotional states of certain characters and action direction which plays a rather small but important part.

Despite knowing all there is to know about this film, I can watch it over and over again, it never gets boring. I can use all the fancy words I know to glamorize this film but my words will be just another pack of praise words among a million others, and that is a good thing.

"Jacques98","1","23","54","26 September 2008"," I give up. Trying to show people how cheesy/unoriginal this movie is can't be done.
","Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.<br/><br/>Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. I'll never understand how critics can trash a Hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like Oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. Regardless, Oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *Spoilers* Man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *End spoilers* Simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? No. What it means overdone plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it as well. Why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? That brings up the issue of blood/gore. Simply put, it isn't there. The director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something ""gory"" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard Oldboy called the ""most brutal movie of all time"" and ""the most disturbing movie ever"" but when I watched it I failed to see ANYTHING even remotely gory or disturbing. All the ""gore"" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why this even got an R-rating confuses me, much less ""the most brutal movie of all time"". Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.<br/><br/>The other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. The majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic American Pie-style, but I'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? When he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad Asian mix of the cheesiest James Bond villain mixed with something out of Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. Seriously, Oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .<br/><br/>In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. It's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the ""films"" (never ""movies"") they enjoy are.<br/><br/>To those people all I can say is this: I like ""films"" and also like ""movies"". I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. But the thing is, for me to like both ""films"" and ""movies"", they have to be original. They have to be something I haven't seen so many times I lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. When something isn't original, it's expendable. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. Before you give Oldboy yet another perfect rating because it ""touched"" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? I just wish someone other than me would understand this.<br/><br/>Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.<br/><br/>1/10"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","42","108","17 October 2004"," Revenge + x = Old Boy
","Spoilers Warning !!!  comments below are ONLY for the eyes of those who have seen the movie<br/><br/>Let's start with the story line. The hook: Why would any one want to imprison OH Dae-su for 15 years? The twist: The 15 years of imprisonment is itself not the revenge, but only the necessary prerequisite to the real revenge. There are actually a couple of clues which we might have noticed had we not been so overwhelmed by the powerful visual images. The 'prison' in which Oh has been kept is reasonably decent, with even a television to keep the prisoner occupied and informed of what's happening in the outside world. It tells us that the captor wants to keep Oh in reasonable shape for the release. If Oh had killed himself in prison, or come out a completely irreparable wreck, the revenge would not have been as sweet. The other clue is just the length of time of the imprisonment. Quite obviously, the captor is waiting for something to happen, and 'something' this takes 15 years. Had we time to think, it would not be too difficult to guess.<br/><br/>Even if you had not read or heard anything about the movie before watching it, you would know right from the start that it's about revenge. The twist, which comes about mid-way through the movie, is that the hunter is in fact the hunted. As Oh is furiously seeking revenge, the revenge ON HIM is far from being over. The other variable in the formula in my summary line, represented by an 'x' in the summary line, is incest.<br/><br/>If there is such a thing as man-made poetic justice in revenge, you'll be hard pressed to find one as perfect as that in Old Boy. LEE Woo-jin's tragedy is caused by Oh's telling of the former's incest. This drove Lee's sister to suicide, resulting in Lee's gnawing hatred for Oh. So deep is the hatred that Lee waited 15 years for Oh's daughter to grow up so that he could pay back in kind, engineering incest between Lee and his daughter. While comments in IMDb almost unanimously praised the ingenious plot, there is one dissenting voice which, viewed objectively, make some sense. Somewhat simplified, this argument is that after the 15 years' ordeal, Oh has emerged hardened and unconventional, and therefore should not be as devastatingly vulnerable to the final revelation. One could of course argue that the vulnerability is rooted in Oh's absolute devotion to his daughter. An interesting debate, this is. <br/><br/>With hindsight, I could also suggest a further twist: Mi-do need not really be Oh's daughter. In fact it makes more sense that she is not. Why would Lee need to go through all the trouble? Why not simply kill the daughter together with the mother, but make sure that the body of the daughter is not found so that she'll be just mysteriously missing? Find any girl to play the role 15 years later and Oh wouldn't be any wiser. Director PARK Chan-wook would undoubtedly have thought of this too, and could easily counter it by introducing something like a birthmark for identification. But he didn't bother because too much detail would take away from the brutal, raw impact of the revelation. Too much nitpicking of the plot often means missing the point entirely. <br/><br/>So much for the story line, and now to the motion picture. It's generally agreed that director Park painstakingly planned and executed every shot, every sequence. While the focus has been on the hard brutality, there is actually also quiet subtlety, kind of both Yang and Yin, in Old Boy. Of the plenty of examples of the former (Yang), the one almost everybody talks about is the 'hammer' scene. Within this long, drawn-out brawl, which incidentally is just as rich in black humor as is hard-hitting violence, the most ingenious is the scene showing a horizontal assemblage of the goons on the left and the solitary defiance of Oh on the right of the screen. I don't remember seeing anything so wickedly clever before. As to the Yin elements, consider the scene in the hidden attic of the high school, in which the two high school kids explore and tease each other in a sexual overture. Quite unlike the steaming sexual scene between Oh and Mi-do, this one is tantalizingly erotic. <br/><br/>I've only seen one other film directed by Park, Joint Security Area (or 'JSA') (2000), an excellent piece of work, powerful, mainstream. It seems that pursuing the theme of vengeance in his movie-making, Park has embarked into cult films, with obvious successes as Old Boy which brought home Grand Prix from Cannes. I first saw Choi Min-sik (playing Oh) in a supporting role in Korean spy thriller Swiri (or Shiri) (1999), my first ever Korean movie. Then, he really impressed me with Happy End (1999), in which he teams up with whom I think is still Korea's best actress, Jeon Do-yeon. Quite opposite to the explosive Oh in Old Boy, the character portrayed by Choi in Happy End is introvert and subdued, but driven to extreme acts by his wife's infidelity. Two different role: same excellence. <br/><br/>I can fully understand why Old Boy won the Grand Prix in Cannes, for its all round artistic achievement, but what it fails to give me is the feeling of sublime elation I get after watching a film like Ikiru."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","17","38","26 April 2007"," A Universal Masterpiece
","This film, in spite of its sulfuric reputation, and the direct connection established by the media in the recent Virginia Tech massacre case, is a masterpiece. A boy has been privately imprisoned for fifteen years with no explanation at all, and of course no trial. It was a private initiative taken by some kind of criminal organization controlled by some kind of mafia itself organized by the entrepreneurial rich. When he is freed he tries to find out why he had been imprisoned like that and to get even with those responsible for it, hence to get his vengeance. The film is a lot more powerful than that in fact, than a simple vengeance case. He will understand that he had known something he shouldn't have known, and he had used it against a schoolmate of his though he should have known he should have kept it for himself, he should have kept his trap shut. And his talking, even if very little, was enough to cause the suicide of a person, and it is the schoolmate of his and lover of the suicidee that went through with his own justice. The film becomes great when the victim of this imprisonment understand his mistake, his crime, his responsibility in the death of the other person and mutilates his speaking for him never to speak anymore. But then the schoolmate, quite older of course understand that he caused a lot of suffering, the death of his victim's wife for instance and the disappearance of his daughter. He then brings justice back onto himself. And the Old Boy, meaning the boy who got old in this private prison, can finally tell the story, in writ, to a woman friend of his and he finally rediscovers love, even if mute love. And this time the film becomes a rewriting of Oedipus' myth: the criminal, unaware of his crime, blinds himself when he discovers the amplitude of his criminal attitude and will die slowly in poverty, rejection and begging. Here the responsibility is definitely shared, silence is imposed onto the criminal tongue, but death comes to the avenging initial criminal who did the first unlawful act that was revealed by the Old Boy, and this Old Boy can then rediscover love again via his writing down his own story. Guilt is always a shared human dimension and punishment must also be shared though some innocent people will pay for the crimes of others and the initial criminal will have to pay more than the subsequent ones. The human species is a very barbaric animal race and yet it is haunted by justice.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","Visually stunning and stylishly executed, Chan-wook Park's 'Oldboy' is loosely based on 'Oedipus' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. On the technical front, it gets almost everything right. The background score is marvelous. The action sequences are well shot even though poorly choreographed. The cinematography and visuals are stunning. The CGI is fake at times (for example the ant crawling under the skin scene). The dialogues are wannabe symbolic and wannabe philosophical. The acting is over-the-top. I didn't see any point in the movie as a whole. Nor did 'Oldboy' entertain me neither did it enlighten. I fail to understand what puts this film on a World Cinema level and what is it that so many love about this movie? Was it the shock value with all the gruesome and gory scenes? It starts on an interesting note but then one finds out that it's a silly contrived revenge plot (not to mention the numerous plot holes). What was Park trying to imply? That it's okay for the brother to have sex with his sister and that Dae-Su's telling someone about it in confidence was the bigger crime? Or is it that the best revenge would be to make him have sex with his own daughter? Don't even get me started on the whole hypnosis-erasing-your-memory crap.

To say too much would be to spoil the ride, but this is a film where you'll always be guessing what's going to happen next and never quite sure what's really going on.<br/><br/>It's a bleak, dark movie that begins very well indeed and stays strong throughout. Chan-wook Park is an expert director and really handles everything well. He's blessed with a superior leading man in Choi Min-sik, the kind of actor who gives his all to the movie, no restraint, no mild-mannered acting here...he lives and breathes the role and you believe in him at all times. Kang Hye-jeong, starring opposite him as love interest Mido, is also very effective, completely lovely and just right for her role.<br/><br/>As for the story... wow. This movie has a brilliant script that constantly surprises you right up until the very last scene. Twists are commonplace these days, but the one found here is the most shocking I've ever seen. OLDBOY has it all, really. A great story unveiled in a leisurely way, piece by piece, no hurry. Touches of the surreal – the disgusting octopus-eating scene is everything you'd imagine it to be. Great acting, great technical aspects. There's violence too, of course. The tooth-pulling torture is probably the most squirm-inducing bit, but the highlight for me is the one-take corridor battle which has to be seen to be believed. One guy with a hammer versus twenty hoods...well, watch it and find out what happens.<br/><br/>By the time the ending comes and you find out why Oh Dae-su was imprisoned, you realise you're watching a masterwork of cinema. It's not an easy film to sit through by any means, but it is affecting and it is very well made indeed. Challenging, gut-punching and outrageous: OLDBOY is one of the bad boys of our time."
"DankThomas","10","3","4","9 June 2016"," An amazing thought provoking revenge story
","Oldboy is one of my favorite films of ALL TIME. The decisions made are so clever that it blows me away. Essentially it's about this guy named Oh Dea-Su, who is being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years for no apparent reason. However one day he's released. But then he needs to find out who was his captor in 5 days while seeking for revenge. <br/><br/>First of, this movie is brutal, violent and heart-wrenching. Amazing directing, amazing soundtrack by Yeong-wook Jo, amazing cinematography, everything. It's unbelievable how perfect it is. Italië not just a revenge story, it's a tragedy about being so desperate for revenge that it ruins your life. It's something that will blow you away. 10/ motherf*cking 10"

","If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like ""challenging"" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your ""brilliant"" reviews.<br/><br/>Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.<br/><br/>To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie."

Of course it is a really big thing to call this movie ""perfect"" but everything under this term would not be fitting For oldboy.<br/><br/>I don't know till today how people can think of such an intense and hard story. It's twist and impact on the characters are just impossible.<br/><br/>How it displays this average man turning into a complete ""Monster"" is just brilliant. literally everything in this movie makes sense. Everything is connected and logical. <br/><br/>I admit, that the movie may be hard to watch at certain scenes but the movie needs all of them.<br/><br/>The music is set PERFECTLY and is just beyond perfectly fitting to the dark theme of the Movie. The few fight scenes in this movie are also unbelievable. The scene where Oh Dae-su gets the knive in his back is one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. The soundtrack here is just perfect and one of mall all time favourite Soundtracks of all time.<br/><br/>This movie has the courage to involve themes so as incest and torture. <br/><br/>This movie needs to be seen by everyone who is old enough to do so. This is a true masterpiece."

If this is the first time seeing Chang-Wook Park movies I recommend to see JSA, Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. All this movies are great, and probably are the best work from Mr. Park, but OldBoy is a true Master Piece. You can't die without seeing this movie.<br/><br/>10 of 10.<br/><br/>PS: I also highly recommend Tae Guk Gi, is not from Chang-Wook Park, but Min-Sik Choi (Oh Daesu in OldBoy) is on it."
"SakowskyBrothers","6","13","28","26 August 2007"," The world laughs with you
","A classic Korean revenge film developed by the mastermind Chan-wook Park couldn't be any better then what it has become. The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex. I entirely understand its concept and brutality; it is after all a great homage to film-noir and attempts to break every boundary to become one of the darkest films ever created without being a actual horror.<br/><br/>During the 15 year imprisonment scene the character had lost all possible nature of himself as he had been forced to become a animal. Masterbating to dancing women. Writing in his journal on whom would have put him through all this pain. Training in combat by punching the wall. Slowly cutting through the brick to at least just feel the breeze of the outside and the rain trickle over his hand and even attempting to smash his head against glass in attempt to kill himself.<br/><br/>All that was once the character had been lost in a spiral of insanity in his solitary confinement. Upon release his character had to regain the ability to live in society. He had to learn new words, he had to learn to laugh, to love, to feel guilt and sorrow and to cry. All this character development to a beautiful soundtrack mixed with classical and techno themes.<br/><br/>Only flaw in this movie would have to be the one scene when Oh Dae-su takes the roll of super-man and cleanses the underground of all the scum. That wasn't enough to interrupt the brilliance of the movie. The time he was lying on the ground with a grin on his face before he put the cigarette in his mouth or the time hes walking away laughing after the man has fallen from the roof onto a car.<br/><br/>In end this movie will not make you laugh. No it will make you cry on behalf of how we lost the film industry to Korea. Because remember when you laugh, the world laughs with you but when you cry, you cry alone."

This Korean film is remarkable. WOWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>All is good in this film.

","First, please don't take this review personally. Unless of course it fits. I have met two people who liked this poorly made movie. Both were 14 year old boys who were going through their ""rebellious"" phase (but not cool enough to be rebels themselves). I asked them why they liked this movie, and they said (in a genuine Beavis & Butthead way), ""It's COOL heh heh heh! Dude nails his own daughter heh heh heh!""<br/><br/>People, that's about all that this movie has. It is rather pointless, unintelligent and visually uncreative, but due to the fact that ""dude nails his own daughter heh heh heh"" and other adolescently provocative elements (like torturing live animals and 20 gallons of blood), it seems to have achieved internet fame.<br/><br/>I strongly urge you not to waste any time or money on this film, and if your children want to see it, smack them really hard and tell them, ""Not until you've grown up into a fully-grown idiot.

","This movie is actually about Woo-Jin's revenge not Dae-Su's because Dae-Su did absolutely nothing (post-imprisonment) to hurt the guy who had so wronged him. I mean, he knocked around a couple of his henchmen but Woo-Jin obviously didn't care because he blew his own bodyguards head off just because he couldn't hear him. If you are going to make a movie about revenge, the protagonist should have a better reason than some kid spreading a rumour about your incestuous affair. Plus, what was that bullshit about her getting pregnant because she believed in a rumour? I suppose there were no pregnancy tests or doctors in that day and age. To add insult to injury, the hypnotist in the end tells Dae-Su that he doesn't deserve her help except that even beasts deserve to live. How can she rationalize helping Woo-Jin and not Dae-Su. I'm surprised he didn't try to have her killed for the part she played in his predicament. Plus, wiping Dae-Su's memory while leaving his daughter's memory intact just allows him to fall in love all over again without the burden of guilt. Kinda makes his tongue-cutting sacrifice seem pointless if you ask me. I've heard a lot about this movie and it has such a high rating that I expected a lot more from it."

That alone should send up some warning flags (that fruitcake should go back to his decapitated Barbie dolls).<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the 4 squids that were killed in the making of this movie (shoved into some guy's mouth and eaten alive & thrashing about).

"awwelsh-1","6","32","91","3 February 2006"," Interesting Premise That Ultimately Fails
","I think the best word to sum up how I felt after watching Oldboy was ""frustrated."" The premise underlying the film is an interesting take-off of The Count of Monte Cristo and it certainly promises a lot of potential. And the director certainly cannot be accused of taking obvious directions to appease the masses. I certainly paid close attention to Oldboy and, admittedly, watched it a second time. But in all honesty, I did not enjoy it and I can say wholeheartedly that this must be one of the most overrated films on IMDb.<br/><br/>Like many of Oldboy's harshest critics, my major problem with the film was the big ""twist"" - - the reason Dae Su was imprisoned. This twist was completely preposterous. Even in the realm of fantasy/action films, I just could not swallow it. It felt like the kind of cheap twist you would find in a B slasher movie like Prom Night. Unlike films like Sixth Sense, where you can re-watch and see connections that lead to the surprise twist, you can't do that with Oldboy. Further, the twist does not fit with the overall mood of the film. Oldboy strives for a real and grim atmosphere but the major villain's plan fits better with a James Bond film.<br/><br/>Oldboy has other problems. Its action set-pieces are not particularly impressive and are few and far between. There is no action scene that will stick out in your mind, like Hard-boiled or The Killer. Yes, there are some seat-squirming graphic revenge scenes, but even they are not as ""extreme"" as advertised.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Oldboy's success hinges on the suspense and impact of its major plot twist and, given its implausibility, the film falters and falls on its face. I have seen that this film has been scheduled for a re-make and, despite generally disliking remakes, I think Oldboy is an excellent candidate. Somewhere in this muddled mess is a great idea that, with the right script, could make an excellent movie."

"namideo","5","6","12","14 April 2010"," I had mixed feelings on this one.
","First off, I'm going to confess to seeing the dubbed version and advise anyone wanting to see this movie to try and see the subtitled version. That version wasn't available to me at the time, and I think I would've liked this movie a lot more if it had been, because as it stands, I wasn't that impressed, and I struggled to get through it all. Which is a shame, because it looked like some of the performances were really good. I don't even know why they dub movies these days. It should be against the law or something. I digress.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely different, and the benefit of foreign films is that you're almost always going to get something stylistically that's a little different from American films. And from that angle, this was an interesting movie. It's also very cringe inducing and not necessarily meant for the squeamish, but the violence is there for a reason and not entirely unjustified, which is good.<br/><br/>The story follows a middle aged guy named Oh-dae-su. Oh-dae-su isn't a bad guy, but he has a knack for trouble and does things like getting drunk and missing his daughter's birthday, so he's not an admirable fellow either, but that's kinda what makes him interesting. Unexpectedly, he gets kidnapped and held prisoner in what looks like a hotel room, except there is an iron door locking him in, and in this room he stays for 15 years until one day he is unexpectedly released. He comes out a changed man, and the rest of the film deals with him seeking revenge on his captors and finding out why he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed, because in the beginning of the film, I was expecting something along the lines of an introspective look at the human condition, and it turned into more of a regular action thriller with choreographed fight sequences and a diabolical plot that aims pretty close to the heart, but is completely far fetched. And contrary to some reviews I've read on this film, I actually found the ending to be slightly predictable. I just couldn't entirely buy into the story.<br/><br/>Overall it's pretty well directed but at times in-cohesive with scene changes that give little explanation as to where we are or what's even going on. Perhaps it was intentional to allow the viewer to relate more to the main character's bizarre set of circumstances, but the way the shots are assembled, it feels like the movie was either rushed or uncompleted.<br/><br/>And despite good performances all around, some of the casting decisions made no sense to me. For example, one of the major characters is played by an actor who looks about 15 or 20 years too young for his particular role, based on the information we're given about his character. Not a major gripe, but it irritated me throughout the film, and made the movie slightly harder to follow, but not in an intended way.<br/><br/>Again, I know I would've liked it more with subtitles, and I may go back and watch the subtitled version at some point for a re-evaluation, but the movie didn't really leave enough of an impression on me to do it any time soon."

If you were one of the folks who saw it coming a mile away, good for you, congratulations. Now you can sit back and enjoy the ride. Oldboy is one of those films that starts out strong, builds you up the whole way through, and then ends with a bang, leaving you satisfied and thinking back at what a great film it was. It follows a lonely man who has many problems but refuses to face them. The movie guides him through a healing path where he discovers the mistakes he made in his life and as a result pays the consequences for them. It really makes the viewer draw many parallels between his or her life and the life of our tragic hero in the film. Not to mention it is beautifully filmed. The choreography in a rather impressive sequence involving some torture and a fight scene involving a hammer (I won't say much more for sake of avoiding spoilers) was fabulous, almost a bit Matrix-esquire.

","A film that discusses a vast range of human emotion and moral questions, Oldboy is merely a plot-driven tale of revenge. The film is composed of extremely rich characters of intensely described emotions and personalities played by very apt actors. However, these characters become consumed in a confusing, but well-woven, web of events, flashbacks, and choppy explanations. The depth of these carefully created characters built by Chan-wook Park is hidden by the carefully created story built by the same person.<br/><br/>The subject matter is full of potential no matter how it is presented due to its intensity and brooding venture into the human soul. But the viewer is rendered unable to connect with the plight of the characters due to the several twists and delicate plot points. While the story is solid and unfathomably interesting, it severely detracts from what should be the major point of the film: the exploration of the human soul.<br/><br/>The filming and production of the piece is beautiful. The director carefully builds his story with perfectly inserted flashbacks and David Lynch-style scenes. The acting by the primary cast conveys the emotions of the characters to a fine point. The writing manages to render dialogue for the film that remains realistic, characterizes, and displays emotion, despite the fantastical situation and many variables. The composition accompanying the film is exceptionally brilliant, mixing classical and modern instrumentals together. The music effectively accentuates the intense emotions portrayed in the movie. Additionally, the filming and design creates a beautiful visual experience. Oldboy is a visual masterpiece, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but all of it detracts from the main purpose and raw emotion of the movie.<br/><br/>It's like Memento (2000) on steroids, or Room (2015) with even more intensity. Yet it misses the mark completely. The emotion is felt, and then lost in the confusing whirlwinds of the story. Park throws the viewer into the Land of Oz and is lost wondering where Kansas went. Tears should be shed for the tragedy of Dae-su Oh, but instead tears are wept for the lost potential of this visually perfect, but emotionally incomplete film."

Along with Mi-do, to save those he cares about most, Oh-Daesu is given 5 days to figure out who imprisoned him and why. This film definitely focuses on the fact that even the smallest things can blow up out of proportion, and the results can be catastrophic. The acting is by far the best I've seen in Asian cinema, and the writing is fantastic. I highly recommend. 10 stars all the way."

","one of the most up-and-coming film makers of the day is one Chanwook Park, an auteur from South Korea who just may go down in the history books as the 21st centuries first great storyteller.<br/><br/>Revenge. the word itself denotes a certain tingle on the back of your neck. we all know what it means, some of us have even been a part of it's tangled web. Vengeance is the culmination of almost every emotion the human mind is capable of understanding, and some we don't. Chanwook Park has written, directed and produced three film that tackle the psychology, philosophy and grand theme of vengeance, and Oldboy is the second installment and probably the most important.<br/><br/>the story is quite convoluted, and much of it should be left to be witnessed with virgin eyes and ears, but sufficing to say that a sully drunk named Oh Dae Su is captured by a man with a purple umbrella one rainy evening after a few hours in the drunk tank. he is kept in a small motel room with a fake window, a TV, an eerie painting and a gas pipe for the duration of 15 years. during this time, he witnesses his wife and child murdered on the 11 o'clock news, and he is framed for it. Dae Su sort of goes into a slow state of focused madness. his body becomes tough and trained, his hair becomes shaggy and beast-like, and his wrist becomes an hourglass, counting the years in checks until his release. When Dae Su is released, he is no longer Dae su, but something else, he's a beast, a monster, an unstoppable force of vengeance created by the rage and sorrow of the former Dae su. he still looks like the same disheveled 40-something, but there is a deadness to him, a crouching killer waiting to spring on his pray- the people who killed his family and put him in that horrible place, but with all the anger inside Dae Su, there still lurks a very human being, one so desperate for contact with another life after 15 years of deprivation, he consumes a living creature as his first meal upon release. this is only the first half hour of the film, and it's really the simplest part of the plot to explain- a precurser. this should give you an idea of how deep and dark this film plunges into the human psyche. for all it's cartoonish moments and stylish look and feel, Oldboy is unmatched in its well of emotion and deeply human story. you are not asked to take what you see as literal occurrence, but rather to accept what you see and draw meaning from it. there are some scenes many people find obligatory, consciously shocking or just plain gross, but they are all necessary in order to understand the epicness of this tale.<br/><br/>on a technical scale, Park has taken a complete divergance from his previous effort- Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and instead gone into a kind of surrealist filmnoir-meets-hong-Kong wonder-world from which this fantastical story can be properly told in the grandios form it requires.<br/><br/>a lot of people disliked the ending to this movie, and if you watch this film the same way you watch something like Fight Club or Memento (both fine films) then you wont like it either, but this isn't fight club or memento, this is Shakespeare, this is Homer, this is what lies beneath the gloss and dirt. the core. the story itself is unimportant, it's what the story implies that makes it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>i mourn the idea of remaking this film, giving the helm to the man who'll do Fast and the Furious 3, and making the main character go to prison rather than the original mysterious hotel room. all the things that make Oldboy Oldboy are gone, and all we're left with is the homage of someone who obviously missed the point. so i urge you to see this version of the story before it becomes a bastardized memory of itself stuffed into a Pepsi advertisement."

","Old Boy is a slick action thriller that is both entertaining and ultimately thought provoking. Fincher's 'Fight Club' and Miike's 'Ichi The Killer' have both been raised as stylistic comparisons and there is a lot of merit to this perspective.<br/><br/>Essentially, it is about a man's imprisonment and subsequent quest for vengeance against his initially unknown captor. To state more than that would be to spoil a film that relies upon a significant plot-twist. This plot twist has been much discussed. Further, there appears to be a significant amount of ambiguity in the final scene that leaves it open to interpretation as to whether the protagonist has 'taken steps' to move on from the events, or whether he is still a warped monster of revenge.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that it is a niche film - one for people who like overt cinematic technique - namely flashy visuals and inventive action sequences. My personal bias is towards such films that take an innovative approach to visuals and for this reason, and the provocative ending, I found it to be a very good film.<br/><br/>I think that most people would find it entertaining to some degree. Whether they would find it a good film is a matter of debate. There have been a great many reviews extolling the merits of the film and many eloquent criticisms - both are equally valid.<br/><br/>There are continuity lapses and some facile quasi deus ex machina (omnipotent villain) explanations, but in particular, I think the charge of nihilism is quite accurate. It is not a movie where the message is obvious, or indeed one where you could really categorise as having something profound to say about the futility of revenge or the human condition. That said, as a stylish piece of entertainment I enjoyed it immensely. I have seen Park Chan-Wook's 'JSA' and 'Sympathy For Mr Vengeance' and preferred this film. Whether this makes me a vapid pop-culture victim, so be it, but I honestly have a better time seeing something like 'Performance' or '...if' or even 'Ichi The Killer' than 'The Sorrow and the Pity' or 'Through a Glass Darkly'. Great films, like great literature, can be hard work and not always more rewarding."

","Frankly I can't understand the rating of this film on IMDb. Eight point something - oh puh-lease. Yes, I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this utter tripe, in some vain, and hoping for some redemption - however, as the film went on, and with every minute longer that I watched it, as opposed to having reached for the power button, as much as I sensed disappointment looming 10 minutes through, the disappointment continued without abatement until the very end. So my advice to you is, watch it, I don't care if you ignore this warning/review! but should you, 15 minutes through start having reservations - act upon them and save yourself some time.<br/><br/>The worst thing about a film that you've got to watch with subtitles, is, you have to stay focused intently else you might miss something. On the plus side, it means I am able to present to you, my opinion, that you can rest assured is something formed from a full and proper, intense session, of a waste of 2 hours of my life! Not through laziness, but just because this film is so simple in storyline, - there isn't much depth to it and hence I don't really think this film deserves much more time spent on it pondering the rubbish storyline which is very thin on the ground.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, the premise of the entire film is a joke. It's fantasy land viewing with scenes that are too far fetched. Even if the scenes were believable - the motivations of protagonist are not. Of the far fetched scenes, all were mediocre, leaning towards downright laughable and boring.<br/><br/>This film has been over-rated by a bunch of namby pamby wannabe critics without a clue. People who see something from nothing. A joke. I could sum up the entire premise of this film in one paragraph, and the film makers have padded it out to a 2 hour film. There are two times when the majority of people write reviews, when they really like a film, or and more often, when they really despise it. This film falls into the latter category, because there are people out there who believe this is a masterclass and have almost coerced people like me into wasting 2 hours of my life to watch this - so here I am, offering balance. Watch to your detriment - this film is for simple minds, and reviewing this in 2013, and decades down the line, people will look upon this film with contempt, the same way I have. My two cents!"

","I give this movie 3 stars for a compelling beginning and interesting story progression, and a few very amusing fight scenes.<br/><br/>I deduct 5 stars for the nihilistic incest fantasy at its core.<br/><br/>Any review that doesn't grapple with this sickness at the core is a sign of a morally inexperienced or bankrupt reviewer. How do you not warn the viewer that the supposed redemption of the character comes when he pays a hypnotist to wipe his memory in order to permit him to continue carrying out one of society's greatest (and most sensible) taboos, against HAVING SEX WITH YOUR OWN CHILDREN.<br/><br/>That's right. This ""Count of Monte Cristo"" revenge tale has the erstwhile prisoner unknowingly becoming involved with his own daughter, who he doesn't recognize due to his long imprisonment as well as post-hypnotic suggestion. The writer lacks the courage to give our prisoner only one excuse (time passing) for sleeping with his child...the post-hypnotic suggestion seems added to give the prisoner further justification for just going for it.<br/><br/>Think ""The Count of Monte Pedo."" <br/><br/>I'm posting frank spoilers here in an attempt to stand out from the reviews that avoid spoilers and say, merely, ""YUCK,"" because I wish I had been warned against this. The person who recommended this movie to me laughingly told me, ""It goes to places you would never expect."" The more accurate description is, ""It goes to places it shouldn't, and wallows there because it can't muster the courage or imagination or moral clarity to say anything about it once it gets there."" I am not closed-minded against challenging cinematography or story developments. What bothers me about this movie is its attempt to justify these developments with a kind of ""See, here's how he can go on sleeping with his daughter"" happy ending.<br/><br/>Persons with weak moral compasses or who don't look deeply at this material may find the nihilistic progression of this movie compelling. I remind them that anybody can destroy his own world, his own life, and his own mind in order to justify any behavior. Do you want to live in a world where the willingness to destroy the world is all it takes to get what you want?"

","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS* I don't know why this movie has such high rating . Maybe it's because Quentin Tarantino likes it , so people feel like they have to like it too ? Who knows. I heard rumors that Hollywood wants to make an American remake of this one . Spielberg is supposed to be the director and Will Smith the main star . I can't imagine that , but hey . The whole world is getting crazier with each day , so why not .<br/><br/>The movie is based on comic book I haven't heard or read . It's manga , so expect a lot of kung fu fights , shouting and twisted psychology.<br/><br/>I treat ""Oldboy"" as a thriller . When I'm watching a thriller I'm expecting logic . I don't know if the viewers who liked ""Oldboy"" treat is a some sort of fantasy , but for me it was a total disaster in terms of realism and logic.<br/><br/>1) Our hero is a prisoner . He's been locked in a apartment . In the middle of the city . The WHOLE building is a prison , where EVERY apartment is basically a cage. And I thought that when you kidnap somebody you hide him outside of the city limits or something like that 2) Our hero for 15 YEARS EATS THE SAME MEAL for breakfast , lunch and dinner . What about vitamins , proteins and so on ? After a week he would be sick . After a month he would probably die . Yet , he's alive and in good health . Magic , I guess or he's a terminator.<br/><br/>3) You can't hypnotize anybody AGAINST HIS WILL . You need the patient to cooperate with the hypnotist.<br/><br/>4) You won't learn kung fu if you will be PUNCHING THE WALL WITH ONE FIST FOR 15 YEARS.<br/><br/>5) I guess eating live octopus is a deep symbol of something 6) You can rape a woman in the elevator and walk away with no problem . Despite having at least two witness , the police wont be even searching for you.<br/><br/>7) The love between our hero and the most important female character is nonexistent , despite what the movie tells us 8) Our hero is in the same age as the villain . They went to the same school , same year , same class . Yet , our hero looks like 40 or 50 years old , while the villain is maximum 30 years old. Judging by the look our hero could be his father ! 9) The sex scene is one of the most awful sex scenes I've ever seen.<br/><br/>10) You can defeat army of opponents with no problem , yet when you are angry one guy will defeat you without the problem.<br/><br/>11) Who's that woman ? Why she helps the villain in the beginning ? Why she helps the hero in the end ? Does she have personal reasons ? 12) The ending message is beautiful – incest is good as long as nobody knows about it. Brother and sister or father and daughter should LOVE EACH OTHER NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY , BUT ALSO PSYCHICALLY What is wrong with you people ? What about logic or good taste ? This movie feels like an adaptation of one of those porn fan-fiction that Internet is full of . Incest appeared before in one famous movie from the 70's , but that movie never said it was a good thing ! That's the only ""message"" I saw . The authors of the comic book , the creators of the movie and the fans of the movie need to be locked in mental hospital.<br/><br/>I give it 2/10 , because the music is beautiful."

","This is one heck of a film experience, a cinematic joyride unlike any in recent memory. A well-crafted tight package it is, of electrifying acting performance (Choi Min-Sik is simply great), innovative cinematography, unbelievably warped story line, bone-jarring action, black humor, all fortified by a moody and captivating music score(it tends to lodge in the recesses of one's right hemisphere, and won't leave). <br/><br/>A role that demands a tremendous emotional range, Choi Min-Sik gives one of the most memorable acting performances in recent years. We see a man brimming with bottled up rage for vengeance barreling his way towards the inevitable encounter with his nemesis, and when the moment arrives, we are witness to a heart-wrenching transformation of a broken man pitifully begging for his mute mercy. If there ever is a measurable scale to the emotional spectrum of acting, then Mr. Choi's performance pushes through the untested limits of infrared and ultraviolet. His brilliantly inscrutable and ambiguously formed sweet-and-sour smile(Mona Lisa would be proud) near the end is the singular summation of a tortured soul who has just been reminded of the unbearable cost of his hollow victory. Perhaps it is the smile beneath which a glimpse of the ""monster"" can still be seen. Many will ponder.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the viewer is treated to some striking imagery which effectively appear almost embossed onto the film. Some of the more memorable scenes appear to be lifted right out of its dramatic Manga frame composition. Dramatic pose of our protagonist holding back the man and his dog, Mr. Han's momentarily frozen Judo form, the ""Great Wave""(poster) of emotion towering over Dae Su.. There is no stylistic over-byte here, just enough dramatic essence distillation to stick. Simply brilliant. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to the infamous hallway fight scene, an all out, no cuts, make-your-palm-sweat realism. This is largely due to Mr. Park's mastery of his directorial craft to match the subject drama and acting.<br/><br/>Those cineastes who like their cinematic Martini ""shaken AND stirred"" will no doubt discover a winding, twisted emotional vista, one that we rarely see. A rock and a grain of sand may sink the same, but surely this cinematic de la creme will ascend to its rightful notice. Indeed a stylistic substance and substantial style."

Oldboy is undoubtedly the most disgusting movie ever. I was not put off its slow pace, violence, or torture but because the main topic of the film is that he had sex with his daughter (I'm even ashamed to type this in) I honestly must say that you need the sickest mind on the planet to come up with that. How disgusting can you get? There is already far too much sex in the media but that is totally out of order. Zinda was 95% different it was dark, sinister, sensible, unpredictable, stylish and of course excellent flawless acting. Oldboy was none of these. Other disgusting scenes were: <br/><br/>1. When he put his hand out for the rain and took a sip of it, the same hand he masturbated with (Yuck)<br/><br/>2. After he was released he ate the octopus alive (Yuck, Ewww)<br/><br/>3. He tried to have sex with the girl when she was in the toilet (Yuck, Ewww, Gross)<br/><br/>I just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film is on the IMDb top 250? It should have been in the bottom 100. Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. While I was watching it I hated every second and I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would reveal in the last reel but it would end the discomfiture.

Wow, we're talking about some twisted minds over here.<br/><br/>It's not that I hate violence. Have you seen any movies made by Lars Von Trier? There, violence has a point.

No explanation makes sense, especially in the end, where the imprisoned guy learns that ""he was programmed to fall asleep"" when his daughter touched her, so she could take him home. And that was of course, to make them fall in love with each other. Why didn't he program them to fall in love with each other in the first place? And if anyone (and I mean it - if anyone) says this wasn't done because it would be difficult and so on, I'm gonna bang my head against the wall.<br/><br/>Oh, remember what happens in the final scene.

","""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""<br/><br/>Never have truer words been said. And I agree with the second part even more. This is a film where the hero and the villain are both lonely individuals because they're in a grieving process. But you can't be truly heroic or villainous when you're that pathetic, so ""Old Boy"" is less the tale of an upcoming good-vs-evil confrontation than the journey of a man who was stolen part of his life and had the remains to give it the only possible meaning: knowledge first, then revenge.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the twist, one brilliant paradigm the film provides is that sometimes it's not about looking for the right answers but asking the right questions. But I'm talking in abstractions, let's just get into reviewing mode. Oh-Daeh Su is a man we first see drunk in a police station, he missed his daughter's birthday and is ready to go home when he's suddenly kidnapped and jailed in an apartment where he's given food, clean laundry and a TV as his only connection to the world, like Peter Sellers' character in ""Being There"".<br/><br/>TV teaches him one thing or two when the rest of the experience hardens him. At that moment we're hooked already, we want to see his escape and want to know what this average-looking man ever did to deserve this? The way he ""gets off"" is an indicator that the film isn't exactly trying to match our expectations. Indeed, it's not as simple because it's much simpler than we'd have anticipated, he's released and finds himself with new clothes, a cellphone, and time to readapt to the city he left.<br/><br/>There's even a scene that echoes ""Being There"" where he's confronted to street thugs, Oh Daeh-Su says ""Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training... be put to use?"" Apparently it can, and his fifteen years of isolation improved his physical skills as much as they damaged the social ones. Yet, everything feels too convenient, too weird, even in a restaurant, a young girl named Mido seems to grow an infatuation on him... even after he did the grossest thing ever; eating a live octopus! Is the film falling in the romance trap? Wait till the end, that's not the right question to ask.<br/><br/>Now why did he eat the animal? That's a question. ""To feel something alive in his mouth after having been deprived from life"" seems like an organic answer, remember that Oh Daeh-Su has been totally desensitized from life and naturally pain, taking the life out of an animal or a human being would make him feel alive again as if he had sucked the juice of life to feel something again.<br/><br/>The ""octopus"" scene sets our mind to the most gruesome parts where Oh Daeh-Su tracks down his captors until he finds his former warden and pulls seven teeth out before getting the names. All the discretion shots in the world can't distract from disturbing ""Marathon Man"" vibes but here again, it's not just about shocking for the kicks. When Oh Daeh-Su pulls off the tooth, believe it or not, he's the one suffering, he's the one who has surrendered to his bestial nature to commit atrocities he never thought he could.<br/><br/>As he says: ""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?"" And living, as far as he's concerned, is looking for the answers, there's something worse than suffering which is suffering for no reason, this could apply for violence in films, it can only work if there's a reason. So for a film so inclined to disturbing acts of violence, it's interesting that its central theme is knowledge.<br/><br/>The film puts us in the mind of someone who wants to know but maybe the truths it's ready to reveal would make his torment worse, his life more hellish, but he's willing to take the risk... this is why you can't judge the film without considering its antagonist. Woo Jin-Lee is everything Oh Daeh-Su is not, he's handsome (very actually), rich, confident and he defines himself as a scholar in Oh Daeh-Su. So we have the man who wants to know and the scholar.<br/><br/>And as the cat-and-mouse chase goes on and the plot gets thicker, Woo Jin-Lee's cool and detached demeanor fades out to unveil as tragic depths as Oh Daeh-Su did so we understand that they were the perfect match to each other until the climactic face-off. And like Bill in ""Kill Bill"", it's not just black and white morality. I know, you could see a ""Kill Bill"" allusion coming, there are so many parallels to draw between the two films and it's a fitting coincidence that QT was the Cannes Festival and gave the film its Grand Prize, but ""Old Boy"" flies high miles above American Cinema.<br/><br/>Indeed, calling it a revenge story, an action film or a psychological thriller wouldn't give you one tenth of the idea. American movies have proven that a good editing, a compelling story and shocking value are integral to a film's success but I blame them for having given me the wrong idea about that South Korean's gem, perhaps one of the most immoral and amoral movies I've ever seen, it's just disturbing, disgusting and graphic on levels rarely reached by American cinema (Tarantino included)... on the surface.<br/><br/>Indeed, it's impossible to give ""Old Boy"" a negative review. The reason is simple, the film is amoral but it's a masterpiece of amorality, it embraces it with a sort of morbid enthusiasm whose credibility depends on its sincerity, whoever uses violence can atone with it. Yes, the film is extreme but if it wasn't, we would feel either manipulated or cheated and the film might show revenge as something necessary but never satisfactory!"
"paulclaassen","5","3","5","16 June 2018"," I don't get it; what's the hype all about?
","'Oldboy' is constantly mentioned as one of the greatest Korean films ever made, and has also been called the most disturbing Korean film (followed by 'I saw the Devil' and 'The Chaser', which were both incredibly disturbing). I therefore eagerly watched the film in high anticipation, but am quite sad to say I was very disappointed. It started off very interesting and mysterious, and the story was told in a very unique way. The moment Oh Dae Su is released, the film becomes very neo-noir-ish (and I don't enjoy neo-noir) and I actually found it to me more comedic than disturbing or suspenseful. Choi Min-sik was excellent, as usual, and without him in the lead I might have liked the film even less. So, essentially the film is about an old school friend, Lee Woo-jin, who wants to avenge Oh Dae-Su for Lee's sister's suicide. Because of this he locks him up for 15 years, then sets him free after 'programming' both him and his daughter via hypnosis to fall in love. Uhmm, ok... Ok, spoilers to follow, so stop reading if you don't want to know. Is this filmed said to be the most disturbing film simply because it is revealed the woman he so eagerly had sex with is actually his daughter? Nothing else in the film is disturbing. When all is said and done and Lee kills himself (what an anti-climax!!), Oh Dae-Su tracks down the hypnotist and asks her to erase his memory of his daughter so they can have a relationship. Seriously!!?? So he'd rather have her as his lover than his daughter?? I rest my case..."

","That's how big an impact ""Oldboy"" made on me! The opening of the movie alone is perhaps the coolest opening I have ever seen because when that music started playing and the first scene starts rolling I was in movie heaven. It was one of those perfect moments I guess, and it was all the much harder to believe, because I am no Asian-movie fan. Actually I avoid Asian movies as much as I can because I don't like their storytelling and directing, plus I never remember the faces because they all look the same. I have, since seeing ""Oldboy"", changed my opinion on that. How could I not, the movie has more style that the first two Matrix movies combined, visual effects that are more than equal rivals to any big-budget Hollywood movie, actors that I was somehow able to recognize were amazing, despite having to read the subtitles all the way through, and a music score that has been playing in my head for many days now. And I haven't even gotten to the true core of this movie. It's a story that blew me away, it's a hardcore revenge movie that won't leave you cold. Put all of this into exactly two hours of pure entertainment at it best, countless memorable scenes that are beyond amazing, and give it a dash of perfection. You got it, an instant cult classic. 9/10"
"Det_McNulty","9","33","110","9 July 2006"," One Of The Most Original And Compelling Films Ever Made. ""Oldboy"" Blew Me Away
","I personally feel Oldboy is the best film to come out of Asian cinema, it really hit me hard. I loved it from start to finish, this dark tale of revenge is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Everything about Oldboy is perfect, the direction, the poetic screenplay, the haunting operatic score and the wonderful acting. Even though Oldboy is a tale of revenge, it has an underlying message of redemption.<br/><br/>I mean how can you feel sorry for someone when you don't know what they have done. You see Oldboy questions the viewer, you will falter between feeling sorry for someone and then wondering ""But what did they do to make that person do such a thing?"" The film tests what many viewers can handle, even though the film is disturbing it adds a touch of twisted humour. Chan-wook Park is a director with a lot of talent, he mixes genres perfectly and many different techniques used to create a dark foreboding atmosphere.<br/><br/>The dialogue is poetic, deep and meaningful. The phrase ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you, weep, and you weep alone"" is a very true statement. It's the kind of dialogue where you want to sit back and think about it for a second because everything moves with great pacing. The movie is deep and fulfilling. It holds many surprise twists and turns and uses some great shock techniques.<br/><br/>The film mixes genres together, mainly using revenge and drama. The movie studies humanity and how a person can hurt someone without realising it. I would say this masterpiece is very psychological because it tests the viewers boundaries of what they can handle in certain places. The movie has a very comic book feel to it because it's based of a Manga series as well as being part of the ""Vengance Trilogy"". The movie helps define the often used term of ""cool"".<br/><br/>Oldboy stands high up in a class of it's own, the movie is visual beauty and shows the pain that the characters are going through. The edging menace that weaves it's way throughout the film manages to keep the viewer watching and grasping for more. Oldboy is a film that sticks with you and plays on your mind for a long time after each viewing. The movie is very deep and manages to show things through ""In your face"" technique and subtle imagery through acting. Another genius aspect would be the way you can't really decide who's the bad person is, there are definitely no good characters apart from Dae-su Oh's lover who acts powerfully and with lots of precision.<br/><br/>For example one of the great scenes in this masterpiece is the love scene, it shows all the pain Dae-su Oh is going through. The actor Min-sik Choi has been casted perfectly and plays his role as Dae-su Oh with sublime brilliance. The direction is stylish and different, the movie experiments with very clever camera techniques. An example would be the close up of Dae-su Oh in the right hand corner of the screen and the blurred image of someone behind him. Oldboy is an extremely intelligent style of film making that is for a viewer who wants to get something out of the movie they are watching.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat like a Film-Noir, the narration adds depth and powerhouse style to the films undertone. Hence the idea of revenge and telling the tale of something that asks the viewer questions. The movie plays with the mind and twists everything you once thought was correct. The viewer never knows who to trust or what is going to happen next. he movie is unpredictable and feels like a poem of death. The first 40 minutes or so build up a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film shows how our society and class we live in is fuelled by evil.<br/><br/>The movie is far from being at action movie and some might say far from being a revenge movie. It's more about lost love, self indulgence and finding inner tranquillity. The acting as mentioned is very powerful and provokes the viewer to ask the one main question that the film offers and that's ""Why?"" <br/><br/>Another important aspect would be ""Insanity"" and ""What drives a human? What really makes them want to go out and do something?"" Some viewers will be put off from the films high-octane style and grace. But mainly the fact the movie is very twisted and disturbing. Though the added touch of satire adds a crazed ambition. The film actually feels quite Quentin Tarantino like in certain places or at least something that would appeal to his taste in film. The film is unflinching with it's camera use and what is being put fourth in front of the viewer.<br/><br/>Perfection, detail and sublime visual flare makes this one of the greatest films ever made. You'll be wanting to see Oldboy again and again as soon as it finishes. The movie is confusing and fulfilling with it's wonderfully sweeping plot line. There is no doubt about it, Oldboy is one of the greatest films of the 21st century."
"WriterDave","7","28","91","13 February 2005"," Savage Plot Saved by Imagery and Sound
","""Oldboy"" is best viewed on a clean slate. I knew nothing about it before watching it, only that a friend recommend it. Similar in fashion to ""Donnie Darko"" or ""Fight Club"" this is a film that once you know the twist and how it ends (and this has a climax ripped right from the bleeding heart of a Greek tragedy) it probably won't hold up on repeat viewing all that well. As such, I will probably avoid watching it again, as it was oddly endearing and I would rather remember it well than think about it too much and ruin the experience.<br/><br/>A simplistic and twisted revenge plot gets shrouded in claustrophobic mystery and visual chutzpah (the camera work and color scheming are intense and satisfying, a stunning blend of Scorsese and Zhang Zimou) that tricks the unsuspecting viewer into thinking they are watching something more special than it really is. There's also a fantastic music score blending classical pieces with techno music. The music and the imagery last in the viewer's mind long after the film ends. Unfortunately the story line and characters do not. I suppose on a simple motion picture level (where one views film-making as a purely visual and sound art form) the film is a rousing success. However, if you wish to view film as a story telling art form, this repetitive and contrived motion picture fails miserably. Already pegged for a Hollywood remake that will no doubt pummel the style over substance nature of the film into the ground."

","There are so many good reviews for this and I can see why. The filming was pretty good and the introduction was grossly fascinating. Sadly, 99% of the film, I did not understand what was going on. It was so hard to follow because the cuts were so random. The plot was vague at times, leaving so many questions. How'd he become a Kung-fu master by punching a wall and watching TV? How did he survive without sunlight for 15 years plus how did he live off of only the dumplings? Why did the villain care so much about Dae Su? He's the one who killed his own sister ... and why go as far as to cut off your tongue? I guess I am missing something big about this movie.<br/><br/>Nearing the middle of the film, this movie drastically glorified rape. The poor women in the movie were nothing more than some tools, despite them being their sister or daughter. They sounded like chihuahuas gone wrong during all the unnecessary brutal, disgusting sex scenes. I guess they're trying to tell me that love is indeed brutal sex and rape. Because as you know, Dae Su 'loves' his daughter physically and emotionally.<br/><br/>The gore...so unnecessary. Why did those people deserve to be hurt. I feel this movie was made for horny teens with nothing better to do than glorify brutal sex, torture, and watch a dude eat a squid. <br/><br/>I feel for the Korean people since now the foreigners who watch this hunk of sick porno relate their culture to this movie. <br/><br/>The maker's intentions were not relayed. The focus was pushed aside by the sick aspects of this movie. And trust me, I adore gore! This left me feeling sick with sadness, not terror. I rate 1/10. 1 for beautiful music."

Watch something else and have a better day. <br/><br/>It seems I need to write a bit more, so I'll also mention that people that have had any psychological trauma in there life should definitely avoid this movie despite the high reviews.

"ebossert","10","33","112","11 April 2006"," A Non-Gratuitous, Well-Crafted Extreme Film
","Oldboy is a fine movie. In reading some of the negative reviews on IMDb, however, one may be given the impression that this film is gratuitous in its use of violence and sex. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who have seen this film understand that the sex scene was an important  even ESSENTIAL  event. (This is, mind you, the only movie I can think of that has been able to utilize sex as a significant contribution to a well-crafted storyline.) Thus, the sex was not gratuitous at all, since it served a purpose that becomes all the more obvious as the story progresses. If one wishes to see gratuitous sexual content that adds virtually nothing to a horribly-crafted storyline, one can refer to Izo (directed by Takashi Miike).<br/><br/>With regards to those complaining about the film's believability, they are simply attacking a strawman. And I ponder at why these very same criticisms of believability are not applied to such overrated films like The Lord of the Rings or ET. Perhaps because the priority of such films are not in their presentation of believable concepts? In like manner, this film's purpose is to express the consequences implicit within the pursuit of vengeance. Whether or not the events therein are believable or not is inconsequential. Thus, the criticism of unbelievability is logically flawed, and pointless.<br/><br/>I have always held that making a film extreme  in and of itself  does not make a good movie. (And I have seen plenty of low quality extreme movies.) That said, there are both bad and good extreme films. With its engaging storyline and entertainment value, Oldboy is an unequivocal example of the latter."

","When I first started watching this film I thought that I would be in for something really different. It turns out it was really different, but the fulfillment of the plot does not match the hype or the style. The style and music I thought were really well done, but sadly the story (which starts out with a cool idea, 15 years locked up and you don't know why) does not go anywhere new with the plot. The movie at times was extremely graphic, and while I don't care one way or the other in terms of gore, I thought they went out of their way to find ways to display graphic violence.<br/><br/>Overall I do not think this film belongs in the top 250, it is an interesting film, and pretty well done, but overall is not the interesting. The real test for me is will I go back and watch it again? Maybe. It just doesn't bring enough to the table during of after the initial viewing to warrant the same repeat and initial value of other films rated this highly.<br/><br/>As long as you go in knowing what to expect and not expecting it to be one of the greatest films you will ever see, it should provide a solid 2 hours of entertainment"

","(This Review is originally from my blog at http://samuentagareview.blogspot.com/. Feel free to check out my other reviews)<br/><br/>Oldboy is probably the most famous South Korean film in the entire world, and since it's being remade by Spike Lee this year, I figured I'd watch the original film to see what the fuss was about.<br/><br/>And wow. Wow. Wow.<br/><br/>So, I'm just going to go SPOILER this time, because anyone who wants to see it probably already has.<br/><br/>So this guy, Oh Dae Su, is kidnapped and kept in solitary confinement for fifteen years, the only contact with the outside world being the guards that feed him and never talk, and the television in his room. Suddenly, after fifteen years, he is set free, and decides to find out why he was kept inside that room for fifteen years.<br/><br/>So then he meets this girl at a sushi bar, eats a live octopus whole, and then faints. He wakes up in her house, and a very awkward, sexually tense relationship begins as the two try and find out who put him in prison.<br/><br/>Eventually, they find a security guard at the place he was kept, and try to find out who captured him by pulling his teeth out with a hammer. (By the way, this film is really gruesome) and then the famous single-take fight sequence begins, and it's really good. That's definitely the highlight of the film, and there's nothing else that quite matches up to it in the rest, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Finally, following a couple of deaths, sex with the random girl, and several close calls to the man behind everything, he finally catches up to the man, who reveals everything that happened.<br/><br/>So Oh Dae Su and the bad guy used to go to the same school, and the villain had this rather, um, inappropriate relationship with his sister. Oh Dae Su, on his last day at the school, sees this, and spreads a rumor around the school, not realizing that they were siblings. She starts having signs of pregnancy, and commits suicide.<br/><br/>Then the villain, in anguish, decides to enact revenge, kidnaps Oh Dae Su, keeps him away from his daughter for fifteen years, then releases him and with help from a hypnotist, gets Oh Dae Su to fall in love with his daughter, the girl at the sushi bar.<br/><br/>So then, Oh Dae Su is stricken with guilt, begs the villain to not tell the girl, and cuts off his tongue for no reason, resulting in the villain letting him go, and killing himself.<br/><br/>So now, Oh Dae Su tracks down the hypnotist and gets her to make him forget about the identity of the girl he met at the sushi bar, so that they can continue their relationship without the guilt in Oh Dae Su's heart.<br/><br/>What the heck.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is really well made and brutal, but it's also all kinds of messed up. I have no idea how they're going to remake this for more conservative American cinema, but a lot of the plot twists have to be readjusted for the remake.<br/><br/>It's really a personal preference, but this sort of stuff just makes me uncomfortable sitting there, watching it.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's good. Just make sure you know what you're going into, if you haven't seen it yet."

","Oldboy, a Korean action thriller, is one of the best films I watched in 2004! Oh Daesu, on his way home to celebrate his daughter's birthday, finds himself kidnapped and placed in a small apartment-like room. Despite his attempts to find out why, he is never told anything over the 15 years he remains prisoner there! During the time in his cell, he stays busy by attempting suicide, watching TV, trying to escape, and preparing for when he does get out. It is at that time Oh Daesu will begin his violent, disturbing quest for answers. No more needs to be said, as this is a film best left revealed as you watch it for the first time. I will mention one scene for the action fans though. Oh Daesu, on his way out of a building, starts into a hall and encounters a whole gang of punks prepared to stop him. Armed with a mere claw hammer, our hero smashes his way to the other end, realistically dishing out pain (and taking his share of it back!). We witness this awesome scene of action beauty unfold over the course of about three minutes, scrolling from the left to the right, and with absolutely no cuts! Anyway, with its unique and suspenseful plot, great characters and acting, and sharp sense of style and music, Oldboy was an impressive feature. The film was less than a year old and a remake was already in the works! If you get the chance, I definitely recommend watching it.

As a revenge film it's not that original, no one sane wants to do their daughter. And the plot wasn't that original, it was just disturbing.

I am a great fan or Korean cinema, however I also understand that not all writing need be in a faux-haiku style. Though much must be lost in translation, there are metaphors, similies and general speeches which make little or no sense, hugely detracting from the atmosphere of the piece.<br/><br/>Other than these critisisms, the film was overall a very good watch. How it has achieved an 8.2 rating I do not know, however to each their own.

","NOTE TO REVIEWERS: <br/><br/>Oldboy is a quandary for public opinion as for some strange reason or another it seemingly splits the IMDb reviewers straight down the centre, and I ask for those that sift through the Oldboy reviews just pressing ""no"" because they didn't like, understand or get the film to please take the time to read this, and if on the 'reviews' merits you find it unhelpful, unformed or at the very least not expressing my own thoughts of this film then please feel free to press that little button.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, undeserving of an unnecessary wave of criticism of this film which stemmed around three years after the creation of this film, Oldboy can be an unsettling cinematic experience as it forces the viewer to face up to some unsavoury aspects of humanity, namely the more taboo topic of revenge.<br/><br/>The second instalment of Park Chan Wooks vengeance trilogy, Oldboy takes a different, and slightly slicker, approach from its predecessor (Sympathy For My Vengeance) and a less philosophical one than its successor (Lady Vengeance). Whereby the former dealt with the escalation and the utter futility of revenge, and the latter tackled not only the notion of ""what justice is"" but also being the only film of the three to deal with redemption, Oldboy is a stylised tale of truth searching and revenge, which throws up perhaps one of the most devious twists in film history but also successfully manages to lead the audience down a completely different path as we ask why? But not the correct why.<br/><br/>Many find its sequences to be gory and unnecessary, and as a fellow critic I accept that those are their views on the matter, but in my mind they lack the courage to look this film head on. There are many reviews which rate this film poorly, while all the positive ones have a negative useful to non-useful ratio, but by reading the derogatory ones you wonder if some of the posters were jumping on the ""anti-Oldboy"" bandwagon for the ride, as few seemed capable of producing a coherent synopsis. That is not to say 'all' negative reviews were unfounded but that, in my mind, certain issues are misinterpreted. As for Oldboy being a gore-fest, that is overblown hype created by the same people that then went and saw Hostel and thought it was brilliant. The violence is stylised and perhaps the scenes en mass can desensitise, but the scenes are no more gruesome than those from any other thriller, and are few and far between. What is troubling for most people to deal with is that notion of revenge. What Park Chan Wook succeeds at is having us believe in a story and then being able to flip it entirely on its head. All the work we invest as an audience is completely undone, as our protagonist makes a startling change. It's hard watching because it is such a negative ending, yet that in itself is the point. Oldboys message is not ""don't open your mouth because you'll get punished later in life"", that's the analysis of someone who totally missed the point. The point is we as humans lack of compassion and sensitivity and understanding. That we are more focused on ourselves than helping and leaving others be, we do not take the time to take into consideration other peoples feelings, and do we have control of our feelings? While certainly not glorifying incest (and certainly not a practitioner) ; is not the notion of love the same whomever it be applied to? Are not the feelings the same? The ultimate punishment for Oh-Dae-Su, and ultimate revenge for our antagonist is not that Oh Dae Su unwittingly fell in love with his daughter, but that Woo-jin Lee had full knowledge when he possessed feelings for his sister, he knew the choices he was making yet could not control himself and his sister, and perhaps more importantly, they did not want to. Oh-Dae- Su's punishment is that he fell in love before the realisation of the 'real' relationship between he and Mi-do. His feelings for her were real throughout the course of the film, so the ultimate punishment is that he must stave his misconceptions and prejudices because he has now found himself in the same position as Woo-jin Lee was, when he began spreading the rumours when he was a teenager.Oldboy isn't about keeping your mouth shut, it's about staving off preconceived ideas and unthoughtful concepts, why are some things more bad than others? No one really has an explanation for this, merely that society has decreed it to be so. <br/><br/>Those hoping to find within this film an intense thriller which is high in entertainment value will not be disappointed as Oldboy works on all levels and most importantly and its most basic as a thriller. Park Chan Wook has created a deeply terrifying but highly engrossing movie which above all else is smart while the twist affects all of us as it makes us all feel violated and almost as if revenge had been committed upon us, as well as Oh-Dae-Su.<br/><br/>Perhaps i'm misinterpreting the pleas of those that disagree with me, but then again this synopsis is only the interpretation of myself, the Academy of Science Fiction/Fantasy & Horror Films USA, The Asia-Pacific Film Festival, Austin Film Critics Festival, Bangkok Film Festival, Bergen International Film Festival, The British Independent Film Awards, The Broadcast Critics Film Awards, The Cannes Film Festival, European Film Awards, Golden Trailer Awards, Grand Bell Awards, Hong Kong Film Awards, Online Film Critics Society Awards, Satelitte Awards, Sitges Catalonian International Film Festival and The Stockholm Film Festival...yes, I think we all got it wrong here."
"Green_Lantern_482","10","38","136","28 January 2005"," A Brilliant, Artistically Accomplished Thriller
","In Oldboy Choi Min-Shik (of Shiri fame) plays Dae-su, a man kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years in a single room apartment, before being released and given 5 days to discover the reason for his imprisonment. Okay, so you know the basic premise of this film. What is hard to convey is the sheer excellence of the performances in this film, or the artistically intriguing camera shots or even the absorbing nature of this intriguing thriller. Every scene looks stunning, the lighting and sets seem perfect from the drab prison walls that actually make you feel ill, to the cold steel of the office building with its clean lines and vapid design. Great care and attention has been taken when planning this film, and it shows. Park Chan-Wook deserves much acclaim for his direction and sheer effort in bringing this film to screen. The plot is also intriguing yet not overly complex and the pace of the film is punctuated by scenes of extreme violence which are somewhat disturbing, but never gratuitous when balanced against the nature of the world Dae-su has descended into. But all of the sets and direction only gain cachet when placed next to the performances of the two main players; Choi Min-Shik (who is simply astounding in probably his best role to date) and Yu Ji-Tae (from the enjoyable Korean horror/thriller Into the Mirror). Both men put in staggering performances of particularly extreme characters without seeming too grandiose. This baroque thriller is simply not to be missed by any fan of thrillers or Asian cinema. Yet I would warn those who have issues with screen violence and somewhat disturbing subject matter to look elsewhere. But all in all, I hold this film up as a true masterpiece, and unquestionably one of the best thrillers to be made yet."
"TwoThirdsMajority","9","12","35","29 April 2007"," Takashi Miike meets Wong Kar Wai
","When i first saw Oldboy back in 2004, i was just 13 years old. I watched it with my girlfriend at the cinemas just couple of hours after watching Alfonso Cuaron's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't enjoy it that much, but the film does make my girlfriend cry. However, i do like the dialog between Daesu and Woojin, as well as the corridor fight scene.<br/><br/>Three years later Oldboy came back to the spotlight. During the recent shootings at the Virginia Tech Institute, Fox News and Sky News claimed that Oldboy inspired the killer Cho Seng Hui to commit crimes. I wasn't much convinced by the news reports, and so i picked up a DVD of Oldboy at the store and try to link this film with the shooter. Because if i remember, this film doesn't have the GTA-style violence that will encourage people to commit violence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, i was right. This film is not that GTA violent at all. And it has only one gun shown at the film. However the good part is that it made me love the film more. Why? Because it made me appreciate the story, the feel, the romance and the tragedy of the film. I'm not really used to Korean cinema, but this film just blew me away.<br/><br/>The story of this film tells about Oh Daesu, a man who was sent to the police station on the day of his daughter's birthday. He was bailed by his friend Joo Hwan. However, just as he was to apologize to his daughter on the payphone, he was kidnapped, and was sent to a room with nothing but a television, a toilet and a bed for 15 years.<br/><br/>After 15 years, he escaped. He became unfamiliar with the outside world that he hasn't knew for a long time. During the time he was in that room, his only link with the outside world was the television. And he became familiarized with computers and cell phones, thanks to television.<br/><br/>However, his world changed. He was accused of murdering his wife while on that room, and his daughter was sent to Sweden. Desperate to know why he was imprisoned for 15 years, he sets out for revenge, hoping to look for the man responsible for imprisoning him in that room.<br/><br/>What i like about this film is that it has the brilliance mix of Scorcese combined with a Tarantino-ish dialog and some neo-noir backgrounds. Even if it's not an English film, but it is a film that will appeal to many. The directing was probably the most brilliant piece of artwork you'll see in a film. One scene has Daesu fighting a group of thugs in a corridor, and that scene is taken with one shot, which makes the whole scene look like a painting.<br/><br/>So is this film good? Of course it is. Sure there's some sex and nudity, and you'll need to read subtitles to enjoy this film, but the violence? Not that heavy. It's just only teeth removal, tongue cutting and a fight scene between a man and 30 gangsters. It shouldn't be blamed for matters like Virginia Tech shootings. However, if you're looking for a deep & thought-provoking film with touches of Tarantino & Scorcese in it, then look no further than Oldboy."
"ExpendableMan","6","24","81","4 April 2005"," Good, but not outstanding
","Oldboy, the Korean film so beloved of Tarantino has become something of a word of mouth cult film in the UK lately. As a film student myself, I've heard plenty of talk in seminars among other people on my course about this incredible movie that simply has to be seen but I wasn't swayed into watching it immediately because of one thing; it is director Chan-wook Park's follow up to Sympathy For Mr Vengeance. That previous film, while decent enough went on far too long and the end payoff was not quite worth it, yet despite this it was hyped to the heavens. So, settling down to watch Oldboy, I was a tad wary of the hype machine blinding viewers to the limitations of an otherwise unspectacular film.<br/><br/>Like Sympathy...Oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. A man named Oh Dae-Su has been imprisoned in a room for 15 years and when released, sets about hunting down the people who did this to him and taking his revenge. On the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of why he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. Lee Woo-Jin, his nemesis is at first a cold, calculating man fixated on destroying Dae-Su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. Furthermore, Park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, Identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences.<br/><br/>However, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling Park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. Sympathy...for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, but Oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, Oedipal tragedy. The infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of the film and can we really believe that Dae-Su is such a great fighter, when all the training he has done has consisted of shadow boxing? And whoever was in charge of casting needs a grand old kick in the balls, as Dae-Su and Woo-Jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age.<br/><br/>An interesting and diverting film then, but hardly the nugget of cinematic gold that some have made it out to be. Also, be prepared for some rather gruesome moments. In one instance, the lead characters eats a live octopus, in another a man has his teeth snapped out with a hammer and there are numerous cases of torture and violence."

","In 1988, a businessman named Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) is arrested for drunkenness, missing his daughter's 4th birthday. After his friend Joo- hwan (Ji Dae-han) retrieves him from the police station, they go to a phone booth for Dae-su to call home. While Joo-hwan is talking to Dae-su's wife, Dae-su is kidnapped, and wakes up in a sealed hotel room where food is delivered through a trap-door. By watching the television, Dae-su learns that his wife has been murdered and that he is the prime suspect. Dae-su passes the time shadow-boxing, planning revenge, and attempting to dig a tunnel to escape.<br/><br/>In 2003, 15 years after he was imprisoned, Dae-su wakes up on a roof-top with a suit and some money. He receives a taunting phone call from his captor, who refuses to explain the reason for his imprisonment. Later he collapses at a Sushi restaurant and is taken in by Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), the restaurant's young chef. After he recovers, Dae-su tries to find his daughter and the location of his prison. He discovers that his daughter was adopted by a Swedish couple, and gives up trying to contact her. Dae- su locates the Chinese restaurant which made food for his prison, and finds the prison by following a delivery man. Apparently it is a private prison where people can pay to have others incarcerated. Dae-su enters the prison and tortures the warden, Mr Park, who doesn't know the identity of Dae-su's captor but reveals that Dae-su was imprisoned for ""talking too much."" While leaving the prison, Dae-su is attacked by a large number of guards but manages to defeat all of them."
"lunarsociety","9","2","3","20 June 2016"," Really hecked me up
","I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started watching this film and BOY was I in for a ride. It's quite easy for me to get attached to protagonists and I often watch films with the protagonist as a focal point (a hard habit to shake when you're an emotional wreck like myself). Because of this I didn't see the plot twist coming at all. Understandably, it broke my heart as I had gotten quite attached to Dae-Su.<br/><br/>I will agree with other reviews that this film is expertly made when it comes to technical execution, but I didn't see the use for some of the more explicitly sexual scenes apart from them being uncomfortable to watch (and perhaps to make a comment on Dae-Su's sexual nature). <br/><br/>Any film that is capable of shaking you up to your core gets a good score from me, but this was also a really beautiful film to watch. In some ways it reminded me of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, though the subject of incest was dealt with in different ways. Oldboy deals with the very taboo subject in a more stealthy way, but both films make the viewer question whether there is a true distinction between good and evil."

There are enough twists and turns to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. It isn't a film for the faint- hearted, but I advise that you just buckle up and get ready for a wild ride.

","A friend recommended this and I wasn't sure it was my kind of thing, especially when I tend to lose track with subtitles, but I found this not to be a problem here. It is certainly a movie that you have to be alert to watch and keep up with what is going on. I'm not going to talk about the plot other than to say it is a roller coaster of emotions , twists and turns and keeps you interested throughout- it is unique. The direction makes you feel you are right there in what is happening, one of those movies where you really don't want to pause it or miss a single second. . Min-sik Choi, as the main character -Oh Dae-Su is incredibly good, his transformations throughout are worthy of any acting award going... I loved this film. I did some searches after watching it, to find out about Min-sik Choi and what else he had done..there is an article about some of the things that were not acting but really happened during this movie..check it out ..it's bizarre!"
"mistoppi","8","2","3","20 February 2016"," Shocking! A must-see, if you have the stomach for it
","To be hones I'm in a shock right now. <br/><br/>The story of Oldboy is absolutely horrible. And no, I don't mean it's written badly, I mean the story is so horrifying that after I was done I just had to sit and stare the screen for a while. The only thought in my head is: ""What the hell did I just see?"" This is the beauty of movies with clever plot twists that actually do surprise you: Oldboy, Primal Fear, Fight Club... I'm sure there are many more, but just making a list would be lazy. The plot twist in Primal Fear is just surprising. It's clever, but the thing is, it's not that bad. while Oldboy... That plot twist is absolutely shocking. And the story is well written even when you don't count the plot twist. The main character's narration gives a lot more interest to the story. The mystery is intriguing, and the writers have a way of keeping the viewer invested in the story. Even when you don't really like Oh Dae-Su, you still want to know why. And even Oh Dae-Su is not really a likable character, you still wonder if he deserved that. That would be an interesting philosophical debate.<br/><br/>There are a few group fight scenes in this film, and they are excellent. They are well coordinated and enjoyable (or as enjoyable as fight scenes are) to watch. The visual side of Oldboy amazes with how good it looks when it needs to. There were few gore-y scenes, yet nothing too horrifying was shown, so something was left to imagination. Still those scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a very well made movie. It's shocking, and I'm not sure how good it is when you watch it a second time, but at least after this first time I am astonished - and shocked. I'd love to recommend this movie but I don't know how risky that would be."

","Sometimes a film leaves you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside. It's a feeling of fulfillment and completion. A feeling that everything will work out and everyone is okay Oldboy is NOT one of those films. <br/><br/>Drunken buffoon Dae-su (Choi) is mysteriously kidnapped and inexplicably held prisoner for fifteen years by men he never sees. He is left only to watch the same television and eat the same dumplings every day. When he is just as inexplicably released back into a world that is now completely alien to him, his only mission becomes finding the man who imprisoned him, by any means necessary.<br/><br/>The twists and turns Dae-su's journey takes him down are jaw- droppingly outside the box, leaving the audience only to wonder whether Park is a thematic genius or completely insane nihilist. Based on an equally messed up graphic novel by Nobuaki Minegishi, Oldboy has become one of the best thrillers of all time, capped by one of the best blindsides that has ever been thrown at unsuspecting viewers.<br/><br/>Spike Lee attempted an American remake in 2013 starring Josh Brolin, which isn't entirely terrible in and of itself, but it's hard to match the intensity put forward by Park. If you haven't seen this film, don't ruin it by reading into it too much. Just turn the lights down, turn the flick on and begin to feel incredibly uncomfortable by the fact that at any moment someone out there could be plotting to absolutely destroy your life for no reason."

","First of all, I want to clarify that I'd personally give Oldboy a score of 9.2 or so but given the nature of IMDb's rating system if you like a movie you gotta give it a 10 Where to begin? From the amazing score by Jo Yeong-wook to the compelling and skillful acting of Choi Min-sik, Oldboy is, all the way through, a masterpiece. Few movies manage to be so gripping and at the same time so emotional. Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, a middle-aged drunkard who, after one of his many late-night drunken endeavors, mysteriously disappears off the face of the earth, leaving his wife and daughter. Turns out Oh Daeu-su is actually imprisoned in what seems to be a hotel room and he has to spend the next 15 years of his life there with no other human connection. After he is finally released, Oh Dae-su, now a shell of his former self, embarks on a quest to find the man responsible for his mysterious imprisonment and his reasons behind it.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a great journey through human psyche and you will find yourself thinking about it way after you've watched it. A must-watch for anyone who enjoys good cinema."

The hallway scene, is an amazing shot that has since been replicated by a number of other films, even the recent Netflix, ""Daredevil,' show features something very similar. This is the kind of movie you can watch 4 or 5 times and notice new things each time, even new character developments and motivations.

"emilkim","10","35","131","18 January 2005"," Cruel and Unusual
","Cruel and unusual...<br/><br/>Please do not mistake the above phrase as a negative review of this film. It is anything but. The movie is cruel; unforgivably, unabashedly, brilliantly cruel. Mr. Park refuses to compromise his vision in the name of our innocence and he and this film should be commended for it. All too often films, especially of the Hollywood variety, forsake artistry for commercialism, the honesty of tragedy for the fuzziness of fairy tale endings, truth for dollars. The very ""unusual""ness of this film arises from its very cruelty. It is embarking on territory rarely treaded on by conventional American films.<br/><br/>A man is imprisoned for 15 years. He gets out. He seeks revenge. He seeks the truth. The question is not whom but why. This is the basic premise of the film. It is not a complicated plot, and many such revenge films with similar plots exist, yet somehow this film is completely and utterly on its own plane. Maybe it is in the way Mr. park sets the mood - every frame is hauntingly beautiful, not just convenient to the story but as integral as the actors themselves, illuminating the human emotions that are such a part of this film. Maybe it is in the penultimate performances of its players, so truthful and lush that if Mr. Choi were to recreate his character on a bare stage, I would still be riveted. Some have had the audacity to accuse this fine actor of over-acting. To that I say if such is the case, then all the other acting performances that i have witnessed have been woefully under-acted. Maybe it is the wonderfully hypnotic score, or the vibrant colors or engaging dialog's(lines that are as memorable as they are fitting). Whatever it may be, I am a better film fan for having seen it.<br/><br/>Some may accuse me of exaggeration or hyperbole. Watch it for yourself. Ask yourself after you have seen it if it has not affected you in some real way, whether good or bad.<br/><br/>The mark of a great film can often be found in the lobby of the theater, or the neighboring diner, or (perhaps more fittingly) in internet forums, where the merits of the film can spark lively debates among those who have seen the film. It's images refuse to leave the recesses of your mind, and so you ponder, argue, proclaim ideas amongst those who have had the same experience. Such is the film Old Boy.

","I will admit right off that bat that I'm not a fan of the whole ""Asian Extreme"" phenomenon sweeping across North America right now; as far as horror goes, my heart is grounded in the Spaghetti Splatter of Fulci and Argento; as for revenge, Charles Bronson always ""makes the bloodlust grow fonder."" ""Oldboy"" takes a bit from both: a man is imprisoned for 15 years without any apparent purpose, and vainly attempts to break free of his shackles; once he does, he seeks out those who put him there, and embarks on a stylized--yet strangely 'civilized'--killing spree. For much of its running time, my reaction to ""Oldboy"" was a stupefied ""huh?"" It has a plot as excessively complicated as a '70s giallo, and often drifts quite far from reality (not really griping, as it provides the film with a disorienting, surreal sheen), but is simply mesmerizing. From the standpoint of visuals and camera work alone, ""Oldboy"" is as beautiful to look at as Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" However, like Argento, the characters are less prone to expressing their feelings outside the requirements of the plot, and while there is a striking humanity underneath the bloodshed of ""Oldboy""--it simply isn't enough to elevate it above its own obsession with surface quality. Too bad, seeing as how the potential for greatness is certainly present.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"Tweekums","9","6","15","11 February 2009"," A Classic Revenge Thriller
","Oldboy was my introduction to Korean cinema, and what an introduction it was. Initially it seems to make little sense the first thing we see is a man with a dog leaning backwards over the edge of a tall building and another man is holding onto his tie which prevents him from falling, this man says he has a story to tell. Then the story begins with the man, Oh Dae-Su, drunk in a police station, a friend collects him but while his friend is making a call in a public phone box he vanishes. The next time we see him he is imprisoned in a room never seeing his captor who feeds him through a hatch in the door and gasses him anytime something needs doing in the room. He learns from the television that his wife has been murdered and that evidence at the scene suggests that he is the killer even though he has been in his room for a year at this point.<br/><br/>As the years pass Oh Dae-Su plans his revenge while trying to escape but shortly before he manages to break out he is gassed again and wakes up outside on the roof of the tall building where he meets the man with the dog. After letting his story he leaves the man who then jumps but Oh Dae-Su does not look back. While looking at the fish in a restaurant window a stranger gives him a wallet and a phone. He goes inside and after eating a live octopus receives a call during which he passes out. When he wakes up he discovers that the girl who served him in the restaurant has taken him home. Although he initially doesn't trust her they soon falls in love. Shortly after this he is told he has five days to discover why he was kidnapped or the girl will be killed. He only has a few clues as to his captor but as he follows them and gets closer his life gets more confusing till eventually he realises what he did to earn such a terrible punishment.<br/><br/>The action is exciting and and a few places fairly gruelling such as when he uses a claw hammer for tooth extraction although some people might find the octopus eating more disturbing. Min-sik Choi did a great job as Oh Dae-Su and Chan-wook Park's direction was top notch. Although an English dub was available on the DVD I watched it in Korean with English subtitles."
"Mad-Scientist-Matt","6","6","15","27 July 2007"," Looks impressive, but hammer on it and you'll find it's hollow.
","This is a case of a movie where the director has lavished too much attention, too impressive cinematography, on a story that can't support it. Chan-Wook Park starts with an almost Hitchcock-like tale of a man abducted and held against his will by an enemy he could not see. It is rather moving to see his anger, confusion, and frustration come to the surface. Sometimes the intensity is broken by dark humor, the sort of comic ""relief"" that also serves to ratchet up the tension. And the sense of composition and style is first rate. It seems like it's sometimes a cross between Hitchcock and the Wachowski Brothers.<br/><br/>But they you start to see loose threads appear, and instead of tying them up, the climax just makes everything unravel. We know that the hero, Oh Dae-Su, has been the victim of some elaborate plot for revenge or sadism. But then we find out just how elaborate it is, how many things the villain would have had to have under his thumb to make them not be coincidences, how many times Oh Dae-Su had to make the wrong choice, and just as importantly, how many times he had to escape getting killed by dozens of thugs at the wrong moment. At this point, the movie stops being an assault on our sensibilities, and turns into an assault on the willing suspension of disbelief. There's a fine line between shock and schlock, the sort of violence that produces horror and the sort of violence that is so unbelievable it can only produce numbness or laughter. I can appreciate both, but Oldboy crosses the line into schlock at the end - and seemingly doesn't realize it. ""Laugh, and the world laughs with you?"" Maybe not, in this case...<br/><br/>When Hitchcock went for shocking, he could leave you thinking that the world is twisted and sick. Chan-Wook Park only succeeds in leaving you thinking his own imagination is twisted and sick. Not really the same sort of shock."

","I thought this movie was brilliant. A cool action, thriller, and mystery movie at that. Although the mystery genre is debatable, as the end of the movie explains facts rather than letting the viewer have the excitement of stitching the plot together to come to their own conclusion.<br/><br/>As for the Ending, I just spent the last 1/2 hour perusing the comments and message forums to check if anyone else hit on this fact. It looks like no one else has yet. Upon my first watching of the movie I thought, ""Cool...but, what a lack-luster and strange ending."" Albeit the ending does wane a little, bit there's a hidden gem if you look carefully (helps if you have the movie on DVD so you can hit the pause button).<br/><br/>***********HERES THE SPOILER*********** <br/><br/>A friend of mine in Korea pointed this hidden gem out to me while I watched the movie for the 2nd time, this time on DVD.<br/><br/>Remember this quote, ""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?"" <br/><br/>And this one...""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""<br/><br/>The spoiler is about the last scene...When Oh Daesu is sitting in a chair about to go through hypnosis by the very woman that hypnotized him and his daughter in the first place. He wants to go through hypnosis to forget the fact that his lover is actually his daughter. The lady tells him that sometimes the hypnosis doesn't work...Tells him to stare at a tree, then tells him to imagine walking 70 paces. Each pace that he walks the monster ages at a super-rate and eventually will die...leaving Oh Daesu behind. <br/><br/>The scene then changes...panning over a set of footprints...walking away...***did you see it***...finally showing Oh Daesu and his daughter embracing. The daughter asks Oh Daesu all these questions, what's going on, what are you doing here?, you'll catch a cold, etc...He embraces her. In the end you see the daughter with a very genuine smile, showing love in her eyes...On-the-other hand, you see Oh Daesu with a crazy-like-grin...leaving the viewer not-to-sure if the hypnosis actually worked or not. <br/><br/>Are we left with ""Oh Daesu  the real Daesu"" or ""Oh Daesu  the Monster""<br/><br/>If you have the movie on DVD hit the pause button near the end of the scene where the camera pans over the footsteps. (At the wide lens shot of the two lovers - daughter and father.) In the middle-foreground you will see hung to a tree the woman-hypnotist (she is camouflaged because of the coat she is wearing). <br/><br/>Recall the two quotes...""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live?"" ""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""<br/><br/>The movie has its faults, but I thought this hidden gem was pretty cool and made the ending more satisfying."
"chmilar","5","23","81","23 March 2005"," Excellent ending, but the journey suffers
","Oldboy follows a fairly standard story structure: The audience is presented with a ""mystery"" which the protagonist must solve. However, while pursuing the mystery, information and characters are gathered which are significant for the ending, when a huge surprise is revealed. Other films that follow this pattern are ""No Way Out"" (1987) and ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995).<br/><br/>The setup for Oldboy is: Dae-su is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years by an unknown antagonist. On release, he is given some clothes, money, and a mobile phone. He learns that he has five days to discover who his antagonist is, and why he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is devoted to gathering clues to solve the mystery, and this is the film's weak point. The director, Park Chan-wook, must provide the audience with all of the clues which are important to the ending, without telegraphing the ending. He must also make the search for clues interesting on its own - as if the audience is watching an ordinary mystery film. It is in the latter that Oldboy fails.<br/><br/>The story of Dae-su solving the mystery is not involving. Likewise, the romance that begins between him and a young woman is not developed very well. There is not much sense of character development, and events seem somewhat random. Director Park tries to spice things up with violence and odd behavior by characters, but it is just ""window dressing"".<br/><br/>In some mystery genre films, such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) or ""Lone Star"" (1996), the ""journey"" of solving the mystery is the interesting part of the film. The solution to the mystery is not particularly important, but the journey is entertaining and rewarding.<br/><br/>Not so in Oldboy. I felt bewildered as to what direction the film's events were following, and I was not engaged in the storyline.<br/><br/>A good test that Park should have used in developing the story is: If the ending was removed or changed radically, would the remainder of the story stand on its own merits? Would it engage the audience?<br/><br/>The ending of Oldboy has tremendous impact. It is very well executed, and very intense. It is too bad that the journey to that ending is so weak.<br/><br/>When ""No Way Out"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" ends, the viewer re-evaluates everything he has seen, and sees it all in a very different light. Oldboy's ending does not trigger such a revelation."

","I first saw the trailer of the movie, and it sure looked good. I'm a big fan of oriental Action movies. Oldboy received good reviews, so i rented it out. It has a brilliant unique storyline, with a disturbing and shocking twist and ending. The movie is about a man that gets mysteriously kidnapped and finds himself in a room locked. Not a prison, just a room, with a bed and TV and he receives food. The days turns into years, and after 15 years he is suddenly released. He is given a phone and message on not Why did this happen to him, but Why was he released. Sounds a little daft, but for those who have seen this movie, if you think about it, it makes sense. It is absolutely bizarre and not for the weak hearted. Oldboy had some magnificent violence that was recorded excellent. There is a fight scene, where he takes on 15 guys on his own in a hallway. The 2 minute fight scene was recorded in one camera take, and looks brilliant. Great performances, I still recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge."

","Amazing film. I visited Korea for the first time this year. As the country, Korean films are different from what you have seen and what you have experienced from a Western perspective. This movie has a subject that starts like a Kafka story of an individual facing an unknown repressive machine, but turns quickly in a sordid and personal revenge run that would be worth of the hand of Tarantino. I am sorry to use Western cultural references, but this is the best way to describe my impressions. There is actually much more deepness, a troubling, shocking but yet so human story beyond the action story line. There are tons of graphic violence and some sex, but they did not seem shocking to me because they were very much in the logic of the story. Acting is superb, and the story line, including the ending is perfectly logic. I am hearing that Hollywood intents to do a re-make and I fear the results. But maybe they can convince Tarantino himself to do it! One of the best films of the year to end, 9 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","OLDBOY is the second installment in Park Chan-wook's 'Vengeance' trilogy.<br/><br/>Oh Dae Su (Choi Min-sik) is a normal guy who lives a normal life with a wife and kid. One night when he gets caught drunk and disorderly, he's kidnapped and imprisoned in a room and is only able to communicate with the outside world by watching the TV that's in his room. One year passes by and still trapped in his room he turns on the TV and watches the news and finds out that his wife has been murdered, making Oh's rage grow and grow. Fourteen years later, he's released and starts to seek for revenge to find the person who stole Oh's fifteen years and murdered his wife. When he's released, he is given a mobile phone, clean clothes and money and meets an attractive young female named Mido (Kang Hye-jeong) who gets caught in Oh's quest for vengeance. But there is one rule in Oh's quest for revenge; the rule is he is only given five days to find his captor and his wife's murderer or else Mido will die.<br/><br/>OLDBOY is an absolute classic tale of the obsession for vengeance and Park Chan-wook has done an incredible job, but it's unfortunate that he didn't get the Palme d'Or at Cannes but at least he got the Grand Prix Prize. I'd highly recommend this movie to those who aren't squeamish, but if you are squeamish, look away because the violence is nasty and quite realistic."
"ajpelzek","10","27","99","19 August 2006"," Oldboy: a monster is created.
","This movie floored me. I first watched it at about two in the morning, and it was impossible to sleep afterward. I thought, ""Did I just see that?"" <br/><br/>Chanwook Park allows the viewer inside the paranoia of Oh Deseu's crumbling reality, wherein everything is suspect as manufactured. Bugs crawl on his skin, gas drifts into the room and knocks him out for indistinct periods of time, and he tattoos the passing years with stitches as his mind melts away. Pure animal instinct takes over completely. Trying to find the reason behind his long and mysterious imprisonment, Oh Deseu backtracks through a life of misdeeds. Numbness, time, solitary confinement, memory, and television have programmed him into a sick, revenge-bent machine. Once out, there is but one act in his thoughts, and that is to kill. Little does he know, though, that finding the puppet-master is far easier than defeating him. The ""justification"" for the entire episode falls frail in comparison to the punishment handed out, and Oh Deseu's love-tragedy plays out with a gravitational force, with an air of inevitability... like a feather falling to the ground. It is no matter that the blame for the original sin falls onto the puppet-master's lap, and Oh Deseu is but a scapegoat. The movie is a meditation on the many shapes that revenge can take, and the justifications and means humans employ to seek it. This tour-de-force details the molehill's evolution into a mountain, with only the passage of time and magnification of distinct memories to be held responsible."

","Stylish, violent, haunting Oldboy is not so much a movie as one of the most harrowing cinematic experiences you can go through, brutal yet cool. As thought provoking as it is vicious this is one of my favorite movies, it takes the notion of revenge and flips it upside down and takes it to new places, your not sure what your watching until it's too late. The mysticism along with the dark side of human nature bind together so as to hypnotize and beguile the audience. The action scenes are brutal and realistic, the kind that can actually happen. The dialouge is well written, the story well paced and the direction is excellent. I eagerly await the American remake, though I recognize the fact that it won't be nearly as good."

These people are just silly! They apparently have no lives to lead, which makes trashing these lives pretty darn easy.<br/><br/>That makes them all very unlikeable. And without concern for the characters, much of the shocking stuff was just... boring. While some guy was eating live octopus, I was swallowing down a brew with hotdog, wondering if this would bother with my digestion. I decided it wouldn't so I went out and cooked up another hotdog. Then my sister called, and I talked about my niece's school grades (they're improving), then I cracked open another brew. By the time I got back, the movie was over.

"MorgothsReach","10","4","9","31 May 2011"," A Modern Classic That Raises The Bar For Future Films
","Can you take revenge on someone for imprisoning you if you do not know the reasons behind their actions? This is one of the notions that permeates Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' that sees an ordinary man, Oh Dae-su(Choi Min-sik) imprisoned inexplicably for 15 years before being abruptly released and given 5 days to find out who locked him away. Opening with a terrified man being hung over a building by his tie, Oldboy never lets up in its furious pace as an urgent Dae-su attempts to piece together the reasons for his incarceration. Aiding him in his trials is the young chef Mi-do(Kang Hye-jeong) whose attachment to Dae-su is out of mutual loneliness and a secret unknown to either. Much more than an average revenge thriller the likes of which Hollywood continually regurgitates, 'Oldboy' focuses on the themes of isolation and of revenge itself as Dae-su uses his prison television as a companion during his separation from society as well as feeling and sniffing the first man he encounters after his release. Mi-do, in addition, recounts how she once saw a six foot ant in her train travelling home in a stylistically eccentric scene that references her assertion that lonely people imagine ants. As with the other two components of his Vengeance Trilogy - 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' and 'Lady Vengeance' - 'Oldboy' examines the nature of revenge itself and how the futility of it brings no closure but only more pain. This is apparent when it becomes clear to the audience that Dae-su's revenge is not the only one at work. Choi min-sik puts in a powerhouse performance as Oh Dae-su portraying the immature drunk from the opening of the film then descending into desperation and anguish before excelling as the post-captive Dae-su whose thirst for vengeance gives way to a more sadistic character who thrives on both receiving and administering pain. In the standout scene of the film - the now famous tracking shot - Dae-su fights 20+ thugs in a narrow corridor with a knife lodged in his back before smiling nonchalantly as an elevator opens to present even more assailants to him. In a film full of classic scenes this is one of the most exhilarating as we watch Dae-su cleave through his enemies like a force of nature. We are never in any doubt that he will win the fight; we simply sit back and admire the choreography and sound effects of Dae-su's callus hardened fists meeting various parts of anatomy with a force that is going to do more than just tickle. Kang Hye-jeong likewise puts in a tragic performance as the ill-fated Mi-do: the image of innocence who is corrupted by two opposing evils. In a powerfully symbolic scene Mi-do adorns a pair of angel wings, unaware of their significance as Dae-su's terrible scream roars across the screen. As Dae-su's captor, Lee Woo-jin, Yu Ji-tae delivers a twisted performance as the obsessive mastermind whose imprisonment of the protagonist is only the precursor to his elaborate plot. As the wealthy recluse, Ji-tae portrays a man perfectly in control who in his final scene descends into grief-stricken remembrance that allows the audience to understand but not condone his machinations. In his crafting of 'Oldboy' Chan-wook has delivered a modern classic that will stay with audiences long after the credits roll. Not simply a thriller but a meditation on the destructive force of revenge nowhere is this better epitomised than the final scene where Dae-su's lingering smile slowly fades into a grimace as he embraces Mi-do in the snow."

A lot of people either love this movie or hate it with a passion. The ones who love it are the one's who choose to give something a chance, have an open mind, and already know the best stuff is being made outside the US. The ones who hate this movie well, never mind, it's not worth filling up this space. I did like this movie a lot. Liked it when I first got introduced to it in 2003 by friends in Korea and I still feel it holds up to most movies in its genre. The story in summary is explained by others who've posted review and synopses of the plot so go there to read it but to compare this to Count of Monte Cristo is a bit dumb. Maybe if you stretched it you can see the comparison but come on, seriously? Fans of go-for-broke revenge plots in the vein of Seven will love this movie as it is the closest thing to it. Certainly it has some plot elements that are going to make American audiences squirm but it is a Korean movie not an American movie. Don't be detracted by the people who've given this such negative reviews. It's VERY raw and sometimes brutal but it is a revenge movie at its core. Also, I don't know what ""gore"" people are referring to in this movie as there is no gore. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gore. Brutality yes, gore? Hardly. Tarantino wished he could have directed this movie, 'nuff said. This movie rightly deserves it's rating."

The real winner here are the makers of the movie, the direction, cinematography, music, actors , their performance is immense and simply brilliant. The plot is complex but revolves around the life of Oh Dae Su getting abducted and locked in a prison for 15 years for no reason whatsoever. Then one day just like 15 years earlier he is released for one reason, to find he was locked. The rest of the movie shows how he achieves this and what are the twist and turns to achieve the same. The people who he meets during this time are really the real bearers of this story and the uniform brilliance in acting really makes the whole time spent on the movie worthwhile. The movie is very stylish, very graphic with blood and gore, very touchy on some I think this masterpiece is not given enough recognition over other similar movies. I hope this movie is never remade in any language since the subtle brilliance will definitely be lost in translation. I heard a Indian Crap was made lifting the story from OldBoy but we can blindly ignore the movie knowing nothing will even come close to the real masterpiece.

"johnnyboyz","6","4","9","23 August 2007"," I expect Oldboy to age rather quickly.
","Oldboy is a film that is colourful and cinematic. It blends martial arts and action in with a plot in such a way, it's easy to just ogle at the special effects and stunts on show. Oldboy in terms of these stunts and effects is just another example of Asian film and what they do so well but this is an example that was unnecessary. Certainly, you have your 'art' films in the form of Hero and House of Flying Daggers that rely heavily on sublime aesthetical quality as well as stunts and hypnotically good music but with Oldboy, it's like it's merely 'House of Flying Daggers: for teens' and this is because it just tries to gross the audience out whilst use a lame revenge story to fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>There can be no denying that Oldboy tries to tread filmic ground that teens will have no idea even existed and this comes in the form of voyeurism. There is a scene in which a boy sucks the breast of a girl whilst another boy secretly watches from a nook in the wall  what's interesting here is that not only is the third party's view in point of view format (meaning that it's supposed to signify us watching) but half way through, the girl pulls out a mirror just so that she can watch her own reaction to the activity being carried out.<br/><br/>The film eventually starts out like any other revenge film  a guy is back on his feet after a stretch in a prison of some sort and goes after answers as to why he was there. The film tries to play cat and mouse with a mysterious cell phone: 'Whose calling?' and 'Why are they?' Yes, I wonder. He also manages to shack up with a female character after an encounter in a sushi bar that involves a particularly memorable scene involving an octopus that I knew nothing about until actually watching the film. This is where Oldboy begins its journey of a revenge film gone very, very wrong and I don't mean that as a negative statement, it's just that Oldboy is so audacious and over the top in its delivery of rather pointless content that when you think about it, it's difficult to get too excited.<br/><br/>Oldboy fails to suck you in  it just doesn't create an atmosphere. Despite its ratings and 'disturbing content', I actually found the film to be rather upbeat, almost like a comedy at times. There is the humble breaking of reality when the film pauses and a dotted line showing the intended line of attack a hammer will undergo once that character swings it is funny more than anything else. There is also an emphases on 'nothing dialogue'. When two people are talking down the phone about a formal school girl from years ago who was, from their memory, 'a total slut'; I was wondering if this was meant to be funny or if it was setting up a character for later on or whatever  I was left confused more than convinced. There's also plenty of room for ancient Chinese or Japanese or maybe even Korean proverbs that characters spout to one another. This is Oldboy again trying to be something it is not.<br/><br/>In regards to the 'gross, sensitive' content, I say ""what content?"" The guy eating the live octopus was surprising more than it was gross  I've eaten both octopus and squid before (obviously not live) but so what? The sex? Well, what about it? Try Basic Instinct or Boogie Nights or anything else of that variety. Again, it's for teens: 'Oh look, a sex scene(!)'. The 'graphic scenes of torture' involves someone having their teeth yanked out.....for about three seconds. Again, try watching work from Takeshi Miike or one of the Hostel films. Yes, Oldboy was violent what with its hammers and its snapped toothbrushes and its broken up shards of compact disc but so what? Violence is in most films these days. To conclude: Octopus scene = Surprising; Torture = Brief; Sex = Soft; Violence = Graphic so that's one out of four done to a graphic extent.<br/><br/>Oldboy failed to impress me in ways it has others as I just know there are better films out there. It tried to be something that it wasn't yet at the same time, has some redeeming features that keep it from being an out and out 'bad' film."

On top of this incredible screenplay, the beauty of the scenes, the light, the music, the actor's play make of this movie and an incredible moment ... if you manage to let you dive into it."
"sebtwister","10","3","6","13 August 2017"," ""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone.""
","I finally re-watched this masterpiece from Park Chan-wook. When it comes to movies about revenge, I have never seen something as effectively shocking as this was. It made me remember why I was so shaken up by this movie the first time I watched it. Nothing can truly prepare you for the kind of deranged story that unfolds in front you.<br/><br/>The plot is about Oh Dae-su, a man who is kidnapped and confined to a prison where, with his only form of contact with the outside world being a television where you see someone of the worlds biggest events he missed out on. He also finds out that his wife is murdered and he is framed for it, leaving his daughter orphaned. He is mysteriously released by his captors after 15 years. He is left unaware who did it, why he did it or why he was released. While his life is consumed with revenge, he also falls in love with a young woman who works in a sushi restaurant. When it comes to extreme violence, this is one of those films where I found a lot of it deeply affecting to the point where I was just completely taken out of my comfort zone the first time I watched it. It is razor sharp in terms of its storytelling and it feels so rich because for all the twisted insanity that involves in front of you, it feels impactful in all the right ways. All of the characters, no matter who they are feel like their motivations are handled properly. Oldboy becomes a better movie with every scene, because every plot point that's revealed to you, it is just consistently riveting and I was noticing a few subtle new things on repeat viewings.<br/><br/>All of the performances are superb in this and I feel I would have to spoil things if I was talking about everyone, however I will say that I absolutely adored Choi Min-Sik's performance as Oh Dae-su. Everything is revealed to you from his perspective and everything about his performance feels real and believable. He has that wonderful mix where he is just completely deranged and bad ass, while also having down-to-earth vulnerabilities and weaknesses and this makes him easy to connect with as a viewer. It makes everything revealed to you feel so much more meaningful.<br/><br/>His fight scenes.... wow! Just wow! How can something so messed up look so beautiful? The famous hallway scene one of best fight scenes I have ever seen put to film and it is just staggering to me how perfect it looks. It's not so much the martial arts that looks impressive, it's the fact that the film isn't afraid to make the fighting a little raw and sloppy at times which makes for a visceral and painful looking scene. Seeing Oh Dae-su with a switchblade stuck in his back for most of the scene just has me grimacing. And to top of that it is filmed in a beautiful extended long tracking shot. As badass as he is in this film Choi Min-Sik also gives a wonderful physical performance and he looks like he is in pain.... a lot. He sells a character who only has one thing left to fight for in his life and that is revenge and you feel his desperation for it.<br/><br/>The music in this film is just beautiful. The use of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons to someone's teeth getting pulled is so indescribably twisted, I just love it! That piece will probably haunt me whenever I go to the dentist now. The rest of the soundtrack is so beautiful it almost brings me to tears listening to it by itself. Jo Yeoung- wook and Shim Hyun-Jung's classical score feels very contrasting to the visuals, and just feels so tragic and melancholic. The last track called The Last Waltz, is one of the most beautiful pieces in the film and just has me deep in thought as I'm meditating and processing everything that has just happened in the film. <br/><br/>I also appreciate how you get a few darkly funny moments in there as well. There's one scene early on, while Oh Dae-su is still held prisoner, where he decides to write a list of people who he think might be motivated enough to do something like that to him and he ends up filling up an entire journal of it. There's a few little moments like that where you see humour like that just sprinkled in and I love that. I simply have to see more films from Park Chan-wook, because in my opinion he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. It's both beautiful and brutal to watch at the same and it's just one of those films that held my attention from start to finish. It is such a riveting experience, that the 2 hours just fly by and it's shocking ending makes the film linger on long after it's over. It's a great story where you end up buying into every characters motivations no matter how you look at it and that's what makes Oldboy a truly special experience. I loved every minute of this."

","First of all, let me begin by saying that I love foreign movies. Before watching this film, I had pretty high expectations Sadly, I was disappointed. The story was decent at best, the acting was also decent, barely any action scenes, and after about half the movie I found myself bored from this movie. My only props for this movie is that the direction of the movie was good. On the other hand, it's not a bad movie. It's a nice movie for those looking fora decent foreign action movie with a few action scenes. I personally wouldn't recommend this movie, and I do agree with some people in the threads saying it's overrated. I couldn't find any reason why this movie got such a high rating."

It's not hard to tell, from the movie's poster, that it is going to be same thing. It isn't because i hate Spike Lee or something, it is because i don't believe the movie could be made to be as good as this one. I would also recommend knowing as little as possible about the story of the movie before watching it.<br/><br/>this is one of the best foreign language movies i have ever seen my entire life. the movie has a plot that is to die for and the last revelation would either amuse or give you a heart attack. The most engrossing thing about it is that it doesn't shock by using violence or unnecessary amount of gore but with a beautifully put together plot."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","24","90","9 April 2006"," An absolutely intriguing mystery
","I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason. Well, I'm glad I just decided to go 'what the hell' because it IS actually really, really good. At least I thought that when I first saw it. I'll be honest...in the 10 years since the movie came out it's not aged well.<br/><br/>Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews, I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets, imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for fifteen years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone. He has five days to find the man who imprisoned him and why.<br/><br/>An absorbing set-up, and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a dark sense of humor. The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns, always keeping us on the edge of our seats. It works on a first viewing, but once you know the big twist and the big explanation is delivered at the end it fails to be as second time around.<br/><br/>As is the case with almost every Asian movie, Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood. Because anything that the Asians can do, Hollywood can apparently do better. The US version by has-been director Spike Lee (at least he sounds Asian) might improve on some of the rough elements which date the 2003 version, but I can't imagine it being as good on first viewing.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and check this movie out, or wait for the remake to hit cinemas. A great mystery on first viewing. A bit of a bore from two to infinity."
"michaelRokeefe","8","18","64","7 December 2005"," Revenge can devour you and spit you out.
","Perverse, obtuse, profane, controversial; but award-winning revenge drama about a common businessman(Min-sik Choi) with a family and a habit of getting drunk after work being kidnapped and put in a makeshift prison. He is incarcerated for no obvious reason; his prison resembles a rundown hotel room... but there is no windows and a locked steel door. This becomes his home for fifteen years; he is finally allowed to watch TV where he sees that he is a wanted man for murdering his wife and daughter. He contemplates suicide several times, but mostly he works out and writes of his situation in a journal. Just like he was kidnapped, he is set free and being obsessed in his wanting to carry out his revenge...a young sushi chef(Hye-jeong Kang)helps him find his captors. This South Korean film includes scenes of torture, sexuality and ultra-strong violence. This one is not easy to forget. If you are serious about your movies, OLDBOY should not be overlooked. Also in the cast: Ji-tae Yu, Seung-Shin Lee and Dae-han Ji."

It was late and they were showing this movie for a long time, so along with me there were only 4 people in cinema.<br/><br/>It is dark, it is sad. Like after Donnie Darko - you feel melancholy for few hours or even days. I had few opportunities to see it again, but I didn't. After six months I did. Once again I was impressed.

","This thing won't let me vote lower than an 1. Never I have experienced such rubbish and incoherent muck as old boy. This movie screenplay is simply awful. The plot focuses on a man in prison for 15 years. And focuses on torture scenes and does not have much of a real story. The 2 hours that I spent watching this film was an absolute waste. And I will never get them back. Nor can I think of a worse way to spend 2 hours. This movies is also nothing but sickening images with no real purpose absolutely shocking storyline. The acting however was very good but everything else about this film is pure garbage. I don't understand how this movie got into the top 250. The only good things about this film were the acting which I will admit was very good. And the end credits when this pure junk was finally over. I have a splitting headache after watching this and I will never be able to erase this bad memory. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! staring at a blank wall for 2 hours would be more entertaining"
"ptgindubai","9","16","56","23 December 2006"," ignore the arrogant critics... this film is a breath of fresh air
","I apologise in advance as i'm going to rant at people who rant! <br/><br/>Just reading through some reviews, and stunned by negativity towards this film... Oldboy is superb! <br/><br/>It's clear that certain members of IMDb are perhaps trying to levitate themselves into movie critique stardom in a w*nky Simon Cowell sort of way. (I.e. their standards being much higher) Everybody is welcome to their opinion and I understand that this film may not be to everyone's taste, but even those who do not like it, should acknowledge its approach, its excellent score and wonderful presentation which is justifiably arrogant. <br/><br/>Most of the negative comments I've read tend to be aimed toward the story being far fetched..the violence, or the rationale of the main characters.. I don't know about others, but I have no benchmark as to how I would act if put through the same ordeal as oh dae su and whether you could resist such an intensive course of hypnotism.. and we shouldn't forget that we live in a world where there are individuals who walk into classrooms with colts ....... and there are others who can become so wrapped up in someone that they gain pleasure by spending all their time stalking them. so I ask why does it seem so unbelievable that someone could hold so much focused hatred and instead of releasing it suddenly, they gain pleasure and wish to draw it out. As to the rationale and thinking of the lead characters, It may depend on what you believe can be achieved with hypnotism and the depth and detail to which you can effect someone's thoughts. I firmly believe that 15 years to shape and plan the events of 5 days is sufficient time to create, according to some the 'too convenient' instances that occurred. <br/><br/>I'm sure my comments will be lost amongst review after review of people going through this film with a fine toothcomb...over-analysing finding things not quite right .... silly comments about ""certain parts not being realistic"".. ""the villain conveniently finding gadgets at the right time"" blah blah blah.... obviously fans of reality TV.. <br/><br/>so in short...<br/><br/>I urge you to ignore those that rebel against the general clique, cos that is a clique in itself..<br/><br/>I can only hope the yanks change their minds and their film media just encourage people to watch the original.<br/><br/>A well acted, hard hitting story A wonderful score Great presentation Beautiful cinematography And a Great twist<br/><br/>OldBoy is superb<br/><br/>PtG"
"hoarhaykoobas","10","23","87","23 October 2006"," Unconventional Love Story
","The love story, it seems, will continue to be told as long as we can tell it and in as many ways as we want. This is why OLDBOY is so refreshing; it takes liberty with as many cinematic elements it can hold from across the spectrum of action, drama and comedy without presenting another typified movie. Conservatives beware, your social mores are not taken into consideration here (nor should they). What really got my attention were the impressively long shots that intensified the action on screen by being in real time; no quick cut cheats here. Without giving away the plot (because I really hate when someone can't tell me about a movie without giving me a synopsis of the thing), OLDBOY is quite simply one of those contemporary movies that puts almost everything I've seen to shame. Imagine America's best movie-making innovators and take away the restrictions that our tight-ass MPAA place on them...you would get films like these; actual pieces of art."
"dontslityourwrist_yet","10","30","121","16 October 2005"," Please...
","I've seen reviews on this place that absolutely does not do the movie justice, accusing it of carrying no real message nor having any coherence at all.<br/><br/>While indeed Oldboy carries no philantrophic messages that make you walk out of your door an inspired man to make the world a better place, the storyline is amazingly well-crafted. While this may be the contribution of the manga it was based on, I believe the director and screenplay writers deserve part of the credit to as to why the story worked so well for a movie.<br/><br/>The director doesn't treat the audience as a dumb customer who paid eight bucks to sit down and get fed with Hollywood table scraps. He drops seemingly random lines that make sense later on, with the unveiling of the plot, step by step, graciously. Whereas some lambast this movie for being nothing more than a movie trying to be artsy and violent at the same time, I seriously don't find this movie as violent as claimed.<br/><br/>This is the part where the explanation that the plot has no coherence fails. People compare this with sixth sense and seven and commented that it lacks coherency and sound sense. I beg to differ. If you're too dumb to pick up the clues and hints of the movie, perhaps your brain is the one which lacks coherence.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie are brief but pleasant. There's no fancy martial arts, slow-motion clichés that the movie industry seemingly enjoy so much nowadays. Very well shot too, not the best fight scenes ever shot in movie industry but very well done.<br/><br/>The dialogues are clever and witty, with a slightly dark sense of humour. Very enjoyably so and the deliverance of these lines feel very natural and flows well with the movie, you don't get that feeling where it seems like the characters are saying it just for the sake of looking cool and badass on their screen time.<br/><br/>Very well-crafted movie. I look forward to more similar rare gems."

"abclaret","10","25","98","21 April 2006"," Stunning Revenge Cinema
","This was the first piece of South Korean cinema I ever saw. In fact outside of Kung Fu films, with the exception of Battle Royal, Id never ventured into Asian cinema before, I now know this is a big mistake, because of films out there like Oldboy. Its opened me up to new tastes and this still as to be my favourite film of the last couple of years.<br/><br/>Oldboy is about a Kafka-esquire antagonist, Dae-su Oh, who is being punished, for no reason he can comprehend. And the desperation he feels as he lurches to find out why and who is behind his suffering is pretty intense. All the way through the film he his latching on to the remotest of clues in the hope of catching his nemesis, but his rival as a few tricks up his sleeve. All pushing towards a conclusion with more than a few twists and an ending which is both disturbing, but reassuring given the circumstance.<br/><br/>The acting and visuals are excellent. I can appreciate people taking apart the story, it doesn't flow and probably isn't as logical as it could be, but with something this good you can sidestep some of your criticisms in favour of enjoying something so primitive and tragic, as a story about revenge."
"dbborroughs","10","30","123","13 November 2004"," YES IT IS THAT GOOD
","After getting out of a hotel room like prison a man searches for answers and revenge. The description is simple, direct and probably the best way to explain this great film. Its not that a more detailed recounting of the plot would ruin it like say the Sixth Sense, or The Village, rather its simply that the plot is so layered that to know more simply may result in too much confusion.<br/><br/>Containing a central performance that is simply one of the best performances of the last five or ten years this film is Oscar worthy from top to bottom, which is a shame since as of this writing the film has not yet been released in the United States where it would undoubtedly blow away almost any film it comes in contact with. Ultimately it is better than even the Michael Moore film it lost to at Cannes.<br/><br/>This is grand film making and I can not recommend it highly enough.<br/><br/>However be warned, its violent and dark at times. It will disturb you, the same way that Silence of the Lambs or Seven disturbed you (although there are no serial killers)<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"filmaker2002","10","23","91","31 August 2006"," Fantastic!
","Oldboy is simply one of the greatest thrillers ever made, and one of the finest films of the last 20 years. It is the rare film that ignites furious conversations and debate after a screening, and it's impact is felt for weeks after the initial viewing. Mr. Park takes his sadistic tale of revenge from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and multiplies its brutality to the 10th degree. It is not an easy film to sit through by any means, but when the credits roll at the end, you feel as though black is white, left is right, and day is night. The villain in the film is one of the most sadistic characters to ever appear on screen, and I would he think he even gives Hannibal Lecter chills. This tale of revenge goes places that no American made film today would dare to dream to even get close to, and its slice of ultra-violence delivers more than anything Kill Bill dared to serve. This one is a must see; it is the rare perfect movie."

Every scene and frame evidences painstaking care and consideration, even though the film as a whole is fast-paced. The choreographed action scenes are thoroughly refreshing and totally original.

Unrealistic or even stupid if you want; but well told.<br/><br/>On the other side what's up with people complaining about the complexity of the plot. If you know how to read subtitles, the plot is explained almost entirely by the words of the characters (Star Wars is a hard to follow story then). I mean, there are very good movies out there for witch I'm not even sure there's what you call a plot.<br/><br/>Violence?

","Oldboy is with out a doubt the most confronting film I have ever seen. The film is completely devoid of any comic relief or sentimentality. The exterior of Oldboy may at first seem convoluted and bombarded with cliché's however the interior of Oldboy is in fact the film's saving Grace. Various people will perceive Oldboy as your typical revenge movie that utilizes gratuitous violence as a tool for entertainment purposes, it is in fact completely in contrast to that, Oldboy is a heart rendering study of a man's burning desire to get both redemption and satisfaction no matter how drastic his methods may be. Occasionally the film's protagonist crosses the fine line between extremity and malevolence and although you don't condone his actions you can certainly comprehend why he does it. My favorite film of 2005, Chanwook Park has produced a film that is beautifully paced with flawless performances especially from Min-Sik Choi and a refreshing script, all of which is orchestrated at the hands of a cinematic maestro."

"xxxlongislandfilmsxxx","10","4","10","31 January 2014"," Best movie ever made, everyone must watch at least twice
","I remember a very long time ago when video stores actually existed. A long time ago before the general public became so despicably lazy, and actually left the house to rent or watch a movie. During this time my girl friend (now worst enemy) and I were at a local Blockbuster searching through all of the movies. This was a time of joy, picking up films, holding the box in your hand examining it's contents, art, description, looking to see who directed it, and whom the film stared. I remember finding Old Boy, looking at the shabby cover art then hesitantly renting it with her.<br/><br/>Once back at her house we popped her film into the DVD player, (something silly like Vampires vs Zombies) eventually she fell asleep during the movie. I then replaced the terrible movie with this golden cinematic master peace, I remember the feeling I had once the film reached it's conclusion and the credits rolled. I was literally in tears because I have never witnessed such a compelling, beautiful story, that had touched me as so. It was almost like a modern Greek tragedy. This film was so perfect, I woke up my girl friend, and made her watch it with me again immediately.<br/><br/>So what makes Old Boy such a brilliant, fantastic, amazing, astounding, extraordinary, genius peace of work? Many things. Let us begin from the ground up, the story. The Story is a sad tale of man who never was able to be a man. Symbolically of course. The film introduces Dae-Sue Oh (Min-sik Choi should have gotten an academy award for his performance) a drunken mess of a man being held in jail for disorderly conduct. Eventually his good friend ""Jim"" (I have no idea who the actor is or character due to my memory and the film being in Korean)bailing him out of jail. Dae-Sue Oh soon makes a drunken, empty promise phone call to his wife and daughter, then disappears in the rain. The film continues with him locked in a privately own prison facility for seven years. He doesn't know why he is there, or who exactly is holding him. For year's he slowly chips away at the wall with chop sticks and creates a small hole in the wall, he then tells himself he can escape with in a month. Unfortunately or Fortunately (depends on your view point of the films conclusion) he is released the following day. His only instructions are to find out who imprisoned him and why with in seven days.<br/><br/>I do not want to go to deep into the story because I dread giving out any spoilers to this movie. It is really amazing with twists and turns that not even M. Night Shyamalan can have in a wet dream. You fall in love with so many characters, and become so mentally attached to them. In fact you even learn to share feelings of sorrow for the villains. It is brilliantly written and evokes many emotions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I believe I am running out of words (word limit) to describe how much I love this film and why everyone should watch it. The main character, his love interest, and the main villain should all get awards. This director has set the bar beyond high for any film to follow. Oldboy's editing is superb. The music selection is spot on. Camera work like no other. Pacing that will have you on the floor because you fell of the edge of your seat fifteen minutes into it. Oldboy is hands down the best movie to be released in the world in the past thirty years."
"tedg","Null","25","105","17 February 2006"," Vertigo
","No movie stands alone. When we watch it, we bring all sorts of expectations to it, and a large part of that is the genre we expect. If we expect style, we are particularly acute in how we judge that factor, for instance.<br/><br/>In fact, we've come to rely on how a film announces itself. What I find interesting about this one is that it deliberately subverts any expectations we might have along these lines.<br/><br/>For example, most viewers will consider this a ""revenge"" movie, a very specific subgenre, and judge it on those merits. The problem is that the filmmaker goes out of his way early in the game to announce that these fellows are correct in their assumptions.<br/><br/>He then pulls the rug out from under those simple viewers, just as he does the hero. That's the art here, and you'll have to judge just how important it is to you.<br/><br/>I've become aware in the last few years how important the entry into a film is. The biggest, most shocking thing a filmmaker does is take us to another world. There are two big jumps he or she needs to make. The first jump is in the first few minutes, where the nature of the work is presented. If the movie is a strict genre film, this is easy because we have so many shorthand designators. Music is important.<br/><br/>The second big step has to do with the first plot point. In this case, the episode tells us that the hero (our surrogate) sees only what is intended. His perception is bent, manipulated. His TeeVee is our movie.<br/><br/>I registered this against films that weave stories about how stories are woven. The touchstone of course is ""Vertigo,"" where two forces or beings on screen struggle to create a ""movie"" in front of us, each one trying to define a false future that merges with the similar future of the movie we watch.<br/><br/>""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Open Your Eyes,"" even ""Tampopo"" are examples of this notion of storytelling, one that is intelligent and engaging. We have three entities as creators here. We have the guy we think is the master creator, Park, who we see borrows images as if he were in a drugged dream and can dream only in terms that he saw before he was locked up and gassed.<br/><br/>We have the supposed master manipulator, who hypnotizes, drugs, confines, bribes, and uses force and technology to make things turn out precisely the way he wants. Precisely, with no misstep whatever. Nominally he is the one creating the reality we see, but his manipulation is more perfect than that even of Park, so we know he is suspect.<br/><br/>And then we have the fellow that seems to be the puppet. But is he? He is the one that writes. Such comprehensive notebooks or diaries are common code in movies for something we enter. He is the one who dreams, for whom the images on TeeVee become a fantasy life replacing the ""real"" one.<br/><br/>He is the one with the interesting hallucinations that start with the purely hallucinogenic notion of exiting from a truck onto a grassy rooftop. He is the one who eats life, and in fact traces his roots back to the manipulator by surveying restaurants.<br/><br/>That business about snow and lost tongue and erased memory at the end. Shouldn't that tell us who imagined or created what we see? This idea originated in ""2001,"" where Kubrick played with the notion of who was narrating what we see: is it man, computer or deity?

","This movie is very hard to describe without going into the plot of the movie. It is very much a tapestry. If I start to unravel just one strand, it may destroy the tapestry. The main character, Dae-Su, after a night of drinking and being held in custody of the police, suddenly disappears on his way home. For the next 15 years he is imprisoned (not in a typical prison), with his sole companion being TV. The rest of the story revolves around the whos and whys of what happened to him. The story is complicated and twisted, yet very compelling. For the duration of the movie I could not look away, completely captivated by the story (and waiting for it to unravel). The cinematography and soundtrack is simply stunning. My favorite scene has to be his return of the place of his incarceration (especially the hallway fight scene - reminded me of many side-scrolling video games). The fight scenes are not martial arts masterpieces, but rather realistic throw-downs (I especially like the use of a simple hammer). The only draw back is that I wish I knew Korean such that I could understand the making of featurettes (and get a better understanding of the movie)."

","Having been collected in a drunken state from the police station by his friend, Oh Dae-su vanishes from the street and awakes in a locked room. Months later he knows nothing more about why he is imprisoned and is brought food. A year later he has been framed for the murder of his wife but still is none the wiser why he has been imprisoned or by whom. Fifteen years pass by and Dae-su has spent most of them driven by rage an a desire to get free from his prison. A month from breaking though the wall he is gassed and dumped on a roof garden inside a suitcase.<br/><br/>Being, in essence, a wuss, I took my time getting round to watching this film and braced myself when channel 4 trailed it with warnings for brutal violence, torture, sexual scenes and ""a scene where a man eats a live octopus""  suffice to say I was ready that this film wasn't going to be Disney. That said there is a feel of graphic novel about this (I think this is where the material has come from) and for all its brutality there is a dark sense of humour running across it. The plot is engaging mainly due to the level of mystery in it and I was held unto the end. The conclusion is drawn out for a bit too long but it is still quite clever and satisfyingly downbeat. Viewers should brace themselves for a certain amount of lack of logic across the plot  this comes with the heavily stylised territory and doesn't damage the arch of the film that much.<br/><br/>It is of course violent; there is no disputing that, and I did have to look away from the screen on several occasions. The torture scenes and such are within a dark context though and I found it a lot less violent than some Hollywood films that draw pleasure from gore and death  here it is dark and unpleasant and rarely exciting. Park's direction is impressive and the film has a great fell to it with plenty of style and clever touches but not to the point where it dominates proceedings  the style is the polish, not the whole show. The cast work surprisingly well considering that the depth of the film and characters does rely heavily on the rather convoluted and unrealistic setup. Choi is a powerful heart to the film, starting as a flabby drunk, transforming with rage and hate to the point of looking totally different while also making other significant shifts. The film very much belongs to him but he is well supported throughout. With perhaps weaker characters to work with Kang is good as Mido while Yu turns in a compelling and sinister character without ever losing touch with what has been driving him all these years.<br/><br/>Overall then an impressively dark and compelling film. The violent scenes (and one intense scene of animal cruelty) will put many off, as will the fact that the film doesn't happen in a real world but regardless it is stylish, engaging and compelling."

"aahari5","10","3","7","12 April 2014"," ""Even though I am worse than a beast, don't I have the right to live?""
","One of the many metaphorical quotes featured in Park Chan-wook's haunting masterpiece. I'm not entirely sure if it is correctly quoted word-for-word, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>Oh Dae-Su, the protagonist, is a spiteful drunk when he is first introduced to the viewer. He is a man who is so far gone that we cannot feel any significant shred of sympathy for him. One night he is kidnapped after missing his young daughter's birthday due to his drunkenness and is confined in a shabby motel-like prison. After fifteen years he is released and is given less than a week to discover why he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>During his, ""motel stay"" as I will call it, Dae-Su slowly re-evaluates his life. He begins keeping a journal of sorts, comprised of emotional letters to his daughter. He acknowledges his wrongdoings and becomes a wiser man, allowing us the audience to begin to empathize with him and giving meaning to aforementioned metaphor. By the time he is released, he has become a nobler and stronger man, driven intensely by revenge, and is now a character whom we can fully understand and identify.<br/><br/>Another metaphor used in this film is, ""be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they both sink equally"". I believe that, essentially, this means that what goes around comes around. At one point in the film, it is revealed that Dae-Su and Woo-Jin Lee, the antagonist and the culprit behind Dae-Su's imprisonment, attended the same high school as teens and that Dae-Su discovered a secret about Woo-Jin and then committed an act that left him with deep emotional scars and greatly impacted his life. During the final confrontation between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin, the latter reveals that Dae-Su's capture and release was carefully and precisely orchestrated so that an event would later occur with him in the same vein as Woo-Jin's dark secret. By doing this, Woo-Jin has gained the upper hand and has acquired an, ""eye for an eye"".<br/><br/>Overall, I think that this is a truly excellent and memorable film. The underlying themes of redemption and karma hit hard and left a great impact on me as a cinemaphile. Be warned, although this film is not graphically violent, it is still brutal and what is implied off screen is usually quite disturbing. That being said, this film is not to be missed. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time."

","I've always enjoyed watching movies, going to the movies, renting a movie now and then (until it got out of fashion). But I never really looked for interesting, awesome movies to watch that might not have the PR reach to get my attention. I always left it up to Hollywood to decide for me what ""good"" movies I get to watch. That changed with Oldboy. By some stroke of luck I got to see this movie with a friend about 10 years ago. We watched it again, right after. I've seen it over 10 times by now and it was an entertaining watch (at the least) every time. I told myself, if there where movies made by Asians out there, THIS GOOD, then I can't just sit by and not watch them. I got off my lazy ass and searched the Internet from top to bottom and I've been rewarded greatly. While I still enjoy South Korean Cinema the most, Oldboy has made way for me to discover some of the best I've seen from Japanese and Chinese movie makers. And none of it was or will ever be marketed in the western hemisphere. So, watch this, revel in its glory and go forth to find others of its caliber. IMDb is your greatest ally in this endeavor.

","The story is quite original. A guy wants to find out the reason why he has been imprisoned for 15 years. Yet in the end it turns out that he has asked the wrong question. Instead of ""why 15 years imprisoned"", he should have asked ""why is he let free now"". The choice of music in violence scenes is also quite interesting.<br/><br/>I find however rather difficult to empathize with those people. Both the ultimate motive and the ultimate punishment are about incest. Obviously in the Korean culture incest is taken really seriously and you are supposed to really suffer psychologically when you learn that you have had it unknowingly. Rationally I can understand it. Yet emotionally I can't feel it. My natural reaction would be ""okay. I have slept with my daughter/father. So what?"""

I thought this was going to be a movie about a guy getting out of 15 years of imprisonment for something he was not aware of, and then going around kicking butt and getting revenge. I did not realize that it would only have one good fight scene, that the characters would not be particularly likable (including the main character), and that when he finally got his shot at taking out the head bad guy, he'd instead grovel before him and cut out his own tongue to satiate the bad guy.

","I'll echo the majority of the viewers' sentiments, this film is brilliant.<br/><br/>I really did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch it, except that I'd hoped it would be a good thriller from a well respected Korean director.<br/><br/>And that's how you should approach this film if you haven't watched it, expect nothing, because that's when you get the most out of it. I've read a couple of reviews regarding the ""incomprehensible"" plot and ""rambling storyline"" and it beggars belief how these people have come to this conclusion.<br/><br/>In terms of plot and storyline, it's one of the most original and tightly controlled I've ever watched. From the start, when a man is put in a private jail without explanation for 15 years, you're drawn into the story. Then it just gets better.<br/><br/>Acting by the two central characters, the antagonist and the protagonist - at times they easily swap places, such is the clever story line and the brilliant acting - is outstanding. The energy and the inner rage with which both go about the roles was just brilliant to watch.<br/><br/>The music score was pretty much perfect for any film I've come across and the main melody is as memorable as any you're likely to come across in any medium.<br/><br/>The twists are not over-egged, as they don't need to be, and the gut-wrenching, brutal yet emotionally charged penultimate scene will stay with you for a long time afterwards.

","Yes a shout to all people who reads and posts or votes on IMDb. Because you guys make sure I get to watch movies that are awesome. If it wasn't for IMDb I would have probably missed out on many,many and many more movies, including: Oldboy.<br/><br/>When it comes to foreign films I used to be very skeptical. Why? Well most movies I watched when I was young where from Hollywood. But once you really 'open your eyes' you'll see that there are so many great movies not from the movie-factory;Hollywood. like: The Green Butchers, Adam's apples, Oorlogswinter, Grave of the fireflies, Spirited away and not sure but the kite runner. Anyway I think I could make a bigger list but then I wouldn't have time or enough lines to talk about Oldboy.<br/><br/>Oldboy starts of very funny. It doesn't really fit the rest of the film but its a great starter. Then it does seem to change drastically. I won't go in detail since I don't want to spoil anything. But every movie has a certain feel to it. The way you feel, like a taste on your tongue, keeps you entertained or not, simple as that. This movie has a very unique feel to it which I haven't seen or felt before. You get really attached to the main character which makes you put aside your own feelings of 'right and wrong' and condone fighting/killing etc.<br/><br/>This movie has everything you would expect from a movie. complicated characters but understandable, a unique storyline, love in a special way and twists and turns. But this movie shall never reach the top, as in a score 9+. Why? Because its not a movie every person would want to watch. Some scenes are very ...'special'. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Unique movie that is awesome in many many ways but not one to watch with friends or family that wouldn't understand these kind of movies."
"wynonasbigbrownbeaver","9","3","7","1 February 2009"," This movie is.....different....
","I don't even know where to begin on this most original movie.<br/><br/>What I like about foreign films in general is that they tend to stay away from mainstream ideas and this Korean hit is no exception. <br/><br/>In an overview of this movie, ""Oldboy"" is an artistic teaser of martial arts mixed with solid yet hysterical acting sequences. ""Oldboy"" starts out a little choppy as if direction was experimenting with acting and editing ""takes"" on film, but I soon adjusted to the style early on though there were a few confusing and erroneous scenes that still leaves me wondering at this moment.<br/><br/>It is all about this normal guy named Daesu Oh, who gets imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years and he winds up nearly insane in the process. He is somehow let loose into the changed society by mysterious means and is given a task to find out why he was held captive for all that time by an unknown voice in a cell phone he was given. He meets up with this younger lady whom has a mysterious connection to his recent captors, and soon after he unravels this huge mystery through various fights and interrogations. <br/><br/>The choreography in one of the fight scenes was rather entertaining to watch, where our protagonist in the story takes on a dozen or so henchmen with baseball bats and beats them all up even with a knife lodged into his back.<br/><br/>The role of the borderline insane Daesu Oh is a very complex one and his character is well defined and detailed. He is probably one of my favorite protagonists in recent memory. Direction properly detailed a psychological character as someone imprisoned for 15 years without any outside contact. I liked that part where he inhaled that squid alive. That was an example of a truly tormented soul. <br/><br/>The story left a couple plot holes in it, like the mystery of the hypnotherapist. I also didn't understand why would anyone want to go through the trouble of imprisoning Daesu Oh and releasing him just to play games with him. But the story is still original and I hope the Western world doesn't try to mock this story by creating a remake like they did on ""Quarantine"" and what they are about to do on ""Let the Right One in""<br/><br/>Overall, this gives me a good impression of what Korean film has to offer. This is something different and I recommend to watch this at least once."

","This contains light spoilers, maybe no more than a synopsis<br/><br/>Beforethis movie, my contact with Asian cinema had been minimal, not to say nonexistent. After all the comments about it, which, at the time, I judged overrated, I decided to watch it. What i got was the certainty that it was not overrated at all.<br/><br/>Oldboy serves the viewer with scenes that are like punches to the stomach but gives plenty of pauses to recompose. Both these moments are always beautiful in some way, and never irrelevant.<br/><br/>The characters are quite believable and easy to love, although the story itself has a taste of fantasy to it. Oh Dae Su's drama, due to excellent acting, becomes very tangible, making it hard to remain unaltered throughout the film.<br/><br/>The plot begins introducing what the main character was, the old Oh Dae Su and how he came to be what we see in screen most of the time. After being kidnapped, Dae Su spends 15 years of captivity with only a television as companion. During this time, he learns that his wife was murdered and he was the only suspect in the case. Being released without any clue as to why was he captured in the first place, he starts a hunt for the one who caught him and killed his wife.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a masterpiece that speaks of the two stronger human feelings, love and hatred. Being part of the Revenge Trilogy that was expectable but Oldboy does it so well and without repeating its counterparts, that makes it unique among films of the same genre and theme. If you like cinema to feel and think, then Oldboy is mostly recommended."

I'm a little disappointed to admit that I neither love or hate Oldboy.<br/><br/>Oldboy is not a bad film, but it didn't bowl me over as I'd been hoping - maybe the months of anticipation meant that my hopes were always going to be dashed.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that it's just not very well explained. OK, that can be expected in the beginning where we are all as confused as Dae-su Oh, but too much of Oldboy is played out without the audience having much of an idea about what they're seeing.<br/><br/>The explanation, when it arrives after a brief period of simplistic detective work, is something of a disappointment and, frankly, seems fairly trivial compared to the effort expended on exacting revenge for it. Dae-su Oh had forgotten the incident himself, and I really couldn't blame him.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely worth watching for the great atmosphere and some nice set pieces, but a little underwhelming in the final analysis."
"SkinnyElephants","9","20","86","6 April 2006"," Critic vs. ?
","Oldboy is not for everyone. For those of us that have seen it, it's extreme in every sense, including talent and direction. Being loosely based on a popular Japanese manga, the film evolves into something completely else as the movie progresses both in time and content. The opening scene is Dae-su holding a depressed and deranged man by the tie on the roof of some tall apartment building, however the story doesn't actually start from there, the film shows us the progression of Dae-su's character up to that point in a believable manner. Granted, the time changes are not like say, 21 Grams but definitely pace back and forth through stylish editing but more importantly the progression of the potential mystery. Chan Park uses his choice of wide shots, as well as extreme closeups, unusual but impressive angle choices, some of which are obscure. And he pays an awful amount of attention to color schemes and set design. Lighting is far beyond most Hollywood films and his mastery of tone control for the movie is excellent. And the acting is simply amazing.<br/><br/>That said, the film is not perfect. It will never be part of Time Magazine's top 100 films but there are no obvious directorial flaws in it. If one suggests a disapproval, that is exactly what it is, a difference of opinion. Chan Wook Park has style, it's just a matter of whether that will float your boat or whatever, sink it. The last reviewer described the film as being a waste of time and tried to point out what were apparently close connections to Ichi the Killer. Well, I couldn't disagree with you more, Miike is an exhibitionist and nothing more, his films never peak past interesting. Miike also makes sometimes several films a year, none of which show any growth, all proving to reflect very little style. Where Chan Wook Park tells you a story with obvious character development (mind you, he does it with stylish techniques), Miike wants to disturb you like a bully, never really working out more than a sigh from me and I can only assume that a real film critic would agree. There are stylish directors out there that I won't fanboy myself over but can respect, Tony Scott and maybe ever Gasper Noe (probably not), but their style is all integrated into storytelling, Miike never does and probably never will...it's quite obvious whose film was the best in the Three Extremes. I promise you folks, don't pick up Oldboy, that is not what I am saying...what I suggest is you rent it immediately if you want to see something vividly entertaining, stylish and good.<br/><br/>To the last article writer: You don't know diddly-skeet about Korean cinema."

There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).<br/><br/>The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and ""Hammer time"" to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!"

","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, a man is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Number 2 sees a controversial choice: a film that has in fact been passionately set on fire with denouncement by a number of critics. Nonetheless, what I find in Oldboy is comfort of a strange kind. What Park Chan-wook creates in his twisted and surreal world is an untouchable empathetic consistency. The protagonist, named Oh Dae-su (Min Sik-choi), is quite frankly the most three dimensional, intriguing, inspiring and hard-hitting character ever to grace the screen. His conduct is real yet fantastic, defiant yet compassionate. Aside from Oh Dae-su's remarkable and unmatchable persona, sweetly showcased by his narration of the taxonomy of rock bream whilst indifferently wearing a stolen pair of women's sunglasses, or as he walks away, undisturbed by the suicide-by-falling of a man he has just told his story to, and what this brings to not just the film as a whole but its ability to connect with a certain breed of audience, the directing is arguably flawless. If one only has five minutes to spare, I recommend taking what could just be the most impressive scene of stature and presence in the history of cinema: the corridor fight scene, shot over four days (it is a continuous one take with only correction of punches comprising the totality of the computer editing intervention), where we are shown a trademark of the calibre of filmmaking that Oldboy contains. I've never seen anything like it. I watch it again and again, dumbstruck to its perfection, as composer Jo Yeong-wook's magnificent and moving score sombrely serenades over the visuals. Oldboy touches on some controversial and taboo subjects which deter the average viewer, but to the trained eye what Park has done with them is to create a piece of cinema that rip-roaringly strips back the layers of the heart to ultimate bareness, whilst still including some of the best action shots in any film to date. Oh Dae-su's tormented soul, battered and bruised both physically and mentally throughout, compliments the captured transition of his mental state into a 'monster' as well as the finest white wine with fish. Lee Woo-jin's distress, his patience and craftsmanship of a bizarrely pleasurable witty kind of sociopathic torture is portrayed with uncompromising genius: studying the sheer power of the final scenes in his penthouse and his ultimate relinquish into decline is taxing and infesting. Many cast Oldboy aside as a publicity stunt, and fail to see past the octopus. What I'm trying to say, in the end, is that Oldboy earns its place as the second greatest film ever made because of how is depicts the depth that human emotion can delve to."

"AhmedSpielberg99","8","2","4","29 August 2018"," One-Of-A-Kind Revenge Tale!
","Amélie's quirkiness, Tarantino's violence and gore, interesting characters, intriguing plot, profound philosophical questions, and insanely cool action sequences made this gut-wrenching revenge tale the most gripping, entertaining, and enthralling movie of its kind, except it's actually one of a kind!<br/><br/>Amid the gruesome scenes, and the brutal fight sequences, Oldboy has a very emotionally devastating story. Chan-wook Park could have easily leaned on nothing but the action and the gore to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning. Instead, he knew that if there is anything that can attract the attention of the audience, and make them invested in the protagonist as fast as possible, it would be a thoughtful moral philosophy mingled with a sentimental story. That's how Chan-wook Park captivated the viewers from the opening scene until he evoked a catharsis in the audience at the traumatic third act.<br/><br/>Flawless is a very weak, and unsatisfying word to describe the third act. It's simply look like nothing you've seen before, or even you'll see. With its twist reveal, to the outrageous and shocking visceral images, the third act is provocative, distressful, and utterly maddening. But nothing would have worked in it, and in the entire movie as a whole without Min-sik Choi's kinetic multi-layered performance.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nod, at least for Min-sik Choi's incredible performance, is as infuriating as the movie itself. For me, Min-sik Choi delivered one of the best performances in the past decade. Yes, I would easily put his performance alongside Adrien Brody's in The Pianist, Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator, Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. But all that thanks to Chan-wook Park who allowed Min-sik Choi to show all his talent challenging him, and his pathetic, Dae-su Oh.<br/><br/>What is truly impressive is how Chan-wook Park put us in Dae-su Oh's shoes by changing the tone, so gracefully, to resemble how the protagonist feels. The movie starts off with flashes of dark humor matching how mazed and lost the character feels. Then, when things become more clearer and clearer the tone becomes darker and darker till the climax when the movie became acutely distressing and dreary.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, these tonal changes didn't work very well at the second act. Not because the tonal shift wasn't smooth, nor it came abruptly, but because that was the time when our protagonist, as well as us, discovering clues, and collecting pieces to get the whole picture. The whole act was very convoluted, for better or worse, but the thing is that the pacing was madly rushed resembling Dae-su Oh's confusion and ignorance. Not to mention, there were some sequences where we get to know about some very important characters, and some specifics related to them. Adding insult to injury, some of these details could be passed up, because they are simply not that important. The result is that the movie almost lost me a couple of times. I mean that I really lose track of some small details.<br/><br/>Oldeuboi is a very powerful, thought-provoking, and visceral film, and that's because what it implies more than what it depicts. I think it's the first Korean film I watch, and it definitely won't be the last. Just help me with some recommendations, if you wouldn't mind! :)<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

I am in shock because Oldboy is currently one of two films that I have realized that everything in the film is done for a reason; there is a cause for every scene, no matter how seemingly unnecessary, that the director will show later in the movie. The other film is Deer Hunter. <br/><br/>Despite being a film from 15 years ago, Oldboy is more intriguing than the comic book and action films of today, because of its unique fighting scenes and plot line. I was pleasantly surprised that the film totally unlike typical Korean dramas, totally shifting my perception of Korean cinema."

","As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.<br/><br/>Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff."

","I heard countless times how good of a movie this was from critics and fans alike. I watched a preview for it and what I saw was an action movie. While there is a few action scenes (one in particular that was beautifully shot) this is by no means an action movie. There are some cringe worthy moments of torture but it all works and not over done. Most of it happens on screen and you only hear what happens.<br/><br/>The plot is about a man who was kept under watch in the same room for 15 years. He is released out of the blue and has vowed to find out who and why this was done to him. He meets a young girl named ""Mi-do"" and they quickly find a sense compassion and love towards one another.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds we learn about who and why. When we the audience find out the reason I was blown away. Not since I watched the first ""Saw"" movie did I feel so shocked. It was one of the most brilliant twists I've ever witnessed and made me feel for the character even more because of it.<br/><br/>I haven't watched the American remake and don't intend to after the horrible reviews and plot changes I read about.

On that count, it does not disappoint. It is a chilling depiction of a man who has been imprisoned for 15 years without knowing the reason for this punishment. The performance of Chao Min Sik is absolutely phenomenal. By portraying Oh Dae-Su, he completely owns the role and shows the desperation and want for revenge effortlessly. This is not a film for the weak-hearted as it contains several scenes of graphic violence which can't be handled by everyone. A must-watch for all cinema-lovers, this one can definitely rival the best movies that have come out of Asia.

","Oh yeah.. what a movie it was. The best climax I have witnessed in years. Though the story starts in a confusing way and one might find hard to relate the changing scenes but as the movie progresses all confusion goes out of the window. One can't afford to leave a single scene as each moment is like a piece of puzzle that you need to form a final picture. The story has been told from two points and the points meet at the end of the movie and one should be careful as it may cause some serious shock. Many would criticize the story writer for such disgusting ending. Oh, but that is not me. The plot is the boldest I have ever seen, and I loved it to the last minute, not all directors will be able to finish with that audacity.

"Creepy-Suzie","10","2","4","28 April 2015"," This Asian gem left me hungry for more.
","This film gets a 5 out of 5 stars in my book. The story is compelling, and while this is not a traditional horror film (more thriller actually) it is vastly discussed in horror circles mostly because of its notorious ending. Park's journey to the ultimate revelation of horror is just as tumultuous as the finale. There is constant movement and a symbolic use of coloration, especially regarding the womb-like prison abode.<br/><br/>We first see Oh Dae-Su as a stumbling drunk in police custody grasping at his daughters pale feathery gift although her birthday is only hours from over. Abruptly he is imprisoned not by the police, but by some unknown captor for what ends up being a drug induced and hypnotized 15 years. Oh Dae-Su becomes mentally and physically strong both despite of and because of this. Although he has aged in captivity, he almost appears younger upon release. He intermittently sinks into madness, losing track of time but by hash marks in his little hotel type room only to emerge back onto the surface of relative normalcy later, and then screw his daughter.<br/><br/>This is a story of vengeance as it plays out man against man (actually family against family) upon Oh Dae-Su's subsequent release. He searches for his captor for retaliation, but his captor has just begun the little game he has in store for the hapless Oh Dae-Su. I did not see this ending coming necessarily. (No pun intended.) I made a guess toward the end, but dismissed it that no movie would go that far. It did. Holy cow did it. This is one of the best films I've ever viewed, and I'm not just being kinky OK maybe a little.<br/><br/>I was immersed in the plot for the entire running time. Lighting was good, but the street gave a necessary darkness in the beginning. The fact that there was almost constant motion added so much to the flow of the film. Special effects were awesome as was use of color particularly during the hypnosis scenes. I really can't say enough good things about this film. If your hungry for some twisted Asian cinema, check it out. I wonder if that means you'll want to see it again after two hours?"

"Eternality","9","2","4","31 July 2010"," Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before.
","Critically-lauded and an audience favorite, Oldboy is arguably Park Chan-wook's best film to date, and one of the key works of contemporary Korean cinema. Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes, Oldboy lets fly an intoxicating sense of atmosphere, an otherworldly, surrealistic feeling that sucks the viewer into the ghoulish noir world Park has conceived. We are introduced to the lead character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), at the onset whose life story forms the core of Oldboy.<br/><br/>Park's objective treatment of Dae-su is clever. The latter appears to be relating his story to the audience but it seems he is just as confused as we are. Yet we are willing to listen to him, to empathize with his situation, and to follow him on his quest to dig for the truth. Now, Dae-su is quite a poor chap. He has been locked alone in a room by a captor for the last 15 years, and then out of a sudden he is released with only five days to unravel the mystery and find his captor.<br/><br/>Oldboy starts out as a promising mystery-thriller, then turns into a love story, and then becomes a mob-vengeance flick. And when the pieces seem to have fit the puzzle, Park pulls the rug under us with a stunning revelation that builds the film up to its tragic conclusion. It is difficult to pigeonhole Oldboy into one or two specific genres because it breaks the conventions of every associated genre, resulting in a film best left to be admired and appreciated according to its own terms.<br/><br/>Park is a very skilled filmmaker; he has created a signature visual style that is present in most of his works – a morbid coldness that gives viewers a sense of unease through odd color tones, unorthodox shots, and numbing violence that seem almost too nonchalant. While he could be accused of being overly indulgent in brutality in Thirst (2009), in Oldboy however, the violence makes complete sense.<br/><br/>A few of them remain etched in my mind. One, the tooth torture scene in all of its g(l)ory. Two, the tongue-cutting scene, which is more painful than it impliedly suggests. And lastly, the controversial scene that shows Dae-su eating a huge octopus alive after he is released from captivity. Now, you may wonder why Park goes to such an extreme extent to shoot these ghastly scenes of suffering. The reason is simple – causal action brings about consequential reaction.<br/><br/>As Park slowly reveals key plot points during the course of the film, it becomes clear that violence is not a means to an end itself (this is the nature of many ""torture porn"" films), but a meaningful part of a whole. Mi-do (Kang Hye-jeong), a young woman who works in a sushi bar, meets Dae-su and falls in love with him at an inopportune time at the crossroads of violence. When not seeking sexual solace in Mi-do, Dae-su would react (almost always violently) against his captives.<br/><br/>In perhaps Oldboy's most brilliant sequence (a nostalgic throwback to those Street Fighter video games), Park choreographs a long take showing Dae-su fending off hordes of knife-wielding, rod-swinging street gangsters as he makes his way along a dirty, dimly-lit corridor from left to right. Such is his determination to stay alive that even with a knife plunged into his back, he continues to punch his way through.<br/><br/>Misogynistic and cold-blooded, Oldboy is Park's vision of a world ravaged by tyranny, vengeance, misanthropy and masochism. Yet, he finds bizarre beauty in all of this ugliness. Based on a comic by Minegishi, Park's story is absorbing and consumes you whole. Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of ""action-reaction"" events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before. I could only offer my sympathies to the characters. Even then, I know that is not enough.<br/><br/>SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

As well known that this film is highly appreciated and has been praised since its released and is considered one of the greater Asian films along with films in general (of its time). To start off, at first the film is quite confusing but also the pacing and motive of the film is never dull.<br/><br/>There is constantly something which makes it engaging and a major part is due to the filming, direction and overall visuals and scenery. It really does look wonderful even after all these years. Some really great shots and scenes which stand out and capture this film as great to look at. One of course, is the hallway fight scene with Dae-su fending off many guards.<br/><br/>Although having watched this movie with subtitles, there were still some slight confusing during several scenes but after reading few reviews and reading its trivia or key points, it helped give a better understanding. As a whole Oldboy is very well done with its action sequences, it's drama and its overall mystery.<br/><br/>Oldboy is clearly quite a twisted tale and isn't for everyone. It has a very fresh feel about it within its tone, and the acting is well up to par. There are some questionable scenes which have been mentioned before (Dae-su eating the live octopus?) but overall those scenes make the film stand out.<br/><br/>The twist and overall explanation of the twist in the end (around last 30 minutes) how everything unfolds is well told. There are more than one twist but of course we are familiar with the major one. Having known of this major twist (father-daughter) prior to watching, was very keen and expecting it but did not know how it would unfold. Although it somewhat ruined the overall viewing experience.

","The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture.
Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable.
The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo.
Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient ""naturally forced"" occurrence to today's ""artificially forced"" occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system.
Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath."

","Absolutely brilliant in its first few scenes (and a damn good first hour), which set the tone for a wild ride and showcase director Park Chan-wook's impressive visual flair. The mystery of what's happening to this guy is intriguing, and as he himself tries to figure out, we get a very creative fight scene in the corridor (among lots of other things, cough, octopus). It's no wonder Tarantino liked this film so much, as its main theme is revenge, it goes for those big, squirm-inducing shock moments, and it's quite stylish. For me it fizzled a bit in the second half, as I saw more of the nemesis character and the story was revealed. Much as I tried to suspend disbelief (and not think too much about the misogyny), several big moments in the plot seemed contrived, and it seemed kind of messy, wanting focus. Still entertaining though, if you're in the mood for something dark."

This movie was very intense, but in no way as gross and sick as many I've seen in modern times.<br/><br/>The story is good, and like many martial arts movies where you know the hero can't possibly take on that many villains at a time, but he does anyway, you suspend reality and just go with the story.

","Since watching the Best Picture winner, ""Parasite"" (twice within the same week), I've made a list of Korean films that I need to watch. ""Oldboy"" was at the top because I've heard that Tarantino liked it and it was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000's. After watching this film, I was in a trance. The story is based on a graphic Japanese manga. It follows a man who gets kidnapped and incarcerated by mysterious forces, spending 15 years. Through means which I can't describe in words due to the graphic nature, the man comes back to real world but is given a limit by his mysterious captor to find out the reason of his incarceration. Much of this film is filled with surreal imagery, which is also complemented by the editing. It is very violent and graphic-possibly the most violent film I've seen.

The sense of time is also built up with his physical transformation by sliming down and the calluses on his knuckles staying consistent throughout the film.<br/><br/>Once released the chase begins to find out who imprisoned him and why. The reason is so incredibly messed up, and Lee Woojin's refusal to admit even the slightest bit of responsibility he had in his sisters death is sad but realistic.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love about this film and it's a shame that the Americanized ""remake"" did it such a disservice.

I think if I were Korean i may find this less of a masterpiece, as to me this film was new and different, and reading the subtitles meant i didn't get bored easily, and if I missed a few of the words out it left more guess work which i like in a film.

It's repulsive, the plot seems convoluted, there are times when the director,well, one might say, he seems to go too far... I'm just not surprised by the polar opinions about it. There are ten star ratings, there are one star ratings. I'm definitely in the ten-star side. It's epic, it's ambitious, and I bought all of it. WHY? Uh. It's not like me. I'm meek. I wear glasses. I don't know how to fight. I don't like Dae-su and I don't idolize him. I guess that's why Oldboy is entertaining for me. It's someone else's life, in relentless detail.

The visual flair of this Director shows up many contemporary Hollywood film makers for the talentless hacks they are. No wonder every half decent movie from the far east gets instantly ripped-off or remade by the Hollywood money machine. It seems in the US only profit matters and originality, style or imagination is of no consequence. There are notable exceptions we all know and love but generally the Hollywood machine is as bloated and redundant as many of the dolts who queue up to watch the dross it churns out.

"therealwetwilly","10","22","105","18 October 2004"," After 15 years of imprisonment, a man seeks his revenge
","Based on the acclaimed Manga comic book, Oldboy is a sharply made, slickly edited revenge thriller which sees Choi Min-sik playing Dae-su Oh, a man who has been locked up for the past 15 years. Understandably aggrieved at losing a decade and a half of his life, Dae-su Oh escapes his hellish confines and decides that a spot of revenge wouldn't go amiss. Cue quite a bit of bloodshed as he begins to retrace the steps that led to his mysterious capture and confinement all those years ago. <br/><br/>Unlike other revenge thrillers doing the rounds, there's no pithy sense of higher justification invoked in Oldboy. Rather this is a cinematic jolt of adrenaline, a crushingly violent and unflinching look at pure and simple vengeance, recounted with a breathless skill and dexterity by a confident director. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino apparently fell in love with the film while presiding in Cannes this year(2004) and awarded it the Grand Jury prize, and an American remake is already on the cards. A final word of warning: since Oldboy contains some of the most fiendishly inventive scenes of violence this one was probably not designed with your granny in mind. <br/><br/>4,5/5 stars!"
"bumfromkorea","10","18","84","9 June 2006"," A great exploration of the nature of vengeance
","Make no mistake; this isn't just a simple cheap revenge thriller. This is one of those movies where if you don't pay attention and focus, you'll think the movie is pointless and weak. In fact, in one of the interviews, the director makes it clear that he was not making this movie to have the audience relax; he suggests a day at a spa for such purposes.<br/><br/>This movie asks many important and intriguing questions: ""What is the nature of vengeance?"" ""Can our sorrows be erased through revenge?"" and ""Does revenge help us against our enemies, or does it lead us to our destruction?"". Using many unusual plot twists (including some taboo subjects) and visually unique style, the director ends up making a movie that is both peculiar and significant.<br/><br/>This is, once again, not a very common movie. Script is very well written with many black comedies and well-coordinated fight scenes. In addition, the classy but somewhat melancholy soundtrack (mostly orchestral music) is placed and performed perfectly. I would compare it to David Fincher's Fight Club, although Oldboy is much darker in plot,theme, and mood."

"wonil_cho","10","22","108","24 May 2005"," Some can handle the grotesque, obscene, and vulgar scenes of certain movies, while others detest it and see no place for it in cinema whatsoever.
","I can appreciate the fact that many viewers of films have specific tastes. Some can handle the grotesque, obscene, and vulgar scenes of certain movies, while others detest it and see no place for it in cinema whatsoever. While I respect your opinions, I must question the extent of many of the negative reviewers' knowledge of contemporary film-making and story-telling. For one, a negative reviewer actually reviewed Ghostbusters 2 as their favorite movie. Second, the overgeneralization of this film being slow-paced is TOTALLY off-based. I cannot understand the sentiment here. Could this maybe based upon the disappointment negative reviewers had about the revelation at the end? Each scene has purpose in pushing forward the plot. If you watch enough Law and Order you can appreciate the pacing of this film. Third, the ""payoff"" in this film is not to explain the motive behind the revenge, but it is when the viewer sees that the main character (Oh Daesu) is not as obsessed with revenge as the antagonist (Lee Yujin). The roles are reversed, the protagonist understands the rage that is a part of revenge through the eyes of his nemesis. It is not Daesu's idea of revenge that is baffling, but Yujin's overly diligent extent for revenge. And as much as the reason (a spread rumor) may seem stupid or irrational, the extent to which Yujin will go to torment his enemy is what is ultimately revealed. Yujin forces Daesu to understand. (Most psychological thrillers payoff when you understand the villain's thought process, not the events that transpire afterward.) This must be stressed. Why else would he force him into such an incestuous outcome? Wouldn't Yujin have let Daesu die after his multiple suicide attempts? Daesu is in love with Mido, yet he didn't know she was his daughter. But the Taboo tied to the incest causes an interesting sense of conflict. The same sense of conflict that Yujin was conflicted by.<br/><br/>You see that this is an underlying theme throughout the film, the idea of revealing your dark secrets to the world. This is expressed throughout the film: in the opening scene (""I want to tell you my story""), while Daesu is imprisoned and writing in his journal, the clues left by Yujin for Daesu to discover, the ""childish"" quote that expresses the idea of loneliness and the emptiness of having no one to ""cry"" to.<br/><br/>Like I said, this film is not for everyone. Especially for the clowns that think Ghostbusters 2 is a classic (still can't grasp this). I think if many negative reviewers are going to criticize the positive ones for rating this movie highly, you should do this site ""justice"" by explaining what type of movie watcher you are before totally ripping down a film that is too advanced for you to understand.<br/><br/>This is surely not the best film ever made but it is easily not the worst. It receives a 9 because of the expression of such intense emotion (in one scene, Daesu's anger becomes so intense that the window in Yujin's penthouse shatters) and portrays the thought processes of the vengeful in a dark and calculating manner.<br/><br/>All in all there are many layers that are still waiting to be found. I still have many questions that I am trying to answer about this film, and I have already viewed it twice (although, most people won't be able to endure a second viewing)."

","In this short review I not only review the film itself, but also comment on the tiresome cult following that it has acquired over the years.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 2/10 simply because it is too contrived. It tries too hard to be everything. In its attempt to visit the entire emotional spectrum, it just becomes a mess and a hodgepodge of convoluted events. With all the ""poetic"" story elements and significant moments I just got tired of it all.<br/><br/>I get that the soap opera plot is just there to help put the viewer through that supposedly profound emotional wringer. For me, it was just disappointing. A gauche and ostentatious emotional manipulation that lost its appeal after just a few moments.<br/><br/>Which takes me to my comments the films' predictable and frankly, rather rabid fans. Since the film does have a heavy, clumsy impact, I see why so many are spellbound by it. They're swept up in its maladroit attempt at profundity and can't seem to take a step back and see it for what it is: overrated trash. Instead they think it's one of the best movies ever made and any dissenting opinions are attacked with the vehemence that only unimaginative fans in great numbers can muster up."

","Yes, I'm going to go ahead and say that this is my favorite movie. Take that as a bias for this review, or take it as an endorsement, it's up to you.<br/><br/>First off, as you've probably read, if you're interested in the US remake, watch the original. I'm not saying you should watch the original first or second, or to skip the US version, I'm just saying you should watch the original whenever. It's better than the remake, regardless of the order that you watch them. There is a desperation in the main character of the original version that is lost in the remake, and to me, that desperation was the driving force behind the plot.<br/><br/>While spending his time locked up, you get to see Dae-su go through all the stages of grief. But the difference is that the final stage, acceptance, has a different effect on him in that he becomes almost empty. I used the word desperation before because he becomes a man who has nothing to live for except revenge. While the hallway scene may seem ridiculous on paper, I had no trouble believing it when I first watched the movie. In other movies, his actions would be those of a man possessed, but Oldboy is about a man who has suffered, was hollowed out, and no longer knows fear. <br/><br/>Chan-wook Park is an amazing writing and director. I wish I knew more about film theory so I could explain the various ways he makes this film spectacular. The most important thing to me is how he conveys emotion. Even watching it with subtitles, you'll understand the characters' plights. On top of all that, the twists and turns are completely unexpected assuming you haven't seen the remake or the ripoff ""The Samaritan"".<br/><br/>If you're like me, after watching this, you'll go out and find the rest of Chan-wook Park's library."
"ricardopthomaz","10","3","8","30 January 2014"," The modern Oedipus!
","There are few movies in my huge list that get a straight 10/10. This is certainly one of them. I can't stop watching my Blu-Ray, it's the kind of movie that makes you wonder for days and days! Chan-wook Park here directs the masterpiece of his career.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, amazingly directed, clever, plotwise, has fantastic acting, it's different from everything you saw before. Some people might find it sick to watch, but it's like a train wreck, once you start watching, you just can't stop, no matter how much you want to turn your head. Yeah, it's that addicting. It gives you mixed feelings. You can think the protagonist as a sick twisted bastard but at the same time you root for him because of his confinement, what he came through, the things he lost in life.<br/><br/>This story, if you really stop for a moment to think of it, it's the modern take on the Oedipus tale. The kind of guy who apparently did nothing wrong but he comes to find out that his actions had a huger outcome than he initially thought. The kind of guy who thought he tricked his destiny, that he can take control of his destiny, but he was double-tricked first by a greater force of nature and in the end he becomes exactly what he mostly despised.<br/><br/>It's really deep. It's very wrong, yet very enjoyable, very twisted yet very delightful. And what makes it delightful is mainly the cast of characters here. Min-sik Choi shows himself an unbelievable actor here, having the ability to navigate from serious to cheesy, from hero to villain, from ""normal"" (whatever) to nutjob before you even think of blinking. Everything has a meaning, every action, every plot solution, even if you find it meaningless at first in the movie, leads to something and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat until the final showdown, and after that, your first action will be go back to the beginning and watch it again so you can pick up the fragments of the movie you thought it was something at first and re-watch them under a new light.<br/><br/>It's such a great experience with epic proportions that I strongly recommend every movie lover like me to take! Once you get on this train you won't want to leave!"
"asda-man","10","3","8","7 December 2012"," Korean's finest
","Oldboy was the first Korean horror/thriller (or of any genre at all really) I had ever seen and the exceptional films which followed (Sympathy For Lady Vengeance, The Chaser etc.) could not beat the masterpiece that is Oldboy. Unfortunately I can't say that it still remains that way because last year I saw I Saw the Devil which is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and surpassed Oldboy, but not by a lot. Oldboy is a phenomenal achievement. From its directing, to its acting, to the unpredictable and frankly genius writing. It's a masterpiece and one which is not hard to forget.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely horrible and it pulls on my heart strings more every time I watch it! It's thoroughly gripping right from its brilliant opening shot, as it tells the story of a man imprisoned in a room for 15 years. It's difficult to comprehend and you'd be a robot if you didn't feel for the man! You might think that watching a man in a room for 15 minutes would be really boring, but Park (the director, not a park) manages to keep the most boring situation absolutely thrilling and a visual feast. We really get into Oh Dae Su's mind-set as we see his schizophrenic symptoms of ants crawling out of his skin. It's incredibly intense and your willing for him to escape.<br/><br/>Of course he's subjected to even more psychological torture when he is freed as he has to find out who is kidnapper is, but more importantly why he was kidnapped. Oldboy isn't so much of a who's dunnit, but a why's dunnit which is what makes every frame so gripping. Unfortunately most films which are set-up like this as one big build up rely on a breath-taking finale and reveal, but fail to deliver, take Knowing for example. You don't need to worry about this with Oldboy as it features one of the greatest and most compelling finales ever! The screenplay is endlessly intelligent and imaginative, creating a multi-layered story with characters you can really feel for. What makes Oldboy so great is that you can actually sympathise with the 'villain' of the tale and sometimes condemn the heroe's actions.<br/><br/>The three dimensional characters are breath of fresh air, compared to the 2D kids we often get. Oldboy isn't just great because of its ending, the journey getting there is equally as breath-taking and involving. Oldboy features one of the greatest fight scenes in film history and is sure to be engraved in your mind. I'd put it up there with the crazy 88 fight scene in Kill Bill, it's just a technical marvel. It's also just one example of Park's phenomenal directing. It's incredibly stylish as well as evoking the character's feelings. At first Oh Dae Su is just a vengeful maniac, but then he becomes more and more human as we find out things about him which I won't spoil.<br/><br/>In the end Oldboy is a masterpiece. It's obvious that Park was a former philosophy student as the film contains so many provoking dilemmas. Not only is it a gritty revenge thriller, but it also has a huge heart and a massive emotional impact. The wondrous music also acts as another character in the film! By the end of it Oldboy will have you submitting to its knees in a puddle of tears with its cruel, but admirable finale. I can't see the American remake being any where near this standard. Make sure you see this, before you see that one!"

","It's a COMPLETE movie!<br/><br/>It really has everything. Normally when you see such a great storyline in a movie, the director focuses only on that. Because it speaks for itself. Its risky to put your money in such a movie, because you don't know how the movie is gonna come out. And thats the reason why you don't find people who give you a lot of money to make such a movie in the first place. <br/><br/>Oldboy is an exception. Either they got the money they wanted, or they used the little money very smart. Because this movie really is great in every possible way. Storyline, as I said before. Script! Cinematography! Acting! You even have Action-Scenes, and not only some action, but the best uncut fighting scene I've ever seen. And I'm not even a fan of those kinda scenes, but in this movie I loved it. Oh, the soundtrack ""the last waltz"", simply fantastic.<br/><br/>I don't know how successful this movie was, but Im sure that, would it have been a Hollywood-movie with some famous actors, it would have been one of the most successful movies ever.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can only praise this movie and envy those who made it."
"KnightsofNi11","10","3","8","7 October 2010"," Be prepared
","Oh. My. God. If you ever thought a movie twisted the fabric of your mind as to what is and isn't possible in this modern world of cinema, watch Oldboy and I'm sure it will surpass all your previous notions. Chan-wook Park is a Korean director who specializes in incredible stylistic camera work and artistic cinematography within a carefully constructed narrative. Oldboy is the second film in his aptly named ""vengeance trilogy."" It is about a man who is imprisoned 15 years for unknown reasons. After enduring painful loneliness for all this time, he is released, only to find out he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. It starts off strange and different, yet don't get discouraged. Everything echoes throughout the film to end with one of the most twisted and stunning climaxes I have ever witnessed. My jaw was left wide open for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and then about ten more after the credits finished rolling. If it hadn't been so late I might have hit the play button again as soon as I made it back to the DVD menu. It was utterly mind blowing.<br/><br/>I was most definitely not prepared going into this film, but it only served to heighten the experience of watching this practically perfect film. Oldboy hits the ground running and within five minutes of the film we get an incredible taste for what Chan-wook Park's filmmaking is all about. It's fast. It's fun. But it's also smart. Amidst the vibrant colors and the beautiful cinematography there is an incredible narrative. As the mystery of this film unravels we are pulled farther and farther in. And of course at the end of the film it just explodes in our faces without hardly any warning. You will be amazed. You will be disturbed. It will most definitely catch you off guard. It was all so expertly done and I just couldn't avert my eyes for one second in fear of missing the mysterious grandeur of this film. Every moment and every character serves the plot to some avail. There isn't a moment in Oldboy that felt unnecessary or overdone. It's one of the brilliantly made films which comes full circle by the end, only wanting you to rewind and watch the whole thing over again, immediately. I can't come up with enough words to describe how awesome this story is. It is definitely one of those you absolutely must see for yourself.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's a ballsy statement to make, but Chan-wook Park could be the next Akira Kurosawa, only this time slightly more hardcore, obviously. Every shot of Oldboy is so incredibly crafted, down to the most finite detail. The entire film is handled with such care and precaution, and the results are astounding. There are moments in the film which resonate the style of other master directors. There are multiple shots in the film which are heavily Scorsese influenced, for example. However, there is still an extremely definitive style here which belongs to Park. This style is what prevails over any of the specific influences scattered throughout the film. If Park continues to make films like this he will most likely go down in history as one of the genius auteurs of the 21st century. However, on that same note I would be amazed if he ever made anything that could top Oldboy.<br/><br/>Oldboy is one of those films which you will never be able to get out of your head. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you, but to me it was a great thing. It's a one of a kind film which could never recreated in it's full glorious essence. There was once talk of an American remake of this film, and I'm not sure I could have stomached that, knowing for a fact that any American team could never top the demented perfection of the original. Oldboy is utterly incredible. Every moment is perfect. It gets everything right and goes farther than you could ever imagine. The best part is that Oldboy doesn't fall into one specific genre of film, making it an example of how practically any film should be made, in essence. It would be a crime to go through life never seeing this film."

Who are these people? I mean, who would regularly visit the site for a movie they so hated and keep expressing their disappointments by pressing 'no' button for every single pro-Oldboy comment? I am not trying to say the movie should always get positive feedback. Oldboy is obviously not for everyone, and some people have to dislike it. I'm OK with that.

Tarantino's Kill Bill is a toddler's movie compared to this one. I am seeing this movie in January 2005 but it was released in 2003! How did this great movie pass me by? How did this great movie pass the Oscar's? This story of hatred, love and revenge is based on a story that is perhaps not very original but still, but still it is. It has lot of twists that are not easily foreseeable and the powerful emotional acting of the main characters is just astounding. Style and artistic tricks and effects are of great variety and amazement. Editing starts like a badly done home made film but gradually gets more refine and delivers the end as a masterpiece. The cinematographic close ups deliver strong emotion but also humor. The film keeps its strong national style and that makes it still more interesting.

","As a young film student and woman of South Korean ethnicity, I was intrigued and highly entertained by this movie.

The acting by Choi Min Sik was very well done as well as the rest of the casting. I think its great that South Korean films are finally getting some light shed on them but I am kind of angry that they are going to do an American remake of this awesome film.

","When was the last time you unintentionally winced from a movie? Maybe it happens to you easily from a chainsaw massacre, or maybe it takes the obscure, like revealing dialogue or the money shot from The Crying Game. For me, it was way back in about 1998, when I first saw Pulp Fiction and Travolta had to plunge an adrenaline shot into Uma's chest. I never thought a movie could do that to me again. Then I saw Oldboy.<br/><br/>A drunk businessman named Oh Dae-su, who gets arrested and released on his young daughter's birthday, is suddenly kidnapped and held captive in a room with TV and the occasional gassing for 15 long years. One day he wakes up on the outside in new clothes and is given a phone and wallet full of money by an oblivious bum, and suddenly it is revealed that he has just five days to find his obvious enemy and finally uncover the excuse for his long torture. Twists and turns are abound in this Korean film with a slight bonus I love in any overly dramatic movie: a biting sense of humor. My favorite scene - and it was hard to pick with all the damage mainly administered to characters' mouths (including the eating of a live octopus) - is a continuous shot of Dae-su kicking butt with his own signature fighting style (and a hammer) in a hallway full of villains ready to kill him (Just wait till he finally reaches the elevator). Awesome movie with a traumatic ending we Yanks are almost not ready for; if our country decides to remake this a la The Departed, I personally can't see it even coming close to the original."
"canadude","10","20","104","6 February 2005"," brilliant, imaginative tragedy
","""Oldboy"" is the type of movie that defies expectations. It manages to stay surprising, wildly imaginative, original, thought-provoking and terrifying throughout its entire runtime. It's told in a style so weird, yet fluid (almost dreamlike, or nightmare-like) that you can neither tear your eyes away from the screen nor summarize the movie by listing the plot points. It's horrifying, brutal and cruel, but it has a very sure sense of where it wants to go and what it wants to be. It isn't arbitrary.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" begins like an extreme-cinema torture film and blooms into full Shakespearean tragedy. Chan-wook Park takes age-old themes of revenge, fate and individual suffering (sometimes digging past Shakespeare, all the way to the Greeks) and resurrects them with such an assured visual and story-telling style that ""Oldboy"" becomes a one-of-a-kind type of film. The colors, the transitions, the pacing, the visual tricks and conceits are so rich, that once I started watching the film I found it hard to pause or stop.<br/><br/>And, while the film is primarily about vengeance, it's hardly about it they way we are generally used to films being about vengeance. It's not ""Kill Bill."" The violence in it is not cartoonish, nor playful. The style I'd almost call experimental, rather than playful even though Park utilizes everything from CGI to split-screen to different film speeds, color saturations, etc.<br/><br/>The film also has a twist ending which I will not reveal. I will, however, say that I think it works incredibly well. Like the best of end twists, it doesn't seek to simply shock or surprise, but layer the already-told story with strata of meanings, shed new light upon it. Thus, even if you see it coming, it shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the film.<br/><br/>What is the film about? Essentially it's a story of a man who, for an undisclosed reason, winds up a prisoner in an apartment for 15 years, occasionally gassed, hypnotized, drawing his knowledge about the world from a TV. He studies martial arts, attempts suicide several times, writes journals, contemplates, tries to escape.<br/><br/>When he is released (a little less than halfway through the movie I'd say) is when the real hell begins. And the drama on which the film so deeply focuses, the drama between him, his re-discovered world and his mysterious captor. It's at this point that ""Oldboy"" explicitly opens up to an exploration of its main theme, namely vengeance.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" confronts us with very brutally frank questions about the nature of revenge and, concurrently, forgiveness. It wanders outside the Christian precepts of ""Love thy neighbor"" and ""turn the other cheek"" and digs deep into the consequences of vengeance and the changes it brings about in the individuals who conduct it as well as those who fall victim to it. What does the choice between eye for an eye and turning the other cheek reveal about us as human beings? What are the consequences of each choice? Do they alleviate the pain of the original wrongdoing? <br/><br/>At first sight, ""Oldboy"" might seem dead-set against revenge as an option, portraying it as mutually destructive for the victim and the culprit. But, like ""Dead Man Walking"" and its questions about the death penalty, ""Oldboy"" is much more complex. I wouldn't say that swings in one direction more than the other. I don't think that that is its goal. I think it's goal is to ask, and it does so horrifyingly well."

However, Dae-su seeks for his captor and the reason of his long imprisonment.

With a stunning direction and supported by an excellent screenplay, where there is explanation for every apparently weird situation, ""Oldboy"" is also very unpleasant, with the hero being indeed an anti-hero. The theme incest is very strong and almost forbidden for us, westerns, but when I worked in South Korea, I learned that this theme is simply unconceivable for Korean people. Further, a man be called a ""dog"" is very offensive and a great humiliation. Therefore, I believe that this movie is tougher and more offensive for Korean people, and explains the reaction of Dae-Su when the final secret is disclosed. Based on some unfair bad reviews, I believe this movie is not recommended for certain audiences that need (and has problem) to read subtitles and has difficulties to understand other cultures. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Oldboy""<br/><br/>Obs: Why are there so many users with only one review writing about this movie? It is very usual to find people writing only one standard favorable review to promote awful movies in IMDb, probably hired by the production of the film. But with ""Oldboy"", we can find also many bad reviews written by persons with only one review issued in IMDb. Sounds very weird and fake for me this type of ""inspiration""! Further,what is the meaning of ""That user does not exist"" in the message board profile of these users? Is this message correct? How can a user that ""does not exist"" write reviews (and certainly vote)?"

","I would give this movie eleven stars if I could. I could not disagree more with the negative comments made about it. Not only is an incredibly beautiful film, the performances are brilliantly subtle and the plot is intricate without being impenetrable. The hammer sequence in the corridor of the private prison alone makes the film worth buying, let alone the wonderful, elegant, ambiguous ending. It is violent, but the violence in most American blockbusters where hundreds of people are shot and blown up with the intimation that it is necessary for the eventual victory of ""good"" over ""evil"" is far more distasteful to me. Oldboy is like a modern Sophoclean tragedy and also, I think, reminiscent of Fritz Lang. Whilst some people may prefer to anaesthetise themselves by watching mindless Hollywood pap, I'll stick to this, thanks."
"howard.schumann","9","20","105","13 December 2004"," A complex film about love and the price we must pay to save it.
","Chan-wook Park's Oldboy is a grisly, ultra-violent, but wildly exhilarating experience, unlike any I have encountered at the movies this year. A grand prizewinner at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Oldboy has plenty of action, startling visual effects, dark humor, and an existential mystery that will linger in your mind long after the final credits have rolled. Based on a manga by Tsuchiya Garon, Oldboy has elements of revenge but to describe it as a ""revenge saga"" is perhaps to oversimplify things. It is a complex film about love and the price we must pay to save it.<br/><br/>The opening scenes offer a bit of slapstick as young Oh Daesu (Choi Min-sik) is hauled into the police station for public drunkenness on his daughter's birthday. After being bailed out by a friend, he is kidnapped and wakes up in a bleak room designed to look like a hotel but with a false view window and a locked steel door. He is being held captive but where, why, by whom, and for how long? He receives no answers, only food fed through an opening at the bottom of the door. Drugged to sleep by Valium gas, his captors come during the night to clean his room and cut his hair. When he finds out that he must remain imprisoned, his mind begins to unravel and he goes through several breakdowns.<br/><br/>He is hypnotized but never meets his captors. The only human faces he sees are those on the television screen where he learns one day that he is a suspect in his wife's murder. Driven only by an insane desire to get out and enact revenge on his jailer, he trains himself daily to stay in shape by punching the wall. After fifteen years, he is released but soon finds out that the world outside is as much of a prison as his room. He is deposited on a roof and finds a man ready to kill himself; yet he has no compassion, only the single-minded drive to find and kill those who imprisoned him. Without money or friends he does not ask questions when a stranger provides him with a cell phone and a wallet.<br/><br/>Obsessed with finding the truth for himself, Daesu begins his investigation by sampling food from the Chinese restaurants in the area to find the one that provided the food during his captivity. At one of the restaurants he meets and is nurtured by a chef named Mido (Kang Hye-jeong), but he is afraid of trusting anyone. Daesu is too bent on revenge to care much for human relationships, but little by little his attachment to Mido grows. There is a sequence where Daesu has to fight his way past a gang of thugs in a narrow hotel corridor that stands out for its naturalism. Shot in a continuous tracking shot, the scene allows its audience neither the comfort of glamorization or even much in the way of style, but simply shares the drama of a terrible struggle for survival. Like much of the movie, the scene is arresting.<br/><br/>Daesu's captor tracks his every move and we learn that his tormentor is a former schoolmate who blames him for a terrible event in the past. A strange blend of horror and beauty, Oldboy is not for the squeamish, but if you can stand the grimmer moments you will enjoy one of the most memorable films of the year. Park does not condemn or stand in judgment of his characters but allows us to see them as flawed human beings who have been pushed into taking extreme measures to salvage what remains of their dignity. If the ending is a bit harsh, it also has moments that are tender. Oldboy can be repulsive but it has a great deal of humanity and Daesu's pitiful sadness and longing for redemption reminds us of our own vulnerability."
"leumas3765","10","7","28","1 July 2007"," Now THAT'S how you get revenge!
","First things first: Oldboy isn't a movie for everyone. It probably isn't even a movie for most people. It likely would rate as one of the worst date movies of all time, and it isn't something you could comfortably watch with your parents. Children definitely shouldn't see this, nor should anyone without a high tolerance for cringe-inducing torture scenes.<br/><br/>Whom does that leave? People who aren't all that squeamish who place a premium on original presentations of ancient plots, in this case, Revenge. It is a foreign film, but I attributed the weirdness to originality rather than any cultural differences. Finally, I detest implausible movies. While the events in this movie seem highly improbable, I never felt like I was being jerked around by the director.<br/><br/>The plot in brief: After being imprisoned for 15 years without knowing why or by whom, Dae-su is let out just as abruptly. In a typical movie, he would meet a cute girl and the two of them would follow clues to track down the antagonist for the big showdown.<br/><br/>Here, he actually learns the identity of his captor fairly early on, but when he is given the opportunity to deal out his revenge that he's fantasized about for the past 15 years, he realizes he can't do it without learning the truth about why he was imprisoned, and so his captor remains untouched.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie, Dae-su and the girl he's fallen for, Mi-do, eventually do piece together the truth, with the emphasis on why he was released rather than why he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>A lot of other comments have made reference to Count of Monte Cristo or Fight Club, but the movie I was reminded most of was Se7en, right down to the use of a box.<br/><br/>One last thing I liked about this movie is that it had one of the most believable one-on-many fight scenes in all of cinema. For once, the bad guys didn't fight the hero one at a time. At least, most of the time they didn't."

It was such an EXPERIENCE that to break it down into separate categories (plot, characterization, cinematography) would be a travesty.<br/><br/>However! As this is a review and not, in principle, a mere recommendation, I'll make some effort to explain about the movie. As this is a movie from Asia--and thereby subject to all sorts of conventions you wouldn't find in a Spielberg films--there are some elements that may be a bit shocking. For one thing, there's the mature content: primarily, the shocker here is in exploring issues that would likely be taboo for any American filmmaker, and an absolute death sentence in terms of finding studio funding.<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly, this is a movie that encourages--if not REQUIRES--an active viewer. High-budget American films, riding on the wings of Spielberg, tend to provide rather explicit narratives--that is, they fill in any potential gaps with some type of explanation. It may simply be a differing viewpoint on how a ""good film"" is narrated, but this trend is not present in Oldboy: logical leaps are made, and it's your job to keep up with them. I personally liked the change a lot: it's refreshing for a film to require something from its viewers once in a while.<br/><br/>Again, as with many movies, this should be judged as a cohesive whole, and from that standpoint, I can say that it's an absolutely essential choice for any strong-stomached people considering it."
"imdbcgkath","10","19","99","12 January 2005"," An action movie with a deep plot and great photography+acting
","This film uses very well features like flashbacks, plot twists and a surprising ending. The film makes you feel that it could be ended in at least 5-6 points yet it manages to end in such a way that leaves you satisfied no mean feet by itself as many movies weak spot is a lengthier ending than necessary or the opposite, and more movies fail to do successfully a series of turnarounds of the story near the end of the film without spoiling it. Notable also is the fact that although it is a violent story it has brief battle scenes. Another fact interesting to me is that the movie highlights what can be accomplished by highly sophisticated methods of torture like the ones employed in this movie to irrevocable change the personality of the subject even subconsciously. In an era of restrictions to the freedom of expression, invasion in privacy, and prisons working in law black holes like Guadanamo we must seriously think if war on terror is on the right track. Violence in revenge of violence never brought anything but more violence and despair."
"christopher-underwood","9","10","45","12 January 2007"," remarkable film
","Very fine if gruelling speeding bullet of a film that still has time for decent characterisation and thought provoking dialogue. I went to look up my piece on the same director's earlier, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, and see I never wrote it up. Possibly the reason is, as with this one, it is rather difficult after such an onslaught, both with violence and emotion, to gather one's thoughts in a sufficiently clear manner. The film has opened theatrically here to rave reviews, which I do not often find a good omen and several IMDb reviewers find it slow and lacking in violence and gore. Well maybe there is not as much blood as in some but it is far easier to watch an arm issue forth a fountain of blood than to watch just a second of Mr Park's gastronomic or dentistry scenes. Well worth watching though and I feel that after a second viewing when I will not be quite so confused with the 'imprisonment' at the start and a little more able to 'enjoy' the more vigorous sequences, I shall be in position to give a better account of this remarkable film."
"tommyman","7","12","57","10 November 2005"," Pretty good but slightly overrated
","Before seeing Oldboy, I had heard a lot of good things about it. Many of my friends loved it and many respectable critics also praised the movie. The fact that it won prestigious awards from numerous festivals doesn't hurt either. However, this film seems to be the kind of ""hate it or love it"" type of film. Even in IMDb.com, many people believed this is one of the greatest films coming out of Korean while others said it sucks.<br/><br/>For me, after seeing it, I feel that it is a pretty good movie, visually stunning with sharp script and dialogs. All the actors did good jobs on their parts. Choi Min-Sik gave us a good performance as Dae-Su and so did Yu Ji-tae as Woo-Jin. The chemistry between these two is so good that we can feel the intense between them. However, as smart as the script is, the film suffers from the over-dramatized ending, typical for Korean movies (IMHO only). It seems like after a superb first 90 minutes of the film or so, the director tried too hard to impress us with the ending. The last scene between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin is totally too intentional and over-dramatic; I was disgusted. For me, it is sad because the film, a little after its first half, was on its way to be the best movie from Korean in my list. The ending, however, ruined it all; it's like after eating half a bowl of delicious soup, you find out that there is a pubic hair in it.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not a bad movie, by all means. Kudos to Choi Min-Sik for his great performance in the first half of the film; he really put a lot of effort to it. Park Chan-Wook, the director, is, well, still Park Chan-Wook; great potential but never fully materialize his greatness. I'll look forward to his next film if he can really make it next time."

To defend it from it's detractors:<br/><br/>1)The plot is far-fetched but no more far-fetched than any other film of this genre. The motivation of the Dae-su's tormentor is not a let down, and the twist at the end is devastating and effective. <br/><br/>2)I agree that some of the histrionics toward the end could have been toned down, but otherwise the performances, especially by the leads, are excellent.<br/><br/>3)The directors visual style and story telling are worth the hype.<br/><br/>This movie is not for the squeamish or those looking for a happy ending.

","A man is taken, imprisoned and just as escape is imminent, released. By whom? Why and why again? It's a simple premise (based on a Japanese comic book), but it's the start of a complicated, involving movie. And I promise, it only gets better from there.<br/><br/>The main character of this movie is acted out by the amazing Min-sik Choi, who earlier appeared in the Korean box office hit, Swiri. He deserves every acting award (and even some to be created specifically for this role) for the mind-blowing rendition of Oh Dae-su - who undergoes a drastic change during his imprisonment. For such an impossibly difficult role, he performs brilliantly - almost inhumanely. I hope to see more meaty roles such as this (not the popcorn Swiri type) come his way in the future.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's hard to appreciate this movie against the history of Korean movies. It's such a new direction in many ways - basically all ways. The direction will blow you away - the shades of light, patterns and other bits that almost escape you, such as a fight scene along a hallway done in one long take. Chan-wook Park (whose previous works include JSA) has done an amazing job. The more I watch this movie, the more I notice and appreciate of his style and vision.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am biased in some way, because I find it hard to see fault in this movie - the acting, direction and camera work are brilliant. Having said this, be prepared for some violence, sex and some pretty lurid themes. If you feel like being surprised, watch this movie. Watch it a couple of times. It will blow your mind every time.<br/><br/>I trash many movies, this one I worship."
"Quinoa1984","10","18","96","2 February 2006"," a revenge picture that isn't very pretty, and loves it that way
","Oldboy was a film I saw twice in the theater, in New York City (the second time not totally intentional, just the only thing playing worth seeing), and saw again recently. I'm still struck on how balls-to-the-wall director Chanwook Park goes with his story. It's actually not a bad story, but it needs a certain push and originality in drive to make it work. For some this will be overkill, and it's not without an argument. The film is violent, though perhaps not on the level of Fukasaku or Miike's films. It's disturbing, but in a way that hits deep by way of raw emotions that can only come out of East Asian cinema. And it has a level of drama that's staggering, maybe for some a little far-fetched. But it's also a good lot of the time a bitingly funny film, loaded with attitude to match its style, but with a heart as well.<br/><br/>The small low-down on the story: Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-Sik in a towering performance worthy of Charles Bronson or Harvey Keitel or both) is nabbed un-wittingly and thrown into a prison. We follow him along in his long stint, seeming forever, until he suddenly gets 'released' into the open. Now it's time for revenge, but is the question of the truth, of the why, even more crucial than actually getting payback? This becomes the main dramatic pull of Oldboy, but it's not just a kind of ultra-violent fight and action filled epic saga. It's also a love story, so to speak, and a film about the mistakes of youth. The antagonist of the story, Lee Woo-Jin (Yu Ji-Tae in what is one of the most absorbing and calmly demented performances in recent memory), becomes a very threatening, dark presence in the film, omnipresent a lot of the time, like a devil watching over it's subject. And when it comes to the climax, there is a level of Greek tragedy that's so strong, it had a good few in the theater I saw the film clinging tenaciously to their seats.<br/><br/>The story, admittedly, is relatively thin when one thinks about it, and if a director wanted to pull a Howard Hawks and cut past all of the modern aesthetic the film would be a third less in length. But the twisted pleasure of watching a film like Oldboy unfold is in the manipulation of the style, how Park and his director of photography Jeong Jeong-hung give the film an indie wham-bang zeal while at the same time following no rules. This is demonstrated in many tense scenes, but the memorable ones include at least a few key moments in Oh Dae-Su's prison cell, and particularly the infamous long-shot as the fight breaks out in the prison hallway. Seeing a scene like this may or may not draw some viewers down the line right away; how much can you take seeing a scene lasting 3 or 4 or more minutes of just brutal beating, choreographed to a full intensity? As with the film in general, it's a not-too guilty pleasure for genre fans, and for others they might watch it and think 'eh'.<br/><br/>But it is also in the people, in the characters that creates a heightened pitch in Oldboy. It's like a filmed graphic novel in some ways, but dealing with characters who (possible exceptions being Lee Woo Jin and some of his 'posse') are not part of a criminal underworld, and our main hero is turned inside out, into what he calls as himself a 'monster' (watch for the reference to Frankenstein on TV, by the way). So, when it comes time for this harsh, piercing revelation scene in the high tower Lee occupies, it leads to some devastating stuff. Like the darkest bits out of Sophocles, Park's characters are practically doomed by fate, and it's not much of a picnic for them getting there. But for the audience, it's created as a post-modern stew. Oldboy is rough, taut, and in spurts quite visionary."
"borntohula","10","18","96","14 January 2005"," well done, but not totally original
","I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival and it was my fave of the festival and 2004. When the film ended, the entire theatre was buzzing and I knew everyone was thinking the same thing - turn down the lights and roll it again! A truly great film is one you can watch over and over again, its more than just story telling or eye candy. Its a damn shame Oldboy and the director's other films aren't more available in North America - we are missing out on great Korean cinema.<br/><br/>An excellent film about revenge and how it can possess people till self-destruction. But, if you're having a hard time actually seeing 'Oldboy', just find 'Angel Heart' starring Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro (1987). I doubt the director 'stole' this idea, but the similarities in plot and characters are very close. Coincidence? Maybe not. It is also a great film, Mickey Rourke's finest role after 'Barfly'."

"Rich B","10","18","97","30 August 2005"," An amazing story, wonderfully visualised, directed and acted. A must see.
","Oldboy begins with a typical Hitchcock style story. A man is imprisoned for 15 years with no understanding of why or, during his incarceration, any idea of how long. Then suddenly he is free and his journey begins.<br/><br/>The style in this film just pours out of the screen. Yet they don't overpower and dominate the movie as they would in Hollywood, they look as integral to the story as do the actors and the dialogue. They aren't treated as a big moment but viewed as a whole with the rest of the film. There are some really nice touches throughout the movie, in particular the movement between scenes, the corridor fight or the beautifully shot snow scene all really stand out for me.<br/><br/>That brings me nicely onto the action topic. Asian film, ""must be lots of martial arts"" I hear some of you non-converts shout. Not at all. The action and fighting is some of the most realistic I've seen in a movie. People go down when they are hit, and when hit hard they stay down. That is except Oldboy himself, fuelled by fifteen years of revenge and hatred, he is allowed a but more leeway. Yet that doesn't stop the action being beautifully choreographed and put together.<br/><br/>In particular the fight scene in the corridor shows the beauty and care placed into the fight scene. It takes place in a long corridor with the camera panning back and forth following the action as Oldboy, successfully and realistically, fights approximately fifteen men. The action frequently slows and stops, and with no real moments where you are pulled back out of the movie thinking you are watching the impossible.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are tough to watch, not because they are all gruesome, but because Asian filmmakers have the balls to push the audience and make them feel something more than the average cinema experience. To feel something, much like the main character. So scenes are uncomfortable or uneasy because you're feeling the same as the characters.<br/><br/>The live sushi moment is stunning to watch, and conjured up some strange emotions in me, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. The torture scenes are arduous but so real and fear inducing. Perhaps the most shocking and emotionally strong moments are saved for the latter half of the film. Don't be concerned though, these aren't vile in any way, they just make you feel incredibly uncomfortable and very uneasy.<br/><br/>To me, that is what cinema is all about, even all art. It's about making you feel something, not sitting in a darkened room letting images and story wash over you then disappearing for your dinner and a chat about the weather. You want, and need, to be pulled into the movie, to feel and empathise with the characters, forget about the world around you and all the other people and their lives, and finally come away with the haunting of those feelings. The movie should continue on in your mind and pop up in conversations, provoking thoughts and discussion, otherwise you've wasted your time and money. Oldboy satisfies that to perfection.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't really go into the story, not that I do much in reviews anyway, but in the case of Oldboy it really does give far too much away even touching on it. Check out the IMDb listing if you really want, however just trust me, it's a superb story and you don't want to know anything more about it beforehand. For the last twenty minutes or so you will be astounded and the twists and turns keep coming right up to the very end.<br/><br/>It's also quite a moving story and takes on what exactly makes a person and defines who they are and the labels they carry through their lives. Most of all though it's about revenge and how unfulfilling, all consuming and empty it can make you feel.<br/><br/>The actors are really good across the whole movie, but it is the leads that really excel. Min-sik Choi is utterly believable and gives such a powerful performance. His acting coupled with the visual style will have you holding your breath at times. The female lead Hye-jeong Kang and the protagonist Ji-tae Yu also offer excellent performances. The range of emotion that the character Woo-jin Lee has to go through is enormous, and Yu performs them brilliantly, while Kang plays a restrained, controlled and tortured mind to perfection. There is a real depth to these characters, and they are brought to life by these three wonderful actors.<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent example of what cinema can be, and once again the lesson comes from outwith Hollywood, I just wish they would sit up and listen in class. The movie is not any single scene, but the sum of it's wonderful set pieces, beautiful style, imaginative camera work, truly wonderful performances from all the leads, and a stunning story. You have to see this movie."
"rasmushelms","9","3","9","19 May 2014"," A Brilliant, Disturbing Thriller
","I have to admit, in the first hour I was worried that this film would be another ""Kill Bill"" in that it would be a shallow, formulaic revenge flick made in a highly stylized manner. I could not have been more wrong. <br/><br/>""Oldboy"" starts out in predictable fashion, as we see the film's protagonist Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) captured, put through 15 years of imprisonment, and then released with a burning desire to hunt down and inflict revenge on his captors. However, as I would discover, there is more to the situation than meets the eye, and Oh Dae-Su is in for a shocking discovery. <br/><br/>As brutal as the film is, and believe me it is brutal, the film in directed and shot quite beautifully. Park Chan-Wook crafts an almost surreal atmosphere at times, which when coupled with the film's rough, violent tone draws comparisons to both Miike Takashi's ""Audition"" and Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Pusher."" Park's use of classical music makes the film operatic in its brutality. It's clear to see why Quentin Tarantino is a fan of the film. <br/><br/>Also worth mentioning are the performances by Choi Min-Sik, who fully embodies the character of desperate, tortured, ""monster"" of a man, and Yu Ji-Tae, whose portrayal as the film's villain is truly chilling.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is an incredibly cruel, and violent film. However, if one can stomach the images that Park Chan-Wook brings to the screen, the pay-off is a brilliant, disturbing thriller."
"jwr-davis","8","3","9","13 August 2007"," Highly recommended
","Don't let that title fool you (or the reviews from people that don't understand genre)this horrifying revenge thriller from Korea's dark maestro Park Chan-wook, who gave us the wonderful Sympathy for Mr Vengeance is making the British and American offerings in this genre look pretty quaint. Oldboy has touches of Kafka, and echoes of British paranoia thrillers like The Ipcress File and The Prisoner. But it opens up a whole new sicko frontier of exotic horror, and more or less reduced my intestines to guacamole both times I watched it, not so much with its violence - although heaven knows there's a super-sized helping of that - but with a queasily ingenious imprisonment-torture impossible to contemplate without a prickling of cold sweat.<br/><br/>Oldboy certainly shows that it's Asia where the farthest reaches of extreme cinema are to be found, and the worst nightmare is that 15 years in prison, which leaves the numbed viewer wondering if that is an unspeakably long time - or perhaps an unspeakably short time in the nihilist wasteland Park conjures up. ""What happens after you've revenged yourself?"" wonders Dae-su. ""I bet the hidden pain will come back."" This is cinema that holds an edge of cold steel against your throat."

The soundtrack is wonderful, the camera-work, the acting, the story. It reminded me of Sin City at the time and I was surprised and pleased to read in another comment that it WAS based on some Japanese anime - I think it showed. That also explains why a few of the scenes are so OTT. But they work anyway. It all just .. all .. fits ..<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you like foreign films, Asian films, if you like black humor, if you like revenge, if you like seeing a new face and find he acts amazingly from the very first second you lay eyes on him. The opening minutes are mesmerizing, and the movie hardly lets up from there on.<br/><br/>As for the ""eating"" scene? so what? you've never eaten live lobster sushi before? if you're so easily shocked - by strong tastes, strong visuals - then find another movie to see! Old Boy is one of the years best for me.. definitely. I can shut my eyes and many many scenes replay vividly for me. Someone else mentioned that the film made them wonder if they were drunk, it had the same effect on me, in a good way."
"robert-jacques","9","17","92","20 June 2005"," With hints of Hitchcock Park Chan-wook Never Lets Up
","Though it maybe too violent for some, Park tells an excellent tale of revenge that borders on the bizarre and twisted. A man, Oh Dae-Su is imprisoned briefly on the night of his young daughters birthday then released only to find himself kidnapped and imprisoned in a new type of jail cell: a hotel room. There he is locked up for 15 years were he has little contact with any humans. He obsessively watches T.V.where he learns of his wife's murder. Occasionally the room will fill with 'valium' gas and when he awakes he is clean shaved and has a new haircut. This routine continues through the 15 year period. When he is released he enters on his Odyssey of revenge to discover the identity of his captors. This is where the film really picks up, he befriends a female sushi chef named Mido, who sympathizes for Oh Dae-Su after hearing his story. She ends up joining Oh Dae-Su on his quest in discovering the motivations of his captors. On their journey Oh Dae-Su encounters many twists and turns that vary from the violently surreal to the oddly bizarre. There are some great fight sequences where his rage consumes him so fully he is able to fight off his captures with a knife sticking out of his back. This is just one of the very powerful and violent scenes in 'Oldboy'. There are also scenes of torture and gore that are particularly intense. The violence may over shadow the brilliance of this film, however the narrative asks no sympathy for Oh Dae-Su but only to study him. The man who imprisoned him states: ""I'm sort of a scholar, and what I study is you."" This is how we observe the film, as scholars of Oh Dae-Su. I do not agree with the actions he takes at the epilogue of this film, and i feel it may have gone on ten minuets too long. However, I feel this film has reached a level of suspense and terror on par with the likes of Alfred Hitchock. As Hitchcock's films pushed the limits of cinema in his era I see parallels to what Park has achieved in crafting suspense and shock. The story takes many twists and turns that never makes you feel easy, just when you feel you know where Park is taking you he adds an extra twist to the story to make it that much more satisfying. Using elements of the surreal tied with extreme violence and sexuality Chan-wook Park creates a masterful story that gives a new spin on the revenge genre that reflects that of a Greek tragedy. I give this film my highest recommendation, that is if you can get past the violence and disturbing images, however each moment is done tastefully and serves a purpose pushing the narrative forward."

","Oldboy is one of those rare movie experiences that unfolds deliberately and note perfect. Park layers on the detail of Daeshu's journey from the opening frame yet never lets the viewer on to where the path will take and it does take some dark and unnerving twists. Still this is bold and visionary film-making at its finest with standout performances by each of the 3 leads. Mass American audiences will never find this film though as there are few distributors that have the courage to stand behind a film this risky and adventurous as far as the subject matter goes, i.e. the final reveal and the choices that it brings. The final 2 minutes alone will have most American audiences gasping in PC shock and most likely offended. This does not seem to be Park's meaning despite the challenging and uncompromising actions that Daeshu makes. Film-making this good deserves to be recognized and rewarded--thank you Cannes Grand Prix--but it is a pity that only those that seek out material this unique will find it.

","I'm starting off with something positive. The shots are very clever and Min-sik Choi's performance is great.<br/><br/>Now to the negative:
The women in this movie we're just props to be abused.<br/><br/>""It hurts but I will endure it for you"" - sums up pretty well how Park Chan-Wook treats the women in his movie. For every mistake their male counterpart makes, Mido and Soo-ah are the ones getting punished and it is framed in a way that they really don't mind taking the fall.<br/><br/>Brother and sister have an affair and of course, as they face the threat of exposure, she is the one to kill herself with a smile on her face and ""no regrets"". And eventhough Woo-jin is the one who physically gave her his blessing to do so by letting her hand go he has the audacity to seek revenge from a guy, who said one sentence.
Speaking of said guy, Dae-su was the one who spread the rumor and his wife is the one getting killed.<br/><br/>Of course, Dae-su and Woo-jin suffer, arguably even more but they get to do so like human beings, grieving and making concious choices not being discarded like rag dolls. Even Mido, who survives this whole mess, doesn't get the choice if she wants to be with her father or not, Dae-su decides that for her and relieves himself of the guilt afterwards.<br/><br/>Bottomline: The women in this movie have no free will and Dae-su deserves the Father-of-the-Year award"

","Oldboy (Oldeuboi) is the second installment of the 'Vengeance trilogy' directed by Chan-wook Park and is by far the best of the three.<br/><br/>The first time I watched Oldboy it blew me away. Dark, slick, gritty and twisted, revenge has never been portrayed sweeter. I fell in love with the film instantly, I became gripped to my TV within the first five minutes. It kicks off right from the beginning and unlike some other films you don't have to wait half an hour to get interested. It seems quite straight forward a man (Oh Dae-su played by Choi Min-sik) is suddenly kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and one day he is suddenly released. Now the protagonist is on the hunt for the man who's behind his imprisonment to get his revenge, however the story is more complex and gripping than that.<br/><br/>Like me most people would probably assume that the film will go on and in the end the villain will be revealed however Oldboy is quite unique. After Oh Dae-su is released his captor Woo-Jin (Yoo Ji-tae) one day reveals himself. Oh Dae-su instant reaction is to kill this man however Woo-Jin tells him that if he kills him he won't ever find out his motives behind his imprisonment. Woo-Jin then tells Oh Dae-su to discover his motives within the next five days or else he will kill Mi- do (Kang-Hye Jeong) a young sushi chef who Oh Dae-su meets at the restaurant she works at after he got released, she becomes Oh Dae-su's love interest. If Oh Dae-su succeeds in finding out Woo-Jin's motive then Woo-Jin will kill himself. With the captor revealing himself begins the protagonist's desperate journey to find out why he was kept in a room for 15 years, which leads him to dig in his past. This makes the story so intense and entertaining.<br/><br/>Oldboy is more than just revenge, blood and the typical overdose of violence it has a very intriguing plot portrayed very sleekly. For people that don't have a strong stomach it will disturb and disgust you(still watch it), some scenes will make your jaw drop, other scenes will make you speechless. There is nothing quite like Oldboy, it has all the correct ingredients. Chan-wook Park filmed every scene as if it's a piece of art; so stylish, bold and dark it seems as if we was to watch and feel the emotions of Oh Dae-su throughout the film. There's some amazing soundtrack and even better dialogue, everything just fits perfectly. <br/><br/>Choi Min-sik's portrayal of Oh Dae-su is one of the best performances I have ever seen. It's gripping and mesmerising, it sticks with you no matter however many times you watch it, such a powerful and striking performance. I've never seen anyone get in to the role and portray anger in such a breath taking way as well as Choi Min-sik. Yoo Ji-tae and Kang-Hye Jeong also gave outstanding performances.<br/><br/>For the people who haven't watched Oldboy I encourage you to watch it ASAP, it's a must see. I guarantee that you will not leave your seats, it's that entertaining. This film takes cinema to a whole new level, it breaks every barrier in ever aspect whether it's direction, acting, cinematography or background score. Oldboy has changed my outlook of cinema and after watching it everything else seemed mainstreamed to me; that's how much of an impact Oldboy has on me. I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched Oldboy, even though I know what will happen next, I was still gripped and entertained. Oldboy is in my top 5 all time favorite movies and I don't think any movie will be able to take it's place. <br/><br/>Source of link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/"

You get to know the main character who has gone through years of torment for some unknown reasos as you experience his pain as Oh dae Su (Choi Min Sik) becomes a tormented man in his struggle for vengeance.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this film takes you down some paths that you think at one point - 'oh no they really are falling for clichés' but then it goes down something darker and you are totally blown away by what the conclusion is. I am usually a sucker when it comes to finding out twists as I can barely spot them but let me say the twist in this one I did not suspect one bit and was shocked by what I saw.<br/><br/>This is a unique film - the acting is perfect, the idea is clever and the emotions portrayed in the characters all exhibit human traits of being torn inside while still alive and just the whacky thing we can do to people to get our peace of mind if only temporarily.<br/><br/>All I can say is that you must see this film and it is a film I will be recommending to everyone to see."
"cookiechip_07","10","2","5","27 May 2011"," Oldboy = Oh boy! Looking further than western cinema...
","Oldboy<br/><br/>Is a brilliantly directed thriller by Chan-wook Park. Its tells the story of a guy who has been kidnapped and then after 15 years imprisoned in a room is let free, however he instantly seeks revenge on the guy who put him there. <br/><br/>The story is excellent with a plot that shows depth and keeps you guessing right until the very last shot. The film starts strangely in a holding area at a police station and this is where we get to see the lead character 'Oh Dea-su'. Right from the off, you sense this person is an unstable character displaying very erratic behaviour. He talks a lot & changing from one emotion to the next in an instant, however we are lead to believe this is due to the fact he has been drinking when his friend comes to bail him out. <br/><br/>Once out of the station he stops to make a phone call home when he is taken. The next time we see him, he is in a room looking unclean and dazed. 15 years passes by with nothing but a TV for company. This is one of the most important parts of the film, which the director perfectly puts across to the audience, you do feel the isolation he feels, the torment of 15yrs, wondering why he is there, when is he getting out, all these feelings / questions are asked by our lead. <br/><br/>When Oh Dea-su is free he befriends a young lady who has taken such a liking to him she enters into his world, helping him find the man he want to seek revenge upon. Once he comes face to face with his enemy, all is not what it seems, as he tells our lead revenge cannot occur as you will always be left wondering why he imprisoned him so the reason must be uncovered and then the two will meet again.<br/><br/>The film has so much on offer, some will point to the fact it might be too unrealistic yet you will not care for such a statement as the acting is great. Every actor portraying each role in a very realistic manner and thus you can really feel for each one individually on the same level. The director includes a wonderfully shot fight scene, where numerous men take on Oh Dea-Su in battle allowing for us to watch as if the side of the house has been cut open for viewing! When we follow our lead into his journey of discovery, there are disturbing parts of the film which are done tastefully and not over exposed. <br/><br/>Although there is a memorable scene which is not so tasteful (or tasteful for our lead!) which will leave people squirming even the non-squeamish but had to be shown in this manner in order to be credible to the character. Flashbacks are used to show past events inside the mind of the characters which for some people is off putting but for me helps gather a sense of what really happened rather than relying on verbal two-ing and throwing. There is symbolism included in many shots and the director likes to revert back to earlier dialogue which wraps the story up delightfully. <br/><br/>Overall Oldboy is world cinema at its highest quality. A colourful piece of cinematography from a notable director which I believe will no doubt see a Hollywood remake. If this does occur the only director I can see doing Oldboy justice is Quentin Tarantino. There are some people who will walk away from this film stating it was good but not amazing, however what I hope the majority will take away from Oldboy is a greater sense of appreciation for Eastern society film making."
"terceiro-2","9","2","5","28 October 2010"," Loved the movie but no idea what it was about
","This is an excellent movie, which I really enjoyed. However, I must admit I did not really understand most of the movie. While it is a bit strange saying that I enjoyed a movie which is so hard to follow, there are a lot of reasons to like this movie.<br/><br/>First, it is not like any movie I had seen before. It is creative without being silly or indulgent. The director is continually having great ideas which on almost every occasion come off.<br/><br/>Second, the acting is quite excellent. The way the actors react to events is quite captivating. They do strange things, normal things and just everyday mundane things in a totally believable way.<br/><br/>Third, the movie has some fairly humorous parts, even though it is a very serious movie. Look out for a couple of scenes in particular, for example the octopus scene and the attempted seduction scene. Hysterical.<br/><br/>Finally, the use of colour in the movie is very effective. Most of the movie is characterised by loud, vibrant colours. However the director sometimes uses black and white and duller colours to excellent effect.<br/><br/>In short, this is the type of movie that you just can't turn away from. You will be continually asking yourself what could possibly happen next. I am sure that with each repeat viewing you will pick up many different things which you missed first or second or third time around."

","South Korea is enjoying a historical-first exporting of culture to the West. Americans have long been importing European culture, but with so much noise coming from the South Korean wave, now is the perfect time to take a look out east. And, as an introduction to a large library of outstanding Korean movies, Park Chan-Wook's 2003 thriller Oldboy will exemplify 21st century Korean art.<br/><br/>The storyline for Oldboy is hard to discuss without spoiling too many twists. On a random night, the protagonist Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped outside a phone booth. He's then held in solitary confinement for fifteen years, receiving daily meals and arbitrary hair cuts. The day of his fifteenth year in prison, he's released and immediately starts investigating who imprisoned him and why.<br/><br/>The plot, while interesting, is not what gives this film the strength to survive a market saturated with thrillers. This movie is very smart for what one would expect in a thriller genre and carries many messages about revenge, violence, redemption and the ability to forget. When Oh figures out the reason for his incarceration, why is he dissatisfied? And even more poignant, why is the audience dissatisfied? A viewer expecting to turn his or her brain off as soon as action starts will probably miss what makes this such an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Oldboy's action sequences serve more purpose than to get the audience's heart pumping. Park Chan-Wook does an amazing job using action to reveal character motives and internal struggles. During one unedited scene, Oh battles through a hallway filled with gangsters wielding blunt weapons and knives. He isn't stronger, faster or better trained than any of his opponents, but instead fights on pure rage. At one point, Oh is stabbed in the back and falls to the ground while everyone surrounds him and assumes he's dead. Instead of something over the top, Oh does the only realistic thing that can be done at that point and uses a hammer to crush the feet of a few people around him. Frightened, his enemies jump back, giving Oh enough room to recover. The scene ends not when everyone is dead or unconscious, but instead the gangsters just don't want to fight. Oh staggers out, unpursued, because nobody wants to continue fighting a frothing caged animal.<br/><br/>Many critics comment on the violence in Oldboy. There is plenty of violence; enough for Quentin Tarantino to fall in love with the film and assist in awarding it a Grand Prix of the Jury at Cannes. But much of the violence occurs off-screen and in the head of the audience. During one scene, while Oh tortures someone that was in his path, the viewer sees less blood than any scene in Saw or The Expendables. But many will find themselves wincing since imagination fills in the rest of the details.<br/><br/>This is a movie that viewers will likely rewatch. Except for a few gems, this summer has been lackluster in memorable films. The best way to end summer is to grit your teeth and read some subtitles (the movie is dubbed in English, but the speakers can't capture the same level of emotion), and take a look at how artistic and wonderful the thriller genre can be in the right hands.

"kluseba","9","2","5","20 August 2010"," A true piece of Asian culture!
","This movie got everything that a good movie needs and deserves absolutely its place within the one hundred best movies of all times on this site! <br/><br/>It has its own and unique character because of a typical Asian strange atmosphere, an excellent acting, some very good ideas and interesting twists throughout the movie. You have a twisted revenge story mixed with a fatal love story in a very philosophical and moral context that makes the viewers judge and think a lot. Topics and antithesis like future and past, love and hate, revenge and forgiveness are all covered by the story and lie much closer than one may expect. The topics and the story with all its twists are complex, but very easy to understand for everyone and it is easy to approach to this movie although it is a very unique and special one. Even after several views, the movie remains profound and surprises you and is still entertaining - no matter for watching it alone at home or during a little alternative DVD night with friends with whom you may surely discuss about this piece of art! <br/><br/>The film is a rare masterpiece, heavy and disturbing, but not because of a few very well done gore and action scenes, but because of the profound and twisted stories of the main characters who are all lost sinners in a very fatal way. The movie has the class to be more than an inside tip but a mainstream movie, but in the same time, the movie is far away from the ordinary revenge stories and doesn't deny his Asian flows and roots. It is a very intellectual, philosophical and personal movie, but some excellent, absurd and even artistic action, crime movie and horror elements keep the tension high so that this movie doesn't have any lengths. It is more than an entertaining movie and when you've seen it once, you will surely fall in love with it and this film request multiple viewings! <br/><br/>It is fascinating how profound and artistic the Asian cinema is in comparison to a too serious European cinema and a too superficial North American cinema an this movie is an excellent example for this fact and may convince you to get more connected to the Asian cinema. Let's hope that there will be no American remake because of this movie's international inside success, because they won't be able to create the same kind of uniqueness and atmosphere. This movie is a true piece of Eastern culture!"

","This movie just gets more and more intense until the end when you get shocked by the conclusion. The story is very good and will keep you interested till the very end. Min-sik Choi was amazing in this film. Imagine being locked up for 15 years. Now your cell is not bad, it is like a small dorm room with bad wallpaper. But you are fed the same food everyday and all you have is a crappy TV to watch. Being stuck in that small space will drive you nuts. You also find out by the TV that life is changing and that your wife is murdered and they say it was you. Yet it can't be because you are locked up. What do you do to keep yourself sane. Min-sik Choi's character Dae-su just became a beast within himself. A beast full of revenge against the character played by Yu Ji-tae who was also excellent. The rest of the cast is also great and really know how to act. The story is just one big pain in the mind. You try to figure it out and you can't be absolutely sure you got it, till the end of the film. And when that comes, you won't believe what happens. Great film and probably one of the best in that year from South Korea."

Constantly fascinating, though it's hard to watch a tongue being snipped out with scissors, and other acts of mutilation. Oldboy is a sadistic masterpiece.

"evetan00000","10","2","5","3 January 2009"," One of the most disturbing film I've come across...
","Old Boy is the 2nd instalment by the Korean director Park Chan Wook. After posting his 3rd film Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, my colleague lent me this DVD to watch and i must say this is better than the 3rd one.<br/><br/>The same actor for both films, Choi Min Sik was imprisoned for 15 years without him knowing the reason. He lived in a daze thruout these years and one day, he managed to escape and plot to seek who's his captor and to take revenge. A series of mind-boggling events started happening and it just threw me off once in a while trying to make sense of everything. Lots of plot twists and odd relationships in this particular film and by the end of it, i was clutching my head in emotional pain as everything became sickingly clear.<br/><br/>Physical torture is another form of the director's signature style, with scenes that depict blood and pain, I really cringed when the lead actor swallowed a huge live octopus and later cut off his tongue. Yup thinking back still makes me sick.But the worst pain of all would be the mental torture the story ended in. To imagine being in his shoes, i would just really kill myself to relief the eternal pain in my mind.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for viewers who like these violent scenes and able to take it visually. Now im left w his first instalment that i haven't watched yet: Sympathy for Mr Vengeance"
"matt-szy","7","10","48","16 May 2006"," a nice experiment in film but ultimately too contrived to be great
","Old boy is not a realistic film. Its characters are cut outs from some hyper thriller genre. Its plot twists are obvious devices to move the story along. And if these things mentioned are not important to you than it is likely you will be entertained by everything else; the camera trickery, the shocking torture scenes, and the comic book inspired story.<br/><br/>Old boy is a film made in a Hollywood vein. It is more sensational than anything else. In order to move the characters along Park has placed devices (deus ex machina) with the use of planted cell phones, surprises in boxes, uncovering things the viewer nor the main character, Oh Dae-su, had known. Is this a bad device? No. Its a common device used in many films. Could the story work without these devices? No. And because of this Oldboy works in the thriller genre. Yet Oldboy doesn't surpass any kind of film conventions in this in this genre to receive special praise.<br/><br/>The torture scenes are used more to shock than to tell anything new in the story. An example of a film where torture, very graphic torture, is not some cliché shock device but more so a comment on human relationships, pain, societal indifference, is Takashi Miike's film, Audition.<br/><br/>Lets not be so hasty in disregarding this film as bad, because bad it is not. It has moments. The opening is definitely an attention grabber - a guy holding a poodle being held by his tie from a building rooftop by some dark faced figure, Oh Dae-su's pleading, after finding out the biggest secret (plot twist), where he performs a disturbing masochistic act, and of course the one long take of the fight scene where Dae-su beats up some forty people. All that is cool. And the film throughout was cool, maybe mostly cool for cool's sake, until the end.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for entertainment with torture, blood, sex, fighting, topped with a comic like story of revenge, this film will definitely work for you. And if you are profoundly moved by the genius of this film, I'll be very suspicious. ALl in all, 7 out of 10."
"damianlhayes","10","14","74","9 October 2006"," Welcome relief for some, complete disappointment for others?
","If you like films that entertain and let you forget for two hours, then this is a film you will not enjoy, in fact probably hate. If you like films that ask you to really think, that categorically refuse to adhere to standardised modes of filmic production and consumption, then this is film you will love.<br/><br/>!Spoilers!<br/><br/>How many films can you think of have the same linear predictable plot structure that inevitably ends happily ever after? Almost as long as films have been made this has continually been the case. Hollywood productions which so completely dominate the western audience, simply dare not do otherwise. And why not? It is what makes money. Films follow this pattern because it is a tried, tested and proved method for mass consumption. I consider OldBoy to be an anti-Hollywood film. It is a journey that begins with a hero and ends with a monster. It addresses subjects that mainstream directors would never even consider. Having read a number of comments posted, what seems most abjectionable to people is the incest and the torture. The incest and torture is absolutely not pointless or unnecessarily gratuitous. The removal of Daesu's tongue (symbolic phallus) and the excessive dental work is a direct reference to the theory of castration anxiety, which is the basis of Sigmund Freuds work on the human psyche. As for the incest and the self mutilation, it is definitely a reference to the Greek Tragedy of Oedipus Rex, where Oedipus blinds himself after he discovers he has unknowingly slept with his mother and murdered his own father. The incest, the torture and the amputation of Daesu's tongue represent, among other things, a total rejection of the model of the Hollywood hero, who always wins.<br/><br/>You may like, love, loathe or Hate OldBoy, but don't think it sensationalist and pointless. It didn't win awards for nothing, there really is reason people like it so much."
"quinoble","10","14","74","3 June 2006"," a wild beast of a movie
","I can't say I ""loved"" this movie--it's far too brutal and dark to be called lovable--but I can say that hardly a week goes by without my thinking about it. Upon first seeing it I was dazed, unable to speak, feeling as if I'd been stabbed in the gut. Was this a movie? I'd always thought I knew what movies were, but Oldboy was utterly different. Other movies were about their subject; Oldboy embodied its subject. Other movies were watched; Oldboy was experienced. And after finishing other movies, I leaned back comfortably and thought fondly about how good they were; after finishing Oldboy, I was trembling, unable to fully process what I'd just been through.<br/><br/>Oldboy has inspired an unusual amount of vitriol (judging from some of the angry reviews here, it seems many people want revenge on the movie itself!) Many people are uncomfortable with its horrendous violence, and turn this into hatred. They're right to be disturbed. Oldboy is horrific, because it deals directly with one of the most horrific aspects of humanity: our primal need to destroy those who have caused us suffering. Chan-Wook Park employs every technical resource of the cinema--music, sound effects, set and costume design, cinematography, editing, CGI--and portrays such extreme violence, not merely to sell a few more tickets (though the movie's stylishness and brutality certainly didn't hurt its box office), but to make the audience feel, at the visceral level, the destructiveness and utter futility of revenge.<br/><br/>There are no concessions to the audience's sensibilities. Moviegoers are used to photorealism; Oldboy goes for portraiture. (The director has claimed the movie's cinematography was partly influenced by the paintings of Goya and Velasquez, and it shows, especially in the justly celebrated corridor fight). Standard dramatic exposition is abandoned as the movie leaps dizzyingly from scene to elliptical scene, leaving the audience to play catch-up. Scenes of unbearable torture and suffering alternate with scenes of tenderness, humor, surreal imaginings. We jump back and forth in time as we grow closer to finding out the unspeakable truth. And when all is revealed, the director adds a final twist of the knife: Dae-Su chooses to forget it all, unable to face the acts his antagonist has tricked him into committing, and the lovers are left to find what happiness they can.<br/><br/>Chan-Wook Park's vengeance movies are the closest the cinema has come to Shakespearean tragedy. Lear and Hamlet may be too remote from us to have the impact they undoubtedly did on Elizabethan audiences--but Oldboy is completely pulpy and modern. There are those who bristle at the comparison, rallying to the defense of ""high art"", those who share Tarkovsky's belief that film is a vehicle to convey sacred truths to the audience, to whom the idea that a movie can be enjoyable and intelligent is anathema. But the Bard was seen as no more than an extremely successful popular entertainer in his own time, and his contemporaries criticized him for his unruly, extravagant style-- exactly the same sort of treatment Park has been accorded. Which is to say that by comparing Oldboy to Macbeth, I don't mean any more than that Oldboy 1) is awesome entertainment and 2) explores a basic facet of human nature. You can't ask for more from a movie than that."

Yeah, the protagonist is pathetic - but that's the point! Aren't we all bored of Tarantino's sucky heroine in Kill Bill who's so hell-bent on her revenge that she can take on nearly 100 Yakuza dudes and win? Revenge is petty, and Oh seems to think he can take on the world.<br/><br/>The brilliant scene where he attempts to take on a couple of dozen henchmen is superb! Purposely filmed to look like an old-school arcade game, it drags on for so long showing the hopelessness of the situation. Everyone is injured and falling over - they can barely catch their breath, but all they want to do is kill and maim.<br/><br/>I must say I am fed up of violent movies that serve no purpose than entertainment. That verges on sadism. Look at Bad Boys 2 - a huge pursuit across the city, where let's not forget countless cars blow up and presumably people die ('cos that's what happens when cars blow up) and what can Will Smith and his compadre do? Crack sniggers and make jokes.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a film that shows violence and revenge for what it is - pathetic and futile. Also, a brilliant story full of mystery that really doesn't reward the viewer for finding out the truth - just as is the case with the protagonist, Oh.

He does not know who's imprisoned him or why. He later finds out from the television in his room that his wife was murdered, he is held responsible for her death, and his young daughter has been adopted.

She helps him unravel the mystery behind the fifteen years he's lost. The ingenious setup of this film is that Daesu meets his tormentor Woojin, face to face, early on. Daesu cannot kill him because he wants answers, so he is forced to allow Woojin to observe him revelation after revelation. Woojin tells him he has five days to figure it all out or Mido dies.<br/><br/>Old boy is disturbing, it is twisted, and its effects linger. There are some shocking scenes of violence. There is also an amazing fight scene that takes place in a narrow hallway. The point of the film is not to feel sympathy for Daesu. He will exact his revenge. Or will he? It is the revelation of Woojin's motive we wait to see. Choi Min Shik and Yu Ji Tae give amazing performances.

"Danherb","9","17","95","4 June 2005"," Extraordinary, stylish, brilliant, but probably not appropriate for everybody
","***Very minor spoilers***<br/><br/>This movie will (and it already has) split up the audience in two groups: One group, that will be totally impressed by the film, its script the exceptional editing and cinematography and another group, that will see no sense in this movie, only a succession of absurd and bizarre situations and scenes.<br/><br/>It may take a while to get used to the peculiar style of this movie. I think I would attribute myself to the first group, at least after I have watched ""Oldboy"" for the second time. I was even very impressed by it, but I have to admit that it was a little bit hard for me to get used to the movie's specific fashion. But I guarantee, once you've cottoned on to the style of it, you will love it!<br/><br/>One has to look at this movie as mixture of a piece of art and a complex thriller/drama. It is surreal at times, but not as much as David Lynch's films f.ex., because it absolutely has a continuous and coherent storyline, although several situations and the character's actions are a bit unbelievable at times, which is probably the biggest problem, that the objectors of this film have.<br/><br/>But the style, thus editing and cinematography are just awesome. The way, the director presents certain scenes by using stylistic features such as freeze images, special music and narrating instead of dialogues is marvelous, it breaks old customs, but it perfectly works. Especially the first half of the film is very stylish and terrificly edited, the second half of if is rather devoted to story and its twists. The sooner the ending comes the more brilliant the script and the twists are. And the denouement at the end will take your breath, but even if you watch the movie for the second or third time you will notice hints and things that you haven't noticed before, because they are not essential to understand the twist, but they show once again how great and sophisticated the script is.<br/><br/>So if you don't shy at peculiar and extraordinary Asian movies, go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"max_coleman","10","17","95","31 May 2005"," Excellence, the best film of the last 4 decades
","This is simply put, amazing cinema. The music that accompanies the film is as recognisable as distinguished classical music such as Beethoven and Mozart going as far as to incorporate Vivaldi's four seasons' winter movement. The music, however, is just the start of what was an unfortunately overlooked film. The acting of this film was of such calibre it didn't even bring to question ""I wonder how the actors prepared for these roles, how do they work so well together, where does this chemistry come from?!"" as they perform to such a fine extent that the viewer is immediately immersed in the film to the extent where there are no actors, there is no film, only a constant denouement which leaves a viewer at times, so immersed that we become isolated from our own world, accepting Dae-Su's viewpoint as our own. This is a critical skill that this film harnesses as the subject material is quite difficult to grasp and accept freely otherwise. It gets to a point where Dae-Su is approached and depicted as an almost Travis Bickle type character, that is to say, an anti hero. Plot holes such as the age difference between dae su and woo jin are covered effortlessly by acting, choreography and cinematography that puts films widely regarded as classics such as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" to crippling shame. This film without a doubt is the best film i have ever seen, by a long way, there is something here, not for everyone but those who are willing to suspend the constraints of our reality in return for stepping into Oh Dae Su's."
"Indyrod","9","18","102","11 February 2005"," The most chilling climax since Se7en
","I just watched this amazing movie last night. First of all, this has the most chilling ending of any movie I have seen since ""Se7en"". And I watch A LOT of movies. When a movie makes cold chills run down my spine, like ""Oldboy"" did when the twist is revealed, it's a masterpiece in film-making to me. There's nothing about the movie that I did not like, absolutely nothing. And I think it's better than ""Kill Bill"" in every respect, in fact, much better. After watching director Park's ""CUT"" from the ""Three... Extremes"" anthology and being very impressed, ""Oldboy"" seals the deal that this is the director to watch. Superbly filmed, amazing performances, a dynamite soundtrack, and a story that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll. I still can't get over the feeling I had when the twist is revealed. Just absolutely amazing how a movie can physically take over your body, and make you visibly shaken. I was very shaken, disturbed, and in total awe that this director was able to pull off such a phenomenal flip flop of the revenge genre. Kudos to this great film, and a must-see if there ever was one."

","I think that Oldboy is a good film but also one of the most overrated films i know.

I do not think so, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of that kind of filming. I think that the director tried hard to impress the audience and he made it. But, the real art is elsewhere ( Godfather, Once upon a time in America, Stalker, Breaking the waves... and so on ).<br/><br/>Oldboy is a movie that any cine fan must watch but it's not a masterpiece in any way :)"

Gore - As perfect as any gore classic, romance as innocent as the most serene movies, action as raw as any Tarantino flick, style impeccable.<br/><br/>The sensitivity with which the director has handled such a sensitive topic (due to which the revenge drama unfolds) and the balancing of the mystery element till the very end, the last line spoken by the anti-hero, the realization of purpose completed......pure bliss! <br/><br/>I am just speechless!"
"PhilKill","10","10","51","6 February 2007"," A striking and unbelievably good thriller.
","Korea has been making some of the freshest and most exciting cinema of recent years, and Chan-wook Park's film is no exception. Part of his revenge themed trilogy which also consists of his previous film 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' and the last film in the series 'Lady Vengeance'. Dealing with retribution and its affects on human emotions, Oldboy is the story of Oh Dae-Su (played remarkably by Min-sik Choi). An average man, who is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years without any explanation. In his prison with very little to do, he takes out his pain and anger on the walls by hitting them with his bare fists and unwittingly he transforms himself into a hardened and capable fighter. On his sudden release a puzzling story of gritty revenge unfolds. The less you know about this film from here on the better, so I wont reveal anything else of the actual plot.<br/><br/>The cinematography is striking and the action sequences are pulled off with an energy and realism, balanced with a quirky sense of humour lacking from western films of this kind. A key scene where Min-sik Choi fights his way through a stream of foes down a narrow corridor is one of the best shot fight scenes I've seen, with its awkward and realistic choreography that is clumsy yet flowing. It is simply breathtaking, it left me speechless and with my jaw firmly on the floor. But if you're expecting a action film with relentless fighting this isn't the one for you. Oldboy is a mystery thriller about revenge, it's bleak and dark, and it's plot will keep you gripped. Everything about this film for me is perfect; the acting is extraordinary, the direction is flawless, and simultaneously it is brutally and beautifully delivered. But it's the unsympathetic, harsh story that makes this film stand out in the end, it defines the revenge film and will leave you in awe."

He is given dumplings every day, and he has only the TV as a means of communication with the rest of the world. Then, he is released, and is along with a nice suit, he is given sufficient money for his personal use, only to learn that he has to find his captor in 5 days.<br/><br/>ChanWook Park's thriller that has captivated thousands and shocked or disturbed others is surely going to be, for better or worse, a big thing when it opens in select theaters in the US. Many of you have said that it sucks, and that it is overly ambitious for what it is. Well, I give you that: it is ambitious, but that it does its job. By no means is this movie original, nor innovative. I can name a few movies coming out of Hollywood that have done a similar job and succeeded as well as this one did. But this is no Hollywood. This movie has come out from South Korea (which by the way has been releasing countless excellent movies lately) and I tell you, in my view, it has rivaled (or even surpassed most) many big budget films that I have previously mentioned. This movie assures movie goers that one not need flashy settings, untalented pretty faces as actors and big budgets to make an excellent film like this one.

","Even though I see where people are coming from, it's still amusing to see people complain about Oldboy being violent - Violence & torture has been widely discussed ever since the release of the movie. Every single review that Oldboy has ever got, made points about it. If you turn your clock and back to 1990 and read back the reviews for Pulp Fiction. You will find EXACTLY identical criticism - ugly, needless, pointless violence - do we really need a rape scene in a movie? Oldboy, just like Pulp Fiction before it, is a divisive entertainment. It does not celebrate the greatness of mankind and pats on our shoulder for watching it to the end, saying 'well done, see how great we all can be' kinda attitude. Instead it punches, gnaws and knocks you over until you are thoroughly battered and bleeding to the core. Some people love it or some hate it. No two ways about it.<br/><br/>And I'm firmly in the side of 'loving' it. When I watched it for the first time, I felt repulsed and shocked. Didn't quite know what to think, but I couldn't forget. Two days I found myself wanting to watch the DVD again. After watching it for the fifth time, I slowly realized it has that 'magic' quality, that something special which will last in memories of many, for years to come.<br/><br/>Style, music, acting and color. Oldboy is a supernova of all these, mixed into highly charged adrenaline pumping, kicking your gut, like entertainment. Even if you hated this movie, you won't be able to tear your eyes away from it, because Oldboy has the hypnotic quality like a sweet nightmare.<br/><br/>Oldboy will stand the test of time because it's a pure cinema of awesome quality, and if you can stand the heat, it's a movie to kick your head spinning and two days later you would be ready to be kicked once more."

"XenoHive","10","16","93","13 November 2005"," Where do critics gain their knowledge?
","I found Oldboy to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and for simple reasons. As a student of acting and of play history, it amazes me how so many of the ""critics"" on this website view this movie with dull disinterest or even disdain. This movie captures the audience immediately with its breathtaking cinematography and inherent mystery, of which, I assure, there is more to be found. The film is best viewed in the original Korean with subtitles to get the truest performance possible (if you don't speak Korean, that is) from the actors who tackle emotional and psychological subjects reminiscent of Hamlet or Macbeth. The allusions of this story to the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo do not diminish from this movie, but only serve to impress me further by the way a classic theme of isolation and vengeance can be built upon and heightened today, especially via the realm of South Korean cinema. The violence, twists, and revelations which occur during this movie are not of the same variety found in most cheap Hollywood movies you might see today because no matter how unlikely, or perhaps even implausible, they might be, they are only so because they are on the most extreme of human experiences. And, because of this, the actions taken by the characters all lie firmly embedded somewhere in the universal human psyche. The choices made by the characters are not nearly as far-fetched as those made by say the average character of an average TV drama, going into a ridiculous situation with ridiculous causes. Rather, these are characters driven by goals which stem from real strain built onto believable people. Every character has a journey, every character has a revelation, and every character faces them-self. To highlight the extraordinariness of this movie, the director and cinematographer were also clever enough to know when these moments are, and paint them with a clarity that can be summed up as other-worldly. Yes, the violence is shocking at times, and maybe it stretches one or two scientific concepts, but the movie is still in one word: artful. It is art because I am here typing this at 3 in the morning, enraged at how so many could pass this movie off as shock cinema because their puritan minds could not fathom so extreme a case as this one. What would happen if Andy Dufrain was not so sweet an individual, but one who cried out for revenge like Hamlet? That is what this story is. This movie is special because it touches on what most of us cannot even begin to imagine. I will not ruin the ending, but I will say that the reason Oh-Daesu is imprisoned is something that I think all audience members will leave knowing they are guilty of as well. Humanity is special. Oldboy is special."

Even the short descriptive text they used to promote the film says too much. Let me just say that it is probably the most creative revenge movie you will ever see. The set design is great, especially the penthouse condo. There is one special effects sequence (with an ant) that works perfectly, and provides a quick laugh in a moment of sadness in the film. The pacing is surprisingly perfect, considering the run time for the film is 2 hours. The acting is stellar. The struggle of the main characters was so real that I felt uncomfortable for a good portion of their interaction.<br/><br/>It also has one of the most realistic fight sequences I've seen on film. Where the main character defends himself in a hallway (shot lengthwise so you can see almost the whole hall at once), against about 20 thugs.

I can't really say too much about the movie without risk of giving things away... but here's the movie in a nutshell. After being bailed out of jail on a drunk and disorderly charge Oh Daesu (Min-Sik Choi) is kidnapped and confined to small apartment where he is cut off from the entire world except for a TV. His meals are brought to him through a small trap door and every now and then he is gassed into unconsciousness and his captors clean up after him. After living like this for FIFTEEN YEARS he is suddenly set free with no explanation. He vows bloody revenge on the person who did this to him but he also desperately needs the answer to the question ""why""? To say too much more would ruin the odd twists and turns.

Not a moving or touching experience, rather a thrill; an adrenaline rush; a jolt.<br/><br/>The film does not relate to the heartfelt aspects of humanity, nor does it attempt to, nor should viewers expect such things. The film does speak of rage, subversion, antagony and revenge. And it does so wonderfully. Aren't these all aspects of being human?

What starts as a vengeance movie, slowly becomes a puzzle where all pieces match by the end.  This is like THE SIX SENSE without the phantasms.<br/><br/>Chanwook Park has created a movie about the human condition, about the subjectivity of good and bad.  When the movie reaches its conclusion, all-moral values are destroyed and many people will be looking for the purifying fire that never arrives.

","As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I found this film to be fascinating and enigmatic. It's surreal plot and philosophical dialogue, while certainly over-dramatic and at times outright ridiculous, leave the audience with a sense of the powerful emotions involved. On the outset, the plot seems crass and absurd, but when you look deeper into the characters you see a powerful movie that depicts the gamete of human emotions in a vivid and incredible way.<br/><br/>I found some of the material to be a bit unnecessarily depictive, but at the same time I'm not really sure if this could have avoided due to the graphic nature of the story. If this movie is lacking anywhere, it has to be in it's continuity. At times the transitions seem forced and the tension loses momentum briefly, but I think this is made up for in overall effect.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for the squeamish, as it depicts violence and sex quite boldly, yet it's subtle commentary on the nature of sin, repentance, and justice is quite compelling. Definitely worth watching at least once as long as you can handle the disturbing material."

","Harboiled. Awesome. Two-fisted. Shocking. Original. Stomach-turning. Captivating. It's near-impossible to come up with adequate superlatives for Korean Chan-Wook Park's ferocious, Jacobean tale of bloody revenge, particularly when they've been diluted elsewhere for so many lesser films.<br/><br/>Following a drunken night on the town, egregious businessman Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is abducted and locked in a tiny apartment for no apparent reason. For 15 years.<br/><br/>During that time he has no human contact, is occasionally rendered unconscious for haircuts or medical checks and kills time by beating the walls, plotting his revenge, suffering hallucinations spurred by loneliness and poring over his past for a clue as to his persecutor's identity. A TV is his sole link to reality and it's through this he learns of his wife's murder.<br/><br/>Then one day he wakes up in a suitcase in the outside world and sets about hunting the jailer who still taunts him via a mobile phone. To say more would be to give away far too much of the labyrinthine plot, suffice it say that Dae-su's not the only one seeking retribution.<br/><br/>Park revisits many of the themes of his earlier Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, but here orchestrates them into an operatic, stylised crescendo of violence, grief and corrupted love, using precisely chosen original music and striking visual design to haunting effect while punctuating Dae-su's quest with moments of disturbing violence (a teeth torture scene is almost unendurable) and breath-taking audacious action (the protagonist's hammer fight with dozens of assailants, captured in a single take, is incredible).<br/><br/>Material this dark could so easily have been played wrong but Min-Sik Choi gives an astounding performance of such rare power and commitment that it's impossible not to be swept into the world behind his eyes.<br/><br/>Oldboy's certainly not for the squeamish, faint-hearted or easily offended but it's absolutely essential viewing for anyone with a passion for virtuoso cinema  the cutting-edge just got a lot sharper."

","Where to start? If you are a lover of extreme Asian cinema like myself then you will love this no question. But where as excellent Asian films such as Ichi the Killer and Battle Royale contained non-stop ultra-violence Oldboy is different.<br/><br/>Oldboy is multi-layered in the sense that it has many different genres and emotional characteristics to convey. Firstly the violence is sparingly used and beautifully done especially in the long corridor scene, instead most time is used on Dae-Su's journey. It follows his search for truth, vengeance and what he ultimately discovers about himself and how shameful his life has been. Secondly it feels like more of a twisted love story as Dae-Su's relationships grow. <br/><br/>This film has carried lots of controversy, if you don't normally like these sorts of films look past the violence and controversy and see Asian cinema at it's best. 10/10 superb."

","Chan-wook Park's revenge opus certainly starts with a bang as we meet the film's anti-hero Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) holding a man over the edge of a tower block by his tie. What we see  or what we think we see  is misleading, however, and gives us an appropriate introduction to Park's remarkable yet flawed saga. The opening scene echoes a much later, pivotal, moment that holds the key to the entire mystery, and neatly encapsulates one of the themes of OLDBOY  the passing of time, its resonance, the power with which control of another person's time endows us, the manner in which what is a trivial moment in time for one person can be the irreversible beginning of life-altering tragedy for another. OLDBOY is also a study of revenge, of its nature, and of the way vengeance can destroy the person who seeks it more completely than the person on whom it is intended. <br/><br/>Immediately after the opening scene Park takes us back fifteen years to meet a much different Oh Dae-su; an overweight drunken buffoon handcuffed to the wall of a police station because of his disruptive behaviour. Bailed out by a friend, Dae-su disappears during the course of a telephone conversation, and awakens to find himself in a prison cell decked out like a cheap hotel room. This room will be his home for a decade-and-a-half during which his only contact with the outside world is via TV. He occupies his time by keeping a journal in which he records all his previous misdeeds and the people with whom he has come into conflict, by toughening his fists against the walls of his cell, and by planning his escape thanks to an additional chopstick delivered with his meal one day. Then, just as he is about to make his escape, Dae-su is released<br/><br/>Bursting from a suitcase as if being reborn into the world, he finds himself on the grassy roof of a tower block that overlooks the street from which he was abducted. On the rooftop is a man contemplating suicide  which is where we came in <br/><br/>Dae-Su's ultimate failure to escape from his prison sets a precedent that runs throughout the movie: he fails in everything he sets out to achieve, largely because he is just a puppet  the target of revenge, not its architect.<br/><br/>Asian movies are probably the most inventive in the world at present. Unlike Hollywood's Majors, which too often find themselves shackled by their fear of the influence of outspoken pressure groups and moralistic politics, Asian filmmakers are free to explore subjects  and show scenes  from which Hollywood would shrink (which leaves one fearful for the quality of the proposed American remake of this film). This film is typical of that creative freedom. The violence is both cartoonish and sadistic, and is often depicted as of a viscerally epic nature (such as the one-take sequence in the corridor of Oh Dae-su's former prison) or coolly balletic (as in his encounter with a gang of street punks). Park's camera lingers greedily on a close up of a gangster's teeth being extracted with a claw hammer, and we are treated to a scene of Oh Dae-Su tearing the head off a live squid and chewing manfully as its tentacles shiver and curl around his mouth. And yet this violence never seems gratuitous or out of place. While, when looked upon with a studied eye, the corridor fight-scene is more than a little unbelievable, by filming it Park is staying true to the film's Manga roots. Like the stories in those comic books, the characters in OLDBOY seem to operate on the periphery of a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own. While this makes it easier for us to accept some of the more far-fetched aspects of the plot, it also distances us emotionally from the characters. Characters are all they are, ciphers, instruments of the storyteller wielded as professionally and dispassionately as that claw hammer. As with most films that rely on visceral impact to transport the viewer, the densely plotted story disguises a wealth of plot holes that only rise to the surface of the viewer's consciousness after the deliberately ambiguous ending. Oh Dae-su's actions become increasingly erratic as the tale unfolds and he comes closer to learning the truth. Given the motives that drive his character, his intense feelings for the winsome Mi-do after just a few days don't ring true even after we are given an explanation for it but, as they are crucial to the eventual outcome, leave the impression that they have been shoehorned into the plot.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning, with superlative camera-work from Jeong-hun Jeong, and Choi min-sik gives a towering performance as the embittered anti-hero. Ji-tae Yu, in a smaller but no less important role, lacks for much of the film the tragic persona his part cries out for. For my money, his character would have worked better had he been given a darker persona haunted by the events that have driven him to pursue such an elaborate act of revenge over so many years.<br/><br/>Despite these reservations about character and plot, the film is definitely a worthwhile addition to the growing number of imaginative and praiseworthy movies produced by Asian countries over the last decade. I've a feeling that time may dull its reputation, that the talented Chan-wook Park has not yet reached the peak of his talent and will produce work in the future that will surpass OLDBOY. Certainly, the top 100 rating it holds on this website is higher than it deserves."

","I heard Oldboy was a movie that should not be missed. I couldn't agree any more with that statement. Don't let the simple premise fool you, this movie is quite complex. The visuals are innovative, and the various plot twists are unexpected. The final revelation especially caught me off guard. Also, two highlights that stood out for me were the octopus scene for its audacity and the corridor fight scene which was exceptional. The movie is far better than I expected. There is no way that the planned Hollywood remake will be as good or entertaining as the original.

The soundtrack was fantastically atmospheric! However i do believe that the ending of the movie was a little long winded, and i can see why some would see old-boy as sadistic and gratuitously violent,but i believe its violence was necessary, i mean if i got locked up for 15 years without any apparent reason, i wouldn't exactly be blowing kisses to find out why. It also helps form the identity and develop the 'monster' side of Oh Dau Su, in parallel with the less sadistic 'sane' Oh Dae Su. Oldboy does in some ways have a message ""laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone"" which helps our protagonist maintain his sanity during his captivity and eventual release.

","I think that movies like 'Oldboy' highlight the fact that if you want to watch high-quality, thought-provoking film, then you must first check that it wasn't made in America. This leads us to an explanation for the conspicuous failure of Hollywood to actually make any money for the last few years, and a criticism of the formulaic 'blockbuster' approach to movie-making. 'Oldboy' isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is certainly a complex and unique piece of work.

","In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers.

He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming. <br/><br/>It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis.

"osakar","Null","2","6","1 February 2012"," A modern classic.
","Oldboy is a great film. Not only did it put South Korea on the cinematic map, it did so while delivering a great, psychological horror story, told with a completely fresh flair and style.<br/><br/>It is a violent film. The violence is over-the-top and shocking, with scenes of torture and bloodletting that are grotesque and wince-inducing. However, Oldboy has little in common with the stereotypical action or gore movie, in which the focus is on the violence itself rather than trivialities like plot, characters and themes. In such works, the events in the film function mostly as a tiresome haul that needs to be completed before the satisfying arrival at the blood-splattered money shot. Oldboy, on the other hand, smoothly weaves the violence into its story in a natural and unforced manner. Also, by refusing to shy away from the images of obscene violence, the film puts an uncomfortable magnifying glass over the ugly side of revenge. Showing the disturbing violence for what it is rather than glorifying it, it makes an impression that lasts far longer than that of Tarantino's shallow revenge fantasies.<br/><br/>After his previous work, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, director Park Chan-Wook went a whole new direction. While that film was slow-paced to the point of being meditative, and had stylistic touches but maintained a cold realism, Oldboy is fast and stylish and bursting at the seams with cinematic ideas. Film-wise it follows an anything-goes principle, and it does so without ever feeling silly or excessive. The unexpected use of CGI, unexpected violence, unexpected turns of the story – everything is designed to catch the first-time viewer off-guard. Yet despite this, the film flows beautifully and makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>The combination of music – everything from low-key electronic loops to intense Vivaldi pieces – and images is simply fantastic. Every shot is eye-catching, from the dark and crumbling slums of the city to the antagonist's sterile penthouse and the final scenes' snow-covered mountain tops. It is a film that is great both to look at and listen to. Even so, it avoids making Tarsem Singh's (director of The Cell and The Fall) mistake of letting the images be the entire film. Instead, Oldboy's story more than holds its own against the visuals and soundtrack. When the film's final revelation comes crashing down, it is as shocking to the audience as it is to the protagonist. This ""twist"" scene also has one of the movie's greatest, tensest build-ups; if only for this single moment, the movie is well worth watching.<br/><br/>Oldboy is an example of a filmmaker having a good vision, the means to make it a reality, and the dedication and talent to pull it off. Direction, story and actors work together so well, it makes creating something like this look easy. If you can handle the violence, you will find an extremely well-written, creative, dramatic, humorous, original and entertaining film, one that takes you for a cinematic roller-coaster ride in its truest sense. A must-see."

","After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must discover the reason for his capture in five days.<br/><br/>I am a bit surprised to find this film in the top 250. Not that it is not a good film (it is), but it does not seem like the sort of thing that would get the honor. I suppose, certain plot elements aside, it has incredible cinematography (both in movement and color) and excellent directing. The acting is fine, as well.<br/><br/>The violence is hard to categorize. On one hand, some of the bloodiest scenes call to find the films of Takashi Miike. But Miike lacks a certain sensibility that Park does not -- this may be a revenge film, but it is also beautiful in a way. The violence, at times, comes off like a well-scripted choreography. Where Miike tries to shock the audience and push the limits, Park seems content to stay just on the edge and make sure it is done in good form.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from the same issue that ""The Sixth Sense"" did. While ""Oldboy"" has many twists and surprises, one of them will probably be told to a viewer before he or she watches the movie. And that is unfortunate. Does it ruin the movie to know twists in advance? Maybe not. But it might be best to have things revealed as the story intends them to be.<br/><br/>All in all, a solid film. If I had any complaint, I could say the film was a bit long. But the pacing was steady, so it was not an unenjoyable longness. Not for all audiences, this film should be seen by those who can appreciate it."

It reflects strongly on human nature & the way we all perceive things. One man's strong revenge for something does not make him a villain, when you realize what the basis of his revenge his.

","I watched this movie 4 times.

Bells sometimes mark the beginning of a new scene in this movie. Oh Daesu was also conditioned to act as such after hearing the ringing sound of the cellular phone. We also begin and end some actions by sound (e.g., after receiving a phone call, we respond, think and act -- a sequence). In this sense, we are also conditioned to bells. In ancient times, drums or horns may have been used, while we are living surrounded by electronic bells (e.g., various alarming sounds in windows-based PC).<br/><br/>When I grew up in Korea, I hated hearing those bells everywhere -- home, subway, school, street, hospital, and even in Buddhist temples.

Yes, it's very violent, I would say graphic as in the likes of Last house on the left, though NEVER exploited in that sense. This movie is all brains!<br/><br/>The direction is the first thing that will have you in awe. From the first 15mins of the movie, you will see how masterfully this movie is shot. In a split screen scene you will actually feel what this man has missed in those 15 years imprisoned in this apartment. His anger for his imprisonment, the complete mess in his look and clothes are all truly convincing by Choi Min-shik who has appeared in two other big Korean movies which are Failan and the award winning movie at Cannes last year Chihwaseon.<br/><br/>As I have already mentioned the violence is very graphic and will probably be rated in the USA NC17. Which is understandable. But do not be put off by the extreme violence. This movie is bound to have you talking and discussing for days if not for months. Just be very well prepared for the final shocking twist!I could not sleep at night after watching this movie!<br/><br/>Well done to Chan-wook Park you who has showed the world what a truly excellent film director he is. Oldboy gets a well deserved 10/10<br/><br/>."

","Well, this movie is truly brilliant and fascinated. 'Oldboy' is directed by Chanwook Park, who also directed 'Trio','JSA', and 'Sympathy of Vengeance'. 'JSA' is the one that made me to watch and respect Korean movies because of it's style and well-develop story and plot. <br/><br/>Of course, Chanwook Park became my most respectable and honorable director in Korea. <br/><br/>After 'JSA', Chanwook Park released 'Sympathy of Vengeance', which wasn't succeed in public; however, I believe that this movie showed his own style, and created his own genre. Great movie that I actually want to show this to American friends. <br/><br/>His second chapter of 'Revenge' series was 'Oldboy'(2003). I didn't think this movie will succeed in Korea, but it was succeed. It is encouragement for the director, Chanwook Park. <br/><br/>'Oldboy' is well directed and stylized fascinated movie that I've never seen in Korean movie. This movie is the most intense, creative, and stylized well made movie. Moreover, it has own genre. I think it was possible to be succeed in box office in Korea because of the actor, Minsik Choi. His performance is the incredible and breathtaking. The best performance that I've never seen. I knew he is the best actor in Korea, but his performance in 'Oldboy' will knock you out. <br/><br/>Music is also well inserted in 'Oldboy'. Overall, this is the movie that I proudly show to American public, and it will surprise people that Korea has the director like Chanwook Park.<br/><br/>

I have seen many movies over the years but still, the quality of this one has not been reached by any of them. Oldboy really makes the most of every of it's aspects. Cinematography, editing, performances, character writing or just the brilliant twisted story are absolutly unique. By the way, the thematics and symbolisms of this movie are also highly recommended to any hobby-philosophers. The way how Chan-Wook Park handled the back story of the movie's antagonist, is not only relatable, but also kind of daring. You see his point, although you do not agree with his actions. Oh Dae Sue on the other hand, is a great protagonist. He's got a simple motivation, and is marked by 20 years of isolation, but also possesses some emotional spots and is more vulnerable than ever. The movie has a message and doesn't only rely on it's astounding directing. There a many visual metaphors and it touches on many social-critically questions. I am sure, everyone will get something out of it's story. Simply a perfect movie."

"wizu08","9","1","2","13 November 2016"," Gripping Revenge Thriller unlike any other
","""Revenge is futile"" is the theme of Old boy, a South Korean movie directed by Chan-Wook Park with Min-SIk Choi as the lead character of the story. It is a dark, twisted masterpiece of revenge fiction with terrifying plot twists.<br/><br/>The story follows Oh Dae-su, as he gets imprisoned for 15 years in a room and is finally released by his captor without any explanation. We are shown the changes brought about in Oh Dae-su over the course of 15 years as he is subjected to routine doses of television, drugs, valium gas and hypnosis. He is suddenly freed after 15 years and we look at a mentally unstable man with vengeance in his heart who sets out to find his captor and kill him. The second part of the movie then follows Oh Dae-su as he tries to find his captor, meeting a beautiful girl (Mido) in the process, and learning the truth about his captivity slowly as he gets closer to his captor. The end is a series of terrifying plot-twists culminating in an intense climax scene. <br/><br/>This movie is a piece of revenge fiction and shows us just how messy revenge can be. ""Revenge begets revenge and this is where the justice system has to step in."" This movie is a study on how horrible and twisted revenge can get and the extents to which vengeful men go to exact revenge on the people they were wronged by. The aftermath of this vengeance-filled story, as we see in the final scene, is tragedy and destruction.<br/><br/>I personally love this movie because of the intensity maintained throughout the movie. The direction is top-notch and a few scenes stand out as highlights with brilliant acting, cinematography and compositions. The plot twists are numerous with each one more sinister than the last and keeps you horribly fascinated at the unfolding of events. The psyches of the different characters are studied in detail as their actions unfold and hurtle towards the climax. <br/><br/>Overall, I would place this movie above other revenge fiction movies like Kill Bill, Count of Monte Cristo as this movie is darker, with more violence, more destruction and more revenge than the rest of them. A must-watch for sure."
"outrunkid","9","1","2","9 November 2016"," What a Film Experience!!! SPOILERS!!!!!
","SPOILERS!!!!! Small elements of the ending revealed! DO NOT READ if you don't want to KNOW ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENDING!<br/><br/>I'd heard all about Oldboy for many years now and had always wished to see it, but due to one circumstance or another, never did. Finally, I'd managed to get my hands on a copy and deliberately put aside some time to see it... Oh, boy, am I glad I did!<br/><br/>Oldboy is quite simply a marvellous film of the highest order. Nearly everything about it is perfect. The acting by the whole cast, but especially by the main actor, is incredible gritty and realistic, almost to the point of it being disturbing to watch. The direction and choreographed fight scenes are brilliant, really successfully drawing you in and getting you entangled up with pain and suffering being caused. The technical side of editing, cinematography, art direction and sound design are pristine pin-pointed to perfection. There are no unnecessary over-usages, yet the creative team know the limit of how much to exaggerate to allow you to be swept up in the violence, seedy environments and unpleasant situations. <br/><br/>Story wise, the film is extremely well plotted, building you up with tension and anticipation to the very, very, VERY edge of your seat and suddenly knocking you off your feet with an amazing twister shock ending. I would have to say only one element of the ending, the supposed hypnotising of the characters to make them fall in love, felt far too contrived for the hard-hitting, OTT reality that has been established within the film. And that for me at least has knocked a star off because otherwise I would be giving it a great big TEN. <br/><br/>Oldboy has quite the reputation of being a violent film. Rightly so in many places, but if you come into this expecting non-stop, fast-paced fights and gore, you might be disappointed. Most assuredly, there are some violent scenes â€“ extremely violent in some cases â€“ but the quick, bloody pace that is set up early on quickly seems to peter out and instead is replaced with a story that is riddled with themes and questions. It's no less enticing and gripping, but just don't go in viewing this film as a 2-D foreign language revenge flick that makes use of conventions. In fact, it seems that Oldboy has created as well as redefined codes and conventions that have influenced a great number of the violent Hollywood films that have come out since Oldboy, a film probably no one thought would influence world cinema in such a massive way.<br/><br/>Let Oldboy sink into you, absorb the disturbing atmosphere, go along with the extremely dark comedy that arises, revel in the violence and do yourself a favour by not reading anything further about the ending if you haven't seen it already."

","One of the most visually impressive films of the 2000's with meticulously craft directing from Chan-Woo Park. But also easily one of the most devastating films you'll see. It rips your heart out in more ways than one.<br/><br/>A revenge tale is only as good as the characters are written, and this film is brilliantly adapted from the 90's comic. The characters, who were apparently not developed enough in the comic, are well established within the first 20 minutes. All characters are brought around nicely by the time the credits roll, which contributes to the devastation of the film's emotional gut punch towards the end.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons the characters work so nicely, is that Park provides character development in more ways than one. Whether it be through an important close up on our lead character's face or even a well-timed artistic metaphor, the story is so well-realized through its characters. Being that it's a tragic story that turns into a revenge flick but then turns back into a tragic tale again, you need to believe both sides of the coin. Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu do a tremendous job at rounding out motivations as Dae-su and Woo-jin respectively.<br/><br/>In order to feel the full impact of emotion Park was going for, you have to be with the film every step of the way. Although there are some plot points that blur the lines of being plot holes, Park gives us at least an acceptable answer to keep us engaged. Even just looking at the thrilling action sequences, which can be over-the-top and 'Raid'- like at times, is acceptable after seeing the finished product.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a modern day classic. Not necessarily the type of film I would want to revisit more than once, but I got the full emotional impact that I had hoped for. Chan-Woo Park majestically directs the comic to life better than anyone possibly could.<br/><br/>+Impressive fight scenes<br/><br/>+Devastatingly beautiful storytelling<br/><br/>+Lead performances<br/><br/>-Potential holes in the story<br/><br/>9.1/10"

","Now, I have read down the reviews on IMDb and am really shocked to see the bad ratings! I get the movie is not for everyone, containing heavy violence and very mature themes (AKA the ending) I can see how some people won't enjoy it. However, weather you like it or not it certainly does not deserve ratings of 1 star! This movie is beautiful, the cinematography, the script, performances and THE END (left me in shock) are all near perfect. I am a fan of violence and gore so this movie ticks all the boxes for me but even if your not a fan I still recommend you see it even if you turn away at the more hard hitting scenes! The end, no spoilers don't worry, is incredible, beats the hell out of any m.night's twists! It actually left me open mouthed!! Don't watch the American remake directed by spike lee! It's doesn't do the original any justice! I know some people don't like foreign/ subtitled movies but this film is worth it and 100x better than the remake!! So go watch!! Sit back and watch the plot unravel <br/><br/>Now for my spoiler review: look away if you have not seen the film: <br/><br/>So, where do I start..... I have heard a lot of people criticize the ending and brand it 'messed up' or 'horrible'! The ending is hard hitting and the main character does a great job of showing the disgust and hate of what he did with his daughter and when you see the main character begging to his captures not to let his daughter know who her father is it really hits the viewer of the extreme twist however people need to understand it's a film, it's work of fiction. OK maybe it's not for a younger audience but that's what age ratings are for! I think the rating of the film depends on the movie goer, people who like world Cinema, people who like violence and like their film with a bite will hail this a masterpiece (like me) and others not so. But the film is fantastic, it's a must see! Thanks for reading :)"
"eshwarmail","7","1","2","24 July 2016"," Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride
","It is one of those movies where you can neither guess the reason for the revenge nor the actual end play (by midway). Definitely the emphasis is on style over substance, glorifying goriness than the emotional connect and acting is definitely not its strong suite. Despite its emotional and language barriers, it is a victory for movie making by having a stranglehold on audience attention up until 90% of the movie. <br/><br/>Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is a careless drunk and has rubbed many people the wrong way. On his daughter's birthday, he is abducted and put in a room without giving a reason for the cause. He is put in an independent room of an apartment without any scope for a conversation except for a television, mostly drugged, fed the same duck dumpling and occasionally visited by a hypnotist. As he prepares himself by learning boxing and other martial arts from what he can gather from television to extract revenge on the person who might have done this to him and also digging a tunnel in parallel for his escape, one fine day he is let off after 15 years. Can he do what he has been preparing for?<br/><br/>It is a captivating premise to be imprisoned without knowing the reason and source while also keeping the audience in the same state of ignorant mind as the protagonist. This establishes an empathy from the audience who will embark on a journey with the protagonist till the end of story (or the reveal). As the hype builds up over a period of time, it cannot be fizzled out with a run-of-the-mill reason and that's where the story kicks into another least expected dimension. All the loopholes and misfires are temporarily forgotten and we change to the new ride and hop along with a renewed interest which again acts in the movie's favor.<br/><br/>A special mention should go to Ji-tae Yu who plays the character Woo-jin Lee, he does it with such elan that makes you think that you are not just seeing a good vs. evil story. The story and screenplay is well thought out and executed that greatly influences how the editing eventually turns out. While the boldness of the content is surely to be appreciated in a mainstream cinema, the way it ends is what emphasizes the grayness of the human mind. A classic generally attributes to how the audience reacted to it rather than how well it is made, in that aspect Oldboy definitely is a cult classic that overcomes the goofy acting, uneven scenes and continuity issues to become something that is much more.<br/><br/>Less you know about it, more you can enjoy its forbidden, adventurous and a bumpy ride."
"nicolechan916","8","1","2","13 January 2016"," Twisted story but with great acting and prop use
","The trailer is no indication of what you will sit through as the film plays. I was at the same time both deeply disturbed and a little intrigued to see how it would end. Safe to say, I was not at all prepared to spend my Friday night like that. I can't say much without giving away the surprising elements of the film, but if you are considering watching the film, just bear in mind that you will probably be traumatised.<br/><br/>I think the reason why I reacted so strongly (and negatively) to this film, is because I have been brought up in a society which considers these topics taboo and cannot even think to imagine if this were to happen to me. So in a way, the film questions the conventions of society and challenges us by putting us outside our comfort zone (way outside). <br/><br/>The acting is great as the actors/actresses fully embodied their characters. The interactions between Min-sik, Ji-tae and Hye-jeong went smoothly and is realistic to watch. Min-sik does his character justice as a tortured man with almost nothing left to lose. Ji-tae while still having the looks of an innocent young man delivers the emotions of a sadistic and somewhat mentally unstable character creatively. Hye- jeong too, plays her role as the innocent and oblivious damsel well. However, it seems like a waste to have her introduced as a strong independent woman at the beginning and then turn her into a shallow headed female who is basically useless. Going off that, this film is so obviously male centred, and females are only used for their bodies. <br/><br/>The use of props though used mostly for violent acts, are very impactful. A hammer becomes part of Min-sik's signature, replaced teeth turns into a clue, photographs are used to reveal past events and gift boxes no longer connote something positive. The director and writers (based on comic) are quite ingenious in this way, and everything is displayed in a way that ties to the end. Still, I will not be watching this again or the Hollywood remake for that matter."

Only bad thing is to keep reading subtitles if you don't understand Korean language. Coming back to why i like this movie, it has an amazing bitter true message - Don't talk too much as it can lead to big trouble. Cast has been amazing.

As probably everyone knows Chan-wook Park's obsession is the theme of revenge. Old boy is the second movie of his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance - 2002, Oldboy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - 2005). Oldboy is by far the best movie of the trilogy and one of the best Asian films of all time.

Probably what I liked most about it was how the events unfolded and how the suspense was always present. I kept asking myself, ""what's to come now?"" and although some of the turnouts were not entirely believable at times I gave it 9/10 because the acting was impeccable on behalf of the main characters and it was very original (although hard to watch specially nearing the end). <br/><br/>Highly recommended but it's meant for a mature audience because it does have twisted content."
"bowmanblue","8","1","2","4 August 2015"," Disturbingly dark
","I recently saw another Korean film 'I Saw the Devil' and, in light of the fact that I've now watched a film made by the same people, 'Oldboy' I'm glad I did. Because I think that many of us have been kind of lulled into believing that the only way to make a film is 'the Hollywood way.' I didn't like 'I Saw the Devil' when I started watching it, but, after persevering, I was glad I did in the end. Plus, now I feel I know Korean cinema a little better (or how it's done) I was able to enjoy (if that's the right word) 'Oldboy' from the off.<br/><br/>And it's certainly a difficult film to describe, let alone say who's its target audience is. A man – and not a particularly nice one – doesn't bother seeing his estranged wife and baby daughter in favour of generally going out and getting drunk. However, things quickly catch up with him when he's swiped off the streets and locked in a room for no less than fifteen years without explanation. However, during this time he's had more than a few changes of heart. Now he's not only ready to find out and punish whoever imprisoned him in the first place, but also make amends with his daughter, who is now basically grown up in his absence.<br/><br/>It would be easy to label Oldboy as a 'revenge thriller.' Yes, there are certainly aspects of hunting down those who wronged him. But it's the way it's done that makes it so different. I would go into specifics, but it's one of those films where if you say too much about the plot you will give away vital points which will lead to you predicting what's to come. It's fair to say that there are more than a few twists and turns to keep you interested (or disgusted?) and you will not only need to be ready for those, but also have a strong stomach in terms of content material.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to my thoughts on who it's marketed at. I don't really know – people who like revenge movies, but can tolerate some pretty disturbing story lines mainly. Oh, and subtitles. It's got subtitles – but then you probably guessed that. However, even though you have to read the dialogue it's still easy to tell that the cast are pretty impressive and there are performances that are going to stick with you – even if some of them are for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Basically, if you like your foreign revenge films dark then give this one a go. Just don't blame me for any therapy you may require after sitting through it. A classic, but a dark one."

","This film is probably my favorite movie, it has got everything! Excellent fighting scenes, yeah they are comparable to Matrix or any Bruce Lee film, Old Boy has got a brilliant script, beautiful and innovative photo, unpredictable, exciting, cruel and astonishing story. And the actors and actress are just prefect. Even the music is indescribably fantastic.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with humor, action and scenes that wakes strong feelings.<br/><br/>But I warn sensitive people, this film contain a lot of disgusting/extremely violate scenes<br/><br/>Oldboy is the second film in a trilogy by Chan-Wook Park. The first film Boksuneun Naui Geot, or Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance which it is internationally called, is also a great film, but don't even think about ignoring Oldboy if you didn't like Boksuneun Naui Geot, because they are not even in the same league!"

","I don't know where the hate for this movie is coming from, unless it's from those with weak stomachs. A lot of critics seemed to really enjoy it, if they reviewed it at all. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think of it as the best thriller to come along since Memento. Both movies have their gimmicks - short-term memory loss in Memento and a small hypnosis bit in Oldboy, but it's just one twist of many in these movies. The thing that strikes me the most about this movie is the lead actor who plays Oh-Daesu. He is transformed from a happy drunk in the beginning to a worn and broken shell of a man, full of anger and remorse. All good stories show the character going through a journey of change, and Oldboy succeeded very well. The lead actor really carries the picture.<br/><br/>This film is also a visual joy to watch, particularly the early scenes of his imprisonment and the passage of time in his cell. I'm a Takishi Miike fan, so the violence didn't bother me at all, except for one scene that put The Marathon Man to shame and made me scream. It's been a long time since I did that during a movie and it was a lot of fun. I really loved the cinematography - it never felt overdone. The infamous hallway fight scene was extremely cool, just one of those technical feats that make you say ""How did they do that?"" <br/><br/>I didn't see the big ""secret"" coming, so it made the ending a disturbing shock to me, but it also seemed consistent with the characters. Don't let anyone try to ruin the ending for you! The ending alone is the whole reason I can never see an American remake for this picture, despite Nicholas Cage's desire to produce and star in one. It just wouldn't fly in these moral majority times. Also, the only western actor I could imagine reprising the role of Oh-Daesu is Gary Oldman. All in all, this was a dark movie, filmed with a lot of energy and even some interesting things to say about personal guilt and revenge, things that Kill Bill, for example never touched on."

","Woo-jin Lee's sister killed herself because she is pregnant by Dae-su Oh. So Woo-jin Lee put Dae-su Oh in a room for 15 years, and revenged to Dae-su Oh by setting up Dae-su, Oh to have intercourse with his daughter who is born by his sister. however, after Dae-su find out what is going on, he beg for not to tell the truth to her daughter and cuts his tongue and Woo-jin Lee not killed (or forgive) Dae-su, Oh and end up to kill himself in the elevator. It is awesome plot, whole story fits the one sentence ""even though I am worse than a beast, don't I have right to live?"" and dramatic ending that Dae-su and his daughter hug each other. But the progress was awfully boring and the fact this Woo-jin Lee basis of his revenge is hypothesis wasn't really fit the theme; like there was no indication that Woo-jin Lee deeply believed in hypothesis and suddenly, very end of the movie, viewers will find out that whole plot is based on hypothesis. I felt the movie was just rambling about Dae-su's life story, however, each act have its own reason for it, but for most of the viewers it will be seen as ""nasty"". It failed to grasp all the viewers and I personally think the progress didn't build up, it stays in one spot, also, it is hard to see the change of Dae-su, Oh. I can't say this movie is a trash, it is really well-made movie but I felt bad after this movie. makes me wonder why did director made this movie. Personally I don't like this movie."

","Overall, I think the film was great and I put it on my to buy list; But brainwashing a man to fall in love with his daughter doesn't justify the fact that you killed your sister, especially because you got caught giving her some nipple attention and got her pregnant. Carlos Mencia says, ""Somebody had to bang their sister"" But I don't think Woo-jin Lee had to bang his sister. So, I'm not convinced that a brother can really love his sister romantically, unless both brother and sister didn't know they were brother and sister, or of course they were ""hypnotized"". However, neither of those are Woo-jin Lee's circumstance. He doesn't have a good enough reason to screw his sister in the first place to make it fare for Dae-su Oh to be tortured so badly. I think it would have been better if Dae-su Oh and Woo-jin Lee had more equal reasons for revenge. I was obviously forced to be on Dae-su Oh's side. Every comic book story in the world I guess."
"Funnyman1235","9","12","77","12 May 2006"," Is this the greatest film Tarantino never made?
","No doubt about it, OldBoy is all about extremity. You want torture? Try getting your head around the idea of being in solitary for 15 years or the new dental work courtesy of a hammer. Violence? Check out the one-take corridor brawl in which psychologically ravaged Dae-su takes on a score of goons... with a claw-hammer.<br/><br/>You want to know how far someone could go to wreak revenge? Well, we advise you to brave South Korean writer-director Park Chan-wook's helter-skelter descent into the dingiest pit of human behaviour, even if at times it is tough going and ludicriously unfeasible.<br/><br/>As a sequel to the first in Park's 'Vengance' trilogy. We are greeted by a reality drenched in atmosphere and the grotesque. Like Se7en but we see the murders this time round. The live octopus scene and torture by hammer are without a doubt the most horrific moments. But there's plenty else to shock even without them - and all done with such unabashed verve that you'll be as compelled as you are repulsed.<br/><br/>OldBoy recalls Fincher in its CG-assisted flourishes and doom ridden themes, and Tarantino with its sharp-suited, stylised bloodletting. But it's unlikely either of those guys would ever be allowed to push it as far as Park has with this. Not to everyone's tastes, but if you have a strong stomach, OldBoy is sure to impress.<br/><br/>Like I said, the word is extreme..."

","I can't believe NYT criticized this movie for violence and scenes regarding that live squid. It must be nice to have a closed mind and abhorrence towards violence when one is reviewing movies in the day and age of Saw 2.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be another one of those overtly shocking and needlessly violent movies but it was not at all that. The script was very tight, the actions were all justifiable and realistic, and the mood of the film kept me glued to my seat.<br/><br/>If you liked Pulp Fiction and the Sixth Sense, you will LOVE this movie, because it has the grittiness and the shocking twister that will knock you socks off. Of course, it was not made in Hollywood, so it will be a bit different, but then again, we watch new movies to watch something new, right?

","Once you've seen this, you're going to be thinking about it for a while.<br/><br/>No, you won't simply be unable to forget it because it's unpleasant and blowtorches itself onto your memory; it's the thematic and character implications that remain memorable.<br/><br/>The film's premise is well known: Dae-su Oh is a philandering businessman and irresponsible father. Basically an a**hole, he has the rug pulled out from underneath him when, one rainy night, he's abducted and imprisoned in a private jail: no cause or authority given. Finding himself alone in a dingy room, and enjoying no human contact save dodgy food, kicks and gassing from his anonymous captors, Dae-su Oh starts to grow (unsurprisingly) unhinged.<br/><br/>Who did this to me? AND WHY? WHY? WHY? And Dae-su Oh gets plenty of time to ponder that question, because he is caged for some 15 years. During the interim, he has nothing save for the TV and some pads of paper for company. From the telly, he sees he is the prime suspect in wife and child's murders, and is now a wanted man. A seething bundle of psychosis by this stage, he begins to practice boxing, using the wall (yes, the wall) as a punch-bag, tutored by a TV sports programme. It Bart and Lisa from The Simpsons watched what he watches, one dreads to think<br/><br/>But then, Dae-su Oh is suddenly released, no reason given for this sudden ejection. Then, his nemesis gives him a wodge of cash, a mobile phone, a suit and a three days to find out WHY he was kept locked up. And Dae-su Oh is going to find out.<br/><br/>Chan Wook-Park's film has courted plenty of controversy on account of its graphic, almost comic-book style brutality, as Dae-su Oh beats his way through a long list of suspects. One seen in particular, when the exhausted Dae-su Oh scoffs a live squid in a sushi bar, has generated condemnation (personally, it's his table manners that offended me).<br/><br/>To get the most out Oldboy, you have shed any preconceptions and fears: take the plunge into one of the most twisted situations imaginable. Park quite literally turns the world upside down for Dae-su Oh, and I think his greatest achievement here is that the audience is likely to feel just as stricken and abused. Constantly the boundaries of your taste and integrity are confronted. Aside from the violence that Dae-su Oh wrecks, hungering for retribution, Park throws in a number of gut-wrenching situations that are intensely personal for the characters and for us as well. Oldboy is a film that has its head in the clouds and feet of the ground. Put simply: Park keeps this horribly, oddly easily to believe, because character generates incident.<br/><br/>However, I read in an interview that Park apparently comes up with his film plots in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. It shows. Though hard to explain, Oldboy is not a homogeneous work. The narrative is sprawling and visual style, while frequently amazing, messy. Oldboy tends to ramble.<br/><br/>Worse, this is never as devastating as Park's second film Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance. It's as though Park took the flabby, humanist message from JSA and injected it into the disturbing premise of SFMV. Park tries to do too much in Oldboy, trying to marry thriller and complicated story and even moments of laugh-out-loud comedy, and it doesn't hang together.<br/><br/>Thus we are left with a bunch of moments, which are by turns repellent, monstrous, devastating, funny, upsetting and touching. Oldboy has one cohesive element, though: improvised weapons and torture methods. Toothbrushes, knives (classic), scissors, claw-hammer etc.<br/><br/>But I recommend you watch Oldboy. In the third act Park conjures up several amazing scenes that reveal the origins the animosity has led someone to exact a monstrous revenge against Dae-su Oh. If light is shed on the story, then the mental turmoil and confusion remain, best conveyed in a brilliant, Escher-like sequence.<br/><br/>Oldboy will stick with you. I won't and can't try to explain what's it really about and what it means, but any and all who see it will experience something different.<br/><br/>And to end this review, I'll say the climax presents a moment that is the epitome of human degradation and pain."
"evangelos","9","14","94","20 March 2005"," definitely at least a 9
","to try and contribute to the discussion whether the film is overrated, let's have a word on what ratings are supposed to mean: in my eyes, an ""alltime rating"" like this one should consider whether a movie achieved something more than telling a good story in nice images (always considering the background (for example the time) of its production) way more than personal taste. having said that, i also disagree on the overall rating at some points, for example when i see that a masterpiece like wong kar wai's ""in the mood for love"" hardly makes it into the top 250. in case of ""oldboy"" i don't see where this movie should be overrated - it just made it into the top 100 and i think it's well positioned there. oldboy is the second part of a trilogy on the topic of vengeance, and like the first beautiful part ""sympathy for mr. vengeance"" the director achieves to use highly interesting imagery, impressing camera work and cut, a ""close-to-arrogant"" amount of metaphors and all this on a very thoughtful, twisted plot. the NEW thing: it is not that weird ""art-cinema"" some European directors would deliver but still highly entertaining, telling strictly ONLY what is needed to understand the story. If you are a film freak, you will definitely not regret seeing this one, even if you don't like it - because from an objective perspective it is ambitioned and well-done cinema. if you just want to entertain yourself and you are into thriller/twisted stories and - basic! - you are not afraid of movies leaving the already known paths of Hollywood-storytelling-patterns, you will also enjoy this a lot. It is a clear nine with a tendency towards ten. a masterpiece, and i cant wait for part 3 of the trilogy."

What was truly great about this film was the directing. I have not seen such an amazingly, and uniquely directed film in a very long time. Transitions, expressions, color, and almost every single shot in this film capture something that is new to film, and something that is hard to look away from. I feel though that some may disagree (due to the other comments), but I think this is because they were too focused on the dialog (which is no Tarentino) or acting to appreciate what was accomplished by this film. New technique and style has been brought to film, and without a doubt this movie will influence works around the world. See this movie and PLEASE watch the camera, watch the color, watch the transitions. If you blink, you might miss something incredible, because incredible things are done throughout."

","Forget everything you know about conventional cinema. No stereotypical wire fighting here, just a twisted story, ultra-violence and tragedy - all presented with a tremendous sense of irony and an in-your-face style that puts most American action/suspense/genre pictures to shame. Director Chan-wook Park intends to disturb and shock the viewer with graphic scenes that dare the audience to look away. The subject matter is disturbing and really challenges social taboos, but hey, so does South Park. Min-sik Choi is the Gary Oldman of Korean cinema. Menacing one moment, as helpless as a kitten the next. One of the most powerful single performances I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Modern cinema's much needed blood transfusion flows from Korea."

","I can't explain why but there seems to be a lot of hostility surrounding this film, so many people hate it and yet it has an 8.4? It seems strange that a film many will call a disaster could be ranked so highly. The reason for its ranking is that despite the opinions of some it is actually an amazing film. Technically its perfect, the only problem is in the narrative, which is quite a disappointment to say the least. You spend the whole film trying to figure it, trying to untangle the mystery of his kidnapping and then when its finally revealed you are left feeling cheated, and robbed. To some it is just too much, it devalues the entire film and so the entire thing will be looked upon as a failure. However, others will overlook the ending, or at least come to terms with it and still respect its more brilliant side Oldboy walks the line between realism and insanity, yes it has its problems, but it also has many good points. It's the same with 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', and it is in 'Lady Vengeance' that I can only hope for a combination of both these two films better points with none of the negatives. You have to remember that it is a trilogy; each film compliments the other. You may well hate it but to say it is a bad film is just ignorant, personally I love it and give it a 10 out 10."

When he is finally released, Dae Su finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and strangeness. His own quest for vengeance becomes tied in with romance when he falls for an attractive sushi chef (Gang Hye-Jung), who feeds him live octopus and who may or may not be involved with the bizarre mystery. This is all served up in a striking palette of purples and dark reds and stuffed with insanely malicious twists and turns. Choi Min-Sik is terrific in the lead,counterbalancing over-the-top hysterics with deadpan. There are intense fight scenes (Dae Su's favorite weapon is a hammer), look-away moments of torture and self-mutilation, sex, and gallons of black humor. Not for the fussy, but for those seeking something wholly original and daring, this cinematic entree is alive--it's hard to imagine a better slice of psycho-shock sensationalism.<br/><br/>God I've read that Hollywood is gonna reproduce this Movie in 2006.

I feel sad because I just watch the best film in my life and I'm afraid I will never find any film to compare with ""Old Boy"". Great story, directing, acting, visual art, music and almost everything. Choi Min Sik is really ""Oh Dae Su"" and he was locked up for 15 years, you feel his angry and all his violence action is a MUST. The final battle between ""Oh Dae Su"" & ""Lee Woo Jin"" show that Mr. Choi is the best actor in the world. After I watched ""Old Boy"", it's still in my mind for weeks & weeks. I recommend to all my friends and colleagues that this is the best film in 2004. It may be wrong because it may be the best film in your life. I hope there will be no remake of ""Old Boy"" in Hollywood. Although there are many good director and actor in Hollywood, masterpiece is unique.

","Oldboy<br/><br/>At it's heart there lies a story of lost innocence and revenge. In this journey, director Chan-wook Park, travels a road where we question what lies after the righting of a supposed wrong, and the price that man will go to in order to maintain a sense of not knowing.<br/><br/>As has become the tradition with much reporting of graphic Southeast and East Asian cinema, a focus on violence and vivid imaginary overshadows the intricacies of narrative development. Of course it doesn't hold an eighteen rating for no reason, but for a moment lets forget some of the comic-book violence in which it excels. <br/><br/>Our story focuses on the 15-year imprisonment of Dae-su Oh (the man who gets along with others),confined to a dwelling that has all the apparent comforts of a modern South Korean apartment, but with the added bonus of piped hallucinogenic drugs making our protagonist more susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. Like our prisoner, for much of the film's duration we are limited to understanding why this event has taken place. In the meantime we are invited to embrace both the intentional and unintentional comic and tragic moments that follow as the ticking years wind the tension of retribution as we go from supposed breakout to the incidences of assumed chance meetings. Where true understanding of our journey is confined and complex questions asked in the last twenty minutes of the film, we are treated to flashes of inspirational camera work and effects, which do not in any way detract from the sense of this film. It would be easy to dismiss the violence as over the top, but as Dae-su Oh asks, does fifteen years of imagery training prepare one for the battles that will ensue. Along that way we are treated to a familiarity of claw hammer and human skull, which will have you both wincing and smirking at the same time. Fistfights that will make you take sharp intakes of breath as bone smacks bone in a not altogether unbelievable way. <br/><br/>Although not gripping from beginning to end, you do want to find out the reason for such a complex game of cat and mouse, which in essence is what the plot revolves around. Where it is easily possible to miss some of the bigger questions this film asks, if your able to maintain your interest and look beyond the surface violence, days later you can still find yourself asking what price you would be prepared to pay in order to forget or not know, and whether holding onto grudges of the past are really worth expending all that energy."

","In Oldboy, the third feature from South Korean filmmaker Chan-wook Park, director of Joint Security Area and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Daesu Oh (Min-sik Choi) is arrested one night for public drunkenness and bailed out by a friend. He suddenly disappears and ends up in an apartment styled cell, where he remains a prisoner for 15 years--never knowing who imprisoned him or why--until he's released as unexpectedly as he was captured. Daesu's wife is now dead and he is believed to be her killer and their daughter has been raised by an adoptive family. He befriends Mido, a much younger woman who becomes immediately attracted to him despite his strange behavior and mysterious past. At first, he only wants to find out why he was imprisoned, but once he learns who was responsible, he feels compelled to seek revenge.<br/><br/>Oldboy is Park at his brilliant best. The movie is so visually inventive from the opening credits that there's never a dull moment in the entire film. His use of color and shadows is masterful and the score is fantastic.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about the movie, though, is that Park is able to sustain the tension for as long as he does. During the film's climax, when Daesu finally confronts his nemesis and the story's final shocking plot secret is revealed, the movie reaches a point where lesser filmmakers would have found themselves in a corner they couldn't back out of, yet Park pulls off an ending that's satisfying, but without selling out the story."

The story unfolds in a series of scenes filled with such a style like you've never seen before. Everything from the corridor fight sequence to the flashback sequence is filled with an amazing style of story-telling. The acting is EXCELLENT. Choi Min-sik is amazing as Oh Dae-su, and all of the other characters are also excellent. The soundtrack is brilliant. Simply brilliant. The story is just... amazing.

"gloryc","9","13","91","9 February 2005"," Oldboy: not realistic but emotionally honest at least
","All the negative reviews read as very visceral and most of the points aren't constructive so I'd like to address some of the criticism pointed towards Oldboy and suggest people watch it at least twice before making up their minds.<br/><br/>1. This movie is not as violent as everyone makes out. From the squeamish reviews I've read, you'd think Oh Daesu chopped limbs off wholesale on screen with blood squirting everywhere. All the ""ultra"" violent scenes are implyed and not actually shown on screen just like the ear scene in Reservoir Dogs or chainsaw scene in Scarface. Oldboy is not Ichi the Killer by any means.<br/><br/>2. I have to laugh at naive people who call Oldboy disgusting as if they're above seeing depictions of incest and torture. Believe it or not, Park Chan Wook actually had a point in showing these things in Oldboy. I read the message of the film like this: Were all sadistic at some level. And it's human nature to deflect our rage/guilt/f*cked up problems on to others and this ultimately leads to self destruction. I would think most people not living in Care Bear land could somewhat empathize. There is a line in the movie where the villain says, ""Revenge is good for your health, you should try it some time."" The only thing that gave Woo Jin purpose in life was enacting revenge and vice versa with Dae Su. Vengeance was their lifeblood and when that was completed both men had to stop running away and face the blind naked truth which entails things like incest, ruined families, wasted years.<br/><br/>3. The ending isn't a thumbs up to incest! It's rather logical. Imagine you were in Dae Su's shoes having to deal with his daughter and how his actions have ruined his family's life. Without the distraction of enacting revenge occupying his mind, the stress of his f*cked up situation catches up with him and it's overwhelming (white hair anyone?). So like a lot of us he took the easy/weak way out by erasing his memory."
"to_kill_better","9","14","100","25 March 2005"," Stylish!
","This was a real surprise to me. I'd heard various tales of how violent the film is and was expecting some kind of lame gangster thriller. In fact, Old Boy is a very handsomely made, stylish revenge thriller which has the feel of a David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) movie. The production values are top notch; excellent cinematography and musical score, and a number of surreal, dreamlike scenes which create the kind of edgy, not-quite-real atmosphere which the best Asian cinema does so well.<br/><br/>There is violence in this film, and indeed violence which could be called gratuitous, but the surreal world inhabited by this story makes the violence less disturbing than than the kind of gangland unpleasantness seen in films about South Central Los Angeles or East-end London. This is a comic-book adaptation with a clear 'anti-hero', heroine and villain and it delivers a fantastic twist on the standard Hollywood revenge thriller ending. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that, at the end, the villain dies, the hero lives and he gets the girl. But the circumstances of this denouement are so dark and twisted that it takes a while to sink in.<br/><br/>A very good, very stylish, very twisted film; I'd love to see more like it."

","After reading the article in Wizard about the top 100 best movie fights that featured the fight in the hallway as number 50 or something like that, I figured I'd have to see it. Than seeing as how it came with the Tarantino seal of approval, I got a little worried seeing as how his last movie (Kill Bill 2) was a stinker. But my worries were unfounded.<br/><br/>Intense, realistic and having the best and most perverse twist ending I've seen in years (although I could do without the last scene), it gave me hope that more Korean movies were this good. The fight scenes were well choreographed and featured real fighting, ie street boxing, not insane flying string work that he could never possibly pull off. There's a sense that he will not stop even if his a$$ is being handed to him and that makes it all the more intense. Plus he beats up 20 dudes with a knife stuck in his back, and that is cool no matter who you are.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the people saying it was terrible obviously watched it with the dubbing. Worst voice-over work on the planet! Even worse than some of Jackie Chans old Hong Kong films. But in Korean it's almost perfect. The relationship and how men and women interact in Korean society is spot on and Dae-Su's scowl and maniacal grin is perfectly befitting a man stuck in a room for 15 years.<br/><br/>I'm just glad I watched the film before reading the other comments left on this site, because those who call this a bad movie only watched it to badmouth Koreans and they should be ashamed, because this is a fantastic movie."

","Oldboy is a powerful, intense story of vengeance, love and redemption. The story follows Oh Dae Su closely as he works to understand the thinking behind his imprisonment. Characters are strong and well developed, and the director holds nothing back, it may be too raw for some tastes, but it's this very shocking intensity that will draw you into the world of pain that the various characters inhabit. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I knew I was onto a winner here when I heard Vivaldi's ""Winter"" playing over a torture scene. The emphasis is firmly on story, above action, but it does contain one of the most original and well shot action scenes of recent years, anyone that's seen it will know what I'm referring to.

","First, I am Korean and moved to Boston on the last September - my English may not be perfect.<br/><br/>Don't read this if you haven't watched this movie.<br/><br/>Many of people who give low grades misunderstood this movie. Everything you felt uncomfortable came from the intention of Park Chan-wook. One of his purpose (of this movie) is to make viewers uncomfortable. The peculiar and funny styles and violence are also carefully calculated to make you guys sick (or relaxed sometimes). The plot of this movie is planned very deliberately. Most of things you think nonsense actually make sense if you understand those points you missed.<br/><br/>Those styles and violence are NOT the most important parts in this movie although some of viewers may hate (or like) this movie because of them.<br/><br/>What do you think the most important words (or question) is in this movie? In my opinion, it is Woo-Jin's. ""We loved each other although we are brother and sister. Can you do that (can you still love each other even after you know you are father and daughter)?"" - I don't know how it is interpreted in English.<br/><br/>Do you think Dae-su forget everything in the end? Nobody knows but Choi Min-sik, who acted Dae-su, thought Dae-su cannot forget everything even after he asked the hypnotist. Choi acted as if Dae-su still has the painful memory. You can see from Dae-su's distorted smile of the last scene. Dae-su may have to live with Mido forever with those memories. Will he still love her as a lover even after fail to forget? Without understanding those stuffs, you cannot say that you understand this movie.<br/><br/>I think Park Chan-wook's other movie 'Mr. Vengeance' is also his masterpiece. You can see more violence in that movie but with cool and neat style. Definitely, Park wanted to make another revenge story with excessive images and that story is 'Old Boy'.<br/><br/>I might be defensive for 'Old Boy' but NOT because I am Korean. I agree that this movie is not for families, kids and couples, and somebody may really hate it.<br/><br/>I gave 9 out of 10 because I cannot remember any prefect movie I can give 10 out of 10. But 'Old Boy' deserves 5 if it were out of 5.<br/><br/>Even for guys who hate this movie, I think 1-2 out of 10 is too harsh. There are many garbages from Hollywood which deserve those 1-2 (even 0).<br/><br/>I referred to some interviews with the Director Park Chan-wook."

That is why woo jin lees last comment when entering the lift is ""can he live knowing the truth?"" when he has lied to himself for so long.

","If you criticize this film because you don't understand it, thats fine, but this is truly great film-making. The viewer becomes an integral part of the story as we follow Oh Dae Su after his 15 year imprisonment. This movie is not only beautifully shot but it shakes you to your core and really makes you question your core beliefs of right and wrong and good and evil. One of the cruelest villains of any movie and some of the great acting of korean cinema. As we follow Dae Su and he begins to unravel the mystery we are still shocked when we become aware of the motives behind his imprisonment and the lengths to which his captor went to bring him misery. On top of the brilliance of the script and acting the film is shot beautifully with great sensitivity to the scenery, color, and music, this movie is a must see."
"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","9","9","58","6 November 2006"," grotesque mind game
","Chan-sook Park's 2003 cult film ""Oldboy"" tells the story of Dae-Su Oh, a Korean businessman imprisoned without cause for fifteen years. One day he is suddenly released and intent on unraveling the mystery behind the reason for his capture and to bestow vengeance upon those who imprisoned him. With every step he takes, a new mystery is discovered.<br/><br/>For Dae-Su, as well as the audience, the answers continually feel merely one step ahead. This is a classic revenge tale in the highest regard, but cinematographer Jeong-hun Jeong and director Park craft the film as something far loftier. Dae-Su's quest is one of self-discovery and bordering on the philosophical, as he battles personal demons and personal enemies alike. There's an underlying romantic element to the piece that is presented with the same delicate care as several rather gruesome and unabashedly offensive, but mostly audience-created, scenes.<br/><br/>This is hypnotic film-making in the best sense, psyching out the audience at every turn, and steadily escalating to a big, mind-blowing finish. Surprisingly, as disturbing as much of the material is, ""Oldboy"" makes for satisfying viewing."

","If you can accept cinema is an art form and art can sometimes be disturbing, you may love this film. Otherwise, it's maybe better to stay away rather than watching this film and declaring it's very disgusting and nerve wrecking.<br/><br/>This is a 'black' film that disturbs and provokes. Revenge stands just beside the deepest feelings such as fear and passion. Mental processes, delusions and strong feelings are excellently filmed throughout the movie, it's hard not to question yourself while watching, what would I do if I were him? Flashback scenes are brilliant, especially the ones at the high school and elevator sequence of Evergreen. The way that Daesu, the man of conflicts, unfolds the mystery of his tragic fate is impressing. Step by step Pandora's Box is being opened and at the end, we even know what color the box is. <br/><br/>Oldboy's not another 'ordinary violent Asian movie'. It's too far from being ordinary. Blood that is shed is nothing compared to the mental damages given. It definitely carries a significant amount of psychological violence which is likely to occupy audience's mind even the movie is over. But it's worth bearing."
"prdmite","9","14","102","25 April 2005"," An excellent movie!
","I understand that most viewers hated this movie for its violence or harsh content (most of it implicit, though). However it is wrong to say that this movie is just 2 hours of gratuitous violence and that it's obscene and doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Oldboy is one of the very rare movies that I have seen recently that are totally original. At first, the plot may give you the impression that the movie is really stupid and lacks sense (""a guy is locked up for no reason for 15 years and now he's going to seek revenge""). Does this kind of plot, with an apparently dumb plot remind you of a famous highly acclaimed blockbuster? I'll give you a hint... KILL BILL !!!<br/><br/>OldBoy and Kill Bill are two very different movies, but they share a manga-like style, are quite shocking and start with a weird plot.<br/><br/>The main difference is that Kill Bill's plot gets worse and worse during the movie, ending with a phony love story, and that Oldboy gets better until the end, where you are overcome with one of the most powerful and original endings ever.<br/><br/>I think IMDb readers have a very naive sense of what is a good movie ending: they hate Oldboy (which has been acclaimed by most critics) and rate the ending of The Shawshank Redemption as one of the best of all time ?!? In fact The Shawshank Redemption is the most PREDICTABLE movie of all time..<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't mind being a little troubled (not that much though) and like strong and ORIGINAL movies, take a look for yourself, Oldboy is one of the greatest non-poetic Asian Movies I have seen."
"Lt_Coffey_182","9","13","93","13 January 2006"," Brilliant in every way. One of the most clever films you'll ever see.
","Oldboy is one of Asia's most critically acclaimed films, worldwide, that has been released this millennium. On watching, it is not difficult to see why. The plot is quite simply fascinating to witness. The way it is unravelled, the narration and the direction are all fantastic; it is gripping to the point where almost two hours fly by without you even noticing. The way Chan-Wook blends past flashbacks with present goings on is very smooth and does well to further show off his obvious directing talents. The revelations at the end are extremely shocking but are done so cleverly that despite how the audience may feel about the issue in question, they must at least be impressed with how it is presented. Park Chan-Wook really does deserve an applaud for his directorial efforts in this film as it is such a stylish masterpiece and really focuses on the details, taking great care in making a great film.<br/><br/>Inside the amazing plot are two fascinating relationships. The main relationship is between Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), the main character, and Mido (Gang Hye-jung), a young woman who befriends Dae-su. The way they are strangers who immediately fall in love is very intriguing and their storyline develops fascinatingly. The other is between Oh Dae-su and Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), the antagonist. The way how Oh Dae-su's quest for vengeance is only greatened by his quest for the truth from Woo-jin is understandable and Woo-jin's complex character makes him almost a sympathetic character. Add a couple of thoroughly entertaining and well choreographed fights and some shocking imagery and you have a classic Asian film in the making. The score is intensely dramatic in parts and the frequent use of a piano adds a lot of depth to the overall atmosphere of the film. All the reasons why Asian cinema is very popular beyond its own continent are prominent in this film.<br/><br/>The acting by the leads in Oldboy are also excellent and done extremely convincingly. Choi Min-sik is brilliant to watch and is very convincing as Oh Dae-su. Min-sik is very good as a man who has lost everything and who has lost his socialisation. His ability at displaying madness, anger, sadness, joy and ambivalence make his performance impressively versatile. Yoo Ji-tae is brilliant as Lee Woo-jin and provides a fantastic contrast against Dae-su. Ji-tae is often moving in his portrayal, despite the fact he is playing a sick and twisted game. The confidence of his display is very impressive. Gang Hye-jung is very good as the female lead. Her performance shows her character's loyalty and naivety on a very good level and her childlike looks make the audience care for her very much. The great casting really helps the characters come to life and bring the film's point across.<br/><br/>This film does very well at manipulating the audience's emotion and feeling empathy towards the main characters which is a very powerful quality for a film to possess. Oldboy is very courageous in the subject matter it explores and definitely benefits from not being too concerned with how the public would respond to this film.<br/><br/>Oldboy, at only three years old, is already a classic and is a near perfect film. Subtitles are actually a benefit because they make you concentrate more which is important to fully understand this film. Well directed and acted, Oldboy is a genuine masterpiece."

","After a night of drinking, a man is imprisoned by some unknown people and left there for 15 years until he's let out. After a while trying to readjust to society and figure out what's happened, he is given 5 days to wreak vengeance upon whoever took his life away from him. Unfortunately, the progress is being watched by a less than benevolent spectator.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this film is it's influences. It's based loosely around The Count of Monte Cristo, takes a lot of Shakespearian and Biblical elements, throws in typical Asian kung fu, and then puts it into a very modern stylistic context in terms of cinema. The best part about this movie's style is that it never actually feels overdone and it actually seems to make sense... a shot isn't canted just to be weird, it's more subtle than that, even if the tone itself bleeds the idea of style.<br/><br/>Honestly, I was taken simply by a single shot, a long take where the camera tracks along a hallway as the main character fights off a large group of people. It straddles the line between realism and romance and creates a destructive ballet of choreography and motion that is downright beautiful in a somewhat horrible way. Then setting it into the context it has to a rather well done and structured story really helps this movie have a profound effect on the viewer. Just don't expect to be coming out of this feeling very happy, as it gets a bit disturbing at the end.<br/><br/>It may have overdone the ending, but I don't care. The weird mix of hypnosis and not-hypnosis kind of constricted the story. It is interesting to note that this film is of a new group of films out there that a few people call Asian Extreme Cinema, and I've seen two other films from this neo-genre that involve heavy use of violence and hypnosis themes (and men cutting their own tongues out). Why do these images seem to tie this genre together? What is it about hypnosis, specifically, that creates an anxious desire in these filmmakers for broken vigilantes? --PolarisDiB"

","Well, as the title says, I think that a good artwork in any platform is not always a pleasant one. To me, what defines any artwork ""good"" is that it has the ability to make us think about issues that we normally wouldn't think or care about.<br/><br/>Oldboy, to me, is one of those works.<br/><br/>No doubt lots of people would find this work distasteful, and I understand why they would think in such fashion, one of the reason been the high level of violence. But then again, since this movie is focused on the theme of ""revenge"", I'd love to see people express about their opinions on that they would do if they had been locked up in a cell alone for 15 years without any apparent reason.<br/><br/>This movie showed me, a unique view, something that one would not see in normal daily life. A view from the mind twisted, hatred filled, yet still passionate man. It is chilling to see how 15 years of isolation can turn a middle-aged middle-class man into.<br/><br/>Chilling.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, it makes me think about how lucky I am that I have a normal, mostly happy life. Compare to the main character, we are all very lucky.<br/><br/>The movie itself handles the character emotions really well. The actors performed both positive and negative emotions flawlessly.<br/><br/>The music is great too, and the tone varies a lot. The last scene combined with the music, gave me a deep impression and after that, a long, deep sigh.<br/><br/>Personally I put Oldboy among the ranks of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Forest Gump"" as my favorites. Though they all have distinctive themes and different ways of expression, there's one common thing between them.<br/><br/>They all make me think, and think hard.<br/><br/>I certainly hope this film does the same for you."

","Similar to the ideal behind ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", ""Oldboy"" is not your typical revenge drama. As a matter of fact, until one views the film in its entirety one will not know of the fact that the revenge does not belong to the protagonist but rather to the antagonist.<br/><br/>A statement mentioned in the review before mine claims that ""Oldboy"" does not have a 'meaning', that its ending is not satisfactory (when comparing to ""Seven"", ""Memento"", and ""The Sixth Sense""). Those two films are not ""revenge flicks"", they are trend setters that work entirely on atmosphere and that their endings do not necessarily need to be important.<br/><br/>""Memento""'s ending is flawed because you don't know whether Lenny is a faker, himself, or not and whether what Joe Pantoliano says is true. ""Seven"" had a message brought forth by a lunatic monster and after his surrender, the ending was not 'important', but rather a balancing act between insanity and brilliance. ""The Sixth Sense""'s ending hits you like a punch and cheats the audience because who Bruce Willis' character REALLY is is inconsequential to the story of the boy who speaks to ghosts.<br/><br/>Also aforementioned is a quote by Morgan Freeman; but to honest, 'The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part.' is a quote from Ernest Hemmingway.<br/><br/>Oldboy is visceral and brutal but is also bold and insightful as to the fact that although you have had harm done unto you do not try and seek revenge by murder or vigilance. Try your best to understand WHY the terrible occurrence had happened to you and what you can NOW do to fix it.<br/><br/>That is the ideal, the 'point' of ""Oldboy"" and it has been exercised wonderfully.<br/><br/>It is one of 2005's best films (in North America), although it is copyright 2004.<br/><br/>D."

Not because Mr. Tarantino told me so - but because of the flashing pictures that are still burning my mind.<br/><br/>I have a picture of Dae-su in the background and Woo-yin in the foreground, both sharp as hell, no depth-of-field. I remember the octopus arm still moving in Dae-su's mouth while he's already passed out.

","Old Boyis a delirious, confronting ride, a movie full of visceral shocks and aesthetic pleasures: it has an explosive immediacy and a persistent afterlife, a lingering impact that is hard to shake. While it has scenes of considerable brutality, its violence is expressed in a range of ways: its shock value lies most of all in what it tells us about its characters and their emotions. Full of visual and auditory pleasures, it is a dense, carefully structured film, an enigma laid bare with merciless inevitability and moments of lyrical beauty. Some of its patterns and repetitions are apparent on a first encounter, but its intricacies need more than one viewing. It is, in the most disconcerting and disorienting of ways, an exhilarating movie.<br/><br/>OldBoy begins in a flurry of chaos, in a scene that is echoed in a flashback at the end of film. We are then back in time, to the moment when Oh Daesu (Choi Min-sik), after a drunken rampage at a police station, suddenly disappears from view. He undergoes an extraordinary experience. He is kidnapped, taken prisoner, confined to a room, fed, maintained and spied upon. Television is his only contact with the outside world: he watches Korean political upheavals and Princess Diana's wedding, and discovers that he has become a murder suspect.<br/><br/>During his captivity, he tries to imagine who could have wished this fate on him: he has a rollcall of potential names, but no one of whom he can be sure. He devises strategies for marking the passage of time, for escape, for preparing himself to find out who ordered his imprisonment, and exacting revenge.<br/><br/>When he finally leaves his cell, he's a man on a mission. But he discovers that his unknown opponent is waiting for him: the task of retribution will be more difficult than he thinks. The question, furthermore, becomes not who imprisoned him, but why: what is it in his past that has put him in this position?<br/><br/>Choi's performance is remarkable: he makes Daesu a figure at once terrifying, and pitiful, magnetically watchable. Yu Ji-tae, as the urbane, controlled nemesis Daesu encounters, quite early in the proceedings, plays a crucial role in maintaining the extremity of the film's premises.<br/><br/>Old Boy, in its richness and intensity, its weightiness and its lightness, feels like a compendium of movies and mystery stories, fables and case histories, myths and legends, distilled into a single devastating experience."
"Blackzor","9","2","7","10 June 2013"," Top of my list!
","Oldboy is certainly one of my favorite films of all time. It is, in my own opinion, the perfect balance of brutality and drama. It shows that if a man is given enough reasons, he will see nothing but revenge.<br/><br/>As most of you already know, the story involves a man (Oh-Dea Su)being captured and held captive for unknown reasons. After 15 years, he is suddenly released and he only has a fews days to figure out who did this to him and even more important, why.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie fall in the ""less I tell you, the better"" category but I will say this. While this is not a perfect movie (no movies are), I can honestly say that every aspect of this picture is done with care and with an almost flawless attention. Every shot is beautiful. All of the characters have good reasons and motivation to act the way they do. It is a violent film but there is a purpose to it all and in the end, it could move you to tears.<br/><br/>I want to take time and make a special mention to the soundtrack. A great example that powerful imagery can be amplified if you have to right track. It is simply awesome and make a good movie into a great one. The storyline is also worth a mention. It's very strong on its own but its the way it's told. Many questions are asked from the beginning and you get a good pace throughout to get all the answers you need.<br/><br/>Not an easy film but a very very enjoyable one.Highly recommended for anyone that like effective drama and/or violence."

","OLDBOY (Park 2003) was the director's ticket to Hollywood praise, receiving attention from famed director Quentin Tarantino, another man known for his love for vengeance-filled films glorified in their gore and gravitas (see: Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2, Inglourious Basterds). Set in modern Korea, the story of ""Oldboy"" stretches for more than 30 years, its main seed germinating from a secret rendezvous and an eventual rumor spreading in a small-town Catholic high school. The protagonist, Oh Dae- su, becomes the unwitting victim, locked up in a barren condominium apartment for a span of 15 years, literally growing old within its walls, and witnessing world events (i.e. the independence of Hongkong, the death of Princess Diana, the fall of the Twin Towers) through a rickety television set.<br/><br/>As Oh Dae-su is suddenly released, vengeance is the first thing on his mind, yet strange devices (a cellphone, a bugged shoe) leave him paranoid and ultimately lead him to his nemesis: a much more youthful- looking Lee Woo-jin (perhaps an antithesis to Dae-su's ""oldness""?). In his journey to avenge himself and destroy Woo-jin, he finds out things in himself that for 15 years lay dormant in his corporal self: that he could pin down and kill an army of gangsters, that he still has the capacity for love (and sex), that his memories have stayed with him and eventually surface with enough motivation.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" deals with a multitude of taboo topics: the hidden extent of human cruelty and control, incest (brother to sister, father to daughter--dynamics that become extremely important as we uncover the truths of the film), violence, a culture that defies privacy but revels in isolation. ""Oldboy"", as much as it is a commentary on the darkest aspects of being human, is a powerful tale of redemption for a man who literally loses everything and comes out a survivor."
"divncom","6","2","7","10 May 2013"," Greek Tragedy meets Saw via Kill Bill and Lucky Number Slevin.
","I just finished watching Oldboy, the original language version. <br/><br/>First off, the very core of the film; the aspect of this film that most of its most ardent defenders point to as being so substantially original and wholeheartedly moving is the notion of incest and the complications arising from having inadvertently become entangled in such a dilemma.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for most people who worship this film, this idea has been worked before. It's been worked so thoroughly, in fact, that it's thousands of years old. That's right - it's not original. Sigmund Freud (do you know who he is?) based a huge chunk of his theory of psychodynamic psychotherapy on the source material: Oedipus the King. <br/><br/>Short history lesson: If you didn't learn this at University or didn't go to University or pay attention in high school, you might have missed the portion where you learned about ""Greek Tragedy"". That's what Oedipus the King is. Oedipus the King was written in the year 429 BCE by Sophocles.<br/><br/>I will not digress into the intricacies of Greek Tragedy here; the fact that people in this day and age find inferior derivative products to be works of sheer masterpiece speaks volumes on its own. If a cheap 2500 year old rip-off pop culture gore-fest like Oldboy is a masterpiece, what is Sophocles tragedy?<br/><br/>I implore those of you who are younger or uneducated on the topic to delve more into the area of the classics ... read works like Antigone, The Iliad ... etc. If this film kindled a fire for this sort of moral conundrum/tale of horrible destiny in you, then please go study the classics more (by classics I don't mean The Godfather; I mean the Classics with a capital C - Greek, Roman, Dante, etc.) <br/><br/>If all it takes to produce a masterpiece is to take the core of somebody else's 2500 year old Greek tragedy (which in themselves became morose in their commonality during their time), add slick production value, violence and extreme gore to make a masterpiece - then I'm done with the notion of evaluating or participating in the debate over film.<br/><br/>Make sure to take a very long look at a film before you're swept away with its material. Make sure it's not stolen; make sure you're educated before you go to the movie theater. It's a damn shame if you have seen ""Oldboy"" before you've read Romeo and Juliet, your basic canon of Greek tragedy, etc. <br/><br/>So, what qualifies as original? That's up to you as a viewer. Find something that is more modern in its philosophy. Just hypothetically - existentialism is much newer (relatively) than Greek Tragedy. If a film bases the core of its ideas and plot on something much more dynamic and current such as this, they're actually contributing to OUR era. CREATING something.<br/><br/>Oldboy has created nothing; it is less than the sum of its parts: A derived Greek Tragedy combined with excessive gore, excessive stylization and excessive reliance on modern scenery to shroud an eternal theme. <br/><br/>Take these elements and you have, at best, a Saw level film with twists and turns ... throw in a bit of The Crying Game and Kill Bill and viola.<br/><br/>I prize originality above all else. I found none here; overrating a film based on the misconception of originality is a big pet peeve of this critic. <br/><br/>6/10 for good cinematography, acting and adaptation of a very old idea."

","Oldboy is a Korean flick, part of the 'Revenge' trilogy by Chan-wook Park. The movie is about Oh Daesu, who is mysteriously abducted on the eve of his daughter's birthday and kept in detention for fifteen years by someone unbeknown to him. He finds himself in a small room, with a television and no means of escape. He is served food through a slot in the door and put to sleep by introducing various gases through the air shaft. While he is kept captive, he hears of his wife's murder, with which he has been charged. The movie reflects the internal struggle of Daesu in coming to terms with the dire situation he finds himself in. The fifteen years fill him up with relentless hatred for his mystery captor and an unquenchable thirst for revenge. When released, he sets out to find out who was behind all this and why he was subjected to imprisonment for so long. He befriends a young girl who's a cook at a diner and seeks help of his best friend from fifteen years back in order to unlock this mystery. He finds out that his daughter was adopted while he was away and is currently in Stockholm. Very soon, his captor does reveal himself. Still, Daesu finds himself unable to kill him without finding out what the reason behind his torture. It is this pursuit of putting the pieces together that drives the rest of the movie as clues to the mystery present themselves one after the another.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu have both put in brilliant performances. The movie finds its strength in Choi's portrayal of the strong emotions that drive his actions. From a state of being despairingly lost and demented, he is driven by the pure emotion of revenge and becomes obsessed in his pursuit. All that is wonderfully captured in one of the scenes, in which Daesu fights a mob of crooks by himself, with a knife stabbed on his back.<br/><br/>The plot keeps the viewer engaged and eager to find out what happens next. Interestingly, the director also delves into the psyche of his characters with the aid of some surrealist representation at times. I was slightly disappointed with the crowning revelation and felt it wasn't as convincing but I did find the absence of complication agreeable. Instead of leading the viewer into deeper layers of interwoven story lines in order to justify the strong tone of the movie, a simpler and an authentic rationale has been chosen.<br/><br/>While I expected a more intense conclusion to the movie, the uncertain ending adds to the quality of the movie and does justice to it. Overall, it is the undiluted and pure portrayal of the strongest human emotions make the movie what it is."

He killed girls with hammer, chisel and amputated the victims. Some of them were cannibalized. He mashed victim's liver with food processors and drank it. Now the serial killer is sentenced to death and his existence throw serious questions about execution of death sentenced prisoner to the Korean society. For ten years Korean government never executed prisoners and now UN approved Korea as a No Execution country.<br/><br/>This movie is a product of these social circumstance. Of course any modernized country can have notorious serial killers. But this is most brutal and abominable criminal act as reported to the public.<br/><br/>Another phenomena described in this movie are the inactive police act and ugly politician.

"johan-roelofs","9","2","7","5 November 2011"," Hollywood, HAND OFF!!
","The movie Oldboy is, as previously mentioned, an extremely violent motion picture. This might be the films first and major downside, and I lay the emphasis on might because it depends entirely on the person that is watching the movie whether you call this movie appropriate or inappropriate. I for example had no problem whatsoever with all this violence, since it has almost become normal to my generation. I can however understand the people that say that this movie is inappropriate, because literally bashing someone's brains out isn't exactly motivating world peace. Neither does it contribute to the tastefulness of the movie. This aspect is further enhanced by the eating of a live squid, that was still twitching once it's head was bitten off. This scene is probably the highpoint of the movie gore wise. Not to say that there are no other moments on which you might have in a different direction and maybe even cover your ears. This is also the movies' second downside, you probably shouldn't watch this movie if you have a weak stomach. Also and this may only be a problem to few, the movie is spoken in Korean so unless you have South-Korean relatives, or you are, it will be very hard to follow the story without subtitles. This movie isn't just down all the way, on the contrary, it has some of the best dialogue, scripting, acting, directing, camera work, editing and soundtrack that I have ever seen in a movie. The dialogue and the script keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie and will lead you to one of the most memorable plot twists I have ever witnessed. The amount of tension that is created in some of the scenes is just incredible. This of course, is too created by the acting and the soundtrack. The soundtrack is perfectly fine tuned to the mood of the movie and the actors look like they where made to play these roles. Also the ease with which the movie goes along is just incredible, it's like the movie has just been shot in one single take, props to the editing team and the director off this movie because this is about as smooth as it gets. Now the camera work deserves a standing ovation just on it's own. The finesse with which the movie is filmed and all the seemingly impossible shots that the crew managed to pull off are just incredible, for example one of the fight scenes takes place in a corridor and the camera just keeps on rolling until Dae-su has defeated all the evil and conquered the entire corridor. This of course is also an ode to the devotion of the actors, just imagine how long they must have practised this entire routine. All in all this is a great piece of cinema, if you have the time and the guts (wink) to watch this movie. I am sure it is time well spent. Because well made films are becoming rare in the time of reboots and remakes. I will leave with one last word of advice: Hollywood, HANDS OFF!!"
"moselekm","9","2","7","21 April 2009"," A Must See For All Adults
","Oldboy is based off a manga (like many pulp Asian movies such as Ichi The Killer). However, not confuse you with the nature of most Asian pulp movies, this one was done with all seriousness and a great cast as well as director.<br/><br/>If ever, you are searching for a movie that has one of those endings that make you sit up in your seat, or race to be the first one in the living room to shout the 'concluding answer', then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty long for you pretty much being extremely confused (two hours), however, every little thing in the movie is pretty much necessary, if not to define Daesu (Oldboy), but to truly hit you in the end.<br/><br/>Oldboy takes the human aspect of several details and puts you on a near week odyssey of a man trying to commit to vengeance and a quest to find the truth behind 'why' and 'who'. The movie was suggested to me by one of my friends when I asked for a movie title that would leave me struck and speechless in the end. This movie was suggested and I regret buying it and waiting a week to watch it, as it was ultimately the best foreign film I have seen."

There are so many twists and turns that just when you think you have everything figured out the story completely turns and blows your mind. You get drawn in more and more as the story progresses. A very enlightening look at life, love, revenge and the importance of keeping your mouth shut. The production of the film is way better then I expected. The camera effects seem to be a little forced into the film but they fit in pretty good. There are a few fantasy scenes with some visually pleasing graphics thrown in. There were a few corny fight scenes that weren't exactly believable. The acting is believable though. Well at least from what I see. After all it's a Korean film in Korean. Long story short this was a great film with an unforgettable story. Well worth watching."

","The two hours I spent for this movie definitely worth it, one of the most awesome stories I've seen combined with great acting and directing. I don't want to describe it scene by scene, so I can just say ""Unique"". <br/><br/>What I call a great movie has a profile which is; the movie should get you inside. In other words, while you are watching it you are living in it. Oldboy can definitely do that, just from the beginning it takes you in whether you like whats going on inside or not, you are completely in it and all you can do is to go with the magnificent flow of the movie. There are so much thrilling scenes that each time you think this might be the climax but no, it just keeps surprising you.The selection of actors is great, they just fit in to their characters, it can't be any better. The spectator goes through the agony that Dae Sue goes through at the same time you feel empathy for his captor, feeling sadness, joy and anger together.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I'll only use only two words ""Absolutely Magnificent"" and calling Oldboy a master piece would be just in place."
"gryspnik","8","9","60","12 November 2006"," A very well made Greek style Korean tragedy.
","This is not a film for puritans, conservatives and anyone who can't see art for what it really is. This is a film obviously inspired by ancient Greek tragedies such as Oresteia or Oedipus tyrannous. The tragic elements and the catharsis are set exactly as in a Greek tragedy. Even the self inflicted punishment is here. This is a real masterpiece in all levels. The acting is just unbelievable, the direction is amongst the best I have seen in the past couple of years. The cinematography is wonderful.<br/><br/>I will not comment on the scenario because as I already said it is based on pieces of literature that have been loved and admired for thousands of years. This movie manages like few others, to induce both sympathy, fear, rage and tears in you. The protagonist is far from a villain. He is merely a victim of a villain and he just wants his life back. It is on my top 300 list.<br/><br/>Whoever didn't get the plot and found it confusing, I guess they watched it without subtitles..."

","Iam may not be an interesting writer writing about old boy . As i have an engineering academic background , i would like to go down in points about how i feel good on this piece of masterpiece:<br/><br/>I) The background music is really enthralling.(that i had split the end part of the movie and convert it into mp3..and yes, i still do listen to it a lot... thinking about the last scene on the snow-covered New Zealand peaks).<br/><br/>II)The angles-of-shot were captivating ; and, if i were not mistaken the last scene in the penthouse ..about the 70 steps stuff... was copied by Kill Bill 2 .<br/><br/>III) The continuous fight scene in the long corridor...that was a revolutionary idea .<br/><br/>IV) The revealing scenes were great...though the causes were minute.<br/><br/>Since this movie marked a new era of movie production...i appreciate it a lot... so if any one can't appreciate this movie then either he is a holy child (Godly , not interested in movie) or he is dumb.<br/><br/>Some people commented on comparing Tarantino's and Oldboy . But please don't do so..i have seen all Tarantino's and i find them all vague and strange . They are all satirical based .(may be more like SouthPark).<br/><br/>But this movie is clear and simple and the fight scenes are more original and better.<br/><br/>The only reason that I observe as the drawback is the minute reason for vengeance upon Oh-Daesu."

The story is engaging from the first shot until the end, it is beautifully filmed, the music is beautiful and the acting was perfect.<br/><br/>I bet you if this film was in ""American"" it would swiped every award available in its category but since it does not appeal to the lowest denominator you will have the occasional movie goer leaving the cinema in the middle of the movie 'cos' its in 'foreign' and it does not have Vin Diesel in it.<br/><br/>I think I'll go and see it again today."

","OldBoy is a film you shouldn't read about. It's a film you should somehow grab and watch. No research required.<br/><br/>The camera technique is fantastic and unique, with disturbingly eerie and suitable music to boot. The emotion of the storyline is perfectly acted out especially by the lead Choi Min-Sik, who personifies human vengeance with all negative human emotions and a touch of desperate dignified honour to the max. Although the characterisation is quite lacking, this film dosen't need it. Choi hasn't many words to build up sympathy and emotion for his character, yet he uses all the emotional energy he can muster and it shows. From his toes to this eyeballs, Choi plays a man with one thing in mind: Revenge. Yet unlike other revenge flicks, such an emotion is realistically portrayed with a depth I have never seen before from a single actor. Sadness, depression, loss, loneliness, pride, hopelessness, determination, irony, wrath. All with one word. One look. Only Choi could have pulled this off.<br/><br/>Director Park Chan-Wook has made a gem which should be remembered for the ages. The film moves along at full speed like a Tarantino flick, yet comparatively still seems slow and old-fashioned and dosen't feel like your watching a movie. The dialogue is cliched and metaphorical, yet it dosen't feel forced and over-philosophical like the Matrix films. There are many images in the film which will stay in your head for years."

","Oldboy isn't just great korean cinema. it's a great hell of a movie. You watch this one from beginning to end because you want to see what happens. This one is really dark and has tinges of humor to ease the ride. However, Chan-wook Park's style is no holding back and he tells this warped twisted tale. Is this movie about mindless violence and vengeance. It definitely factors in, but I felt it was about transformation. Daesu, played with gusto by Min-sik Choi, is such a perplex character that you find yourself rooting for him, yet appalled at his actions. He is forced to review his life (very involuntarily) and what he's become. I don't even want to go beyond that, but think about your past, your present, and the individual you've become. Are you pleased or satisfied? Would you have done anything differently? Would you reject people who you'd previously greeted with smiles and called friends or would you seek out those who you may have unjustly wronged? That's what Oldboy is about. The journey of life and the consequences of actions taken. That's why Min-sik Choi is so superb in that he really becomes Daesu and from the start to finish, you become fascinated, even obsessed with finding the path he takes. The cast work well here and this may be one of the most intense films I've had the pleasure of seeing. Oldboy may be a huge step for korean cinema, but it really is one fantastic movie."

","Wow! There's no halves with Oldboy. I haven't seen so many negative reviews for a film so highly regarded by many others. Perhaps its the violence, which is understandable because it can be gratuitous and would make anyone cringe. Major plot holes have been pointed out by others. I would tend to agree with that too. The plot is indeed derivative - the basic Count of Monte Cristo premise has been rehashed before for countless TV shows. Yet despite all these valid criticism's (all of which I agree with), I think Oldboy only falls a notch short of excellent.<br/><br/>The magic is in the execution. The script is quite complex and the editing, camera-work do it full justice. In particular, the entire school sequence and the single-take corridor fight are brilliant.<br/><br/>The plot has Oh Dae-Su, married with one young daughter, kidnapped and imprisoned in a comfortable room for 15 years. When he is released, he does not realise, despite being told that he has merely moved to a larger prison. Hell-bent on revenge, it takes him the rest of the movie to realise that he was better off in prison.<br/><br/>Themes in this movie likely to offend include attempted rape, murder, torture, incest and eating a live baby octopus."

","Probably the best of the recent South Korean cinema boom, Oldboy is a compelling drama/thriller with an outstanding lead performance from Choi Min Sik. The premise of a man imprisoned for 15 years for no apparent reason is frightening but this is just the beginning of a series of horrors. At once scary, funny and poignant Oldboy is easily one of the best films of the last ten years, only the dreaded prospect of an American remake (possibly starring Nicholas Cage!!) leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The director's other films - JSA, Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and Lady Vengeance (the latter two part of a 'revenge' trilogy along with Oldboy) are not in the same class as this but still worth seeking out."

","On his way back home after a drunken night out Dae-su Oh is on his way back home with a friend who bailed him out of jail. Then, as if things couldn't get worse, Dae-su Oh disappears... right from the street with no trace. The next thing he knows he is in an apartment style room and he is being held there like an inmate. He doesn't know who his captors are and doesn't know why anyone would put him in there. 15 years later he is freed and his wanting to figure out who imprisoned him turns into obsession when he finds out his captor's plans for him aren't over.<br/><br/>The concept of the film is quite simple and almost seems like a classic ""what if"" scenario - ""what if you were held against your will for a long time and then freed."" What would you do? How would you feel? The strength of the movie is that it also present the other side of that scenario - why would anyone do that to anyone else? How would they arrange it? The story of vengeance that unfolds ends up being as deep as the psychology behind it and that makes for a really fascinating tale. Then there is the cinematography which is just as effective with the hallway fight scene probably being the most famous example. But almost every scene or at least every key scene manages to stand out in its own way. The acting is also strong and even inventive, especially in the end scenes. It is not necessarily realistic, but the point is this is a story so it works to get its point across. Some have compared it to Greek Tragedian acting as it attempts to encompass the summation of a long story (Greek tragedies had far reaching back-stories referred to throughout, while here it is shown in the beginning) into one moment. And as mentioned before, the film shows these scenes from opposing points of view so the viewer is left neither in failure's shambles or victory's joys, but rather outside looking in on what happened.<br/><br/>That makes for a revenge film that is not about revenge itself, but examines the nature of the act. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for brutal violence. The US dubbed version also contains profanity that seems to come standard with the thriller genre."
"zolaaar","7","12","90","20 February 2005"," Film without Mercy
","What is so fascinating about Asian cinema is its radicalism and the extremes. Not only the action and the depicting representation of violence are so radical, but also when it comes to aesthetic issues that exceed the lines of occidental films. Such as ""Oldboy"" does. An attack in philosophical and aesthetic aspects: brutal, disturbing, traumatic - and beautiful. The Jury of the Cannes festival under the lead of Tarantino could not do differently than present the Grand Prix to the work of director Park Chan-wook.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is the second feature film of Park's 'Vengeance-Trilogy' which started with ""Boksuneun naui geot - Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" in 2002. The story is based on a Japanese manga book series. Park tells it in breathtaking, disturbing pictures which reflect the state of consciousness of the protagonist: In moments of emotional safety coined in aerated colors, in moments of revenge left cold and grey. A surreal atmosphere, a fragmentarily way of narrating, and a hardly decoded use of symbolism leaves the viewer without control over the reception of what he is witnessing. Instead he gets into the vortex of extremely emotions where there is actually no way out. Ungovernable anger, distress, fear, love, and pain collide with harsh cuts. The film transfers that chaos to the viewing audience brilliantly. That's what we like about Asian cinema in particular the films of Kitano, Kim, and Miike: The fathom of emotional and aesthetic extremes.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is not a birth product of the brain. In nearly every shot there is something surprising, every dialog develops a plot-twist and in every character lies a fascinating secret. Enough material that leaves us thinking about the whole point and rearrange the emotional chaos in our heads, even after days and days."
"coritoj","10","11","82","13 November 2005"," Old Boy, a must see
","I have seen Oldboy, I have to warn my readers this is not any old street fighting action movie. It is a trip through human emotions, love and hatred, revenge, passion... I could not precisely describe all the emotions this movie brings out of me. Nevertheless, I think it would be a BIG mistake to go for an American remake of this movie, also I would recommend people to watch it with subtitles, the flow of Korean language in certain scenes is important to realise the desperation of the characters there's also the natural innocence and amusement present in all eastern movies. The point of the movie, well, things which for our society are somehow ""tabus"" which can destroy people's lives, I think that is what this movie is about, some kind of eastern-modern version of OedipusRex, but this is only a guess. I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this movie, beginning to end. I have thought also about going to Seoul, maybe to try some ""live Octopus"". I hope this is any use to any of you. Cheers, Good day!!!!!! corito"
"ubergeek001","Null","6","37","3 February 2007"," Too much for simple minds
","The complexity in the film is borrowed from American Cinema; it is supposed to be a remake of The Count of Monte Cristo. You have to understand that a lot of movies now are just regurgitations of the past. People have run out of ideas so they look into real life situations and make up the rest. <br/><br/>In this case, it was well done nonetheless. <br/><br/>When you first watch the film unknowing that fact, you can enjoy it. Besides, everything in film these days are remakes or parallel story lines of other fables told before we existed.<br/><br/>Great camera work, great acting, Korean cinema is starting to gain notoriety.<br/><br/>Don't pay attention to these foolish reviews, it's a great movie."
"deastman_uk","7","10","73","18 December 2004"," Keeping it in the family
","The family does seem to be a focus in Asian cinema, and this is no exception. Being imprisoned in a room for 15 years for no immediate reason is a very good start to an exceptional film. But the closeness of the interiors does not seem to stop once our hero is released to get his revenge.<br/><br/>The violence in the film while never meaningless does seem to weave a strong unpleasant backbone that gives the film its vivid consistency. But its not a logic - its never an and in itself. While there is a lot borrowed from the modern stylised thriller, which always involves some sort of identity problem, e.g. Seven, Fight club, Momento etc, the film is much more than the sum of its parts. The director has a sense of timing that can only come about from the strength of the written material.<br/><br/>But ultimately this is still Asian cinema, with Asian values, yet its fighting for Western cinema audiences. It will be interesting to see which culture makes way first."

"carlosdajekyll","9","9","64","28 May 2006"," The destructive nature and eventual repercussions of revenge and the power of forgiveness
","There has been much criticism made about some of the apparent large plot holes and I just wanted to add some of my own thoughts and cultural perspective about it. I'm not trying to defend the film and I really enjoyed the film mainly because I did not anticipate the twist ending.<br/><br/>First off, the apparent age difference of 15 years between the two main leads. In case many of you haven't noticed, many Asians do age very gracefully without any effort, much more easily than Caucasians. If you had to guess the ages of a Caucasian and an Asian, more often than not, you would get the Asian's age wrong by a great deal.<br/><br/>Secondly, some feel the ending was a let-down. I would disagree on many counts. Put yourself in the place of the bad guy, how would you take revenge? You have lived with the pain and regret of losing your sister for almost 15 years, how do you replicate your revenge? How do you make your enemy regret his initial actions? How do you take revenge on a vengeful person? Be using his vengeful nature against himself. By leading him into performing another more heinous act of his own volition that he would regret even more and live with for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Notice the incredibly difficult dilemma and choices Dae-Su faces at the end. His daughter is the only living and closest relative he has.<br/><br/>What would you do in his place? A)Break off the relationship, keep the secret, you break your daughter's heart and you never see your own daughter ever again and there's no way to explain to her without revealing the secret.<br/><br/>B)Keep the existing relationship, keep the secret, and you have to repeat the heinous act over and over again, each time you become even more guilt-ridden.<br/><br/>C)Reveal the secret and both father and daughter, albeit reunited, will lead an awkward and guilt-ridden co-existence for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>In A), you bear the pain of incest all by yourself, but both will bear the pain of separation.<br/><br/>In B), you bear the pain of past incest all by yourself, and you have to bear even more pain of future incest all by yourself, and you are forced to hurt your child even more (incest) by not trying to hurt your child (by revealing the secret).<br/><br/>In C), both share the pain of past incest and will have to bear with it for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>As a parent, you would not want your child to feel any pain, preferably to bear all the pain yourself, but that option would lead to even more pain.<br/><br/>Where does the regret part come in? When he decides to prioritize vengeance over reconciliation with his daughter. Oh Dae-Su is a vengeful character by nature, and he becomes even more so after the lengthy period of confinement. Had he decided to forgive and forget, had he decided to look for and reunite with his daughter first, he would not have committed the subsequent acts.<br/><br/>A vengeful person is for obvious reasons, a very unforgiving person. To punish a vengeful person, you get him to commit a very regretful act, since he finds it hard to forgive, he would find it hard to forgive himself. Had the bad guy attempted to use the same modus operandi on a more forgiving person, it would never have worked, reconciliation would have taken place before vengeance or the person would have forgiven himself more easily at the end.<br/><br/>Remember he had a choice, he made a decision.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the hypnosis part. Hypnosis works differently with many people, some are more susceptible and vulnerable to suggestion than others, ultimately there's still free will, which would also put any notions of diminished responsibility to rest."

But yeah it was worth it, I have watched it about 8 times and i still cringe every time Mr.Parks teeth get pulled out. The score is also very mellow, but there is a sense that there is more to it. The ending, WOW, I haven't seen an ending like that since Se7en. It really blew me away, i tried to watch it in English and that lasted about a minute. I mean you have to watch it in it's original language in order to grasp the power and ferocity of the actual character of Oh Dae Su and his enemy. I really felt for the guy, he is definitely one of the most developed characters in the past ten years of cinema. Choi Min Sik has a steel gaze, although it may not seem like a lot, that gaze alone you can tell the guy has been through a lot without even hearing his story.

","When I read some of the negative reviews I began to wonder if I'd just been watching the same movie. But then, I didn't start the movie expecting anything in particular - it always looked intriguing on the trailers and I had a few hours to kill so I got out the DVD. Also, I didn't spend the whole movie trying to second-guess the story and work out the ending before I'd got halfway through - I just sat down and let myself be drawn into Oh Daesu's weird story.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was superb and all the lead characters turned in very convincing performances. The lighting and 'mood' are also perfect. As for the supposedly over the top violence, I really didn't think it was any worse than most Tarantino movies. A fair bit of nasty stuff happens but usually off-camera.<br/><br/>I'd say, if you're a fan of quirky, violent movies with great acting and intriguing story lines - and you don't mind reading fast subtitles then OldBoy could very well be your kind of movie."

I found it so good that I almost wish I'd never seen it. I say that I wish I hadn't watched it because it leaves me with a major dilemma: To tell everyone to watch it, HOWEVER, I'll think each time ""wait...will this person get it?"" and if they don't, ""do I really want to hate them for their opinion?"" While visually wonderful, and technically perfect I found myself most often thinking that the creators succeeded in making it work- for me -by the chances they took. The ant on the subway. The octopus. These non-western elements make Oldboy a good choice to cut through hemisphere-bias and see fine direction, story and acting as a pre-Babel language we all can speak."

","Oldboy is a film that is quite amazing i must say. i was quite surprised at how artfully created it was. Unlike the comment above, i must say that i don't require things to be explained to me in great detail. Having a lot of experience with Asian cinema i have come to the conclusion that they don't like to spell out everything in the film. this is good in many ways, one being that it does not insult the viewer, and two it lets you make your own conclusion as to what the film is trying to tell you. at any rate Oldboy is an amazing film that takes it's time to reveal its secrets. The film itself is not for everyone , but surely it is a modern classic. i hate using words like ""humanity"", and ""journey"", but i think they are appropriate in this sense. through the film, the main character has his humanity stripped from him, and he embarks upon a journey of self discovery that will leave him marked and scarred for the rest of his days."

He's shooting the third installment of this trilogy called SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE. I think SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is coming out in the states shortly after OLD BOY. If you get a chance, check out both films. I can't decide which one is better. OB is more plot driven where SYMPATHY is more character driven.

"Chris_Docker","8","11","83","20 August 2004"," Before the opening titles, a few nice gut-thumping adrenalin hits - and that's just for starters . . .
","(minor spoilers inasmuch as I mention some violent highlights) Park Chan-wook continues his individual style of extreme (and extremely creative) violence that he displayed to us in Sympathy for Mr Vengeance. For instance, there is removal of teeth without anaesthetic, self-mutilation, single-handed destruction of a gang of thugs by one man using a claw-tooth hammer. Odd bit of sexual violence and nakedness just in case we thought this was a movie suitable for the kids.<br/><br/>The plot is reasonably inventive - a man who is incarcerated for 15 years and isn't told why. When he gets out he creates a path of mayhem trying to escape the web of his enemies. then the plot thickens. One thing that Chan-wook is good at is twisting the audience's emotional sympathies after showing how thoroughly nasty all the characters are. Suddenly we are shown things in a different light. Even the opening scene where a man is being dangled off a rooftop held by another man simply by his necktie is not what it seems. The inventive ending reveals some of the twisted underpinning that is vaguely reminiscent of Kill Bill. Unlike Tarantino however, Park Chan-wook's violence isn't stylised - it's stomach-churningly realistic. Add lots of nice artistic touches on the camera work, get your audience to accept (in true Oriental film-making style) that not all the logical developments need necessarily be explained, and you have another masterly thriller that stands head and shoulders above mainstream Oriental thrillers."

But his way of description is very cool, and cruel, even he touched the twisted sexual lives of normal people. The camera work is wonderful. The storyline is though very complicated but amusing. If we were very tightened people then this movie should be awesome, however, if we get more free mind then this movie would be one of the best movie in last decade. In addition, main actors have shown their great ability with few conversations. Quite a number of humours also made this movie very enjoyable. Thumbs Up!"

","Well, as the title says, I think that a good artwork in any platform is not always a pleasant one. To me, what defines any artwork ""good"" is that it has the ability to make us think about issues that we normally wouldn't think or care about.<br/><br/>Oldboy, to me, is one of those works.<br/><br/>No doubt lots of people would find this work distasteful, and I understand why they would think in such fashion, one of the reason been the high level of violence. But then again, since this movie is focused on the theme of ""revenge"", I'd love to see people express about their opinions on that they would do if they had been locked up in a cell alone for 15 years without any apparent reason.<br/><br/>This movie showed me, a unique view, something that one would not see in normal daily life. A view from the mind twisted, hatred filled, yet still passionate man. It is chilling to see how 15 years of isolation can turn a middle-aged middle-class man into.<br/><br/>Chilling.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, it makes me think about how lucky I am that I have a normal, mostly happy life. Compare to the main character, we are all very lucky.<br/><br/>The movie itself handles the character emotions really well. The actors performed both positive and negative emotions flawlessly.<br/><br/>The music is great too, and the tone varies a lot. The last scene combined with the music, gave me a deep impression and after that, a long, deep sigh.<br/><br/>Personally I put Oldboy among the ranks of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Forest Gump"" as my favorites. Though they all have distinctive themes and different ways of expression, there's one common thing between them.<br/><br/>They all make me think, and think hard.<br/><br/>I certainly hope this film does the same for you."

","Others have stated the facts about the movie many times over. And this has been churned over and over, so I'll be brief: The cinematography was excellent. The introduction when Daesu is attempting to escape his prison, while world events play on the right side of the screen really aid in showing the passage of time(Many of the things are Korean related, but things such as the Year 2000 celebrations and the World Trade Center attacks bring it home for others).<br/><br/>The music was good, at times rocking(see above scene).<br/><br/>The plot was also good, well written and maintains a pretty good pace, save a few scenes. The twist ending(as mystery movies always have) was surprising to me, but appreciated. The explanation and conclusion to the story make it worth at least a second viewing.<br/><br/>The Adult Stuff (Sex,violence,language) was really not that bad. All R rated pretty much. Though many say perhaps not enough gore, too much sex(The way most Americans feel about movies and TV) I felt that the fighting scenes were for the most part not about the gore. They were fights, with or without blood. The one torture scene near the start, short lived, provides most of the blood until nearly the very end. The sex, also short lived, seems to cause much more controversy due to it's taboo nature, however any adult could easily tell you it's really nothing(not to mention neither character is aware of the taboo). Nope not explicit, like I said rated R. A high R, but R none the less. There's more sex on television. Language, naturally many expletives at times.<br/><br/>Overall: Fantastic, many great lines, great visuals, and worth at least 2 viewings. If not for the whole movie, at least that wonderful Hallway fight."

I personally didn't much enjoy Oldboy as a 2-hour experience, but that said, I can see where those who praise this film are coming from. It's a truly mesmerising film in places, mainly because you can't believe what's happening on the screen, and those who love melodrama and totally unexpected (even if ridiculous) plot lines will love this movie.<br/><br/>Oldboy is, put simply, an absolute fest of excesses, and the violence, sex, extreme plot twists, and overacting like nothing else you'll see make it a truly unique bit of Asian cinema. There's everything from live-octopus eating and dental torture, to deliberate- and then oblivious- incest! <br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Chinese, Japanese and Thai cinema, but admittedly I'm quite inexperienced in S.Korean. The only other Korean movie I've seen is Brotherhood (Taegukgi)- which greatly impressed me- but sadly I can't say the same about Oldboy.<br/><br/>The base plot really attracted me to this movie (along with the IMDb rating). The idea of a normal man being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, and then released without warning to discover the truth seemed like it would make a gripping movie. But I found myself drifting out of the plot as it progressed into more and more unusual and far-fetched directions towards the end. <br/><br/>You will no doubt notice that this film is very highly rated on the IMDb, and has made it a fair way up the top-250 list. If I'm honest though, I don't have the slightest idea whether it should be there or not! I think a reasonable conclusion about Oldboy would be that it isn't to be approached as another piece of Asian cinema, or even as a westernised one, but as a modern experiment in cinematic extremes.

","oldboy is a must see for anyone interested in learning more about korean films. the direction of park chan-wook is slightly clumsy, but it matches the pace of the movie. so i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt when i say that i believe it was fully intentional.<br/><br/>critics argue some of the scenes are too violent or unnecessary, but that misses the point. this movie is solely about revenge, and what we do to achieve it, and the prospect of living life once it has been fulfilled. the violence is simply a collateral matter. and while arguably the violence does force itself into the substance of the movie, mr. park incorporates enough humor to offset the blood.<br/><br/>and the storyline is so twisted, it's almost too unimaginable to be true, which was precisely its draw to me . . ."

","Oldboy is quite simply the greatest movie I have ever seen. I am not overrating this. In my opinion, words cannot begin to describe the feelings this movie left me with. I was left totally speechless while I contemplated this masterpiece.<br/><br/>From the opening shot, director Chan Wook Parks's intelligent use of camera angles is a joy to behold. He instantly adds a grittiness to the story with the use of his camera work, which in places can be extremely subtle. The soundtrack to this movie is the perfect accompaniment to what is unfolding on screen. It grabs you by the ears and slams you head first into the story line. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Min Sik Choi is excellent in this movie. I can honestly say that in places his acting ability and the depth of character he creates can be quite disturbing. The end scene in particular. The character Dae Su Oh is an interesting one, and the journey he is forced to undertake is quite simply, brutal. I feel that although the story line can be conceived as far fetched, it makes compelling viewing, and at no point during this film did I think it was in any way ridiculous. It is testament to the director's ability and that of the actors involved, that this awesome movie has been such a success both in Asia and more recently Western markets.<br/><br/>Although this movie will not be to everyones taste, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is quite simply wonderful."

","Old Boy is the second film in the Revenge Trilogy by Park. The first is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the final being Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.<br/><br/>After being imprisoned for 15 years, Ho Dae-su (whose name means ""getting along with everybody"") is released and finds he only has 5 days to find his captor and seek his revenge. Once the captor is found, Dae-su will learn about a past he conveniently forgot and find he is in for an even bigger surprise during the final confrontation.<br/><br/>The film is mesmerizing, hypnotic, and well edited with flashbacks and jump cuts. Park makes an elevator ride feel like a roller coaster. There is a notable fight sequence referred to as the ""one-take corridor scene"" where Dae-su takes several men in mostly hand-to-hand and hammer-to-head combat.<br/><br/>This is a powerful film. It is a meditation on our addiction to TV, the bloody thirst for revenge, and the tomfoolery your mind resorts to when it is forced to relive your memories. The film will make you question the importance of forgetting, forgiving, and the satisfaction, or lack there of, in seeking revenge.<br/><br/>The movie has an incredible build leading up to the finale. The end scene is full of twists. You will be amazed and you watch the truth slowly unravel. You learn that one memory is not as it appears and that another more important memory holding the key to the puzzle was completely forgotten. You will learn that getting the revenge is not the most important thing, but instead be able to live with yourself is. You will find that neither man will be able to do so, which leads to an explosive ending. There is also a bizarre, if not disgusting, love story at the center of this.<br/><br/>Favorite Quote: Too many good ones to mention. It is a tie between ""Be it a grain of sand or a rock Â– They both sink"" and ""Revenge is good for your health, but Pain will find you again.""<br/><br/>DVD Extras: Commentary, Multiple Deleted Scenes, Interview with director, Still Gallery, and Trailers from Tartan Asia Extreme.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: You will be entranced while following the plot and pleasantly shocked the surprise ending. I will be seeking out Park's other work as well and I suggest you do the same.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook"

I can not bring myself to say a single bad thing about this movie. Camera angles superb. Lighting picture perfect. THe musical score MIND BLOWING. This is also the type of film I suggest one watches with total concentration as I had to watch it twice and the second time brought with it new revelations that had flown over my head during the first screening as I sat in awe of what I was watching. <br/><br/>This is worth it and I have developed a new respect for the relatively unknown director and will make a point of renting and watching other films he is responsible for.

","Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) one day on his daughter's 3rd birthday gets picked up for a drunk-and-disorderly charge. When a friend comes to bail him out his life takes a bit of a strange detour that has him kidnapped by anonymous cretins who put him away for 15 years. During his 15 years of captivity Dae-su manages keep track of the outside world through television while the captors do weird things to him. One day he is just set free and he will need to find the answers he needs and the vengeance he craves all while finding the remnants of his shattered life.<br/><br/>This crazy Korean flick has had the scene abuzz for months and after viewing it I see why. 'Oldboy' is a pretty twisted take on a standard ""You done me wrong"" style revenge flick that will keep you engaged and on your toes to the end. 'Oldboy"" is wonderfully shot from its maniacally paced action scenes to the New Zealand landscape in the finale. Min-sik Choi does an amazing job in the lead. He runs practically the whole gamut of human emotion, all in a hyper-convincing matter. You can't help but feel for the guy when he finally gets all the answers and the plot gets uber-evil. A must see for Asian enthusiasts and for exploitation fans alike. The ending is way twisted and one wonders how the American remake will handle it."
"Mindtech","9","9","69","28 October 2006"," I'll be happy to remember this one
","This movie is beautiful, funny and poetic, and compared to other Asian movies really great. The actors are braver than any American actors I've seen in a looong time. This movie had me going till the end. I think the fighting scenes are justified because our hero is literally fighting to discover the truth. Can you imagine being locked away, your past taken from you? No? Well I can. And I must confess after having seen the whole thing thru, I turned off everything and just sat there and it came to me - this sense of having been filled by a story that ended in a truly emotional state, a bit like Der Untergang, the Hitler-movie... Also, I had to really keep my eyes open during the film (also cuz the subtitles were a bit distorted) but because I did, I got the whole thing. I saw this movie with my girlfriend, and she didn't catch as much as I did. See it slowly, take yer time and make sure you're in the right mood. Just like always."
"jrivera81","10","11","90","9 May 2005"," Not your typical revenge flick!
","From the moment this movie starts till the end it grips you and takes you into world you don't want to be in but are fascinated with. The trailer is a little misleading because it says he has 5 days to find out who did this to him, although a lot and I do mean a lot takes place before this timer ever begins, so it is not much a race against the clock type of movie that I thought it would be. Instead to quote Kill Bill ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" and I haven't seen it any colder than in this movie. Makes you look back and say what if that happened to me and that you have to think twice about the things you will say! I'd have to say this movie will cater more to fans of anime since its themes are more like an anime than a Hollywood action movie and that is pricely why I would recommend it. Movies like payback and man on fire are good but Oldboy will make you question after I get my revenge, what next?"

","Oldboy is a second film in Parks revenge trilogy, and i personally think that is the best one. Also for me it is the best Korean film i saw, and trust me i love Korean cinema. An excellent story directed with a lot of creativity,and visual beauty, chains the viewer to the screen until the end. Great atmosphere supported by excellent music and very good performance from the actors makes this film very interesting to watch. The use of color is also very good.<br/><br/>I watched this film many times, and i advise you to watch it at least twice, cause first time watching, you may find it confusing.<br/><br/>I was reading latest posts from people who watched it, and i get upset with people rating it low, but the final score talks for itself!<br/><br/>Oldboy is an amazing experience, but not suitable for everyone. This days people tend to like crap for the masses, and forget about being original and creative. Many people like films about special effects, rather then anything else. Well i have to say that this film got a lot of style, and bits all this special effect bullshit!!!"
"self_bias_resistor","9","10","80","14 November 2005"," A misunderstood and provocatively violent film
","I found this to be a movie on par with many other hugely misunderstood films, i.e Fight Club, and more recently Revolver; at early screenings, these films were (or still are)given a love/hate reaction, until they finally find solid ground on their DVD releases. I believe this is what will become of Oldboy. Followers of the so called zeitgeist have fallen in love with this film, where as many critics have found the film awkward and not clearly understandable. I personally found the film to be a great philosophy into many life issues, such as mortality and revenge. it also contained some fantastic direction, sublime acting from both lead roles and had an interesting and convincing plot (i have heard many people badmouth the films conclusion and have to say i thought it was a provocative and powerful ending, which brought up questions of conscience)."
"image_engineer","8","10","81","16 November 2005"," not bad... not bad at all
","I saw this movie last night on DVD with English subtitles. I watched it with some native Korean friends. They say it's a very well-known and liked movie in South Korea.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, this is a good movie. It would not have won or been nominated for so many awards if it were not a better than average flick. I was convincingly taken to a time and place outside of my own life for more than an hour; i.e. I was entertained. If you like foreign flicks, and especially Asian-made action/drama/intrigue films (or intrigue films in general), I'd say you have a very good chance of liking this movie. It starts out funny... and becomes dark and a bit drastic and dense, but still has nuggets of humor (some darkly hilarious, example: the last time you see the little white dog) in the last 2/3rds of the film. It's a love story (with a twist) that's not overly sappy, and a revenge story that's not contrived. The pace is good--not too fast and definitely not slow. <br/><br/>Those who have said the ending is stupid haven't seen many Asian or other foreign films (and don't know anything about Asian culture and ethics). Although there have been shifts away from the old mode in the last decade or so, most American films still end with everybody hunky-dory. Hey, Scooby-Doo rocks (especially sans-Scrappy), but I don't want all of my 'moviewing' to end with a rosy ""Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!"" This does not. The protagonist isn't perfect, and ultimately pays for his 'sins.' The scene toward the end with his grovelling may seem over-the-top cheezy and silly to many Americans, but to my Korean friends, his behavior is a little funny but powerfully ""that's a bummer, dude."" He's sacrificing his honor as a man by becoming a ridiculous pleading animal (what works there, hey this isn't Topeka or Orange County) in order to absolutely ensure his love isn't scarred in the way he and his enemy and his enemy's sister have been.<br/><br/>To those who say the movie sucks because you don't quite know what is happening or what is going to happen... ever see ""Donnie Darko"" or ""The Game""? Did you think those sucked? No. So free your mind. Koreans say beer or soju or vodka goes well with movies, especially dark ones; maybe this isn't bad advice for you.<br/><br/>The acting isn't poor and the cinematography is good. There's a lot of parallel imagery if you look for it. For example, the penthouse apartment has a narrow walkway surrounded by green-lit pools of water, which is a reference to the fateful dam and the green river below.<br/><br/>Also, to get deep for a few seconds... the protagonist is trapped for 15 years in a room. But, the closed-circuit TV operator (metal-mouth) is also shut away in his room, day after day. Just because this flunkie's door is unlocked doesn't mean he is any less a prisoner. The 'bad guy' is also partially trapped in his high-security penthouse and conttant bodyguard companionship, shut away from the world. The 'life as a prison' theme is found throughout the movie. It's meant to be cathartic. <br/><br/>I give it an 8 out of 10. Go rent and watch it some late Saturday night with a few friends. If you've never seen a Korean movie before, this wouldn't be a bad place to start (unless you're 8 and innocent or 88 and squeamish)."

","I'm totally new to watching movies with subtitles. I've been a movie fan for over 10 years, and if i run through the top 100 list on the site, I'm certain I've seen 99% of the movies on there, sad but true.<br/><br/>But much to my surprise, OLDBOY, my first ever Asian movie, was a tickle on the feet. Though I've read some of the remarks on this site regarding this movie, i think many of them are nonsense, a lack of appreciation for superb acting, great screen play, a story line that actually works with the characters, and a plot which was successfully unravelled within the 2 hour mark.<br/><br/>Many people write off movies like these based on 2 notions, one is HIGH EXPECTATION TO ONES PERSONAL LIKING and the other, DISAPPOINTMENT DUE TO LACK OF FICTIONAL ERA IN MOVIES. Oldboy, is a realistical production, which outlines emotions, hate, vengeance and love with all fairness and much to my liking an excellent SCRIPT.<br/><br/>ADVICE: DEFINITELY WATCH IT!!"
"chayster_022","8","11","92","20 February 2005"," I didn't like the Catcher in the Rye when I first read it either ...
","Those who are lamenting on how poor a film Oldboy is do not understand some of the fine points that were made in the movie. I thought the Great Gatsby and the Catcher in the Rye were pointless at first, and I had no idea why they were so critically acclaimed. It was not until I realized how applicable those novels were to universal issues (of the era they were written in, but also for future purposes) that I realized the true strength of their messages.<br/><br/>In the same way, I believe Oldboy is more of a thinker's film than a simple revenge film, but that lies in how you interpret the dialogue. It may be that the translations do not carry over very well. But in any case, if you watch Oldboy focusing on just the obvious visceral elements, you will not catch everything. Similar to what Lee Woo-Jin says in the movie, there are reasons why this movie comes out now rather than 15 years ago, but in other ways, it would be meaningful in any era."
"thomas-barrows","8","8","61","27 November 2006"," No, not a masterpiece, but....
","While it is true that Old Boy isn't a masterpiece, it is a well-constructed piece of cinema. There isn't anything particularly revolutionary regarding the themes of Old Boy, it is well-acted, beautifully shot, and the characters are engaging.<br/><br/>The movie is both beautiful and sad. Although vengeance is the underlying motivation for our protagonist, the film does not capitalize on a lot of cheap violence. If anything, the film demonstrates the folly of seeking revenge.<br/><br/>I very much recommend this movie and it has motivated me to explore other Korean films."
"rkjs689","10","10","82","31 December 2005"," Believe the reviews!!
","Many people who have reviewed this film have given very bad and unfair reviews. In my opinion this is a Korean masterpiece. Park Chan-Wook beautifully directs this tale of revenge and doesn't let the viewer sit comfortably because they are either seeing a mans teeth being pulled out with a hammer or finding out the dark secrets of Dae-Su's imprisonment. The main reason why people don't like or accept the film is because of the main subject at the end, incest. When i first watched this film i had no idea what to expect all i knew was that it had good reviews and success at Cannes and when the incest came into play i felt as uncomfortable as anyone else but when you look beyond that you really realise what you have just seen and you really appreciate the directing, Choi Min-Sik's amazing performance (by the way he eats a live squid so be prepared if your a squid lover) and the completely taboo and exciting story.<br/><br/>p.s. There is soon to be a remake of this film. How the hell can Hollywood do it?"

Check out the one-shot hallway fight for an example. Violent, at times very funny, it never let's go, and it'll take your breath away.

","This movie is totally awesome!!!  That was the feeling I was left with after watching this movie, and I bet that most of people who've watched this movie must have felt the same.  The script was so well written, with absolutely brutal tension throughout the movie, plus superb acting make this movie simply spectacular.<br/><br/>The movie begins with an ordinary guy, married with one girl, going sort of crazy in a police station, after night of heavy drinking.  After getting out, he makes a phone call to his daughter to tell her that he'll be home soon with her birthday present, then his whole life turns upside down.<br/><br/>He becomes kidnapped by unknown men, held in a solitary room in some building for 15 years, then one day, he was suddenly let out without any kind of explanation.  While in captivity, he finds out that his wife's been murdered, and he has became the prime suspect.<br/><br/>After he's been let go, he falls in love with a young woman, and together they solve the mystery behind his capture.  When he finally confronts the man that held him for 15 years, he promises him that if he finds out why he was held in 5 days, he'll die for him.<br/><br/>From this point on, the focus of movie shifts from why he was held for exactly 15 years to why he was let go after 15 years.  And when the truth becomes finally unveiled, it's so painful and shocking that it makes him wish that he was never let out.<br/><br/>This movie is revenge movie at its best.  It will definitely blow away any American revenge or mystery movie you've ever seen, and acting of Choi will leave you breathless, especially the final confrontation between the two men.  No one would've thought that director Park would be able to top his previous masterful revenge movie ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,"" but this movie is even much better, which in itself is unbelievable.<br/><br/>This movie will make you gasping for air. And expect unexpected."

You can watch 99% of mainstream films and turn off half way but still be able to describe the entire film in pretty good detail.

The more you watch, the more of the humor you pick up. Sure, there are some intense subject matters and scenes. But seriously, if you think back to the movie, there are jokes after jokes after jokes. Case in point. Right when he comes out of the rooftop. He tells his WHOLE story to the stranger with the dog. He delays the stranger's suicide to tell his story? I mean, that's the whole first half of the narrative, it was for this stranger on the rooftop. Then, the stranger wants to tell his story, but of course, Oh Daesu just gets up and walks away. Then he freaks out in the elevator over the ugly ""woman-being"" (he basically has a standing premature, orgasm). Then he walks out, the ""woman-being"" is freakin out to the security guard, and the stranger jumps off the rooftop and lands on a car right in front of her, still clinging on to his little dog. Then Oh Daesu says ""weep, and you are alone, laugh and the world laughs with you"", or something like that......then he puts on a crazy ass smile and walks out of frame. Love it!"

","I'd like to keep this review relatively short so here goes. Oldboy was easily the best film of 2003 and one of my favourite films of all time. The story which is a twisted tale of violent revenge is fantastic, and the final twist in the story is a deeply disturbing and shocking one which gives the viewer a fantastic confused sense of what to feel for the characters. The direction is sublime as is the score, it fits perfectly with the tone and the visual style of the movie. The acting is also great, you know its a sign of a good actor when he eats a live squid, even though his parents were quite strict Buddhists. To sum up, Oldboy has a fantastic story, great acting and amazing direction, if you haven't seen this film, why the heck not?"

","I won't join the chorus of thousands hailing this highly effective film a masterpiece, but I must say that it is very fresh, inventive, kinetic film-making.<br/><br/>I like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE more than OLDBOY, though I would also stop short of calling it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Why? At times, like OLD BOY, it meanders, and I don't think it always has its hands planted firmly on the steering wheel.<br/><br/>Minor grumbles aside, OLDBOY has great power and Chan-wook Park directs with a clear vision and much energy.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh, a man imprisoned for fifteen years without reason, delivers a performance without affectation.<br/><br/>Much of the film's violence has been discussed and praised. It is brutal and cinematic, and far be it from me to debate whether it is necessary. Of course it's necessary, just as dancing is necessary in a musical.<br/><br/>The scene is which Choi fights dozens of opponents in a narrow hallway -- staged in a continuous shot -- is a textbook example of fight choreography.<br/><br/>The director's greatest achievement is the film's grim, unrelenting tone and penetrating focus on his protagonist's deteriorating mental state. Choi's quest for justice is heart-wrenching without ever being mawkish. His journey is a cruel but necessary one.<br/><br/>This is not, primarily, a revenge tale, despite the fact that Choi does seek retribution.<br/><br/>It is a tale of extreme dislocation. Extremely well told."

If you like wacky, twisty, Coen Bros like movies full of artifice and inventiveness and sheer irreverence for every moral convention and you're not afraid of an awful large dose of horror this is for you. Of course its silly, and if you must, it might even be offensive but its at least three times better than anything the West is producing. Here is genre film making at its very best (SHEER VISUAL WIT) and its worst (sheer narrative awfulness). Many reviewers have written about its terrible story line but they're missing the point. Of course its a daft storyline, but then again who said Todd Solontzs story lines are wonderful but his films are rich, insane and daft at the same time. At its base its just laugh out loud funny and awful. THere are scenes of true horror and true pathos and scenes of mind bending po-facedness but thats the point. Think what Dario Argentino was doing twenty years back and add in the humour and wit and you have it. Wonderful and of course truly terrible as well."
"maou","9","8","63","7 June 2006"," In Response To...
","I'm writing this comment in response to another comment by an IMDb user. I've watched a fair number of movies in my time with a wide range of genres... I'll have to say that although this movie does have some details that may irk some, as a revenge film it is outstanding.<br/><br/>While the aforementioned comment was made in a similar fashion as the ""overpraisers,"" (overpraisers, under-praisers they're all the same, LOL) he fails to recognize some of the important elements that he/she perhaps lost in translation. The story of Oldboy has many elements that only eastern viewers may understand, or a more rounded out western viewer. For example, Oh Dae-su's name is very important to the movie, if you've missed this, watch it again. There are small bits and pieces in this film that many viewers will fail to understand because the movie has that subtle layer below the obvious that the aforementioned user ""saw."" The movie's ending is also quite intriguing. While many will see the ending very simply and only skim the surface of the reality presented to them, there is an argument that the director has presented to the viewers that needs careful attention, examination and discussion.<br/><br/>It is difficult for a western audience to truly appreciate this movie, or Park's Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance. While many will dub either of these movies as ""gorefests,"" Park is presenting the bare and raw version of revenge that humans often desire. He shows us the limits to which many are willing to go for attaining said vengeance. If you don't believe people like this exist, simply browse through a paper.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, watch it with an open mind. AND PLEASE, please, please, dive deeper into the surface of the movie, question everything you see and discuss the movie. Don't just say it's ""extreme"" cinema or that it's a ""gorefest."" Most of all, don't rely on the opinion of others to sway your decision to watch this movie. Watch it, if you don't like it, turn it off and save yourself the displeasure of sitting through it."

"navynasa","8","14","130","9 March 2005"," Best movie out of Korea--ever.
","Old Boy prays on things that South Koreans hold VERY dear--family, honor, and personal freedoms. The 15 year imprisonment is an affront to the personal freedoms, and the family and honor part is apparent (I don't want to give it away). In order to TRULY appreciate it, you must understand the deep seeded nature of these values. To give this movie an overall classification, I would say Quentin Tarantino meets your favorite mind game/mystery. The movie is, however, GREAT on many more levels. For example the torturous nature of the incarceration is brilliantly portrayed; you truly feel for the character. The element of mystery is unpredictable (especially for American audiences) with reveals coming at just the right time. There is also a scene in which our hero mows down about 40 henchmen in a narrow hallway. It is filmed in ONE SHOT. The only reason this film did not win overall best at Cannes Film Festival is because Farenhight911 was the political favorite in France. Overall it is worth reading the subtitles, even if you are not a foreign film fan."

","Old Boy is the story of a father and husband who, for seemingly no reason at all, is kidnapped and thrown into a motel-like jail cell for 15 years. When he is released back into society with his TV-taught vocabulary and his self-taught fighting prowess, he meets Mido, an aspiring sushi chef and immediately begins to seek out his captor.<br/><br/>This film is controversial, groundbreaking, incestuous, gory, and it'll make you cringe. It is hard to describe the movie without giving away much of the story. The story is fantastic, and surprisingly unpredictable. The climax at the end of the film is amazing and will most likely surprise you.<br/><br/>Some say the movie is a bit too gory and unnecessarily brutal, but that fact most definitely adds to the film. Old Boy contains an amazing action sequence, too: a side-scrolling fight scene all shot in one take, where Daesu fights with a hammer, amazing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite what anyone says, see this movie. It'll give you a new appreciation for film and Korean film as well. There's a reason Old Boy did so well at Cannes.<br/><br/><ul><li>Keith</li></ul>"
"newnoir","Null","11","96","9 May 2005"," Best Film Of The Year
","Oldboy has to be on of the greatest revenge films ever. If not one of the best films ever.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi is mind blowing as Dae-su Oh, the drunkard who is imprisoned for reasons unknown for over a decade. The film has many influences, The Count of Monte Cristo being the most obvious.<br/><br/>Just when you thought the revenge flick was old hat, along comes an awesome shock fest like Oldboy jammed with dark humor, action, and some of the best fight scenes in recent memory.<br/><br/>Many people rave about the one take fight scene where Min-sik takes on a whole gang single handedly. It's an amazing fight. And one the viewer is exhausted after watching in a way. Dae-su starts off fighting the gang frantically, claw hammer in hand, he falls to the ground, you think he's beaten, exhausted, but he comes back fighting, he falls down again, seemingly he MUST be beaten this time. But no! He fights back and when it's all over it's amazing to see he's defeated and worn down the entire gang. And all of this shot in ONE TAKE! Incredible.<br/><br/>There are plenty of small moments in the film that are excellent as well. One of mine being the voice over line where the hero wonders if fifteen years of pretend training can work, the short ensuing fight scene has a great, hand held kinetic energy to it. It's a mini-film school for directors on how to properly do a bad ass movie fight. And the hammer and teeth scenes are some of the most intense tooth torture scenes since the movie Marathon Man.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies I've ever scene, with a twisting, turning plot that is totally off the wall and fresh and unpredictable. A revenge epic that tops or equals Kill Bill. Four stars out of four for director Chan-wook Park's masterpiece!"

"Quicksand","10","11","98","23 April 2005"," ""The Definition of Wisdom is that You Can Still Be Shocked""
","I'm not really interested in hearing from the people attacking this movie, because it's readily apparent from their comments that they didn't even watch it after the first couple of minutes-- like one who listens to a song without actually hearing it. This is one of two movies I've ever seen people walk out of during a particularly graphic scene-- this is different from someone walking out of a movie because it's out-and-out bad. In a terrible film, people just give up and walk out at any random point (which I've done, too). Something is effective and effectual if you walk out not just because something graphic is happening on screen, but because you emotionally connect with it, and it rattles you. Violence on film, without context, isn't rattling-- it's boring.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" will rattle you, and I'm sure there's no shortage of reactionary folk who will call it disgusting, offensive, horrid, blah blah blah. Maybe they're right, but it doesn't make this a bad film. You can't look away.<br/><br/>Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped in the film's opening moments, and then held in what looks to be a hotel room (with fortified door and fake window) for fifteen years. This is a 21st Century noir folks, bad things happen. If you're expecting the mainstream violence of a Denzel Washington or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, stay home. If you're not emotionally involved with this married man, father of a daughter, in the first few minutes, the movie is not for you. It's hard, it's harsh, and though the graphic violence (read: blood) is subdued to keep it in R-territory, it's the psychological power that will grab you by the throat. It's the psychological terror that makes ""The Ring"" (minus the otherworldly) terrifying, and made ""The Blair Witch Project"" so deeply unsettling. Again, if you disagree that those movies were scary, you won't like ""Oldboy."" I can think of no other way to define it.<br/><br/>These are psychologically, emotionally, physically scarred characters. You will travel with them and experience every moment, see things you didn't want to see (not of the blood variety) and learn thing you don't want to learn. If you're ready to go along, then buy a ticket and step inside. If you're not so sure, then I'm sure Denzel Washington will have another movie coming along shortly. Whom I like, but we all know Denzel is going to be okay when the closing credits roll. 10/10, though your mileage may vary."

","This is the 1st Korean movie that I've ever seen, & I think it's excellent ( I already saw a lot of Japanese & Chinese movies ) . After that I saw Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, Painted Fire & A Tale Of Two Sisters. I found them all quite good but Oldboy remains my most favorite South Korean movie. Of course I read the review in the newspaper but by the time I sat down & watched Oldboy, I already forgot what it's all about so I was able to watch it without any preconceived notion. I find it fascinating that even though it's a crime drama, the movie offers a look into the South Korean society where people live with such passion. I know the story originates from Japanese materials but it does not really affect much the art of film-making."

There was literally a point in the movie, not to far from the reveal, where I thought 'please no, not that', and it certainly was.<br/><br/>But if you've stuck with the film up to this point, you have the stomach for it, because you've endured one of the most visceral films of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>Its a wonderful concept, a Man being locked up for 15 years, and has no idea why, or who has done this.

","Director: Park Chan Wook Duration: 120 minutes<br/><br/>Some films just do not allow themselves to fall into generalizations and these films pose conundrums when one tries to explain them. I've owned _Old Boy_ for a number of months now, but for some reason or another I had been able to make myself sit down and watch the film. For some reason I thought it was a horror film and being that I generally do not care for horror films I let this one sit on the sidelines while I watched other films. However, I was finally inspired to watch this film when my Korean office partner told me how much she enjoyed the film, been amazed by Choi Min Sik's acting, and how long the film stuck in her head after watching it. Trusting my friend's taste in film, last night I finally settled down to watch the film and similar to my reaction with other films that I had underestimated, I wondered: Why the heck had I had not watched this film earlier?<br/><br/>The film begins with a drunken Oh Daesu, Choi Min Sik, sitting in the police office. He is a noisy drunk heaping abuse on the police officers and constantly trying to urinate on the floor. He tells the police to let him go because it is his daughter' birthday, but when his pleas fall on death ears, he becomes even more recalcitrant to remain calm in the police office. Eventually Daesu's friend comes to pick up his inebriated friend. However, while talking to Daesu's daughter on the phone, the friend notices that Daesu is missing.<br/><br/>Daesu finds himself imprisoned in a room that resembles a cheap motel room. Fed a diet of dumplings and with a television as his only companion, Daesu will live for fifteen years inside of that small room. Occupying his time watching television, punching the walls, writing the names of all who might have had him imprisoned in that room, watching television, and carving a hole in the wall with a metal chopstick, Daesu grows older his youth withered away within that room. However, one day, he finds himself on top of a building finally free to hunt the individual who had imprisoned him. Daesu eventually makes a new friend in the personage of the young sushi chef Mido, Gang Hye Jeong, who for some reason seems to fall for Daesu as he consumes a live squid, who accompanies him on his search for the individual who ruined his life. <br/><br/>This is an extraordinary film. Choi Min Sik's acting is top notch and one can really feel his anger and frustration inside of his prison. I won't go into details here, but his performance during the final minutes of the film must be witnessed to be believed. The music is grand and the special effects are nicely done. The ant poking through Daesu's skin is creepy as hell."

","Why is everyone ignoring the most obvious this film is strange to most people? Why do we all feel ill at ease with this foreign movie? Well exactly because of that. Because it is a foreign movie made in a cultural mindset that is alien to most of the world. It is a Korean movie made by a Korean director for a Korean public. As as such, much is lost in translation. incest between brother and sister, between a father and his daughter are the subject and are not only consumed on screen they are in a way condoned by the director who views them as to love stories that deserve to be let to blossom. The plot holes and inconsistencies that defy common sense are too many to even bother listing and my in themselves be enough to make the movie risible but you also have to add to them the numerous sadistic as well as masochistic scenes that leave you with a sense general malaise. Not a single character in this movie has an interesting arc or motivations that make sense and the revenge plot quickly appears to be a weak pretext. Although well photographed and scored, this movie is disgusting and evil at its core and one feels dirty after watching it. Don't let anyone fool you with a supposedly artistic nihilist approach. This movie is simple the brain child of a disturbed man with access to a camera and unlike true artists there is nothing poetic about his vision, only the sad twisted spectacle of a disturbed mind."

","Vengeance - whether it be cold, calculating and entirely unnecessary or passionate, angry and ultimately fruitless - is depicted as an all-encompassing, life-ruining reflection of one's own inner emotions in this disturbing South Korean revenge thriller that pulls no punches and is vehement in its core ideology that when seeking retribution, you must first dig two graves. No-one escapes unscathed in 'Oldboy (2003)' and the so-called 'crimes' for which penance is being sought are so petty that when they're revealed you realise that the villain's motivations were actually to simply avoid placing the guilt upon himself (the only reasonable party). When the film reaches its heart-breaking, tragic finale it will leave you as devastated as the protagonist, before it all ends on one of the most deceivingly dark notes of the last few years. Yet, besides the fantastically well thought-out plot that's told with some brilliantly intelligent writing, the feature also relies on it's stand-out powerhouse performances and unflinching violence that, while certainly not as graphic as its reputation would have you believe, serves the dark and uncompromising story well.

Still, the movie would not be even half of what it is without those scenes.

"CinematicInceptions","8","1","3","18 October 2017"," Revenge movie done right.
","If you want to give an audience emotional access to your characters, take a lesson from this movie. Oh Dae-Su is probably one of the most pitiable characters in all of cinema, but no less cool for it. We see him go through first physical, then mental, then emotional suffering while also seeing some of the small joys and successes that come along the way. I wouldn't say he's a terribly complex character, but he is a human character with a lot of layers that people can relate to. <br/><br/>I liked the theme of him having to pay for the sins of his past especially because it strengthened his relationship with the villain Lee Woo-Jin. Both of them are playing the revenge game with each other, which puts them on level ground. The difference between them is that Lee Woo-Jin knows all the facts and is deliberately going after Oh Dae-Su. Lee Woo-Jin's rationale for why Oh Dae-Su deserved such harsh punishment seemed extreme and unfair to me, but I could see that he believed in it on a level of principal not just emotion. It definitely made for a better conflict between the two of them, particularly in the climatic scene.<br/><br/>To say that I enjoyed watching it might not be true, but there is no doubt that I was more engaged with this movie than the vast majority of movies I've seen. The action and graphic scenes in this movie was so much more personal than in most action movies. I don't react when I see someone on screen get shot unless it's a shocking moment. I'm sure getting shot hurts, but when I saw the bugs crawling through Oh Dae-Su's skin and when he cut out his own tongue, I physically cringed. Similarly, the reveal at the end that Mi-do is Oh Dae-Su's daughter is more shocking than a lot of twist endings because we as the audience are revolted by the fact just like Oh Dae-Su is. Not as intensely for sure, but it's still shocking and powerful, particularly because of the visual means by which it is shown.<br/><br/>In addition to being an emotional and interesting film, Oldboy also has some cool cinematic touches to it. The visual style is striking and distinct, which makes the movie more engaging to watch. The action sequences are fantastic because Oh Dae-Su is by no means invincible, which makes it all the more fun to see him defeat his many adversaries. Sure, watching Jason Bourne type heroes take out a bunch of soldiers or whatever is fun in its own way, but it's so much more interesting when there are real stakes like there are in this movie. Additionally, we get some pretty good voice-overs from our protagonist. My favorite voice over line was, ""Can ten years' worth of imaginary training be put to use? Apparently it can.""<br/><br/>This is definitely a gritty and violent movie that will make you cringe physically and mentally at multiple points. I personally like movies like that, but I know some people don't so be warned. One could argue that it's a standard revenge tale, which may be true, but it at least brings the revenge tale near to its fullest potential. It's nothing that holds any deep lessons, though it does have some deep lines. I wouldn't say that it's a must see, but it's definitely worth seeing if your a fan of movies in general. Overall Rating: 8.2/10"
"gamitech","7","1","3","6 September 2017"," Was there really a plot twist ?
","People tend to find me as a contrarian, but I think I am would be more of a rationalist. Oldboy has a nice ""one liner"" story line, but in my opinion, does not deliver in its most climactic point, at least as I have expected it to. The movie starts out with our main protagonist Dae-su, drunk in a police station on way home to his daughter's birthday. He never makes it home, because he gets kidnapped mysteriously and puts into a hotel- like prison for 15 years. At first I really liked this idea and where it was going. It was sort of Kafkaesque and abstract. I like to a certain extent surrealism in a movie, and I consider David Lynch one of the best at doing this. It never seems exaggerated, and the blend mystery with lust and sometime horror seems just right, all of it happening in our mind, because we are wired to think in patterns and in the dogma of society. Oldboy was somewhat trying to mimic this surreal motive, but in my opinion in an exaggerated, in your face kind of way. There are scenes in the movie that you get the symbolical aspect of it, but in a too direct way. I am not talking about the violence, I am OK with that, but rather the delivery itself of the symbolism itself is done with a shovel, in this case with a hammer. There is no subtleness about it. That is how it felt for me at least. Dae-su is an ordinary middle aged man, average in its all aspects. There is nothing special about him. But as soon as he is released from the ""prison"", he morphs into what other would call a bad ass, professional ass kicker. He is an Asian version of Neo from Matrix. I struggled a bit with this, as for the profoundness of the movie this seemed irrelevant. Before he is released from the prison he is hypnotized, but he seems to not remember it ever happened. Oldboy is one of those movies where the producer make a lot of cuts in the scenes. I am guessing this is one of the ways to intensify the agony and desperation the protagonist of the story endures. Again, here, the amount of cuts are simply too many in certain scenes. These are again a kind of exaggeration, a shoveling of ""hey this means feelings"" kind of message that really for me builds up, reaches a climax and the simply collapses due to overfilling. The story nevertheless continues with our protagonist trying to seek revenge on whoever has done this to him. He soon finds out WHO that is, but he wants to find out WHY was he punished. On his journey on finding the truth he falls in love with a young woman he finds in a restaurant. They make, love, they fight, they have trust issues and they grow together through the movie in search for the truth. One of the truths is that Woo-jin Lee, his capturer, was one of his high school colleagues. Dae-su also has a flash back where he sees Woo-jin Lee having incestuous relations with his own sister. Having seen this Dae-su spreads the news, like any other high school student would presumably do, and if I were him I would have also called the police. In the movie present this incest is presented from a very transcendental and profound point of view, where at the end of the day, blankly put, Woo-jin had sex with this sister. When his sister found out that people might know about this, she committed suicide. In the final scenes of the movie Dae-su, goes to confront Woo-jin in his penthouse where he also finds out the truth about why he was captured, that being, that he was hypnotized to fall in love with his own daughter as well. I cannot say I did not expect this, since the beginning of the movie was all about his daughter and then Woo-jin having sex with his' almost gave it away altogether for me. What I really don't get, is again, the over exaggerations in the last scene and more than this illogical actions of both protagonists After finding out the truth, Dae-su cuts his tongue and begs Woo-jin to not let his daughter know about this, and he licks his shoes, instead of wanting to destroy Woo-jin even more for the abuse he did on him. After this, Woo-jin leaves the room, has a short flash back with his sister's suicide and then kills himself. I am not really sure why he felt that he had to do that now, as he himself talk about revenge, but he did not convince me that revenge was his thing. I was more inclined to think that he was an incestuous psychopath. His suicide makes little logical sense to me The movie ends, though, in my opinion with a very nice twist. All throughout the movie Dae-su hears and is driven by this quote: ""laugh and the world laughs with you weep and you weep alone"". There are moments in the film where he does just this, but his laugh is not real, but rather a cringy grin that was supposed to replace, what would naturally be a weep. In the end, Dae-su goes on to ask the hypnotist to erase his memory so he would not remember what he has done with his daughter. He is outside, in the snow, when his daughter finds him and runs towards him and embraces him. She says she loves him. The movie ends with Dae-su, looking bleak in the distance and slowly starting his cringy grin. This end is interesting because you are left in a suspenseful where you don't really know if his memory was indeed erased and he does not remember what he did with his daughter or he is just grinning as he would usually do throughout the movie. 7/10"

"ati-szlado","10","1","3","19 June 2017"," The film I want to forget...
","...so I can enjoy it again as well. This film is so remarkable. I remember, watching long lists about great thrillers. And Oldboy always marked it's place on those lists. Why? I mean, it is a South- Korean film, with no famous actor, or a director. ( I live in Hungary, Europe, and mainly all we get is western media, which I do not intend to rate right now). So there's this film, I never heard about. Ever. One day in work, we were talking about a topic that does appear in the film (won't spoil it), and a friend of mine asked me some time later, if I have seen Oldboy? I said no, because, why would I have seen it? No one mentioned it, earlier. He did insist me to watch it. I wasn't sure why he mentioned it until (Spoiler) part of the film happened. It was neutral to me, at the beginning. A Korean man locked up in a room for 15 years, without any knowledge why he has been imprisoned. Interesting idea, with quite funny monologues (Hungarian dubbed). He swore revenge on the person, who did this to him. He gets out, eventually, and planning to have his redemption. Gets to meet with a nice girl, who helps him. Also, gets Intel/offer/order from his kidnapper... Now that is fascinating for me. It's images, references for history and myths, the monologues, and the revelation at the end... Wow. THE FILM I WILL NEVER FORGET, unfortunately. Because it made a deep mark on me, and the way I watch films. It is not for everybody, because I'm afraid, not everyone can understand it. I hope for the best. If anyone asks me about a great film, what do you think what do I suggest?"

"tankace","9","1","3","22 December 2016"," De-Sou I pity you!!
","Oldboy (not the 2013 ,the original) is striking example of an cult action film and even now, it is praised for its acting, action scenes and story which has one of the most shocking plot twist in film history. So it is time to cut my teeth to this little gem.<br/><br/>In short the story follows De-Sou ,a worker who in 1988 is kidnapped and he is held for 15 years and after wards he is released and now he tries to find out who held him and secondary after why for his antagonist Lee Woo-Jin (great villain) forces him in order to finish his ""game"" with him. At the same he befriends a young chief Mi-do ,with who they get on with on the bed (---) if you have seen the film you know what is coming. Also we see some of the most intense and brutal action scenes in history, especially the hallway , wow my it was brutally awesome.<br/><br/>AND now the plot twist, if you don't know it skip this paragraph. <br/><br/>Lee reveals that he hypnotize De-Sou and his daughter ,who is actually Mi-Do ,in order for them to get close ,so he knows how feels like when you lose someone close ,as Leee was so close with his sister,when he and De-Sou were classmates in school. That practically breaks De-Sou and makes Lee the winner of this sick ""game"" , so De-Sou cuts his tongue as a show to Lee in order to keep that secret ,between the two. After that Lee, commits suicide because he realized that his revenge can't bring his sister back from the dead. In the end De-Sou ""ask"" the doctor how messed with his head to erase his memory as for him to live in peace with Mi-do. As if this last hypnotism worked it is up to you.<br/><br/>All in all Oldboy is neat, brutal ,awesome and traumatic neo-noir and it is recommended for crime-seekers everywhere. But if you are unable to deal with violence, that kind of mystery and plot twists ,it is better to pass this one. BUT don't what the Spike Lee remake for it is awful and boring as hell."
"Prismark10","6","1","3","23 December 2015"," A family thing
","Oddly having seen the Spike Lee Americanized remake first, I preferred the critically lambasted Oldboy slightly more than the Korean original. Talk about going out on a limb.<br/><br/>Oh Dea-Su goes out drinking on his daughter's birthday and finds himself imprisoned in a room for 15 years. He is also suspected of killing his wife. He has no idea who has captured him and for what reason.<br/><br/>15 years on he is released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. Oh Dae-Su sees this as a chance of getting revenge, he has kept himself in shape while he was locked up and goes out looking for answers, he also falls in love with a young woman along the way.<br/><br/>The film is a Gothic revenge tale with graphic violence and a nod to The Count of Monte Cristo and Oedipus Rex.<br/><br/>It seems that Oh Dea-Su's nemesis has set up a complex and contrived form of revenge that spans years. Like Oh Dea-Su you yearn for the answers and you root for him as he beats up all-comers some literally to a pulp.<br/><br/>However I found the ending to be messy and unnecessarily graphic and gruesome. The remake had an elegant ending which was more palatable. Also I found the lead actor hard to take as a bad ass.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin in the remake I could buy as the rowdy student in his youth or the drunken boor as a young man. When he is released I can see him being grungy and violent as he hunts down the people who locked him up.<br/><br/>Still Oldboy was critically lauded and regarded as a masterpiece of modern South Korean cinema and is worth a watch."
"ajs-10","8","1","3","7 August 2010"," Excellent thriller with a twist...
","This is a South Korean film, yes, one of those with subtitles I'm afraid. I had heard very little about it before viewing, apart from a small synopsis, which didn't even mention it was in Korean! The setting in modern South Korea where a man has been arrested for being drunk.<br/><br/>We begin in the police station where a very drunk man, Oh Dae-su is behaving quite badly. So bad, in fact that the police end up chaining him to the wall. Eventually his brother arrives to bail him out and we next see them in the rain at a phone box. Oh Dae-su is on the phone to his daughter, whose birthday it is, and he is telling her about the present he has bought for her. He passes the phone to his brother who talks for a moment and then turns to find Dae-su gone. We next see him in a room with a heavy, prison style metal door with a slot to pass food through at the bottom. He hears music and then gas is pumped into the room and he passes out. When he awakes, the room has been tidied and his hair has been cut. This continues for fifteen years, during which time he writes a journal where he lists all those he could have wronged in the past. When he is eventually released he makes his way to a sushi restaurant where he meets Mi-do, a girl with whom he falls in love despite the large difference in their ages. Dae-su now sets about finding out who locked him up for so long and, more importantly, why? And that is where I'll leave my short synopsis; don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>This is a really well made film with a great score by Seung-hyun Choi and Ji-soo Lee. There is some great imagery used throughout and, although used sparingly, the special effects were excellent also. A really great performance by Min-sik Choi as Dae-su Oh and honourable mentions also go to Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee and Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do.<br/><br/>Although I found this film a little long, I found it quite enjoyable to watch. As I've already said, the imagery used is very clever in places and the plot moves along at a nice pace. The story always keeps the audience guessing although I thought the pay-off at the end didn't have quite the dramatic impact it could have. Having said that, it's still well worth watching. Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.7/10"
"imagiking","8","1","3","27 July 2010"," Oldeuboi: Entirely Exquisite
","The second of Chan-wook Park's ""Vengeance Trilogy"", Oldeuboi appears to be the most revered and respected of the thematic triplets. Having absolutely loved the first, Boksuneun naui Geot, I was highly sceptical that this could possibly do any better.<br/><br/>Having been imprisoned inexplicably for fifteen years, Dae-su Oh finds himself released just as suddenly and mysteriously. Knowing nothing about where or why he was kept, he sets out on a quest for revenge, meeting along the way a sushi chef with whom he begins to fall in love.<br/><br/>One of the opening scenes, in which Dae-su stumbles drunkenly about a police station, provides us with nice humour: partly a way to lull us into a false sense of security; partly a way to make the darkness which follows tolerable. Like its predecessor, Oldeuboi is incredibly dark and gritty, both its themes and imagery constantly exploring the very depths of depravity and despair. The scenes of imprisonment are strange: while Dae-su's cage is neither bare nor uncomfortable, he himself becomes increasingly so, the scenes of graduating delusion and hallucinating building to an inevitable crescendo of tragedy. It is difficult to watch him spiral downwards, not least of all when he learns that he has been framed for the murder of his wife. Min-sik Choi's performance incorporates a flurry of perfectly timed and pitched emotions, cementing an incredibly real character within our minds and allowing him to evolve whilst all the while remembering his thirst for vengeance and the effect of his incarceration. Hye-jeong Kang grounds the film with a meek humility, her unassuming sushi chef the only element of sanity in Dae-su's insane world. The narrative effectively keeps us guessing, the final turns in plot unforeseen and quite striking, adding to the facets a consistently excellent story, and one which invites thought in a genuine manner. Worth noting is the corridor sequence relatively early in the film, a superb technical achievement and one of the film's crowning glories. A true spectacle which presents action in a unique way, bringing a brilliance to what might have been a mundane scene.<br/><br/>An entirely exquisite follow-up to the first of the trilogy, Oldeuboi succeeds under the magnificence of Park's direction. Ensuring the further remarkableness of this astounding offering, it leaves all demanding to see part three. For me, it falls just short of the level of excellence achieved by its forebear. An amazing film in any case, it is yet another example of the prowess of South Korean cinema."

"honorhorror","8","1","3","1 August 2009"," Superior exploration about sins in a surreal context.
","First off, the entire movie won't happen in reality, as it was invented in the Japanese manga form and adapted into this hyped movie, probably the most hyped Korean movie ever. <br/><br/>Those good qualities were already mentioned too many times by other reviews so I'd save mine in terms of technology, film-noir approach and creativity in action scenes. Those were all very much the sample of movie making. However, the real gem of this movie lies elsewhere. <br/><br/>The movie is seemingly the protagonist's revenge story, who was imprisoned for 15 years and was framed for murdering his own wife when he was in the prison. Experiencing illusions, desperation, suicides and many obstacles, Dae-su was finally released from the stinking private prison. Just like destiny, he came to a sushi shop where a mysterious girl developed an affection for him. Later, the girl took the fainted dae-su home and treated him.With the girl's help, Dae-su began his road of revenge in searching for the enemy. The problem was, Dae-su's early life was full of bloody debts, so where to start?<br/><br/>The story, executed in a way full of details and colors, which reflect the many characters' mind and memory, their desperation and loneliness. It doesn't deal with social problem directly. In fact, the social context in this movie is entirely emittable, which had very little to do with the story. Only in the beginning of the plot we see Dae-su in the police station pissing off every police officers. Later in the movie, no matter how many people Dae-su defeated, or how many died in the carnage, no law was forced on the responsibilities. Even Dae-su's imprisonment was not directly related to some social problem, but related to purely refined 'Sin' described in the movie. The movie is seemingly trying to rationalize or legalize Dae-su's bloody personal war against the one archenemies, but implying again and again that Dae-su was keep missing things that matter. In many places, Dae-su had the choice to escape with his newly-found lover, who's maybe 28 years his junior, but his mind was so obsessed with revenge. After he found out about the truth of his imprisonment and all the revenging plan, the morality came out only as an ultimate punishment which turned the situation upside down. Dae-su's exploration of sins didn't end with the fact that his new ""lover"" is actually his reconciled daughter after all the 15 years. Lately, without the archenemies, Dae-su asked the hypnotist to modify his memory so he wouldn't know about his daughter and his misdeeds. However, he couldn't forget anything yet he had to accept the daughter who already took him as a lover. <br/><br/>So we can summarize the flow chart of the sin in the movie.Sin 1 is Woo-jin's sex with his own sister. The 2nd sin committed that is significant is Dae-su's rumor about Woo-jin and his sister messing with each other. Later, this sin grew stronger when everyone talks about it. It finally triggered woo-jin's sister committing suicide because the rumors gave her a fake-pregnant symptom. Woo jin committed the 3rd sin by letting sister fall off the cliff. Revenge 1 is a direct reaction to sin 2, which imprisoned Dae-su and killed his wife; but when Dae-su came out of prison, he immediately revenge(revenge 2) and in which process, committed sin 4 which is having sex with his own daughter. But since he has to finish revenge 2, revenge 1 and 2 reconciled him and Woo-jin, giving him the truth about his daughter, which completed Revenge 1, which in return made Revenge 2 meaningless. Woo-jin finally committed suicide(sin 4) which is the direct effort of sin 3. Although Dae-su survived, he didn't have hope to be forgiven(or forgiving himself) and tried to forget the past(sin 4) but failed. Therefore, he had to live along with sin 4 and let the daughter bear sin 4 as well, surviving the cruel world......So, it's quite clear that the original sinner and the final sinner were both Dae-su, punished by his sins until his death. <br/><br/>Nowadays, very few movies have such concentration and explosion in each scene to awe the audiences, yet completely ignoring the social context and the legal system. The Old Boy did this and told a top-notch revenge story that is as dramatic and Sweeny Todd, yet stylish enough like Devil May Cry. It definitely gave me some lessons in making movies."
"monolith94","7","6","46","25 August 2005"," Sophocles did it earlier, and better.
","There seems to be a great deal of backlash to this film, mostly resting on its supposed technical ineptness. I've heard poor acting - not true. Plot holes? Not particularly, if you take the film on its own terms as a world where hypnotism can actually do such things. Too much violence and gore? I've seen gorier and more disturbing films which did not produce quite the distaste and bitterness in my mouth that Oldboy managed.<br/><br/>No, I suggest that in order to understand this movie, you have to understand some fundamentals of drama, and in order to understand why it feels so emotionally unrewarding one has to turn to Aristotle's poetics. Start with books ten and eleven, if you want to get right to the meat (but you'll be doing yourself a disservice). It details the dynamics of reversal and recognition, both of which almost overwhelm the ending.<br/><br/>The film follows much of Aristotle's demands for making tragedy excite pity and fear. We have the ""man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty"" and as said before recognition. And yet, while watching the film I felt little pity and no fear. Well, the teeth-torture had me cringing, but that's a shock-horror trope which cannot help but have that effect. I think because the film may actually be to wrapped up in theory, caught up in so much crude narrative mechanics that the motivations of the characters are not properly fleshed out. This is a very fatalistic universe which Chan-wook Park has created. The director has embraced the modern shock aesthetic too firmly, and mostly abandoned the poetry which a tragedy requires. What poetry there is lies in some of the films cinematography, when it is not too caught up with spectacle and forcibly impressing the viewer.<br/><br/>This is technically a good film, but seems to me to lack grace. The ambiguous ending also seems half-baked. We understand that this character has gone from a good situation to a bad situation, but does the last-minute oddness make it slightly less bad? Perhaps the only way to deal with such a traumatic situation? What was the intent, exactly, to have the relationship between Oldboy and his lover to continue as it does? I don't think that this is a polemic in favor of decriminalizing incest - I suspect that the director just thought it would be another cool way to mirror Oedipus Rex, where the father, blinded, walks off into the sunset with his daughter, to wander the world.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the next film will be more Sappho-influenced. For a better, more tender example of modern reversal and recognition, look no further than eternal sunshine of the spotless mind."

Most films we see do not become instant classics, even if they're great. This film has beautiful women, flash, amazing cinematography, and great dialogue. The violence is also elegant and artistic.

"MichaelMargetis","8","9","79","23 December 2005"," ""Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live? "" - Oh Dae Su
","It's rare that I see a movie I'm so excited about, that I watch it again the day after I've first viewed it. 'Oldboy' is one of the rare movies, a hyper-active energetic gore-fest with Tarantino undertones from South Korean filmmaker Chan-Wook Park. The film surrounds a thirty-something year-old businessman Oh-Dae Su (Min-Sik Choi) who pretty much gets wasted every night after work. One night he is kidnapped by mysterious captors and help prisoner in a window-less room that looks like a hotel room. He has now inter-action with anyone for 15 years inside there, so he starts to make a list of all the people he's ticked off in the last decade or so. One day he wakes up in an extra-large suitcase on top of an apartment building roof. From there he goes on a mission to find his long-lost daughter and to find whoever did this to him and exact revenge (a.k.a. = he's going to kill their ass!) Along the way, he befriends and falls in love with a young female sushi chef, Mi-Do (Hye-jeong Kang) who helps him on his journey. The feature also stars Ji-Tae Yu, Dae-Han Ji, Dal-Sul Oh, Byeong-OK Kim, Seung-Shin Lee and Jin-Seo Yun. Chan-Wook Park's directing is stellar to say the least while the acting is top-notch 100%. Min-Sik Choi gives a riveting performance as our hero, while Hye-jeong Kang does alright with her role. Dae-Han Ji and Dal-Sul Oh provide much needed humor for this crime-mystery while Ji-Tae Yu creates one of the most effective villains in recent years. 'Oldboy' isn't a film for everyone and if you don't have the stomach for it make sure you avoid it. But, for those with the same flair and passion for great cinema as me, I would definitely encourage you to give it a whirl. 'Oldboy' has very few flaws and a lot to love about it. Grade: B+"

If you are grappling with the decision to rent this... here is all I can say: If you play a lot of Skateboarding video games and like Adam Sandler.... or if your idea of a good horror movie is ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"",... then you should probably skip this one.

","Wait! Hold down to your criticism. I am now commenting on this movie from an Asian's point of view! I watched a lot of Asian movies, and so this movie isn't as bad and twisted as other viewers commented in my opinions. The plot... I know it is kinda shaky and no-brainer at the end... but the main characters' sorrow and consequences of his doing fall at the right place with one another.<br/><br/>Some users comment that ""Internal Affair"" is another bad movie from Asia. Shut your mouth! Asian movies aren't just about konfu fighting and martial art. If you are hoping for some serious fighting and ridiculous moves, just go to your closest Blockbuster and rent a Jacky Chen movie, then practice those stupid moves with whomever you wanna fight with. This is not the genre of the movies you will enjoy.<br/><br/>Another point that I want to make is this movie is based on the plot of a comic book. Therefore, do not expect that the story plot will be 100% logical. If you ever watch the movie ""Sin City,"" then you will appreciate much more how the director has made this movie much more understandable for the viewers. You don't trust me?

"SJ_1","9","9","79","2 October 2005"," Magnificent, one of my favourite Asian films.
","Oldboy just blew me away. A month earlier I had seen Seven Samurai and Spirited Away, which are both great films, but Oldboy topped them both in my opinion. I can understand why a lot of people might not like this, but for me it was just everything a great film should be, a good plot, well paced, well acted and with a great soundtrack as well. It was a film which I watched again the day after I saw it for the first time, it had that impression on me.<br/><br/>The premise seemed intriguing, a man is kidnapped for what seems to be no reason and is locked away for 15 years. Then he's released and has to find out what the reason was for his kidnapping. When I saw this plot outline and that it was listed in the top 100 here in the IMDb, I was eager to check it out. In a sense, I got the wrong idea about it, I thought it would be very violent and gory like other Asian Extreme films, and I had heard many people criticising this film for just being out to shock with its violence. I don't really understand this, I winced when a close-up was shown of a person's tooth being pulled out, and it is a violent film, but from what I'd heard I was expecting a lot more violence and I don't see why people make such a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes in this film, an infamous one-take corridor fight is one of them, as the main character Dae-Su Oh takes on a bunch of guys with a hammer. I mentioned how the film is well-paced, and it is, Dae-Su is taken out of the blue, some time is given to showing the conditions he is locked up in, and then he's released, finding out small parts of information that eventually build to this awesome climax. Many climaxes feel rushed, but the two hour film makes sure the whole last half hour is taken up by its climax, meaning it rounds it all off well, and it's one of the best endings I've seen.<br/><br/>Every scene is acted well by Min-Sik Choi, who is good all the way through but really shows off his acting talents in the climax where he's just magnificent. However, Ji-tae Yu is often overlooked and he's also excellent in this, his character is a very 3-dimensional villain with different emotions. Ji-tae Yu is creepy when he needs to be creepy, but also allows us to feel sympathy for his character in places. The villain is really what makes this film work, he isn't just a 2D character thrown in to make it a bit more difficult for the hero, he's just as interesting and integral to the story as Dae-Su himself.<br/><br/>The score by Yeong-Wook Jo is also a crucial part of the film, for me it's one of the best of this decade so far. The music is always there, always fitting the mood of what is happening on screen, but it's in the last half hour when it becomes amazingly memorable. The music playing at the ending and over the credits is brilliant, and there's one scene in particular where the music combined with the scene is so memorable that it now sends shivers up my spine whenever I hear the music now.<br/><br/>I thought this film lived up to all the hype and I think it deserves its place in the IMDb's top 100, everything about it is above average. It's well made and very entertaining, make sure you see it before anybody spoils it for you."

","This is an excellent example of the modern psycho-thriller. The twists are more surprising and thoughtful than that of any Hollywood picture that has appeared in years. The cinematography is also amazing. It's a beautifully shot movie, which is a welcome surprise for the action genre. The plot is interesting, thought provoking, and fairly believable. There's no flying in the air or other supernatural elements. For the most part, it sticks to the real world for the action scenes.<br/><br/>Fans of Miike, Trier, and Raimi should thoroughly enjoy this film. It's twisted, humorous, unsettling, and if you're like me, you won't want to take your eyes off it."

","Old Boy Dae-Su Oh gets imprisoned for 15 years not knowing why, every so often music will play and gas will enter the room, knocking him out. Every time he awakens hair cut, shaved and the room have been cleaned. Upon his release he has 5 days to find out why in the first place and by whom his captors were.<br/><br/>This is the second film by Park in series of revenge films. After seeing this film, I am very eager to view Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the upcoming third installment. Park shows his talent in this film as he shows us a beautifully choreographed corridor fight scene, with no cuts. The camera simply pans back and forth through the action and the fights scenes aren't those one guy takes on ten with high flying action, it's real, it's grounded and he still takes on ten guys.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi gives one of the best performances I've seen in awhile and the bad guy, although not as dynamic as Choi, holds up well as well. The other supporting cast are able to portray real emotions and make the whole movie work and come all together in the performances. In the climax of the film, Choi gives not only a brilliant performance, but a weird one, that will have you either in tears of sorrow, or laughter. It's great seeing him try to adapt to the world, after being imprisoned for 15 years, like what he would do if he were to see a woman.<br/><br/>The film is violent, not in a killing way, because most of the deaths are taken place off-screen. The violence comes from torture scenes, you know, where a guy takes a hammer and takes out the guys teeth...ouch. There is a plot twist, and it is a big one. I was shocked and it stuck with me for ten or so minutes, the twist is controversial, which may put off a lot of American audiences, but I believe it makes the film what it is.<br/><br/>You feel sorrow for the main character, and even the bad guy, but can't really grasp this emotion until the climax of the film, a little late if you ask me, but the emotion that that scene brings out is in top form. It's a scene that goes down in history as disturbing, heart-wrenching, violent, suspenseful, funny, shocking...all in one.<br/><br/>So what can I say about this film, well, it's one to watch, maybe more then once, because it could be difficult for some to grasp at first, or even if you do, may be hard to actually ""believe"". Aside from that, this film is a treat for the eyes as one of the best revenge films to grace the screen."

","After being kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years, Oh Dae-Su is released from his tiny cell. Though he doesn't know why he was imprisoned in the first place, or released. Though this is his task. He has five days to find out who did this and why it happened, and seek his revenge.<br/><br/>This is a great romp through the revenge genre and for the violence. This does have intense violence, but its not all in your face. A lot does happen without you seeing it, but psychological violence is so much worse. I wont talk about any of the scenes as the impact wont have that kick to the face that it deals out.<br/><br/>The look and feel is real dark and gritty. Mostly using a bleak grey wash to up the disturbing atmosphere, there are shots of seedy wood grain, contrasting scenes and giving you a few moments to relax before your shot back into the dark side of this revenge tale.<br/><br/>Oldboy i found did feel like the movie Saw, but did it much better. Like Saw, person is taken and locked away and must learn what they have done to survive. Though there is Kill Bill thrown in here as well; revenge to be bestowed upon all who get in Oh Dae-Su's way. The music is also like 2001, a space odyssey. Contrasting ultra modern settings with classical music, mostly violins, creating a tight dark atmosphere.<br/><br/>Oldboy is violent, dark, thought provoking and somehow beautiful within and very disturbing tale."
"sixonties","9","9","79","27 August 2005"," It's not about revenge, it's about meaning and life
","There are movies that aim to entertain, and there are movies that attempt to say something. This movie aimed to do both, and succeeded admirably. Sure, upon reflection, various parts of the plot don't seem to follow from one another, and so many things in the movie are implausible. But does one want a movie that is as smooth and plausible as yesterday afternoon? Like it or not, human life is tortured and zigzags without warning. What matters is making sense of it afterwards in a way of one's choosing.<br/><br/>This movie is not really about revenge. It is about the human need for knowing things not just about oneself, but about other people. The protagonist could never have lived with himself without knowing why certain things happened to him. Our lives make no sense when the intentions of others are ignored.<br/><br/>Most touching in the movie was the woman's sacrifice for the protagonist and his for her. They were entirely dedicated to each other, and showed that one being willing to do anything to make another happy alone induces happiness.<br/><br/>Thus, the movie invites the viewer to contemplate his need not only for narrative meaning in his life, but also for the intersubjective quality of that meaning."

This would be unfortunate, as it's a good movie with a silent build up to an amazing ending. It's one gritty, dark, and lurid revenge flick worth watching if for nothing else but the, ""GaaoooOOOO!"" inducing ending.<br/><br/>Minor Plot Details: The basic idea of it is that a man is inexplicably imprisoned in reasonably comfortable quarters of a private prison, with TV as his only companion, and fried dumplings his only meal. After 15 years he unexpectedly wakes up one day on a grassy roof, freed. A relatively short time thereafter he is handed one cell phone and a wallet full of cash. From here things develop into a story of abject revenge and vengeance, with a conclusion that'll leave you realizing how well made this movie actually is. It's one hell of a revenge flick."
"Khrushchev","9","12","115","10 March 2005"," A great film in virtually every way.
","This is a great movie. The music is excellent, the acting is superb, and the plot is intelligent. The directing has artistic merit, and I would say it is as good as in movies like Requiem for a Dream and Amelie. However, the movie is more like Requiem for a Dream in its darkness and pacing (rising action to intense climax). It is a psychological thriller though, so in that respect is nothing like Requiem for a Dream (don't take the comparison too far). Anyways, the only complaint I can make about this movie is that there is one major fighting scene that is not very well done. In addition, there are some plot elements some people may not find believable enough for their tastes, but these people probably don't enjoy psychological thrillers in general. This movie is certainly not for young people or really conservative types. It is definitely for those people who like to watch mindf*ck type movies. Highly recommended. In fact, I would say this is the best movie I've seen all year, and this year I watched Requiem for a Dream, Hotel Rwanda, The Sea Inside and Brazil. Unfortunately, I simply cannot see the upcoming Hollywood remake doing it justice. Chan-wook Park (director) and Min-sik Choi (lead actor) are just so good that I think it is unlikely anyone in Hollywood will be found that matches their talent. The action scene will be improved in the Hollywood remake, though. Still, see it in Korean. It's almost guaranteed that the Hollywood version will be inferior."

Visual effects were pretty well done.<br/><br/>Very well acted and paced.<br/><br/>One gripe was the main character gets a bit overly melodramatic at times throughout the movie, but I think this is a form of Korean machismo, and I've definitely seen this type of Korean machismo firsthand. So I guess it's true to life.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the mathematical object -- the Mobius strip. Watch the movie and I think you'll understand what I mean.<br/><br/>I think one fight scene should have been reworked by the director to make it more believable (the one involving the hammer). <br/><br/>The last scene -- I didn't see it coming, but it fit the movie perfectly."

Anyone lucky enough to have read the Manga will not have been as shocked/revolted as many of us lucky/unlucky viewers!<br/><br/>Choi Min-Sik proved once again the level of his greatness, out doing all his previous work on such modern day classics as ""Happy End"" and ""Failan""... he is clearly in a league of his own, comparable only to that of Kong Sang-Ho!<br/><br/>The final plot twist is as much unexpected as it devastating, and has left different reactions to each person I have showed it to. My girlfriend just cover her face and whimpered ""Oh my God..."", while my cousin just sat there in silence with his eyes closed... all the way to my uncle who just let out a nervous chuckle. This movie is really one of a kind that will go down in history as the greatest revenge movie ever constructed, unless Chan Wook-Park can pull out something very really special for Sympathy for Mrs. Vengeance... which I doubt he will be able too, best of luck to him though as I'm sure he will not let us down."

","From the very start, this film won't leave you with a single dull moment; every actor convinces, every scene is there where it has to be, every character can at least claim something of our sympathy and antipathy, in short, it is the perfect Greek tragedy. By that, I mean for example that the main character is not only vulgar and blunt, but he's also funny and likable. His enemy seems to be cold and repulsive, but then even he turns out to have his own reasons for what he's doing. The end is more than shocking, without being cheap (don't tell anyone in advance). Colours, photography, direction, timing, it's all flawless, as far as I can judge. I was wondering whether I was drunk or something when I saw it in the cinema, because I was so impressed, but I wasn't! I would really like everyone to see it. For those who haven't seen any good Korean films yet and still think that because it's Korean, it can't be absolutely great, well, sorry guys, but I don't know if any western filmmaker could beat Old Boy in the next ten or so years!"

"cartmaneo2004","10","9","85","24 January 2006"," A Film that Shows Perpatratiors as Victims and Vice Versa
","Oldboy easily one of the three best movie I have seen in 2005. Although it was made two years earlier, this is when it made a theatrical run in my area and I'm glad I was able to even see it theatrically. Easily one of the best foreign films to come in sometime and could only have been made in a foreign land due to the themes and twists involved in the feature.<br/><br/>The plot is already listed so no need to go over that. As far as the film goes, it takes a fresh angle on revenge where those commit crimes are also victims and as the movie goes on both the protagonist and antagonist are developed so while we still root for the hero, we sympathize with the villain just enough to keep him a bad guy. It's use of violence in the rawest form gives it a realistic undertone and shows how consumed a man is by vengeance he doesn't stop with even a knife is his back. In one of many memorable scenes, the hero takes on a room of fifteen guys with nothing but a hammer and it plays out almost as real as it could get. <br/><br/>As for the twists, which I will speak little of, all there is to say is they are red herrings that are very hard to figure out but aren't just meant to make you go ""wow!"" There is meaning to it and is part of a the story's flow. It's hard to find movie that use that kind of tactic when surprising the audience anymore.<br/><br/>The performances are spot on and the direction uses style for substance and not once is a neat effect use just for looking cool, it all adds up to something. So overall, an awesome film to come out of the Asian market that isn't martial arts or an epic drama set in the past, but one that takes place in present time in the vicious city where good and bad people roam the streets just like USA and Europe. And the violence is almost poetic in getting it's point across. The director's revenge trilogy takes the age old formula of vengeance and puts it a new spin on it creating modern classics that should give anyone with an open mind a visual pleasure."

","So many people, so many visions. When I heard Oldboy was said to be one of the best movies of 2004, I was curious. It is always difficult for a movie that blasts some taboos into the theater's to hold on outside of them. Until half the movie I would give it a 7.5, but the final chapter of it makes the jigsaw complete and the it is a 8.5. Then I came to see here, and 8.5 it was as an average of about 8000 viewers. I think I saw around 100 movies, new and old, only this year. And matching old boy to only them, it is a great movie. A movie isn't only great in acting or writing, it is the total concept that takes u. (or not) It is a true vengeance story with, for me, slices of Seven, Kill Bill, other asiamania movies, big brother. An example of a vengeance movie: Abril Despedaçado (Behind the sun) has a 7.6 on 1000 hits and lots of people are going to find this a better movie, but it is a complete different atmosphere and u know what's coming and Oldboy takes u the hardest on the end and that's what people remember most."

","Let me start off by saying I have seen this movie more than 3 times in the last week. You might ask why. Why would anyone waste their time and watch the same movie 3 times in one week? The answer i leave you with, is because this movie is human.<br/><br/>In the first 5 minutes of the movie, the main character is kidnapped. From then on, i was completely sucked into the movie. Every action that the main character does is incredibly human. what i mean by that is, if you were him, you'd do the same thing as him. This isn't a crazy ""all the sudden, i become a hero"" kind of story that Hollywood gives you. This movie reaches down into every possible emotion that i can think of, and it does it very very well. I spent more time thinking about the movie than the 2 hours of absolute genius that it offers you.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is SUPERB. All of the actors are very well casted, and perform a superb job. I dare say that there are no bad actors in this whole movie. <br/><br/>Revenge is the theme of this movie. Some say revenge only brings more blood, but the acting had me convinced that the bad guys deserved everything the get. As i said earlier, the acting is amazing. I can't even start to describe it using words. I even thought that it was better than Kevin Spacey in The Usual Suspects, and on par with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left foot. The acting in the movie would EASILY be nominated for Oscars and probably win it too.<br/><br/>I am unable to run out of complements for this movie, because the movie was so well made. After watching over 300 movies in the last 3 years, I believe this movie deserves to be on the top 100 movies on this website.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this movie is 2 hours of pleasure that you wont regret."

It is so obvious that all the good comments of Oldboy get huge amount of negative votes. Please continue doing it because you only know how to vent your disagreement with a voting button. How SAD.<br/><br/>Did anyone said it was based on a true story? When Matrix came out, did everyone say America has Agent Smiths everywhere? When Slience of the Lambs came out, did everyone think America is full of pyschopaths that eat humans? This is just a movie. Come on! Just because the language is in Korean and the scenes are set in Korea doesn't mean all Koreans are sick people indulging in incest. How stupid can you get? This is a fictional story based on a Japanese comic book, made into a Korean movie! By the way, some of you find the main character eating live octopus sick and in bad taste. If you bothered to check the lifestyle of Koreans, you will know that eating live octopus is very NORMAL in their country.<br/><br/>For those people who bashed this movie non-stop. Sorry to lower your spirits but Hollywood is doing a remake of it because it is a well engineered movie with a good twist in the end.<br/><br/>There's some black humour in the movie but some people don't seem to appreciate it. I love the part when the hotel owner returned with a brand new set of golden teeth and gave Dae-su the dentist's name card. Told him the service was good and he should try it too. The part when Dae-su beat up some punks while smoking a cigarette, he concluded that 15 years of training was well applied. However when he tried to make love to Mido in the toilet, he found out his 15 years of training has failed him.<br/><br/>The ant Mido saw in the train was huge because her loneliness is bigger than Dae-su. In this movie, ants is compared to loneliness because ants live in a big family. At least Dae-su led his first half of his life as a happy guy, married and had a child. He was locked up when he is in his 30s. Maybe that is why his ants is much smaller. Mido grew up parentless and knowing her mother was murdered and his father missing could have been a big blow.<br/><br/>In the Oldboy: Ultimate Edition, one of the deleted scenes showed that Woo-jin visited the Hypnotist before the final confrontation with Dae-su. Woo-jin told the Hypnotist that Dae-su will come visit her a few years later and he instructed her to hynotise Dae-su to be a happy man.<br/><br/>In the ending of Oldboy, Dae-su indeed visited the Hypnotist. He begged her to erase his painful memory. The Hypnotist advised him that it may fail. The next scene we see Dae-su meeting his girlfriend (daughter). He hugged her and cried when she said 'I love you'. My personal opinion is that he is still the same monster with the painful memories. When the camera panned across the snow. We can only see Dae-su's footsteps walking away from the two chairs. What happened to the Hypnotist's footsteps? Well.. she was killed and hanged on a tree (watch again for her brown coat in the tree branches) because she failed to erase his memories and the monster inside him decided to finish her off. This explains why there is only one set of footprints.<br/><br/>'Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink alike.' The explanation of this phrase is that 'Be it you make love to your sister or your daughter, the weight of the sin is the same.' I hope I have made some people's confused mind clearer.<br/><br/>In the future, all movies will have cliché romantic wishy-washy happy endings because people refuse to accept unique movies like Oldboy, Kill Bill, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction.

","Oldboy tells the story about a man who seeks revenge on his wife's killer and the person who held him wrongly captive for 15 years. I am a big fan of revenge movies. What I really like about this movie is the storyline and mind bending ending. It's like the Punisher and Fight Club mixed together. I also like the production quality the movie has to offer. I thought the fighting sequences looked real and the lighting looked professional. The one thing that I didn't like is the whole ant thing in the beginning. What does that have to do with the movie? Does it symbolize something? <br/><br/>Despite the ant symbolization I thought the movie was excellent. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
"floatmyboat","8","7","63","27 October 2006"," Solid film-making and thrilling story-telling
","Oldboy tells the story of a man imprisoned for fifteen years for crimes unknown to him. Oh Dae-su has five days to find out who incarcerated him and why. Starting from the helplessness of a clueless man stuck in a cheap hotel room, Oldboy shows Oh Dae-su's growing schizophrenia over the duration of his jail-time culminating in ruthless vengeance in finding and eliminating his enemy. Gory and explicit at most times, Oldboy spares no effort in telling the story as naturally as possible.<br/><br/>Fans of the Chekhov's Gun school of thought (season three of Lost, woo hoo!) should find Oldboy squarely in their alley. Numerous clues are dropped throughout the movie, providing an interesting exercise for genre fans to sleuth around. The protagonist is just as blank about his predicament as the audience, and both of us start on his journey of revenge and retribution with a clean slate. The movie keeps you on the toes at all times with its carefully crafted suspense. The tension mounts slowly, but surely, as the different pieces of the puzzle gradually fall in place. Admittedly, I didn't consider Dae-su's crimes to be a big shocker. But at the end of the day, the film is more an exploration into social mores and adventurous film-making than just a stomach-churning twist ending.<br/><br/>So with all these kind words, why does the movie not get a perfect score? The violence in the movie, which is talked about much, does not seem as hard-hitting as it should have. Even the most gory scenes are easily digested. More effective violence rather than plain gore would have better suited the film. The editing could have done with some more work. At close to two hours, the movie does seem to stretch a little. And finally, it would have been really good had the kicker been more potent.<br/><br/>Oldboy is a well-told tale of schizophrenia, vengeance, and morality. A fairly simple tale of revenge is wound into a more complex tale of trickery, paranoia, and a bunch of twists. Recommended!"

","I've seen thousands of movies that supposedly ""shock"" and ""disgust"" the moviegoer, but Oldboy took this to a new level. Rather then using gore or gratuitous sex or violence to ""shock"" me this very intelligent thriller used an entirely different method. Needless to say this is a movie I will never forget as long as I live, and it represents something that not only kept me in rapt attention and thoroughly entertained, it opened up my eyes to the abilities of the human emotional spectrum and turned my stomach as to the depths of humanity. A movie I would recommend for everyone to see, just because of the time spent after it is finished reflecting upon ones self. People who do not like this movie do not understand it, and Oldboy deserves to be placed on a pedestal above any other movie attempting to serve up the same kind of action or drama. Ten stars, exceptional film, any faults are minor and covered by the charisma of the actors and brilliance of the cinematographer.

","I think the heaps of otherworldly praise this movie gets is going to skew it for the first-time watcher. It did for me. The movie did affect me. It was very gripping and well-done. The acting and direction were all really good. The plot is original and keeps you intrigued. But overall, I have to agree with what a lot of other naysayers on this board have said. 'Oldboy' really doesn't mean much. The whole revenge plot was just a really contrived, over-the-top, completely unrealistic idea hatched by a psychotic. I think one of the big problems is that the movie doesn't delve into the main perpetrator's character. I mean I know why he did it, but why is he so psychotic. What made him first want to sleep with his sister and then punish a man so brutally for her suicide, which he only indirectly caused. And why did he have so much money? He wouldn't have been able to pull off this job without heaps and heaps of money. It would have been nice to have that back story. That's only one of a couple plot holes here. Plus, there are a lot of elements in this movie that just don't make much sense...they are only in there for shock value. Such as the scene where the main protagonist eats a live octopus. What was the point? Then in the beginning there was the guy who was about to kill himself. The protagonist would not let him jump off the building until he told his story. Then he kills himself. What was the point of making the man suicidal? And what does the one line repeated over again mean: 'Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone."" It really doesn't have any relevance to a movie which is basically about a kooky revenge scheme concocted by perverted Bill Gates-like tycoon. Overall, this movie has great style, but is too violent and has no real thematic point."

","Lots has been said about this film. It is neither a classic nor a flop. When I heard the premise for this film I thought it would be great. It intrigued me and I wanted to know what had happened to this chararcter that led to him being locked away for 15 years and then released with some kind of mission. The film starts well and it looks nice. I don't mind the shaky camera work from time to time, that some reviewers seem upset about. Some people love those fight scenes, while I find them all a little childish, but it is a comic book film. There is a reasonable amount of violence, but nothing that would put me off the film. The soundtrack is decent. Unfortunately the film then simply fails to deliver. The plot becomes a little silly, which is a great shame because it could be brilliant. But it's not. Nor is it crap.

","I first had the privilege of viewing Oldboy at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2004. I knew nothing of the film and even less about the actors or the director prior to the screening, but I somehow ended up with tickets for the late night viewing. The local newspaper quoted the tagline, 15 years forced in a cell, only 5 days given to seek revenge, so I was expecting a violent indulgence (and let's get one thing clearÂ…Asian violence and Hollywood violence are two separate entities). What I wasn't expecting was a movie that would stick with me days later and end up as one of the best films of 2004.<br/><br/>Oldboy opens by introducing us to Oh Dae-Su as he gets wisped off the streets and is imprisoned in a holding cell for what will amount to 15 years. The cell has a bed, bathroom and television, but there are no windows. A steel door with only a small opening at the bottom so that food can be delivered is all that connects him to the outside world. Gas is emitted into the room periodically to subdue Dae-Su allowing a crew to provide medical attention where necessary or attend to any housekeeping agendas. Dae-Su's next decade and a half will consist of watching television and staying fit in hopes of an eventual release and identifying both his capture and the reason for his incarceration.<br/><br/>That day finally arrives when Dae-Su awakes in the middle of nowhere. The world around him is foreign and the movie takes just the right amount of time showing us how Dae-Su appreciates new smells, communications with others, cigarettes and even new swear words.<br/><br/>A cell phone found ringing in his jacket pushes the story to the next chapter. The voice on the other end of the line is that of his former captor that reveals that a game is about to be played and that Dae-Su's job is to figure out the who's and why's that reasons Dae-Su's captivity. Dae-Su seems numb to the voice but passes out soon afterwards only to awaken at the house of Mido, his waitress at the restaurant at the time of his collapse. Their relationship will take center stage as the two new acquaintances try to unravel the mystery man behind the wizards' curtain that seems to be pulling all the strings.<br/><br/>Revealing any further information about Oldboy might take away from the pleasure of letting the story unfold, so I'll stop here. But what I will tell you is that through Dae-Su's journey towards various reveals we are treated to memory etching scenes including the self mutilation of one's tongue and an absolutely invigorating scene involving Dae-Su's battle with an Asian gang down a narrow corridor armed only with a hammer and utter determination.<br/><br/>Oldboy has just enough of all the right elements to make a good film better. The mood, pacing, lighting and even the music punctuate through the screen to create an atmosphere of dread, sorrow and desperation. But what separates Oldboy from the pack is that it paints a picture of a character that thinks he can walk through the violent world of the Asian underground with reckless abandon on the notion that nothing can be done to him physically or emotionally that could compare to the hell of his 15-year imprisonment. But in the final act, director Chan-wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) turns the table on our protagonist and forces him into the realization that as a pawn in the sick and twisted game, he is not the cold and fearless seeker or truth, but rather a vulnerable and forever imprisoned character that pleads his own life in order to maintain a level of secrecy over the final revelation. The payoff is one that you just won't see coming no matter how seasoned a veteran you may be to films of this genre, and it incaptures everything that Hollywood films would steer clear of if originally presented the script in raw form. And the result was the Grand Prize of the Jury award at Cannes in 2004.<br/><br/>Bravo."

","Title: Oldboy (2004) <br/><br/>Director: Chan Wook Park <br/><br/>Cast: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang, Dae-han Ji <br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>A lot of good things have been said about this movie....and usually when a movie is hyped so much your are almost certainly headed for a disappointment because the movie you see doesn't live up to your high expectations. I'm am extremely happy to say that this was NOT the case with Oldboy. This movie surpassed my expectations in every way possible. And then went a little further.<br/><br/>The story is about a man called Oh Dae Su. One day, someone puts something in his drink he ends up in a police station acting all drunk. The police decide after a few minutes of seeing him act all drunk, to release him after all he is just a guy whos had one too many drinks. As he exits the police station he decides to phone his daughter from a pay phone...it is at that exact moment that he is kidnapped by an unseen enemy. When he wakes up he realizes that he is locked up in a room from which he cannot escape. A room in which he will be locked up inside off for the next 15 years. Who put in there? And for what reason? These are the questions that eat up Oh Dae Su as he spends the next 15 years in that room. With hatred and a very strong desire to quench the thirst for vengeance growing inside of him Oh Dae Su cant wait for the day in which he can escape too deliver revenge to whoever did this to him.<br/><br/>If you think I have revealed too much of the story with the previous paragraph, believe me, thats just the tip of the iceberg on this movie. I have to praise this movie right from the beginning because it really is something of a masterpiece. I know a lot of people (myself included I guess) use that word a little too often...but in this case this movie deserves it! Its a truly well crafted film with an incredible story to tell. From the get go, you are completely sucked in by the credibility of the performances which is one of the best things about this movie. The actor who plays Oh Dae Su (Min Sik Choi) he really out did himself in this film. Displaying incredible amounts of rage, love, hatred and desperation. This guy should get the oriental version of the Oscar if there is such a thing. For his performance is something truly remarkable. Oh Dae Su is a very very likable character, even though he is not perfect.<br/><br/>To director Chan Wook Parks credit, the movie has some really well orchestrated sequences that are a delight to watch. Just wait until you see Oh Dae Su fighting about 50 henchman down a very tight corridor....and all in one amazing take! I was left speechless and had to instantly rewind that sequence! The film has some really interesting shots and sequences that are very original and make the film all the more interesting too look at. The movie is filled with moments that instantly leave you in awe. Well, at least thats the effect it had on me.<br/><br/>Then of course, there's the violence which there's plenty off. There's that sequence with Dae su fighting the henchmen...there's teeth being pulled out, there's tongue that get cut out...man the movie is just really amazing from a violence stand point. There's not much gore per se...for it is almost always implied. But the situation itself is so tense, that you cant helped but cringe.<br/><br/>But the real star of the film (apart from Min Sik Chois performance) is the well crafted story. Its a constant mystery that we along with Oh Dae Su figure out one piece at a time. And by the time we get to the ending...well let me just say this is one of the most incredible endings story wise that I have ever seen. I felt like the first time I ever say Finchers Seven. My jaw just dropped. It truly is worth it to reach the ending of this film, its a true delight.<br/><br/>Anyhows, I'm not going to go on and on about this movie (though I could) because I don't want to reveal anything else. This movie is like caviar, you just want to enjoy every little piece of it and savor it with great delight. One thing is for certain, Oldboy went straight up to my top ten movies of all time. Its that good. Now go check it out! Rating: a very very strong 5 out of 5"

I won't bore you with a synopsis, but I grant you this... if you have recovered from the slew of utter garbage that Hollywood has belched out over the past half decade, and find yourself brave enough to return to the cinema, do yourself a big favour..... go see this movie! The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction is slathered with technical excellence, and the dedication to the craft of film-making has to be seen to be believed. I found myself wanting to see the story-boards...<br/><br/>Tired and cynical critics will probably compare OLDBOY to other films and attempt to tear it down, these same critics probably couldn't take a digital photo without screwing it up, so beware of Western critics of Asian films. Critics are like 'focus-groupies', and all they do is moan and gripe about that which they cannot understand or appreciate.<br/><br/>I am ecstatic about this movie, the plot twists and turns helter-skelter without the mindless regurgitation of films like SAW.

","I don't believe there's many headline type words which can be used about this movie, since they all seem to already have been used. The reason is simple: Oldboy is a movie you either hate or love, although considering the subject and theme of the movie, love probably ain't the right word to use. Still, the movie seem to part it's audience and it's understandably, but unfortunately, it also reflects on it's reviews. Oldboy is a tough movie to be objective about, since you almost have to take a stance about it's story, and the problem here is, that if you like the movie, it couldn't indicate that you can also relate to what the protagonist is doing', and of course the same goes, if you don't like the movie. So what is the protagonist doing' ? he's searching for truth. It's as simple as that, but the truth about what ? On the surface its the truth about who did him wrong, but underneath, it's the truth about human nature: How dark are the dark side of homo sapience, when the fire which fuels us, has been brought to a boiling point, where we find ourselves falling' from the edge towards the darkness ? And is it possible to stop the fall by uncover the truth, or will the truth just reflect another dark aspect of human beings: That sometimes, we are so blinded by our own self-righteousness that we can't c', that it is that same self-righteousness, which pushed us over the edge to begin with. Simplistically the love/hate aspect of Oldboy can be put into a question: Is it cool to tell a friend about something you have witnessed, if you know that what you have witnessed, probably wasn't something you should have seen ? Some will say yes, some will say no - same with Oldboy: Same love it, some hate it, and for that rare quality, Oldboy is worth watching."

","Set in Korea 15 years ago, Oh Daesu finds himself a captive in a hotel room that acts as a prison cell without knowing who his captor is or why he has been held. The movie follows Oh Daesu's emergence from his cell to find both himself and his captor of 15 years.<br/><br/>In short, old boy is a captivating revenge movie that doubles as a great, refreshing movie-going experience. While it is a polarizing film (i.e. Fight Club, Saw, movies that ppl HATE or LOVE), I guarantee most of you will like it. I came out of this one thinking, Man, I've never seen anything like this! While it may be heavily derivative of something else I don't know of, it feIt and looked highly original and well-imagined. There are some gory scenes, but nothing I would consider gratuitous within the context of a revenge thriller. Despite its considerable violence, it's not mindless and it's not cheap: the story is fantastic but the characters and their motivations are not unbelievable. The movie admirably attempts to enter the psyche of each of the pivotal characters, including one memorable scene with a large insect. This represents a great leap for Korean/world cinema, and the world would be a better place for brave cinema as this (not necessarily as violent, though).<br/><br/>I felt compelled to write this after reading the worst review of a movie I've read in my life. The fact that they are remaking it (as opposed to another remake of a 70's sitcom) prove that people enjoy and appreciate this story."

","Over the past few years, I've taken a bit of an interest in far Eastern cinema, an interest that began after I saw Battle Royale for the first time. Which is why when I saw Old Boy in my local Woolworths, I purchased this DVD hoping to see a great film.<br/><br/>The basic story is this - Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held against his will for fifteen years, his only contact with the outside world being television. Then, for some unexplained reason, he is released, given expensive clothes, a mobile phone, a large sum of cash. He is given one task by his unknown captor - to find out why he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>And what we have here is a perfectly crafted thriller. Made in South Korea in 2003 and directed by Chan-wook Park, upon first hearing the premise of this film you would be forgiven for thinking that this is little more than a revenge flick, but it's a lot more than that. It's a near two hour journey as Dae-Su, played perfectly Min-ski Choi, goes on a voyage of discovery, through a tangled web of mystery, intrigue and suspicion as he attempts to find out why he was imprisoned for all of those years.<br/><br/>Without giving too much of the plot away, Old Boy takes you on a tremendous journey, with plot twists that are well worth the wait. It's perfectly acted, perfectly directed, and well put together. I really can't speak too highly of this film. However, I get the feeling that as with other great foreign language films, Hollywood moguls will get their hands on this and screw around with it, so the story loses a lot of it's magic.<br/><br/>Foreign language films may not be to the liking of many, but I'm fast becoming a fan of them. Compared to a great deal of the hogwash that's coming out of Hollywood these days, the films that the Japanese and Koreans are producing are giving the big American studios a run for their money. Old Boy is a masterpiece, as simple as that."

OH-DAE SU was a great character to play for this actor, because he could show all his fears that he eventually has or had in the past of his real life. The plot was kind of offensive but that shackles the audience into their seats and gives them a weird feeling they never felt before. As strange as it sounds, I gave OLDBOY 9 stars, which is a lot I think. If you compare this movie with others you're not going to find a lot of movies that fit-- Oh, I would like to mention that there are rumors about a Hollywood-Remake with Nicholas Cage taking the main part.-"

","Let me start by saying this- Oldboy, while being quite difficult to watch in places, is not a stereotypical ""by-numbers"" thriller which the Hollywood audience seem to have grown accustomed to in recent years. I, for one, would not have guessed the ending in a million years. The explanation for a major event in the story I found o be very unrealistic and disappointing as a result, but I can assure you that this does not make the film any worse.<br/><br/>The plot. A man, Dae-su Oh, is locked away in a hotel room for fifteen years, with no explanation. The only company he has is a television, which really is his window to the outside world. On the news, one day after being locked up for a while, he finds his wife has been murdered. And guess who gets the blame? Dae-su Oh essentially becomes a fugitive, locked in a tiny hotel room.<br/><br/>After fifteen years of being locked up, he is released- with no explanation. However, he is given new clothes, a phone, and money. Diven by is desire for revenge, he embarks on a journey that truly makes you feel for this (as some may describe him in places) anti-hero. Eventually he comes face to face with the man responsible for getting him locked up. Dae-su Oh is given an ultimatum- he has three days to find out why he was locked up for all that time. If Dae-su Oh does not achieve this, his newly found love will be murdered.<br/><br/>Coming from the director of Sympathy For Mr Vengeance, this is truly piece of art.

Is love without reserve always a good thing?<br/><br/>The movie has some quite realistic (for East Asian cinema tastes) fight scenes in which the hero beats gangs of young assailants, in contrast with Chinese action movies or even some Hollywood action movies, the protagonist is badly beaten, dragged and humiliated until the point of self destruction.<br/><br/>But at the end he prevails.

","Oldboy made you ask ""why?"" Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) was imprisoned for 15 years. Why? We don't know. Neither does he. Upon his release, he seeks revenge, that is until he realizes that he needs to first find out why he was imprisoned for all those years. Choi's performance is fantastic. He forces you to want to know why as well. You connect with his suffering, you understand why he wants revenge but even more so, understand why he needs to know why. When he finally finds out, the film becomes disturbing and at first seemed like a weak climax. Upon putting the pieces together, however, I realized that each detail was accounted for. Every subtle aspect was relevant to the answer of the question. This is what made it a good movie. For the majority of the film, I became frustrated with the lack of answers I was being given. Much seemed to be leading nowhere and I feared that the creators got themselves in too deep and wouldn't be able to find a smart way out of it. Fortunately, the end was great. The disturbing aspect of it was off-putting; however, it tied in so well that I don't think it hurt the movie. The movie is very violent and even on occasion, hard to watch. This is part of what allows the audience to really get involved. You can understand the characters pain and anguish. This is always a good quality in a movie and is, along with a smart story, what makes this movie a good one."

","THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. MASSIVE, MOVIE RUINING SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>From the most recent reviews of this movie, it seems that quite a bit of people, instead of paying attention, chose to make a knee jerk reaction to praise they felt was unwarranted, but which was in actuality completely and totally warranted. I just watched Straw Dogs, a highly acclaimed revenge movie from the 70s, and I felt Oldboy was equally comparable in quality and just as strong in story and motivations behind plot elements.<br/><br/>For example, some have stated that Lee Woo-Jin didn't have enough motivation to want to destroy Oh Dae-Su's life. He did. Lee Woo-Jin lost his lover, his closest sibling, and what can only be assumed to be his closest-confidante, and all because of Oh Dae-Su's glib tongue. Oh Dae-Su realizes this at the end, which is why he removes his own tongue and why he supplicates himself to save Mi-do. He realizes that he was in the wrong in that instance, and his lack of discretion irreparably ruined the life of a classmate. Perhaps, due to your thoughts on incest, you believe his life was ruined justly. That is one way to see it, and one I agree with.<br/><br/>But even though Lee Woo-Jin was morally reprehensible and a disgusting individual, he would still have emotions and feelings, feelings which led him to treat Oh Dae-Su as he did. He didn't just want to hurt Oh Dae-Su, he wanted to ruin his life and leave him helpless while he ruined it.<br/><br/>Some have commented on the hypnosis factor of the movie as unrealistic. To that I say... so what? When you watch a movie, you suspend your disbelief. The best picture winner of last year, Million Dollar Baby, completely botched their treatment of intensive care patients and was extremely unrealistic. It was still highly lauded with praise by many movie goers. Movies many times get technical details wrong. If a movie where a man trains himself to be able to fight and then beats down about 20 people all by himself bothers you because the hypnosis factor was a bit unrealistic, then you have some extremely bizarre points of view.<br/><br/>Oldboy was a beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and carefully plotted movie. Plot holes? Almost none. For such a complex plot, that is quite an achievement. Was it hard to follow? A little... but then again, most people are incapable of following a movie that does not hand them the story in easily digestible bits, so that's not a problem, it is actually a plus.<br/><br/>Maybe some didn't find it had enough action. Maybe others were disturbed by the inclusion of incest. Maybe others just wanted to be different from professional critics. Whatever the case, Oldboy was a fantastic movie. One of the finest revenge movies ever created."

","Having heard good things from a friend of mine and noting it's current lofty position in the top 250 coupled with several interesting good and bad reviews, 'Oldboy' intrigued me both with it's premise and Korean origins. I subsequently obtained the newly released 2-disc special edition and settled in to watch, not entirely sure what to expect. In short I was blown away. Having only recently become acquainted with this wonderful site (iMDB) and having resolved to sharpen my cinematic knowledge and radar I couldn't have hoped for a better starting point. Striking visual content, strong performances and a wonderful score are to name but a few of the film's qualities. As I said, I was blown away. The central character is Oh-Dae Su, randomly and mysteriously abducted and incarcerated against his will for 15 years in a makeshift 'prison' resembling a dilapidated motel. The central theme of the picture transpires that it's not who is responsible for this, but why they did it to him and how he proceeds to uncover this with the 'help' of both his nemesis Lee Woo-Jin and new love, Mi-Do. As the story unravels and moves towards it's conclusion the film reveals itself to be a dark, twisted, enigmatic masterpiece. The colour scheme throughout the film renders it almost cartoonish in style: both vivid and dull greens, purples and reds form the common thread and each come to symbolise different things. This and also effective use of contrast and imagery (the film's opening shot is that of Dae-Su's clenched fist grasping the straining tie of a suicidal businessman) combine to at times mesmerising effect. Little touches, like the opening credits collapsing as if the hands of a clock to show that a pivotal aspect of the movie is the passage of time are scattered throughout the film, rendering it on a base level a visual feast of impressive proportions. I personally found the plot and it's twists refreshingly original. Unexpected, shocking and unlike anything i've encountered before. Certainly the final revelation in the penthouse as Lee Woo-Jin illustrates visually his shocking final revenge on Dae-Su, 15 years in the making, followed by Dae-Su's symbolic, self-inflicted penance took my breath away. This film provided a wonderful, startling insight into what world and particularly Asian cinema has to offer and that to me makes 'Oldboy' a seminal work and one that will linger on in the memory."

I'm simply a college student who enjoys movies. That being said, I have to say, I absolutely loved this movie. The story (which I won't go into because it's pretty much everywhere else) was well written and acted. Dae-su does in fact appear to be quite the afflicted protagonist. It was refreshing to see a character that the audience was supposed to sympathize with not exactly be of the highest (or even a normal) moral character.<br/><br/>The psychology of all the characters presented in the film seems dead on to me. Many a times during the movie I couldn't help but say ""if it weren't for my morals I would do the exact same thing."" Those who can't understand why certain characters do certain things need to stop observing and think ""if that had happened to me..."" As for the ending... maybe I just don't have the negative outlook on life that some others on the board have, but I found it very surprising. Not only that, but I went with my roommate and we're both in the Navy, we've seen some crazy stuff, yet we both were sickened by how twisted it was. It was so surprising that anyone could end a movie in such a messed up fashion.<br/><br/>Well, that's enough ranting for me; I just wanted to put my two cents in for what I felt was a fantastic movie."

If you come, however, hoping for a stylish, well-crafted and engaging movie with a plot that makes about as much sense as Death Wish, I Spit on Your Grave, Ransom, and yadda yadda yadda, you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>Yeah, (mild spoiler again) the villain of the piece does seem to exhibit an annoying degree of omnipotence with surveillance technology, and hypnotism is used as a magic deux-ex-machina cure-all for the movie's plot woes. But jeez, people, lighten up. It's a revenge flick. Hell, the protagonist even LOOKS like a Korean Charles Bronson. I don't know how these fierce critics managed to miss that. Maybe they were busy sewing new leather patches onto the elbows of their tweed jackets.<br/><br/>8/10. It's a movie that has a job to do, does it excellently well, and goes home afterwards without cluttering up the joint. Toffee-nosed academics, stay away. This one's for us guys that like movies."
"snncy2000","7","2","11","15 January 2008"," What can I say ?
","I'm always skeptic about eastern movies because I'm too used to American (I mean Hollywood of course) or European point of view, sense of humor and understanding that eastern thinking usually feels naive.<br/><br/>This movie is sum of all those = very good acting, good work of film making, nice scenes, quite decent story telling... Technically perfect.<br/><br/>But subject of it, things it tries to tell are not very clean or acceptable for average western movie goer.<br/><br/>I don't want to bring it to east-west debate/comparison here, I'm an eastern myself actually, but the thing is that the movie tells important things that are not important. It strives to make us believe something foolish, we accept it for sake of the movie and wait to see what will happen and nothing happens. Main concept, prison, all the plan and many things in the movie are unreal and non-logical.<br/><br/>There are thousands of men in the real life doing 15-20 years of imprisonment and when they go out they don't attack to first woman they see (some of them might do :).<br/><br/>Bad guy says ""I raised your daughter from the age of 3 to this age"", is this easy to buy for us? What kind of wacko plans this kind of ""revenge"", puts one in to very special prison (private prison ?? ), waits for 15 years ? <br/><br/>Bad guy wants to take the revenge, but obviously our guy didn't know that the girl was his daughter so this is not the same thing bad guy did with his sister, they knew everything. At this point what the movie suggests is not moral in any country or community I believe.<br/><br/>So, in general, movie keeps your attention, your don't just turn it off, wait but at the end it doesn't worth it unfortunately."

","When i had first finished with this film i wasn't sure what i felt about it. It was definitely not what I had expected, and i thought many parts of the film where either unbelievable or far-fetched. However, in retrospect I think that it was an enjoyable experience, and I think it is unfair to criticise it so harshly. I thought Min-sik Choi was excellent, finding him genuinely funny at times as well as disturbing in others, and nobody can seriously doubt his talent after seeing the excellent hallway fight scene. Although there were elements of the film I was unsure about it did keep me entertained, but don't expect too much from it!"

Maybe it is the little anecdotes that are displayed or the way the films unravel.<br/><br/>Anyhow Oldboy, i was intrigued by the movie to begin with after watching a trailer but...as i watched the film i found my self becoming more immersed inside it. The sheer determination and will of the main character to avenge who imprisoned for 15 years was really cool.

"lagriff05","9","3","21","16 June 2007"," Lives up to the legend
","(Written December 2006)<br/><br/>So this is the revered Korean film Oldboy, the legendary underground film everyone talks about. I've heard some really bad reviews of this one recently, as I looked into it at IMDb. Saying it was violent, sexual, etc, and that it was just a sex/gore flick and nothing else. It turns out that this movie is very violent and very sexual, and like most underrated movies like this one...it is very good despite its content.<br/><br/>The plot is very intriguing---a man, Oh Dae-su (who's name means ""Gets through the day""), kidnapped off the street and locked in a prison cell with a locked door and no windows for 15 years, and then finally released, given new clothes, a cell phone, and a wallet. His mission is to find out why he was imprisoned, and with newfound fighting skills gained in his 15 years of spare time, he plans to do exactly that. He meets a young woman named Mi-do, who is very attracted to him, and she ends up dragged into the twisted revenge plot. It all comes down to a shocking, violent conclusion.<br/><br/>I'd say this is about as good as all the good reviews make it seem. It's compelling, dark, twisted, and gory, carrying with it a strong lesson of what a lust for revenge will do to a man. Oh Dae-su was a sleazy, gossiping fool who let his mouth get the best of him, and it got him into a huge mess. He became a cold, bloodthirsty killing machine after 15 years in solitude, completely changed from the goofy young man he had been before. This is a film about revenge, showing us the consequences for lusting after 'justice' or 'revenge. A very brutal, stripped down view of human emotions. Oh Dae-su is driven by revenge, and as a result, ends up even worse off then he was inside his prison.<br/><br/>People always hate on movies like this for violence or sexual themes, two things of which this movie, Oldboy, has quite a lot of. They insist that said movie is a 'gorefest' or a 'porno' without really looking any deeper into it. This film has sex and violence, yes, but it incorporates those themes into the plot, instead of wrapping a thin plot around the sex or the fight scenes. The incest is a touchy subject, but it's used as a plot point, not for sick fetishes. If you judge the movie based on this then you're missing out. This movie does not glorify incest or the numerous acts of violence Oh Dae-su commits throughout the film's 2 hour duration. Oh Dae-su is a tormented character; this is especially seen in his line ""After my revenge---will I be able to be Oh Dae-su again?"" He's not evil and he's not enjoying the things he's doing---he wants to be his old self again! Not to mention the schizophrenic tendencies he gained in those 15 years alone. Oh Dae-su is not a hero, just a man who wants his peace of mind, and his revenge. You don't have to sympathize with him if you don't want to, that's not what the movie strives for. People who write this off as a gorefest or a sexfilm are not seeing the true essence of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is good all around, especially by Choi Min-sik, who played Oh Dae-su. Very emotive, very angry, and a very powerful and convincing actor. Marvellous. Kang Hye Jeong and Yu Ji-tae did very well as Mi-do and Lee Woo-jin respetively.<br/><br/>This movie is almost worth the price of admission for the great, driving, epic action scenes. That hallway scene...kickass...not to leave out the final, crushing fight between Dae-su and the silver haired bodyguard atop the tower. This isn't really an action movie, yet it has some pure action movies beat for real action. While far and between, the fight scenes here completely kill.<br/><br/>Now as to why I didn't give this great film a perfect 10. It's good, and the director is certainly amazing. But this movie could've been cut short...it runs on for a very long time and instead of plodding ahead at a slow pace, some scenes fly by you at rocket speed before you know what happened. It left me feeling very confused at some points. Namely the scene before Oh Dae-su enters the prisonhouse, after he left Mi-do behind at first...I had to rewind it to see what I had missed, but even that didn't help. Still a bit fuzzy. I find that the numerous amount of different scenes was a problem also, some of them lacked memorability. The ending, too---I couldn't help but feel let down at the reason why the whole revenge plot was enacted. It was...anti-climactic, to say the least...not a very powerful or cohesive ending to such an otherwise great film.<br/><br/>This movie is very good, despite any shortcomings, and I'll be checking out the director's other two movies very soon. Highly recommended to those who have strong stomachs and love a good mystery/thriller movie."
"Sherms_76","9","7","70","27 September 2006"," Oldboy!
","I found the plot in this film very interesting. The story line is extremely clever, being how they portrayed the protagonist actor in the film to be the villain. Making it look like he killed his wife. After 15 years of imprisonment he is released to a world he doesn't understand. I also found it interesting how he took so good care of him while he was imprisoned. Then after how he messes with him by having the homeless actor give him a wallet and cell phone. Then how he calls and torments him, and makes him think about what he has done in the past. Another thing I found interesting is how he attempted to find his kidnapper by going to restaurants and eating that food that he had to for fifteen years. So that he could find the taste of that same food, which would help him locate the kidnapper. The idea that the protagonist character tortures the villain in this story is a huge twist. I really did not expect this to happen in the film. Then the trap that was set for him in her apartment was also clever. Then how they bugged him, so that they could control his life, is insane but on the other hand awesome! Because of the fact that so much went into this idea. Then how they flashed back to the main characters life showing the reason why this all happened was so intense. This was just awesome! The overall direction in this film was awesome; this may have been the best film I have seen all day. I felt that the editing, sound, and storyline went along perfect together. Some of the camera movements in this film were incredible as well. I thought when the camera was spinning around the character when thought he was being attacked by ants was awesome. The reason for that was because it was showing him loosing it, as did the camera giving an extra effect, to the filming of the scene. On almost every scene you can see how well drawn out, and how much work has been put into it by the director. You can truly tell how much he cared for his work.<br/><br/>I also felt that the acting was great, it would have not been nearly as good if the actors in this film were different. They showed a lot of compassion for the way they acted in this film. In which made this film so much better.<br/><br/>The storyline of this film was incredible, a little far fetched at times but none the less incredible. So much had to go into each scene it's hard to believe. Every line was well drawn out for each character as well.<br/><br/>The lighting of the film was also interesting to say the least; the way it changes at times really puts you in the mood of the actors in the story.<br/><br/>The editing was also well done, you can really tell a good film when you see one because of the way that the film ran together. And that is what exactly happened in this film.<br/><br/>The production quality of this film was great, for how many different objects and scenes, and locations were filmed, and the lighting. This film was amazing, much of the reason goes to the director, but the production quality really made this film come together."
"noralee","8","9","98","31 March 2005"," Visually Exciting Update of ""The Count of Monte Cristo""
","""Oldboy"" is a visually exciting update of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" as played out in Korean gangster style.<br/><br/>It is a thrilling ride that dramatically visualizes the revenge theme, much as ""Memento"" dazzled the murder mystery genre. Not only does the script, co-written by the director, create realism out of fantasy like Dumas's story, but each scene tops the next with production design, cinematography, camera movement and striking imagination. This film makes the case for cinema as a separate art form from literature, even as various proverbs and sayings are repeated with increasing irony.<br/><br/>I had not read much about it in advance, other than Quentin Tarantino's understandable enthusiasm, so was alternately reviled by the cruelty and enchanted by balletic juxtapositions, such as what I gather is now considered the classic ""corridor scene"" that is like ""The Matrix"" meets ""A Night at the Opera."" <br/><br/>If the imagery wasn't captivating enough, Min-sik Choi is mesmerizing in a tour de force lead role that demands a ceaseless exploration of emotions from catatonia to hysteria to brutality to tenderness.<br/><br/>Not only do U.S. audiences miss what I'm sure are many keystone cultural references throughout the film, but key dialog is unfortunately exchanged when the subtitles are white-on-white, though I'm fairly sure I was able to infer the details sufficiently to follow the twists and turns of the plot, as for all the breathless film flam the core revelations become a bit predictable as they recall other infamous noir films even as they go way beyond Dumas.<br/><br/>I could definitely have done without the repeating violent scenes that seemed an unnecessary tribute to ""Marathon Man,"" unless this has some resonance for Korean attitudes about teeth.<br/><br/>The diverse music score is wonderful, both the original elements and the use of classical and other music."
"EVOL666","8","8","84","24 February 2006"," Stylish Tale Of Revenge...
","I've heard a lot of mixed things about OLDBOY - Some consider it a modern violent masterpiece, others say it's MTV-generation garbage. I personally enjoyed this one, but wouldn't rank it up there as a modern ""classic""...<br/><br/>OLDBOY tells the story of Oh-Daesu, a man who is kidnapped and kept confined for 15 years. He's given no explanation during his imprisonment, but is given food and a television to watch. After 15 years, he's released, and his captor gives him clues as to his identity and why he chose to kidnap him - and gives him 5 days to find the answers. Of course our ""hero"" is pretty irate, and begins his hunt for revenge. Along the way Oh-Daesu meets a young lady who accompanies and assists him on his quest. To say anymore about the plot or characters involved would give away some of the better ""twists"" of the film...<br/><br/>OLDBOY is a stylishly filmed take on an old subject - revenge. There are several (sometimes ludicrous) turns-of-plot that make this one a little more ""unique"" than your average revenge film. A lot of suspending of reality is going to be necessary to enjoy OLDBOY - but taken for what it is, it's an enjoyable film. The reason behind Oh-Daesu's imprisonment, and his subsequent handling of the information is strange and alarming. His relationship with his young female companion and how the situation is explained and eventually ""resolved"" also opens up some questions about Oh-Daesu's status as either a ""hero"" or very sick individual - but the end is ambiguous enough to interpret however you choose. OLDBOY is not as violent as many have made out (which was a disappointment in my book...) - with most of the more ""rough"" scenes being implied as opposed to actually shown. Anyone familiar with films like ICHI THE KILLER, BATTLE ROYALE, etc...won't see anything in this film that they haven't seen before. Definitely worth a look - 8/10"

"DonFishies","8","8","85","17 February 2006"," A total surprise...in a good way.
","A complete surprise for me.<br/><br/>I had heard lots of praise and acclaim for this film, and decided I needed to watch it. I had imagined a revengeful bloodbath in similar style to Kill Bill, but was pleasantly surprised to find very little bloodbath, but a whole lot of heart and storyline instead.<br/><br/>The idea of trapping someone in a cell for 15 years, and then letting them out, is quite original for its time, and its execution is just something to marvel. The cinematography and editing is fantastic, as is the entire visual scope of the film. The writing is superb, with many laughable moments coming to break the silence of the hugely dramatic moments. The much talked-about one-take fight scene in the hallway is something that will be remembered and ripped-off for years to come, as was the lobby scene in the first Matrix film.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent for everyone, especially the main character. His broken heart, and troubled mind lead to plenty of excellent sequences, as is his female co-star.<br/><br/>If I have anything bad to say, its that the movie goes on a bit long, and there should have been a bit more fleshed out of the past and why he was imprisoned without reason, just so the entire scope of the final act of the film doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks. Yes, it was probably meant to be like that, but there were more than a few scenes that could have been changed or replaced just to make the whole thing flow a touch better.<br/><br/>And just for the record, I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to pull off an American remake.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Draco_oshi","10","9","100","12 March 2005"," A great plot, maybe a little violent
","I saw this film and I liked it much. I found the plot just great, well devised and quite mysterious. The tangled plot makes the viewer feel confused about the story, because he can't guess what's going on for great part of the film. Furthermore there are some crucial objects, like the purple box, that enrich OLDBOY's mysterious atmosphere (it's not a case that some limited edition of the DVD were published in the ""purple box"").<br/><br/>Apart from the plot, I really appreciated its photography and camera work, I think it is really good, and it makes the movie convoy its meaning easier.<br/><br/>I just heard of a remake in future years, I hope it'll be as good as the original, even if I can't believe that there's a living actor who would make better than Choi Min Sik in the same movie.<br/><br/>Bad point: Too much explicit violence, even if some is needed, there are some useless violence scenes."

","Old Boy should be watched in a special time. That is not a film to be watched second time. I see some closer points with ""Requem For A Dream"". After viewed these films you can't find your two hour before energy. When you think happy end is coming, that is possible that you will be demonstrated. It is hard to believe or accept the end. End is the time which you are looking without thinking anything to the screen. At the end of this film if there is something bad, that is: you are crying. And the worse thing: you can not crying.<br/><br/>Old Boy's technical dimension is another reason to like this film. Every scene has an effective side. Especially past of Oh Desau at the high school is given wonderful and intelligent. It's certain that who is interested with cinema must see this film. For a cinema school student it's like course."

I really hate to give a movie this artsy and enjoyable such a low score, but a soon as you start talking about incest I lower the score, I just think its gross! However, in art everything can be said or done. Now when you SHOW incest on screen in a gratuitous sex scene, I draw a line, a BIG RED line. I am OK, but weirded out by sex in film (I'm not against it if it develops the plot), but when its incest, i just want it to stop. Oh ya, there are two incest scenes if you haven't seen the film. However it made the plot more interesting, so I would still give it at least and 8, but when you make the moral that its OK to have sex with your daughter, WHAT THE HECK!!!!!! IT IS NOT OK TO SLEEP WITH YOUR DAUGHTER!!!!! If the moral was don't do it, then it would be fine, but no, the ending was its OK to sleep with your daughter.

(for some reason, the gal in our row kept eating her popcorn during the more gruesome bits, but i needed both hands to cover my eyes for some scenes.) <br/><br/>why did this film blow us away? well, let's see. it was morbidly interesting. there was a mystery to be solved, like a puzzle. there were loads of unexpected things, even some surreal events. ooh, ooh! i know-- the score was beautiful, and the lauded cinematography was also worthy of its praise (even though it was filmed in a dark, overexposed gritty sort of way). all the Hollywood clichÃ©s in storytelling were mostly if not completely absent (i have to wonder if Korean natives found this movie to be ho-hum typical of eastern film-making-- prolly not, considering the awards it went for). so it was welcomely refreshing in that way.<br/><br/>the climax & ending offered some fine apres-theatre discussion, to try to piece together the events & what the meanings were. what is fun is that some of the mysteries can't be solved with a textbook answer, 'cos AFAIK the writer/director deliberately left in ambiguity. what was the glowing thing in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction? well, is that wholly important? it's whatever you thought it was... but you knew it was impressively valued. what does the final scene in Oldboy signify? well, you're in luck, viewer, b/c you aren't dictated to what to feel and how to interpret... like other types of art, you can interact with this film & come up with meaning yourself. but, you aren't cheated out of answers either.<br/><br/>can't wait to see this again! <br/><br/>P.S. if the threat about a remake is true & happening, my only hope is that it will inspire many other people to watch the original."

They indeed appear like detectives when they write such films...I mean make such films. OLDBOY is a classic South Korean action thriller which has been acclaimed all over the world. It changed the way world looked at the South Korean Cinema. This film is undoubtedly from the genius Park Chan-wook, who gave us the emotional action thriller SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE. This film has excellent action which is perhaps the most classic you've ever seen in a South Korean film.<br/><br/>Choi Min-sik is not just an actor, he's something lot more than that. Just watch the film and then you'll believe me. He's perhaps one of the most natural actor I've ever seen. This is his best performance till date. Kang Hye-Jung is excellent and has a great role which she plays effortlessly. Yoo Ji-tae is just brilliant: his best act is in the climax which you're bound to love.<br/><br/>The screenplay of the film is never disappointing at all. It never deviates from telling us one of the biggest tales of all time, and it fully engages us into watching it till the end. The action is seriously classic and mindblowing. The visual effects are terrific, as is the cinematography. The natural humour present throughout the film is decent, as is the portrayal of human emotions in the most realistic and effective way.<br/><br/>There are literally no more words I can have for OLDBOY except ""Intelligent, classic, entertaining masterpiece."""

","This movie was just sensational. I don't usually enjoy foreign movies as I normally find myself trying not to miss any visual information due to the effort of reading subtitles, but this movie was incredible. For those who enjoy a movie that keeps you guessing about what happens next and what each individual element of the film contributes to the bigger picture, this is that movie. <br/><br/>What I enjoyed was the extreme nature of the plot twist which was just unthinkable. As a person who enjoys trying to guess what is going to happen, I honestly did not see the twist coming. This movie has to be the ultimate revenge movie in terms of paying the ultimate price for making a simple mistake. <br/><br/>I have to say that it is unfortunate that daesu must pay a lifetime for his mistake. The final scene which he gets hypnotised into forgetting what has happened, with regards to mido, really gets you thinking. Is it better living a life knowing she is your daughter but you had sex with her or is it better living a life not knowing of what happened and to continue loving her as a wife. Truly fascinating."

","Oldboy is a really interesting and messed up movie. You may need to be a right kind of person (or perhaps a wrong kind of person) to watch it. It is not going to be for everyone's tastes, which is all the more surprising just how well it has been received.<br/><br/>This film was really something else. Something I have not seen before.<br/><br/>The scenes in this movie catch you off guard, with your mental pants down. You think you are about to see something but then it surprises you ahead of time with a close up of something else. Your mind is hopelessly out-gunned. And there you sit, with your mouth open wondering what the next scene may bring next or what other camera angle they will invent. Just remember to breath in between the scenes. And it is awesome.<br/><br/>You may have seen graphic movies before, movies that pour gore and yelling all over you like a big electric saw. Oldboy is less like a saw and more like a scalpel or needle piercing the skin.<br/><br/>Having said that, Oldboy tries a bit too hard. It becomes obvious that it tries to shock you with a new image or thought or sick twist.<br/><br/>It goes a bit over the top in certain parts, sometimes breaking a mostly serious and realistic tone with a more extreme cartoony style, which is not surprising considering its manga roots.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, when some key things get revealed, the explanation is a bit contrived, deus-ex-machina-ish if you will. You have to buy into the movie wholly to buy what the story sells.<br/><br/>The music was very interesting and noticeable. There was a fight scene and you get a minimalistic track of a lonely trumpet and beats. And it totally works, making a scenes take on a wholly different tone than you would expect.<br/><br/>If you can stomach its style, Oldboy is a movie that needs to be seen once in a lifetime. It was a mind-bending experience."
"Rickting","10","1","4","10 December 2014"," A brutal, haunting, dark and brilliantly twisted masterpiece
","This demented Korean revenge thriller is one of the rare movies which despite being absolutely full of graphic violence, unpleasant scenes and shocking twists is still brilliant, strangely beautiful and captivating. Oldboy tells the story of a man held in solitary confinement for 15 years, who is released without explanation and is given 5 days to find the identity of his captor and find out the truth. The truth hurts. Oldboy is a strange, powerful and twisted tale of revenge. It starts off slow and will to be too much for some to take, but it's not quite as bad as you've probably heard in terms of the violence, although the plot is brutal and disturbing. Oldboy is a hypnotically brilliant movie in almost every way and manages not to feel like mean spirited trash. Oldboy is an incredibly powerful film because of the emotions it depicts. Almost a foreign Get Carter, it's captivating due to its convincing portrayal of the extremes of human emotions and powerful performances.<br/><br/>The various actors in the film, who I haven't encountered as I'm not at all familiar with Korean cinema, are extraordinary. The main character is flawed and well rounded, while the villain is one of the sickest and most disturbing on screen bad guys ever. It's got a twisty and unpredictable plot, leading one of the most shocking twist endings of all time. The fascinating and brilliant story is what makes the film so memorable, but Chan-Wook Park creates a visually brilliant and utterly nightmarish canvas for the story to unfold on. The film looks absolutely extraordinary and although it's not an action based film, the one take corridor fight sequence is 3 minutes of beautiful, badass combat I'll never forget. Oldoby, overall, is a twisted, haunting masterful revenge tale with the power of a hammer blow between the eyes. A true nightmare you won't want to wake up from, this is a perfect example of how to make bleak art. A masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Director Chan-wook Park created a ""Revenge Trilogy"". The first, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), is followed by Oldboy. The third is called: Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005). I still have to see the first and second. I'll definitely keep you posted.<br/><br/>In Dae-su's cell there's a painting (by Belgian painter Ensor **proud Belgian over here**) with the quote I mentioned under the picture. This line is original from the poem 'Solitude' by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Full poem: link.<br/><br/>The movie has great soundtracks. I was amazed to hear a Starsailor song but it fitted perfectly. The two classic, composed songs by Vivaldi and Khachaturyan were remarkable and adding to the drama.<br/><br/>Oldboy was filmed in an arty way, the colors were really brisk. Every scene felt like a moving painting, a feast for the eyes. There was quit a bit of blood but it wasn't this nor the climax scenes that were determining the genre. Instead, the emotions played a lead role. It was more frightening to see the characters collapse emotionally than seeing one kill another. This is one of the reasons whereby I refuse to see the American remake. I'm pretty sure it won't beat the scenery and madness of the original.<br/><br/>This negative point is rather a personal defect than a serious issue. I couldn't bond with one of the characters. Mostly you'll have a good, or even bad, personage with whom you feel connected and wishing them the best. With this one I felt pity with them all in a bad way. I think it's caused by the acting because it differs very much from the American/British way. I'm not claiming that their acting was bad, on the contrary, I just need to get used to it and what a better way to do it than undergoing the winter with Asian movies.<br/><br/>Personal rating: 83/100"

"Matthew_Riley","9","1","4","15 November 2014"," Twisted and unusual; A film that will stay fresh in your mind for a long time.
","Oldboy is unique from plot to soundtrack; delving into depths western cinema would not even dream of going. It requires your undivided attention throughout as it questions human moralities and how far one will go to seek vengeance and keep secrets under wraps. The plot twist Oldboy hands to the viewer is frighteningly well executed, leaving you blind as it hits you like a tonne of bricks. With twists and turns like this, Oldboy will drop jaws and leave you tearing up with its clever ending.<br/><br/>However, Oldboy will leave a bit of a strange taste in your mouth at times and leave you neither liking nor disliking any of its characters. Its plot does rely on a few coincidental actions. For example, how did Oh Dae-su just so happen to stumble upon Mido's restaurant? This and a small amount of other scenes in the film could have been explained a bit better. Whilst Oldboys fight scenes are arguably sparse and cheap-looking, they are used to the right effect and are frequent enough to keep you glued to the screen throughout. They will, however, leave some viewers with the desire for more scenes similar to the hallway fight scene, which is filmed brilliantly and thoroughly enjoyable but not as convincingly as they'd like to think.<br/><br/>Despite this, these flaws are drowned out as Oldboy still manages to deliver enough evidence to strongly support the plot, leaving you thinking ""how, why and really?"" rather than ""this makes no sense"" and this is exactly what it wants you to do. For you to ask questions of yourself and the people around you. That's the beauty of the film and what it performs so well, never before have I seen a film that has left me drawn back, a film that is so twisted that I have questioned the conclusion I have come to. For these reasons Oldboy is a must watch, an incredible piece of cinematic and directorial genius which Chan-wook Park should be proud of and renowned for. Oldboy will stay on your mind for a long time, accompanied by its memorable quotes.<br/><br/>""Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone"""

","It was 1988 Seoul and Oh Dae-Su got drunk on his daughter's birthday. After his friend Joo-Hwan got him out of the police station, he is kidnapped off the streets. He is imprisoned in a motel-like cell. He gets gassed periodically without explanation. After 15 years, he is released from a giant suitcase on top of a building. There's a strange guy with a poodle who falls to his death. A bum gives him money and a cellphone. A mysterious man calls to taunt him. He passes out in a sushi restaurant and the cute chef Mi-do takes him home. They both have had hallucinations of ants. His daughter is adopted and living in Stockholm after his wife was murder and he's assumed to be the culprit. He discovers the prison where he was imprisoned. The wealthy Lee Woo-jin reveals himself as his tormentor with a deadly threat against every women that he loves.<br/><br/>As I watched this, I kept thinking of David Lynch and to lesser extend Quentin Tarantino. It's got the bloody violent revenge plot at the center of this. What I love more is the weird surreal touches. There's no way that a guy is going to eat a live octopus in any Hollywood movie. It is such a strange plot move to find a place by how a dumpling taste. It takes the cool violent movie to a weird off-kilter place."

","Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) has spent fifteen years imprisoned within a highly guarded motel room. He doesn't know where he is, why he has been imprisoned, or even by whom. All he has are dumplings to eat, television to watch and nothing but time to spend. And suddenly, one day, he gets released and told that he has a short amount of time to figure out why he lost fifteen years of his life.<br/><br/>From that intriguing setting we end up getting one of the best thrillers ever made. Directed by South Korean Chan-wook Park, Oldeuboi is perhaps the best film he has made to date. And this film truly shines because of its director. The story, based on a manga series of the same name, is iron tight and translated to the silverscreen very well. Park utilizes camera angles, lighting and colours with a master's hand and the film looks phenomenal. Long shots without cuts are used when needed, the whole film has a very stylish neo-noir look to it and it's also paced so that you're always held at the edge of your seat. It provides just enough information to keep you satisfied, but it's only at the end when all is revealed, and that ending twist is perhaps the best I've ever witnessed. Horrifying, sick and yet logical all at the same time.<br/><br/>Min-sik Choi is also a very strong leading actor. He ranges from pathetic white collar loser to a hardened avenger without never missing a beat. It's also a very physical role to pull off, as he has to go from an overweight office worker to a man who has spent fifteen years with nothing else to do but work out. And yet he does it seemingly effortlessly.<br/><br/>It's rather hard to talk more about this film without spoiling everything, but trust me when I say it's worth a watch. Personally I'd raise this to my personal Top 20. It's that good."

","For a movie considered as being extremely violent, I didn't find it frightening or violent at all. What I did think was however, is that it is one of the most powerfully moving and tragic movies I have ever seen. And it is packaged as a gripping, slickly made thriller that one can't help but devour right until the shocking climax, which hits you like a ton of bricks. And another nice thing is that the movie doesn't lose any of its emotional/psychological impact on repeat viewings. Not only does this movie boast an excellent plot and screenplay, it has wonderful acting, gorgeous cinematography and a divine soundtrack. The black humor (signature Park Chan Wook) is also well-done. A must watch! And a solid 10/10."

The movie starts with a mystery and everything starts to make sense as you keep watching this masterpiece. Min-sik Choi does a great performance acting and is a complete badass throughout the movie. Every moments are filled with mystery and thrills creating a hell of a ride. Now this isn't a movie for those who are faint hearted and are easily disturbed by taboos i.e. incest etc..So if you can't tolerate such things it might not be for you.<br/><br/>The movie is recommend to anyone who is looking for the wtf moment after finishing the movie cause I can guarantee you would get goosebumps every time you think about the film."

","Probably the perfect movie. I have watched many films and when I rented this through Netflix so many years ago I immediately called every like-minded movie loving friend I had and watched it again. This movie has probably done more to introduce American people to Asian cinema than any film I know. The story is intense, the movie never lets up. You are literally held in this movies grip until the credits roll. The acting is phenomenal, the story is so original, the ending is unexpected and after a second viewing, it is perfect. Just watch this movie, you will not be disappointed. And make sure to watch it in the original language, dubbing would destroy this film. Next to Silence of the Lambs, I don't think there is any comparison to the quality of this movie. As a matter of fact, go buy this movie, watch it, and be prepared to be amazed and ruined for most movies you will watch after this. Hollywood, you need to take lessons, this is a film for movie watchers, not for the 13 year old theater frequenting American public."

","As Dae-su's personality splits in two so the film has two distinct parts. First half - mystery and action, second part psychological drama and grand payoff. <br/><br/>Park makes the viewer take far more then 70 steps, leading us to believe this and that, leading us to suppress our doubts and fears and to cheer for Dae-su even after bitter-sweet end. Kiloton of bitter with a pinch of sugar.<br/><br/>I was left wondering - does vengeance have a point? Was it all for vengeance or for shame? Or for guilt? Does vengeance really pays off? Some questions are left unanswered and will for sure trouble me days after I saw this film again.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"farrokh-bulsara","7","1","4","12 April 2013"," Just a bridge between two masterpieces
","Differently from previous ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"", Park Chan-wook's iper-realistic and brutal aesthetics here becomes dynamic and puzzled, as its violence gets more spectacular than estranged, so more involved in entertainment than in reflection: in this sense it's an achieved film for the way it manipulates, even with a great dodge, the attention of the audience who never gives up in the suspense crescendo, plot twists, flashbacks, all mixed by sapient editing just to get us curious and intrigued. Anyway the extreme violence becomes pathetic, really excessive if not justified, self-satisfied in sadistic incursions in bad taste and in a mannerism end to itself, surely of great impact for the ability of director to shock and wonder, but not always necessary. After all the narrative machine, cerebral, confused, studied like a glove with that modern and Hollywood-a-like attitude to plot twist and ambiguity, doesn't betray the comics' source with frame shots and parallel chronological structure, but even with a certain, overblown absurdity which often cuts off of the film, visually sensational, a kind of honesty. Chased by apocalyptic music, macabre game of incest and blackmails, punishments and tortures, violence against himself, against next in line, against animals (the protagonist eat a living octopus), has some inventive flash, it's cathartic as Greek tragedy source (Sophocles' ""Oedipus the King""), but even if the passionate audience sews the wires of the story and characters, gets order in the chaos and fins solutions to the enigma, something is still missing, something unachieved and unobserved: an authentic verisimilitude for this delirium, which goes over the equilibrium between Dionysian and Apollonian , giving up to this last one and to a muddled work of mind. By the way, it's a great actor performance for Choi-Min Sik, in a still significant artwork from a certain Asiatic cinema, and from an extraordinary director. In his trilogy, this film in the middle is the less deep and the funniest one, the one in which he dared the most in terms of style and provocation, but even the most commercial and mainstream, in Tarantino pulp era."

","Korea has been releasing some very interesting films over the past ten years, and Oldboy is no exception. Oh Dae-su has been mysteriously trapped in a room for fifteen years. Earler clues show him being bailed out of a police station by a friend after a fight while drunk. He is kidnapped and held hostage in a hotel room and fed dumplings through a slot in the door. A television is kept on, which broadcasts reports on his family. His wife has been killed and daughter given to foster parents.<br/><br/>The Kafkaesque nightmare continues when he is framed for his wife's death. When he attempts suicide, a sedative is gassed into the room to put him to sleep. In Shawshank fashion, he digs a hole in the wall to escape. Suddenly, he wakes up on the roof, dressed in a suit. He is given a cellphone and goes to a restaurant and meets a chef, Mi-do, who takes him home. She gives him an instant message from his captor. <br/><br/>Woo-jin finally admits to being the abductor, and tells Oh that if he can figure out the motive for his troubles, Woo will kill himself; if not he will kill Mi-do. The plot becomes complicated, as we learn of an incestuous relationship and a suicide. <br/><br/>Oldboy looks like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch. It is a stylish thriller and never boring. I was impressed."
"Red-Barracuda","9","1","4","9 August 2011"," An emotionally intense thriller
","This South Korean revenge story is something of a tour de force. It features a powerful central performance from Choi Min-sik, who plays a man called Oh Dae-su who is mysteriously snatched in the street and imprisoned in a sealed room for 15 years. Until he is suddenly and unexpectedly released, from here he seeks vengeance and answers. Cinematically it's very accomplished with a number of standout sequences, including an excellent extended fight scene that uses every inch of its widescreen frame in a single unbroken shot. It pulls no punches on the violence front either; there are a number of brutal scenes not for the faint of heart. So the film is both stylish and visceral. But it also has a powerful emotional core. By the end of the film after the devastating final twists, you are taken to a very dark place indeed. A very psychologically troubling place. Oldboy looks at the lows to which human beings can sink for vengeance. Although, admittedly, the villain of the piece is clearly a sociopath. His revenge on the unfortunate Oh Dae-su is, to put it mildly, over-the-top and excessive.<br/><br/>Aside from the above, Oldboy is a great film because it surprises you. It has a freshness and originality that ensure this. Part thriller, part psychological drama, never less than compelling. It's not exactly for the faint hearted but anyone who dips their toes in is in for a treat."

","(7.5/10) Oldboy is depressing. It is dark. It is bleak. It is bizarre. And most importantly, it is absolutely brilliant. A thrilling tale about Monte-Cristo-styled revenge. The cinematography was quite, quite good. The screenplay was superb. The art direction for the sets were very good and very Matrixy. However, it was in the revelation scene: Oh Dae-Sue discovers that he has slept with his daughter and thus he scissors off his own tongue as a ""symbol of silence"" that we reach the worst of climaxes. The entire film up to this point was the best adapted manga so far. It had everything that manga offers and manifested these elements in a motion picture. However, the idea that this film, the mystery and the revelation, was based around something as revolting as incest was the real downer. It makes this film ultimately depressing and tragic. It clamps down on any further brilliance and magnificence. Hope for this film disappears into the bloody waters like Oh-Dae Su's tongue."
"xbrokenxscenex67","7","1","4","28 January 2011"," Wasn't my favorite movie, but worth watching.
","Spoilers Ahoy: Going into this movie, I had high expectations. I have heard nothing but good things about Oldboy because, of that I might've set my bar a little bit to high. Coming out of the movie, I was a little bit disappointed. The one thing I couldn't stand about the movie was the dub. The dub was horrible, probably one of the worst dubs I have ever heard. The lip syncing didn't even match up half the time, the voices sounded off, and was all around pretty silly sounding. I feel that the dub kind of took away the seriousness of the movie. I was too busy laughing at the dub, I couldn't take anything in this movie seriously. I suggest watching it with subtitles and in the original language. <br/><br/>Another thing, I wasn't so fond of was the themes of incest. I usually love forbidden love stories. However, I just think it's a little weird that Dae-Su Oh got hypnotized so that he could continue to have sex with Mi-Do without knowing 'the awful truth'. If he really did love her, wouldn't he want her to know; so that he could confirm that this is really what she wants? I find it a bit selfish, but maybe that's what the movie was aiming for.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of the plot. I was very interested in the whole story, and I found myself, really wanting to know why Dae-Su ended up locked in that 'prison'. However, up until the end, I found the movie kind of confusing and hard to follow along with. To be honest, everybody kind of looked the same to me. Most of the women looked like Mi-Do, I'm not saying this to be racist, I myself being Asian. However, I feel that they should've picked some actresses, that looked different from each other. Or maybe, all the girls were Mi-Do. No idea. The horrible dub was kind of distracting. <br/><br/>Also, even though Dae-Su was supposed to be the protagonist, I didn't have any compassion towards him at all. I actually, found myself hating him a little bit. Maybe, it was because, I thought he was obnoxious (especially at the beginning, and end of the film)or maybe, it was because I didn't like his selfishness towards his daughter. I found myself synopsizing with the antagonist more. It was truly depressing, to watch him reach out for his sister when she killed herself, I probably even shed a tear or two. Additionally, did anyone else notice, that as the movie went on Dae-Su got noticeably weaker? First, he beats through a crowd of men, gets stabbed in the back, and is still beating them up. Next, he can barely even fight one man who looks like the size of my grandmother. <br/><br/>I was a little hesitant to watch this movie because, I heard that it was pretty violent. I usually, tend to steer away from extreme violent movies, as most of them are just 'movies that have extreme gore for no reason what so ever.' But, Oldboy wasn't that violent, a lot of the violence was off screen, and it didn't feel like one of those trashy 'movies with gore for no reason.' In my opinion, the violence was all in good taste and relevant to the plot. <br/><br/>Oldboy has its good features and its bad ones. Despite, that I do recommended that anyone who hasn't seen this film to go and see it. It's a good movie, when you want something interesting and a little bit different to watch."

I read a couple reviews in which the writer said the dialogue was poppy/corny/cliché or some suchness, but I have to disagree here. The dialogue served it's purpose for the film (noirish narration at times), and there were some genuinely funny lines. There are enough fight scenes to keep your average action movie buff interested, and plot twists aplenty for those who like to use their brains at the cinema. Enjoy!"

","Chan-Wook Parks follow up to 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' is a powerful ride through the mind of an unstable and vengeful kidnapping victim. The film follows our protagonist after he has been locked up for 15 years for completely unknown reasons and with no idea who did it to him. He receives a mobile phone, some money and begins to unravel the twists and turns of this unique and superbly designed revenge movie. The scenes of violence, further between than you may have been lead to believe, upset and humour in equal measure and the films powerful finale shocks and enlightens in equal measure. This is a tough one to follow, it requires the up most attention but rewards greatly for those who follow it every step of the way. The shocking octopus scene needs to be seen to be believed and if you see one film this year make it 'Oldboy', you will not regret it."

","""Old Boy"" is a damned tough movie to review. Its strengths and its weaknesses seem to become apparent only upon reflection. The disjointed plot is distracting and can lead viewers to lose interest in precisely what is going on. But pay close attention to this one; the pay-off is worth it.<br/><br/>The film's greatest weakness involves poor pacing, slowing to the point of boredom at times before throwing mountains of information at the viewer in a few seconds. But Park Chan Wook is a masterful director on the cutting edge of the new wave of Asian film-making with many important titles to his credit. So perhaps this ""weakness"" is intentional.<br/><br/>""Old Boy"" employs extraordinary cinematography, one of Park's trademarks. When dialogue and plot drag, unique camera angles and unusual presentation keep one's attention. The film starts with great promise. The protagonist, Oh Dae Su, is well-defined and supremely well portrayed by Choi Min Sik. As a viewer, I was compelled to want to go along with Oh Dae Su on his bizarre journey. Its bits of satirical humor generate particular enjoyment. The early escape scenes are superbly presented; I cried out in delight.<br/><br/>Sadly, after the escape, the movie begins to lag. While I was expecting more in the area of Oh Dae Su's revenge (characters utter his name as if it's a horrible invocation), the story instead dives deeply into an uncertain psychological exploration that eventually loses me.<br/><br/>I guess I could say that I just didn't get it and I'm an idiot. But the film IS sophisticated enough to be difficult to tackle. It is quite slick, its performances excellent, its presentation powerful. I just wish I could have followed the complexity of the story as it gained momentum and that the film would not have fallen into near sleep mode at too many important junctures.<br/><br/>In all, the film is a special treat despite its drawbacks. I would venture to say that Korean cinema, and Park in particular, has reached a point similar to that of 20th century Scandinavian, Polish and French cinema in its penchant for decidedly dark (film noir) approaches. ""To hell with any concern that the audience might not be able to follow the story; just do the film."" In this respect, ""Old Boy"" succeeds supremely, although I don't find it as subtly beautiful as, say, ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring."" I suspect Park had that film in mind when he made this film. Similarities in style, such as vast understatement, abound.<br/><br/>""Old Boy"" is original, daring, bizarre and purposefully entertaining. I believe only that the screenplay could have been improved; I will also concede that some vital components may have been ""lost in translation."""

By the way, musical parts were so cool, especially in the last scene. I used head-phones, so music made a great effect.<br/><br/>Although the plot seems a bit clumsy.

","This movie is great and anybody saying otherwise is either jealous of its brilliance or hasn't got a clue. I won't bother in explaining the plot since knowing it will only ruin you some surprises (but I saw the movie aware of the final twist and it didn't make it any worse), and, if you already know it, what for? I think the biggest mistake is to take this as a normal movie with a normal plot and characters with normal motivations. Because is not. (SPOILERS AHEAD)This is a movie about revenje and who says revenje needs a reason? stop looking for one: that's OldBoy's whole point: a reason doesn't make any difference. You could take revenje on virtually everything. The whole sister story is probably just there to introduce incest's subject (which is not treated as a sin, but, rather, as a punishement), not to explain anything. This movie is so great because the director seems to know exactly how much information we need at every time to follow him; sequences are never too long or shot (save for the ending maybe?), and include some highlights such as...yeah, the giant ant, and of course the one in which Dae beats up 20 guys in a very Kill Bill fashion. WOrds are concise and beautiful, and music...a world apart. And the details...the line when Guy and Girl are screwing, that seems so pointless, assumes a huge, terrible meaning when we hear it again at the end of the movie. Does that make you think? It is conceivable to sexually hurt a girl, but what happens when you hear it again knowing it is your daughter? Or like the seventy steps the ""Monster"" takes at the end... Movies that will make you click together with this one: Cube, Fight Club, Kill Bill And I give it a 9/10 just because the final scene really freaked me out. Nothing personal."

","I gotta say, I never was really into Korean movies before I saw Old Boy. Every little detail, every little scene is meaningful to the whole movie, and it is in that detail that unknowingly gets the viewers fallen into the movies. The fight scene in the corridor... I gotta say, it's one of the best scenes one could ever make, since it is an uncut fight scene in a closed space, making it as real as it can get. As to the music, I gotta say, the music is so powerful that every time I hear the OST, I feel like I am on a hunt for revenge. Overall, the acting of Choi Min Sik is what made this movie big, even though he himself is not a young Brad Pitt kind of character, it's all in his eyes, and the way he speaks. I hope the viewers enjoyed this movie, as for there are a lot of Korean movies that have interesting and powerful stories as Old Boy. Since the Korean movie industry is not as rich as Hollywood, it would be quite impossible to create a Gladiator or a Star Wars effect due to its budget, yet the way Koreans put together complex and powerful stories shows how much talent they have."

In the end of course, he was unable to escape the trap which had been laid for him. And the tongue scene evokes the putting-out-of eyes of Oedipus."

Don't listen to critics when it comes to foreign movies; especially if the critic is from another culture different than that of the intended audience (Korean language speaker).

"danmccluskey","9","7","88","19 January 2006"," Cinematic Masterpiece
","See title.<br/><br/>This film is just that, a masterpiece. The tone perfectly matches the pace of the film itself. It manages to give off a sense of hope through slowly building it up, then totally decimates that feeling just as quickly, proceeding to repeat again until the climax of the film is reached.<br/><br/>Daesu is a tragic character through and through, and the film keeps you cheering him on through every hardship, every punch, every blow. His struggles in turn become your struggles and you feel a certain empathy towards this man who has lost and gained everything through the whim of another. The transformation his character undergoes from the beginning of the movie is absolutely staggering and a testament to the human spirit, as well as its weaknesses.<br/><br/>Others have said that this film is overrated; in order to be so, it would need to have much more viewership and have wide-spread knowledge and influence. Sadly, it does not have any of these qualities as of yet, so one must argue that it is actually underrated and badly in need of more viewers. I can't stress that enough - more film-goers need to see Oldboy.<br/><br/>The film itself is dark and gritty, which is really an understatement. Colors are always displayed in drab earth-tones and mottled patterns, giving the atmosphere a more visceral feeling and does a great job of placing you there along with Daesu. The film's ""villain"" provides a great contrast to this in the colors of their surroundings and their lifestyle. This gives a reversed role to the typical dark/light stereotypes that villains and heroes are usually labeled with, though using comic book terminology is misplaced in relation to this movie, even though it did actually have those roots. Settings in the movie are entirely mired in sadness and permeate all the characters, save for the villain (and this character again contrasts very readily apparent stereotypes).<br/><br/>The acting matches the setting. Constant sad and miserable undertones mixed in with clearly feigned happiness and even some idealism. Life is clearly a miserable experience in this envisioned world, and the cast portrays this perfectly.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone interested in foreign cinema to watch this film. However, it is not something that should be viewed by someone wishing to be apart of another ""magical happy journey"" film, because this film certainly does not cater to the normal constraints for expectations."

","A guy is kidnapped and prisoned for 15 years. He doesn't know why he was prisoned. Then he is released and is hungry for revenge. That's the basic plot of this movie. The story is great with many clever twists and turns. Sometimes the movie was a bit confusing but there is nothing too complicated. The movie was also a bit violent and included few realistic but cool fighting scenes although it's by no means an action movie. Hollywood is remaking this movie for the year 2006 and I think if someone like David Fincher directs and we add some great actors to the soup it could be even better for me at least. Not to say things were bad here. Just with a even bigger budget and things I can see this movie being even better if they don't change wrong things. They could sharpen the edges of this diamond."
"Zombified_660","8","6","72","29 March 2006"," Clever thriller that's a bit overlong but intense and exciting
","I almost intentionally avoided reading press about Oldboy before I saw it, largely because I didn't want to see any spoilers previous to it. I wouldn't say I was hugely excited about seeing it, but I was very interested and a friend's recommendation eventually got my bum on a seat for it. Continuous discussion of the graphic nature of Oldboy had suggested that perhaps it'd be a very unpleasant two hours, but it proved an intelligent and at times deeply funny and moving study of a man imprisoned over something he is unaware of, suddenly let go after several years with no explanation other than a time limit to find out why he was locked away before a young woman is killed.<br/><br/>It's a great premise, and the film genuinely manages to keep you thrilled throughout it's two hours. I found the ending a little on the overblown side to tell you the truth, but other than that I found little to fault Oldboy. The film has a kind of surreal bent to it, and a jet black streak of humour that many seem to have missed entirely. The main character's narration is part of this, being both dry and witty, but also the way the movie is directed lends it a strange dream-like quality, a little like Barton Fink.<br/><br/>While Oldboy isn't hugely violent, and more importantly is not a movie where the violence IS the film, it is probably graphic enough to put the more wimpy viewer off Asian movies for life. Certain scenes of violence are tinged with humour, particularly the two early fight scenes, but then others are nasty and disturbing (Claw hammer dentistry anyone? Thought not.). Still, at the end of the day, the premise of Oldboy is supposed to be dark and disturbing (would you like to be kidnapped and locked up in a disused apartment for no obvious reason) and there is enough detail and humanity in this film for the violence to be put in contrast and not dominate the feature, so this wasn't an issue for me.<br/><br/>So, to conclude, if you're strong of stomach and enjoy a good twisty-turny movie, then it'd be a good idea to check out Oldboy. It's original, dark and well balanced, and doesn't make it's story overly confusing. I liked it a lot, hopefully you will too."
"aoc777","Null","6","72","3 November 2004"," A film about revenge and more
","More or less summarizing what others have written and giving my own two cents. Minor ***SPOILERS*** therein.<br/><br/>If there ever was a movie about revenge, this is it. Forget about Kill Bill, which was partially released the same year. Kill Bill is a celebration of Tarantino's knowledge of martial arts and bullet ballet movies. It only depicts one form of revenge, which is extremely cold and over drawn. I liked Tarantino's two-part film, but I could never take it serious. This film here, Oldboy, on the other hand uses the complete spectra of revenge available and treats the subject presented and the characters with a lot of seriousness and therefore I can take this movie serious in turn.<br/><br/>A man gets locked away for 15 years for no apparent reason. What will he do after his release? Any resemblance of his former life is gone, only one thing keeps him going, revenge. This is where he story really starts and we will leave it at that. You will just have to watch the movie.<br/><br/>However, from the point of release on we get introduced and intimate with all sorts and forms of revenge, it is impossible not to get personally involved in this movie. Every cinematic style and tool is used to perfection to achieve this, to confront the viewer with the reality of living and breathing retaliation. The acting is admirable and believable; the main actors play their emotions well. Their motivations make sense and the red line and story pans out in a way, which makes the movie scarily realistic.<br/><br/>This brings me to the scary part of the movie. There are certain movies that I personally find quite fearsome as they provoke thoughts and considerations that can cost you a sleepless night. Oldboy is one of those movies, quite disturbing. The thoughts provoked haunted me for several days and revealing the consequences I arrived at, might spoil the watching and thinking fun (you are not watching the usual, keep the brain switched on during the movie!), so I leave everyone to come up with their own thoughts.<br/><br/>Overall Oldboy achieves something interesting, it combines the action and pace of your typical Hollywood blockbuster with the thoughtfulness of a European art house movie, which is why I can recommend this movie to nearly everyone. You will enjoy it, be entertained or at least have a lot to talk about. If you are squeamish you might consider watching some other movie, as this one here will disturb you without using some of the overly graphic imagery that other movies depict. However the violence used is quite realistic in terms of its application and effects, which might also disturb you slightly.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10<br/><br/>Comparable movies and how I rate them: Payback 7.5 Kill Bill 8 Point Blank 7.5 Amadeus 8.5 Count of Monte Cristo 7"

","This is a very stylish piece of cinema. From the opening scene to the vast wind swept frozen ending the visuals of the movie are rich and tantalising. The use of different styles of film making, camera angles and story telling is a breath of fresh air. Being locked up for 15 years in cell with the TV as teacher is interesting way to train the mind for vengeance. Once release the search is on for the motherf**ker who did this to you. The question that is playing in your head is why, over and over like a broken record. With this type of tension it doesn't take much to snap. Taking you on a wild ride through martial arts, surrealistic scenes, family trauma and visceral treats. Oldboy delivers a revenge film, that leaves you hold your gut and feel at lost at the end."

"info-2513","10","6","76","16 June 2004"," The truest motion picture, released in South Korea
","Spoiler Alert There's almost no doubt that Park Chan-wook's new film ''Oldboy' will be a commercial success. With the popularity of the two main actors and with many local critics already deeming it a classic, the film has become a hot commodity on Internet ticket reservation sites. <br/><br/>The film finds the director, who is most known for the DMZ drama ''Joint Security Area JSA,' returning to the theme of revenge and retribution he explored in last year's ''Poksunun Na-ui Kot (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance).' Contrasting the stark, almost barren quality of that film, Park pulls out all technical stops for ''Oldboy,' using scores of computer graphics and fight scenes to tell his tale. <br/><br/>The story comes from a Japanese comic book of the same name, in which an ordinary family man is suddenly kidnapped and placed in a cell dressed up as a hotel room. Given no explanation for his confinement or the murder of his wife, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) spends the next 15 years alone, weaving in and out of hallucinatory states with only a television to keep him company.<br/><br/>Dark and moody like a nightmare waiting to occur, these moments in the hotel room are some of the best in the film. The scenes, in which Park uses a collage of images to set the mood, play out like a Kafka story, with Oh unsuccessfully trying to come up with a rational reason for his plight. An expert on personifying tragedy, Choi is at his angst-filled best portraying a man on the edge of madness. <br/><br/>Oh is determined to one day find a way out of his cell and exact revenge on those responsible. Between bouts of madness, he trains himself in the art of fighting, punching the walls until thick calluses envelop his knuckles.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when Oh finally escapes and begins tracking down his enemy (Yoo Ji-tae), the film gets to feel a bit muddled. Perhaps it's a matter of having too much of a good thing, because the combination of the various elements doesn't completely add up. Like different volumes in a comic book, there's something a bit stilted about the transitions and the resulting finale. <br/><br/>Still there are many things about the movie that do work. On their own, the scenes are visually strong, though some of the more repulsive moments do feel gratuitous. (Animal rights activists beware!) And the pathetic yet comical quality of having a half-insane man attempting to seek justice, as well as the overall elusiveness of Oh's quest, will keep audiences glued to the screen. <br/><br/>One day in 1988, an ordinary man named OH Dae-soo, who lives with his wife and adorable daughter, is kidnapped and later wakes up to find himself in a private makeshift prison. Dae-soo makes numerous attempts to escape and to commit suicide, but they all end up in failure. All the while Dae-soo asks himself what made a man hate him so much enough to imprison him without any reason. While suffering from his debacle, Dae-soo becomes shocked when he watches the news and hears that his beloved wife was brutally murdered. At this very moment, Dae-soo swears to take revenge on the man who destroyed his happy life. Fifteen years have passed and Dae-soo is released with a wallet filled with money and a mobile phone. An unknown man calls Dae-soo and asks him to figure out why he was imprisoned. In front of bewildered Dae-soo, a girl named Mido appears and she promises to help him seek vengeance after hearing about his 15 years in confinement. With Mido's help, Dae-soo begins to trace the guy and finally encounters the private prison where he discovers a cassette tape, which only says... ""OH Dae-soo talks too much' While Dae-soo and Mido's search goes on, Dae-soo finally runs face to face with his kidnapper. The culprit says there will be no way to find out the reason of his imprisonment if Dae-soo kills him now. Instead, he proposes a game. He tells Dae-soo that if he discovers the reason for his imprisonment in five days, then he will kill himself. If not, he will kill Mido. Only five days are given to Dae-soo to find out the reason behind the guy's grudge against Dae-soo. While doing so, hidden secrets about Dae-soo and Mido's relationship are revealed."

","Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.<br/><br/>Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.<br/><br/>Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.<br/><br/>I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.<br/><br/>I hope my talk helps."
"FilmCriticLalitRao","10","1","5","20 September 2014"," Oldboy : A Park Chan Wook film which has divided viewers into two different camps.
","Park Chan Wook's film ""Old Boy"" has divided viewers into two different camps. On the one hand there are many viewers who have voiced their positive opinions about it. On the other hand, there are also some viewers who have not been able to understand this film and its message of revenge. Whatever one might say, there is no point in going into details regarding this film's popularity neither would it be worthwhile to discuss its notoriety. All that can truly be said about ""Old Boy"" directed by Korean iconoclast filmmaker Park Chan Wook is that it can make one learn more about a Korean person's psyche. This aspect of human behavior is revealed in the character of Oh Dae Su whose role has been amazingly played with heavenly aplomb, tremendous maturity and remarkable agility by Korean actor Choi Min Sik. A film critic has to be trusted when he states that a film like this has not been made in the recent past. This is one of those rare Asian films which doesn't walk on the crutches of exotic Asian elements even for a second. There is one sincere advice for the Victorian prudes who criticized the scene in which an Octopus is eaten alive. Kindly have a look at Pasolini's film ""Salo"". Compared to that film the octopus scene appears like an angelic infant. Those viewers who lambasted the portrayal of incest, it must be told that it has always been a part of human civilization since olden times. Hence, why are some people making unnecessary noises now about its depiction ? The best thing about ""Old boy"" is that it makes us aware of the fact that the time connection is extremely important for all of us. Everything about the film is brilliant indeed mind boggling. Whether it is catchy music, quick pace, ample suspense, raw violence or maudlin melodrama. ""Old boy"" is a first class product in the truest sense of the word. It is a film which gives its viewer complete value for money. Whichever format one chooses to watch this film, it is surely going to rest in the viewer's mind for a long time."

","A man (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years without knowing why or who is behind it. He is then mysteriously released and given clothes, money, and a cell phone. He sets out to try and find answers so he can get revenge on who imprisoned him. Along the way he becomes involved with a pretty young chef (Kang Hye-jung).<br/><br/>It's a good film but perhaps not as great as it's made out to be. The plot is riddled with contrivances and holes. So try to turn your brain off or else you won't enjoy it as much. Also, and I can't stress this enough, the plot twist to this film is big so please stop reading about it until you have seen it. It's like knowing nothing about The Sixth Sense and trying to read info on it. The odds are 100 to 1 the film's twist will be spoiled for you. Without that plot twist, the rating on this one goes down some. So go into it blind if you can."

","I saw things coming for a change. There are pretty obvious hints at how things will turn out, and that felt a little sloppy. On top of that, this kind of overly elaborate revenge for a reasonably understandable betrayal was just too much. One could argue that this Woo-Jin was simply a disturbed guy to begin with, but it doesn't really help. In other words, the dramatic aspect does not relate properly to the other aspects, which I will go into in the next paragraph.<br/><br/>What remains is an entertaining film that reminded me much of a Hitchcock with extra servings of well done violence (the scene is the hallway is pretty cool), a perversity salad of and a kind of complicated, mysterious little soup on the side.

I like the story of it better than the movie itself if that makes sense. Some reviewers don't like the fact that it's voice overs rather than subtitles but I'm fine with that. Some people with short attention spans or who can't comprehend longer developing movies might not understand what's happening. I had to explain what happened to my mother. An American version/remake would/will be awesome. There are a few minor things I would have changed had I been involved with the movie, but hey who am I.

","Please don't watch this movie with the English over-dubbed. It ruins the acting of the original actors.<br/><br/>That said this movie is a masterpiece. I was looking for movies like Momento, The Usual Suspects, Inception, Primer, etc that had interesting plot twists and premises and this happened to be on a list. I didn't much care for the description on the back of the movie but Ebert giving it 4 stars convinced me to watch it.<br/><br/>The acting, especially by the main character, is astoundingly good. Thankfully the script is equally intriguing and, as the pieces start to fall into place, yields some ""ah-ha"" moments to the baffling premise.<br/><br/>This movie warrants re-watching. Some of the subject matter is a little more extreme then normally what Hollywood would allow (though not in terms of gore). Its definitely not a good date movie. I would recommend watching it when you are alone or with friends and in an open-minded and patient frame of mind willing to put a little effort into the viewing experience. If you are just looking for some quick entertainment, laughs, or something you don't have to pay complete attention to save this for later. There is actually quite a bit of funny stuff in here but is very much dark comedy material."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","5","12 June 2012"," Sufficiently Dark and Disturbing, Though Not Always Purposeful
","A Korean action-suspense flick that, like many far-east thrillers, doesn't hesitate to take things well into the realm of the taboo. In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture."
"Degree7","4","1","5","27 May 2012"," Intriguing premise...
","What starts as an intriguing premise is built up to what I assumed would be a riveting confrontation between the protagonist and the villain. Oh Dae-su is held captive for 15 years and released to find out why. The initial plot outline is certainly an opening that will spark the interest of any curious viewer. Unfortunately, the melodrama and incredulity of the story causes it to buckle under the weight of its own surrealist baggage.<br/><br/>The big reveal is certainly sick and disturbing enough all right, but it isn't original, and where it's been done before it's been done better (Polanski's Chinatown). It seemed as if the whole purpose of the picture was to wallow in perversion, and the themes (how far the lengths of revenge and loneliness can string one along) are rather limp. At best, this film feels like an extra-saucy David Lynch picture, of which I am no fan.<br/><br/>There are good points to this film however. The first half is entertaining, with plenty of black humour and some fantastic visuals, camera-work, and fight choreography, with clever editing tricks to boot. But the last third of the film felt flat to me. 6.9 stars out of 10."

","Lot's of reviews for this title already but I just have to write one, too.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie for the first time I really liked it. I finally watched it again and this time my admiration reached a peak.<br/><br/>This movie is fantastic in almost every way.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous. I love every scene, every shot of the camera, the atmosphere is amazing not to forget the creativity in presenting the pictures; colorful, original, inventive - like many Asian movies are. However many influences of famous non-Asian filmmakers can be found. I was reminded of directors like Kubrick, Fincher or Tarantino. I also loved how some of the scenes where cut and put together. The pace of the movie is also really balanced. There are times to cool down, parts when the picture takes time to develop in depth and atmosphere followed by ""action"" scenes that come along literally like a hammer on your head. Completed is the whole with a fantastic and perfectly placed score. I think classical music playing over violent scenes did not sound that beautiful since ""A clockwork orange"".<br/><br/>The main character (go look up his name) gives an incredible performance. Absolutely crazy, emotionally gripping and most important believable.<br/><br/>Not as believable may seem the plot for some people ...<br/><br/>A drunk man is kidnapped on the street and trapped for 15 years of his life in what looks like a shabby ""hotel room"". His only friend during this time is the telly. He gets food through a small shutter in the door and after being intoxicated with gas, the kidnappers clean up the room, wash his clothes and cut his hair. He never gets in contact with other people and is not told who is doing this to him or why. The reason why he is not going totally mad is his rage and need for revenge. Finally he is free again and tries to find the guys and kill them. Now this might not sound as complex as it actually is. Maybe even a bit too complex. The revelation kinda is a bit improbable but I think it still could work... and within this movie it definitely worked for me.<br/><br/>It's an extremely powerful movie, even disturbing not only for the gore itself. In fact this whole movie is pretty violent and therefore I can not recommend this for everybody. But it is not violence for its own sake but really has a purpose and also a motivation. This film is a complex character study about the alienation of an isolated man and how human psyche is influenced and/or manipulated.<br/><br/>My only little problem that I had with the movie especially the first time I watched it is the confusion. Not only the plot is quite confusing and at times hard to follow but most of the trouble I had with the picture was memorizing and assigning all these Asian names to the correct characters. They all sound so strange and similar that I was wondering more than once ""Who is that person they were just talking about again?"". The second time around this was not longer the case and I finally fell in love with the movie.<br/><br/>All in all this is an extraordinary experience that you definitely don't see very often or maybe haven't ever seen before. It is unique, compelling, violent, creative, at times funny and perfectly crafted.<br/><br/>Cause of some weaknesses in the plot (developement) I rate this film ""only"" 9/10.<br/><br/>So ******* see it!"
"TheExpatriate700","Null","1","5","11 May 2010"," A Cinematic Masterpiece, Neglected by the Academy
","Oldboy is arguably the greatest film of the past decade, a masterpiece of writing, characterization, and cinematography that was ignored by the Academy Awards because it was made in Korea. Director Park Chan-wook takes what could have been a standard revenge plot and expands it into an intelligent, disturbing exploration of the nature of vengeance.<br/><br/>The film follows the vengeful quest of Oh Dae-Su, a man imprisoned for fifteen years by an unknown individual. When he is suddenly freed, he tries to find out who did this and kill him, only to learn that revenge can be a trap in its own right.<br/><br/>A number of factors make this film a masterpiece. Perhaps the most striking of these is its cinematography. The climactic scene in the villain's penthouse is beautifully shot, with excellent lighting and camera work. However, the film's acting is also a major factor. Ji-Tae Yu, who plays Woo-Jin, provides an excellent performance and should have been at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Park Chan-wook, the director, was similarly slighted.<br/><br/>The main reason I suspect this film was neglected by the Academy was that it came from a foreign country, in particular one not traditionally seen as a producer of Oscar caliber pictures. American viewers have until recently neglected Korean cinema, with the end result that the film did not get its fair share of attention. Hopefully, the efforts of talented directors such as Park will change this attitude."

","I thought that Old Boy was a great piece of film work. The gritty violence and in your face hatred just added to the scenes for the movie. Quentin Tarantino even said some great items about this independent film. I could only have imagined being imprisoned for fifteen (15) years and then being released. I knew that one of the driving factors on my mind would be revenge and to find the beast that was responsible for the incident. I would make the monster suffer and to suffer dearly once I got my hands on him. Old Boy showed the determination of one man and what he was willing to do to find the kidnapper that led to his ordeal. It delivered much more that I read about it and that was a great sign of an independent movie. I am always willing to have more than less. If you have ever thought about any type of revenge or deep hatred for another human being, I suggest that you watch Old Boy first. It might change your mind and steer you in another direction. Old Boy was a good piece of film work and it is a must see."

","It's amazing how incredibly well-made movies like ""Oldboy"" manage to slip under the radar, at least in America. It may be a South Korean film, but it appeared at Sundance and its plot and style are easily catered to a Western audience. Regardless what happened, ""Oldboy"" is a film that can't be missed. It is a crime thriller and mystery that is delivered with such force and style that you can't help but be wowed.<br/><br/>The movie is sort of like a much more contemporary spin on Alexandre Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Oh Dae-sue is kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years then suddenly released. Naturally, Dae-sue seeks answers and more importantly, revenge against his captor, but there's more to his situation than he realizes and he will soon find that the outside world is a giant prison in its own right.<br/><br/>Chan-wook Park directs and writes the film based on a comic by Nobuaki Minegishi. That's a good place to start. Both the writing and directing is absolutely fantastic. There is a strong mix of active dialog and reflective narration from Dae-sue's perspective. The transitions between present action and past memory are not only creative but clear and seamless. While the film's only weakness is that it's difficult to follow and understand as it moves at mind- pounding speed, what you can follow is quite a lot considering the film's complexity and how little detail we know through so much of the movie. Nothing starts to really make sense until maybe halfway through.<br/><br/>Park is also incredibly creative. The two-dimensional (like an old video game) fight sequence where Dae-sue takes out some guys with a hammer is unforgettable. His transitions to past memories that combine footage of the previous and upcoming scenes are quite smooth and interesting. One critical flashback, that (without spoilers) involves a hand-held mirror is elegant and powerful. So many amazing choices are made and they're not just good, they're highly memorable.<br/><br/>Min Sik-Choi, who plays Dae-sue, gives an astounding performance, taking us into the tortured, vengeful and penitent heart of Dae-sue. There are times where he's comedic and times here's pitifully comedic. A lot of the film rides on feeling that emotion, feeling his motivation as if it's part of our own. <br/><br/>This is without question a difficult film. Torturing images, incest, scenes that will nearly scar you litter this film. It is its greatest strength at times but obviously it makes it very difficult for some people to tolerate. Also littering the film, however, are quotes and phrases that gain meaning as the film progresses that are beautiful and thought-provoking. No matter the scene, ""Oldboy"" will grip you and make you think long and hard about it as the credits roll."

He's eventually released, but soon afterward finds himself locked in what at first appears to be a jail cell but turns out to be a fairly well-appointed room, complete with TV. However, he soon realizes that it's not any kind of government jail or prison; it's run by a mysterious private organization, and no one will tell him why he's there or for how long and, in fact, he never sees another human being in all the time he's there. What he does see is a news report on the TV that his wife has been killed, his daughter has been taken away and that he is the prime suspect in the murder, but he knows he didn't do it because he had been locked up in that room. It's not long before he begins to go crazy, trying to figure out why someone would go to the trouble of locking him up and framing him for his wife's murder. Eventually he escapes after having been locked in his ""cell"" for 15 years--or did he really ""escape""? The all-seeing, all-powerful organization seemingly knows not only his every move, but knows what he'll do before he does. He meets a beautiful young chef in a sushi restaurant and moves in with her--but is she what she seems to be? Things snowball from there, and the plot twists, turns and surprises will have you going. It's been mentioned by others that this is a ""nasty"" film, but it's really not. There are some brutal violent scenes, but the ""nastiness"" is much more of an atmospheric nature. Although beautifully shot and brightly lit, the tone of the film is dark and oppressive (a nice contrast) and parts of it will definitely have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>However, the last half-hour or so of the movie went completely awry. I won't say exactly what happens for the sake of not spoiling the ending, but suffice it to say that it will most likely leave you shaking your head saying, ""What the hell is going on here?"" However, even taking into account the disappointing last part of the movie, the film itself is still worth a look. It has more pluses than minuses, the actress who plays Mi-Do is gorgeous (that always helps) and has several not particularly gratuitous sex scenes (that always helps even more) and it does give you a lot to think about. If it wasn't for the ending, I'd have given it a much better rating than I did. Check it out."

Then I remembered it was Asian, not American.<br/><br/>This film touches on taboos I don't think any director (well maybe Roman Polanski) would explore in an English speaking film.

","Oldboy is the second film in Chan-wook Park's revenge trilogy. The films are unrelated, but all share a common link in the plot. <br/><br/>Because Oldboy is about revenge. unknown revenge... <br/><br/>the main character is taken into captivity by an unknown villain for 15 years. that is the plot description the back cover gives you. and it is great that is so ambiguous. Because when I watched it for the first time half a year ago I was stunned and mortified by the plot and its twists. It is impossible to say too much without letting the goods spill, so I wont. <br/><br/>But this film doesn't only sprout a grand plot, it also carries it self with great style! the colour tweaks done in RGB are quite subtle, but they add immensely to the atmosphere. the atmosphere clearly states that this is a serious movie. the main character is confused and angry, barley away from hateful. <br/><br/>The film only builds this atmosphere deeper and deeper the further the movie progresses. it is violent, yes. but all the violence is done in such a fashion that you feel the need for it. it is very emotionally strong violence. And in the midst of all this Chan-wook Park finds the space for some dark(as it can be) humour. but the great thing is that the humour only adds to the depth of the characters and strenghten the plot, making it very plausible and extremely believable. <br/><br/>To summarize: this movie is not for the faint hearted. the subject at hand is more or less one of the final taboos in this liberal world(next to farming babies for the black organ market)...<br/><br/>Strong, sad and ultimately stunning film for the mature minded"

A second vision really enables a take a distance from the ""what is said"", in order to understand the ""how it's made"", which, on the present case, is absolutely fascinating.

"hellboy2681","Null","5","61","11 August 2006"," It's Amazing and Hollywood might remake into garbage!!!
","Chan Wook Park is an incredible director. Before seeing ""OLDBOY"" I would recommend you watch an earlier film of his called ""Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance."" His directing style is superb with complimenting angles the look very fresh but not distracting to the rest of the movie. It's a shame that there is not a bigger market for foreign films here in the U.S. and it saddens me more that Hollywood would rather make a remake rather than to mass distribute the Korean version which is PERFECT AS IT IS!!! Hollywood apparently feels that we the people can not read and watch a movie at the same time or in worser terms they want to Hollywood up this film and kill it. The reason i mentioned Park's earlier film and here is the spoiler part he has the tendency at the end of the film where both main characters die, with the exception in Oldboy but then again Oh-Dae-su doesn't really get the revenge his was hoping for. It doesn't matter which is which, his style makes you feel for both characters. You sympathize with the villain and his cause and for the heroin in his. But all in all his films are just flat out entertaining, they make you think of morality and how society might at times push people to do drastic things, so who cares if both main characters die? In real life wanting to be the hero could get you killed and that goes for the villain as well. So suck it up, finally a realistic film with good character development, great story and plot lines, and great directing UN-hollywoodized. Enjoy it, and share it!"

","Oldboy reviewed by Sam Osborn <br/><br/>rating: 4 out of 4<br/><br/>To describe Oldboy would be to imagine Franz Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis mixed with Quentin Tarantino's revenge saga Kill Bill and placed in the cities, schoolrooms, and prisons of South Korea. That would give you a vague idea of what this film attempts. Now add elements of thick brutality, sexual torture, bizarre time-jumps and head-spinning revelations, and you may be able to envision the strange and beautiful symphony that is Oldboy. <br/><br/>Oh Dae-Su (Min-sik Choi) wakes up in a room. The window is plastered over with a cheap painting of the countryside, there's a bed, a television, and a small bathroom. Each night, gas is spilled through the crack in his door, Oh Dae-Su passes out and is awakened later with his hair cut. All there is to do is watch TV, beat at the walls with his fists, and chip away at the brick wall. Dae-su is imprisoned in this room eating fried dumplings and being hypnotized into amnesia for fifteen years. All without knowing who has imprisoned him and why they did so. He vows that his only objective when he escapes is to hunt down his keeper and eat him. That's right, eat him. The premise sounds as simplistic as a general revenge thriller but believe me, there is little about Oldboy that could be described as ""simple"".<br/><br/>You'll first notice Director Chan-wook Park's take on his material. Like Kafka did with The Metamorphosis, Park skips interim fluff between important sequences and nearly always just cuts to the chase. Rarely are we faced with a scene that doesn't contain an essential revelation or storyline twist. Each scene is essential in constructing Park's maze-like screenplay and does so with a pace that's unrelenting in its speed. Also, Park loves to confuse reality with dream in Oldboy. Again relating the film to Kafka's novella, Park never really discerns between fact and fiction. Many times we're presented with a scene that seems strictly dream-like (a woman on a train inhabited only by a giant ant), only to have the film carry on in the very reality we previously realized only as imagination. And he never lets us settle with characters we believe to be human. For instance, because Dae-Su's only linguistic interaction for the last fifteen years was with his television, most of his words in the real world come straight from the ""truths"" he heard from the TV. And many of the characters, despite making human mistakes, take vengeance in the most inhuman of ways. Dae-Su's weapon of choice is a hammer for pete's sake! <br/><br/>But much of Oldboy's power comes from its incredible honesty. Park uses his Kafka-esquire plotting to keep us on the edge of our seats, even in the most inhumane of moments. His violence is brutal, his sex is real, and most of all, his taste for revenge is simply palpable. He grips our psyche to mold us to his film's will, drawing us deeper into its convoluted reality and spitting us out when he's all through. It's a twisted, cathartic experience that I absorbed for days afterward. It works on all angles of our cerebral organ, evoking emotions and images that I will not soon forget."

You HAVE to remember he was locked up for 15 years, his family was killed, he cant go to any of his friends anymore, in that 15 years he was locked up he lost his ENTIRE life. I think the scenes were they showed him locked up people just look at that as another scene, and not what it really was. The scenes of him locked up, gradually showed him losing his mind, and when released it transfered over into his quest of revenge. Don't let the negative comments keep you from seeing this movie. Its a classic movie. Go see it</li></ul>"

","While I don't think this film was by any means a masterpiece I don't quite understand the derision its receiving. <br/><br/>I think it's important to remember to not take this film out of context, it's surreal and highly stylised because its like a Manga cartoon. This is where i think it derives many of its driving themes/styles. So please before condemning this film for being unrealistic, it's not meant to, or too violent, much of the violence is necessary to establish the characters motives it's not just stylistic. <br/><br/>I don't understand issues over the 'gratuitous' violence, very little of which we actually see. Compare Saving Prv Ryan far more gratuitous, it's war we know people legs etc blown off there no specific reason to show it. Lets not forget the guy has been incarcerated for 15 years and he doesn't know why. Not that I can being to speculate as to psychological condition of such an individual but I suspect that you might be a little gnashed off. I think I would be willing to rip the teeth out of someone responsible to find out why. <br/><br/>Regaring the climatic scene (it seems people had the most problem with this) I don't think Dae-su cuts his tongue off because he sympathises and wants to illustrate his regret to Woo-jin Lee. If that was the case why did he try to kill him with the devise he thought was controlling his pacemaker. His motive is to protect his daughter from finding his identity. If as I suspect Woo-jin never intended to kill Mido, although unknown to Dea-su, he simply wants to visit a punishment to Dea-su that he sees as appropriate. Further he wants Dea-su to understand what he has done, the repercussions of his actions. Don't forget that Woo-jin says something like "" We didn't hypnotise you to erase the memory of what you said to initiate the rumour you just forgot."" Woo-jin wants Dae-su to suffer a similar pain and, I think, for him to recognise his role and feel guilt/remorse. Dae-su realises Woo-jin wants a recognition of his transgressions and so must convince Woo-jin that he regrets what he did hence he cuts out his tongue because he 'talks to much' what could be more appropriate. This is sufficient to satisfy Woo-jin he promptly kills himself, his work is done ""now, what joy will I have left to live for?"" . Dae-su is driven to this act only to protect his daughter it not gratuitous or wanton its absolutely necessary, because it alludes to lengths he will go to to that end. But does he have himself hypnotised to prevent her from finding the truth or because he cant bear the trauma of the monster he has become. <br/><br/>There were many comments regarding the octopus scene. The guy has had no contact with living beings bar a guard giving him food through the hatch for 15 years. Further all he's eaten during this time is dumplings. I think the scene has the effect of illustrating his desire to connect with something living. Whether human or not."

","Someone recommended this film to me recently, and I thought I'd give it a go. I didn't really know what to expect, half expected it to be some kung fu woo chop affair. I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a deep movie, from the get go, with the way he describes the passing of time with his TV as his only companion, to the part where he goes out finding the people who locked him up, I knew this was going to be more than just your average bloke gets wronged somehow, gets trained up and then kills the bad guy type movie. In fact the ending is far from your typical Hollywood 'all works out nicely for the good guy' type ending, it's pretty bad for our Oh Daesu (won't get into, watch it to find out) and does leave you something to ponder when you get to the end. I hear they're remaking this, I wish they'd just leave it alone, it doesn't need to be done again in my opinion!<br/><br/>Pretty disturbing, but great 9/10 !"

","OLDBOY really affected me - I hadn't seen something like this in a long time - something that truly did creep me out. I agree the film has its problems but the acting is sterling (especially the lead guy)there are some amazing sequences of action and emotion and violence and some terrific camera-work. I hate it though when people have to react so violently when they don't like something - okay, so you disagree with some of the strong reviews and awards this film got. Fine. You didn't like it. Okay. But you all are hypocrites when you lash out at others who don't share your opinion. You liked this?? Bull****! This seems to the main thrust of many of the negative reviews and I don't get it. I get that you may not have liked OLDBOY. I have many times not liked films that the mainstream gushes over and throws awards at: I think Forrest Gump is incredibly overrated, but I don't lash out at those who embrace it. The main plot turn of this movie - guy in drunk tank, gets bailed out, stops to make phone call in the rain, boom - you wake up somewhere and you are a prisoner. If you go with that in pulp fiction kinda way - it really is quite disturbing. And the process of someone trying not to go mad, trying to work out in their mind all the people they have wronged - powerful stuff - especially when the lead actor is so strong. Plus the infamous loooong hallway fight with him and his hammer - slowly moving down the hall in all camera shot - it is great. Can totally understand that this film would not be everyone's cup of tea - but I enjoyed it - flaws and all."

","This is a marvelous film, although sometimes unbearably cruel. The two characteristic points of the film that impressed me were: 1) The effect of the unexpected. We watch a man dreaming of vengeance, and organizing it, and finally we find out that he himself is the target of a vengeance. 2) The exaltation of the feeling of love. This exaltation is hardly convincing in ordinary heterosexual love. It reminds me of the love stories of Marques, in stories like ""Del amor y otros demoniosÂ…"", ""mis tristes putas"", ""Madam Butterfly"" of Henry David Hwank, and ""Mary's dog"" of Andreas Mitsou, a Greek writer. Here we see the incestuous love sanctified, the love between a brother and sister, and the love between a father and a daughter. The pursue of vengeance is what magnifies this feeling of incestuous love, always condemned by society, which leads the girl to suicide and the man to self- mutilation in an attempt to avoid the revelation. The act of forgiveness makes the story evade the typicality of an ordinary vengeance plot."

","Oldboy is a twisty, confounding shape-shifter of a film, but it doesn't give one the impression of leaning on its own narrative conceits like a lot of movies do. There's more to Oldboy than story contrivance; there's real manic energy being expended, and there's a tonal complexity that makes it seem almost novelistic. Most movies would be content to be as dynamic as Oldboy, as syntactically accomplished, as fearless, but Oldboy is also existentialistic; it's an action movie that not only dabbles in philosophy but, in its way, puts across a picture of the universe. It seems as immersed in Zeitgiest as the German films of the twenties; it conveys a sense of a world tottering on the edge of sanity, a landscape composed of equal parts paranoia, bloodlust and desperate longing. It has urgency, but it doesn't only have urgency; it has a kind of indolence underneath this, a gravity keeping the crazy parts of the story from flying apart. The film is kinetic, but there's an undercurrent that flows a lot more sluggishly, that balances the frantic surface action. There's a strange calm at the center of Oldboy, the tranquility one might perceive while peering into a bottomless abyss.<br/><br/>The plot can only be described as a devious piece of manipulation, an implausible yet deeply satisfying load of malarkey. It begins in a prison cell that looks like a hotel room; Dae-Su, an average man with a few guilty secrets, awakes from a bender to find himself imprisoned here, not knowing who is responsible for his captivity, or what he did to deserve it. Being locked up, not to mention intermittently drugged and subjected to the arts of a hypnotist, is liable to put anyone in a vengeful mood, and this is just what happens to Dae-Su, who endures years of tedium relieved only by television, wall-punching and the occasional suicide attempt, only to be released suddenly into an outside world scarcely less inscrutable than that of the prison. Dae-Su, haggard and thirsty for revenge, sets out to learn the identity of the man responsible for his incarceration, and in the process becomes involved with a young chef, Mi-Do, who aids him in his endeavors. The ex-prisoner's adversary, Woo-Jin, is some kind of wealthy but depressed playboy, who seems to enjoy toying with the hapless Dae-Su, but may in fact have more perverse things on his mind than simple torture.<br/><br/>The unraveling of the puzzle is handled with astonishing skill by Chan-Wook Park, a director who rivals Tarantino for cinematic flair. Park's formidable sense of syntax is demonstrated in the early passages of Dae-Su's imprisonment; Park compresses time beautifully here, and conveys Dae-Su's progression from disorientation to wild anger to sharply-honed, desperate anger. Then there are moments where Park seems to merely revel in the opportunity to create strange cinematic effects. The best one happens during a fight-scene in a corridor; Park stages the scene as one unbroken shot, the camera tracking laterally down the length of the hallway where Dae-Su, proficient in fighting after years of practicing in his cell, tangles with an endless succession of martial arts baddies. The scene seems like an embodiment of everything the film is: it's both kinetic and strangely still; the cut-away quality of the shot creates the sense of staring at ants in an ant-farm, the objectivity of, if not a god, then someone capable of adopting a god-like point-of-view. Trying to make sense of his situation is, for Dae-Su, a little like trying to piece together fragments of bad dreams, hoping for some ultimate clarity; not unlike what Kafka's heroes went through in their efforts to hash out the rules of a universe where the rules were beyond comprehension, where the shape of things was always changing. Park creates a labyrinth for Dae-Su to navigate, a maze of shifting walls where the shifting is anything but random. The syntax, the beautiful fitting-together of the images, creates the sense of an elegant but violent, inclement, pressure-cooker universe.<br/><br/>The movie seems suffused with existential dread, the jitteriness and confusion of modern life. Dae-Su is a kind of puppet, his actions determined beforehand not by fate or god but by his mysterious antagonist, Woo-Jin, who is also ruled by things beyond his understanding, his conscious control. Neither man is ultimately the master of his fate; they circle each other like lonely worlds in orbit, spinning closer and closer, doomed to collide and destroy each other. The gravity that holds these men together is a mutual need for vengeance; the story details Dae-Su's quest for revenge, then turns itself inside-out and shows that Woo-Jin is really trying to get revenge on Dae-Su. Movies often tackle this theme of revenge-lust as a kind of trap, but in Oldboy the trap seems bigger than this. Dae-Su is a bug in a maze, but Woo-Jin is a bug in a bigger maze. The universe becomes labyrinthine, human motivation boiled down to simple, bloody imperatives. The movie is savage, sometimes absurdly so (a live octopus is consumed at one point; at another a man has his teeth yanked out with the claw-end of a hammer), but the savagery is only part of the picture. There's a sadness underneath the whole thing, conveyed most touchingly by the relationship between Dae-Su and Mi-Do, who become lovers, spirits united at least for awhile against the cruelty, the confusion of life. It's easy to see a movie like Oldboy only in terms of surface effect, of action and blood and sadism, but there are undercurrents running through everything that show how deeply-felt the film-making is despite the shock-scenes, the Asian-cinema hysteria, the reveling in violence. It's a film at once simple and intricate, elegant and brutal, violent and tender."

","Many things have been written about this Korean movie, both praising it and bashing it. I just watched it for the first time and found a movie that, even when it's not perfect, it's definitely worth a look, at least so one can make an opinion about it.<br/><br/>The plot is well known these days, a man is locked in an apartment for 15 years, and has 5 days to get his revenge. Very simple, and very complex at the same time. What has this man done to be locked like that? Why is he released after 15 years? and why doe she have the chance to get a revenge? These questions are what drives the main character, Oh-Dae-Su, and the questions that keep the suspense among the audience.<br/><br/>Adapted from a Manga(Japanese comic), the film's beautiful camera work and outstanding direction really create a visually stunning piece of art. There are scenes full of surrealism that really display a visual poetry and flow like water, thanks to a near-perfect edition. The infamous corridor scene must be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part good, and we really feel for Dae-Su, who is some sort of bizarre Count of Montecristo. We go from this regular guy who after 15 years of torture turns into a subhuman being, a monster as he calls himself, a pawn in a game that he doesn't know. It's a very Kafkian feeling.<br/><br/>The main criticism to the film goes to the way the script is developed. It's not really a bad script, but the story unfolds in a way that leaves the audience unsatisfied. I won't spoil a thing, but it has to do with the fact that one ends up wondering if the revenge had any sense.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not sure if the cultural differences are responsible of this, but I felt that when the motif of Dae-Su's 15 year torture is revealed, the movie loses steam and wraps up the wrong way. Maybe it's because western audiences are used to a more active attitude towards revenge, but somehow it doesn't live up to the expectation. As I wrote above, one ends feeling that everything had no sense at all.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, and putting that aside, ""Oldboy"" is still a movie worth a view, if only for the astounding camera work and the solid direction. Watch it with an open mind and make your own opinion of it.<br/><br/>Solid 7.5/10"

","I have been catching up with Korean films since I viewed I SAW THE DEVIL a couple of months ago. That film blew me away. It was a very violent revenge story. The film was uncomfortable to watch but the story was compelling and emotional, not just violent. I had read a lot of great things about OLDBOY. I didn't know much about the plot, but assumed that it would be good from all the great things I read about it.<br/><br/>After seeing this film I really don't get why it got such accolades. The basic outline of the story is that a man is put in an isolated room for 15 years in a cell that looks like a hotel room. He escapes the cell and begins a frantic search for truth and revenge. All of this sounds promising doesn't it? We it starts out very well. But as the film goes along it gets so convoluted and strange that it just lost me. The film stars Choi Min-sik as Oh Dae-su, the man that is imprisoned. When he gets out he is given a cell phone in which he gets a call from his captor. His captor refuses to tell him why he was imprisoned. What follows is a web of violent revenge and deception. His captor wants to make Oh Dae-su suffer. Again, the basic story could have been very involving but this film is done in such a slow meandering and overall weird way that I just didn't care for it. I won't give away much, but this film is so pretentious and self serious for it's own good. The violence in the film is very brutal, but without the emotional connection it just seems gratuitous. I've read reviews of this film hailing it as a masterpiece, I just dont get it? It is well filmed but so outrageous that it lost me. Not for the faint of heart. I won't see this again."

","For now, ""Oldboy"" still remains the best foreign movie I've ever seen. Ultimately because you just don't see films like this, as its revenge story is just so utterly raw and powerful only the East would get it right.<br/><br/>Its very obvious Park Chan Wook had passion for the Manga it was based on (Personally I do not like all Manga, aside from a few exceptions). Being that the original story would not make for something entirely gripping, Wook inserts one of the most brutal revenge schemes ever conceived in cinema. Showing the raw tragedy all parties must face when chasing vengeance.<br/><br/>Oh-Dae-Su is the kind of protagonist you will feel pity, sympathy, empathy and hate throughout all acts of the movie. It's a unique trait that usually takes a cast of many to portray in a single movie, yet Choi Min-Sik delivers all of them to this damaged man perfectly. He is kidnapped off the street and placed in a hotel room for 15 years, after multiple gassing and suicide attempts he begins a quest to find out who did this to him in a record of many angry individuals. Upon his release he immediately sets out on his mission with the aid of Mi-do (Kang Hye-Jung), who has taken a bizarre interest in his endeavour.<br/><br/>From the opening as the film begins to tell us and reveal Oh-Dae-Su's thoughts, it reminds me a lot of the pacing from Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). It's incredibly hard to reveal a damaged individuals thoughts in a movie, and make it compelling as there are so many imitations. Yet Wook employs the right amount of quirky characters and places them all in ""real time"" via 5 days by act 2 & 3, that the narrative is constantly strong throughout the 2 hour running time.<br/><br/>The camera work I feel is superb, and the special effects are kept to a minimal. I've grown tired of slow motion in fight choreography, and ""Oldboy"" has undoubted one of the best corridor fight scenes ever created. Every punch has weight, and every torture scene is brutal yet relevant. It's indescribably gorgeous, and doesn't shy away from how a revenge story should be depicted.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: To conclude, I very much loved this movie. I have watched it multiple times and my love for it only deepens. Please avoid the Spike Lee remake at the very least, until you have seen this picture. 10/10. Unforgettable."

","Got a chance to see this movie an year back, a wonderful masterpiece<br/><br/>Plot : An average family man with a wife and a daughter is being kidnapped and his wife is killed and he gets framed for the murder and his daughter is made an orphan. He is being set as a prisoner in an isolated room for 15 years without being informed as to why he's kept there. He tries to escape, tries suicide but all in vain. Exactly after 15 years he's released from the room without any explanation. The remaining story revolves on him finding who is his captor and why he did this to him and who takes the final vengeance.<br/><br/>One of an unique movie that I have seen so far, you will never be able to predict the movie. Will keep you in the edge of your seat till the end. Most who have seen this movie have said including me that it is not digestible and highly controversial story. But still have to give credit to the director for his story telling and a compelling narration.<br/><br/>Rating - 10/10!.. Recommended for Movie lovers who want a unique and a fresh story and screenplay."

","I read some reviews and some people think Oldboy is overrated, and i can not understand it. Because this movie is unique!<br/><br/>This movie have a great story ,when you think i could not be more surprised then you get to the end and WOW! What a revenge masterpiece! I really enjoyed this movie,of course i watched in the original language with subtitles. It is always better watch the movies with the original language.For those who are undecided to watch or not Oldboy, just this : MUST SEE!<br/><br/>We can think this question: How will we see the society past 15 years stuck in a room?"
"riziger","9","1","6","13 March 2013"," Dark, disturbing, brilliant.
","Oldboy is a Korean film based on the Japanese Manga of the same name. It is definitely one of the more known Korean films that has been released in recent history which I believe established Park Chan-woo's name to the rest of the world. As it's a really tightly wound plot with twist and turns galore, I'll just say that it centres around vengeance and revenge in a dark manner.<br/><br/>First off, Choi Min-sik delivers one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. The desperation, hope and then hopelessness, joy, despair and weakness are all played out with such commitment that you feel it with him. Yu Ji-Tae, the antagonist, plays a rather more understated role but I felt he had such presence that I looked forward to his appearances. The 2 leads carry most of the film and it really just centres around them both.<br/><br/>The cinematography is definitely different to what I've seen and it was refreshing. The Manga influence shows through with most shots towards the end, and I'm sure they were close to how it was portrayed in the manga. Then there is that famous one-shot fight scene that's pretty impressive when you think about it. It has caught a bit of flak for the excessive violence and sex scenes but I felt they just added more to the plot and keeping the viewer immersed. Definitely a must-watch."

","Revenge, confusion, vengeance, and love-gone-awry create a wild labyrinthine ride in ""Oldboy."" Though unaware this was the second of a trilogy in the director's work when I watched it via rental, that sequence, in retrospect, did not affect my appreciation of this unique, award-winning film. At my own start of a learning curve about Korean movies, ""Oldboy"" seems startling in its conception, plot twists, shock value, and psychological insight. But mild-mannered it is not.<br/><br/>Some elements might seem to hit a near-cartoon level, but they all seemed to work, with the main character's distressed and furious need to punish those who for 15 years punished him by holding him hostage without apparent reason. His manic search, the backward-seeking journey for answers, and the unfolding of events all pull the viewer into a dark and at times frighteningly comic conspiracy. <br/><br/>Often the writer's and director's revelations struck me as truly stellar. The mingling of revenge and rage, love and loss -- the sadistic, violent elements of the whole experience pale in comparison to the psychological reflection that makes this film such a memorable and important one."

","This is a movie for the not lighthearted. It is almost pure tragedy. This middle-aged man suddenly finds himself imprisoned, after 15 years, he is released no reasons given. While he is seeking for his revenge, he realizes that himself is the object of another revenge. Despite the mind-numbing suffering in the movie, it is about love. But it is love that is misplaced. Does that make love still as what we think what love is? Oldboy certainly asks the question, and creates the climate for the audience to form their answer in a fair way. The magnificent acting makes us more involved. The story line is so well connected and the suspense of the story progress so cleverly. For those who like to receive a thank you to listen to this man's saddening story, you will not regret it as long as you are open enough to see the love that is blurred and hidden within the violence."

Old Boy wasn't even nominated. It should have been nominated in , at least, these categories; Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Movie, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Leading Actor (Min-sik Choi).

","That the director of this film liked Hitchcock films is clearly evident. Though I would have to put also in there Brian De Palma (Another Hitchcock devotee) since the film was reminiscent for me of his film Obsession.<br/><br/>The movie is very suspenseful, though I have to admit very unreal. You mean to tell me you can be locked up for 15 years, watch TV, practice fighting by yourself, and knock out 22 guys at a time. Though perhaps one could think that these characters were told to make sure they didn't kill or triumph over this main character by the protagonist. Much of the other issues of the film, regarding his 15 years of captivity are in my opinion far fetched.<br/><br/>As for the age of the protagonist, on the DVD I saw, the commentary by the director gives his explanation of the youthfulness of the protagonist.<br/><br/>If you can stand the violence of this film, I recommend it, but I can't say I would want to see the other works of this director, though I believe some say his other two revenge films are better.<br/><br/>The acting by the lead actor is excellent, (Sorry that I can't put his name down), we see him go from this drunken fat slob, to becoming a supper man. Also something that I noticed, which others I don't believe have mentioned. When the main character becomes this superman, he bears a curious resemblance to an American actor who died the same year this film was released, that actor being Charles Bronson. Has anyone else noticed this?"

","I'm not going to pretend I know everything about movies, or very much about movies. I am sure there are many people using this website that would look at comments posted by people and say ""these people don't know what they are talking about, they are typical people who watch in awe at generic action films and only watch some films just to be different"". That said, I am confused...I really liked this film, I think it was smartly made and the characters are made so no one is perfect. I like that there is no real ""hero"" in this film, just characters with agendas and I think the direction in this film is good.<br/><br/>So I have given my opinion of the film, now for you who may be judging me by these comments I will explain why I am confused as it says in the summary. I've been reading many of the reviews for this film, and find that a lot of the negative ones criticise the people that comment on the film. I know, I know, I'm supposed to be Mr ""I don't give a crap"" but I was under the impression this was a movie review, not a reviewer review, so I am going to create a paradox to be pondered for the ages and actually criticise reviewers. I propose that it is THESE people, these egotistical, elitist people who watch films to be different. Who like ""art house"" films so they can say ""I know a lot about films"" and justify it by asking people ""have you seen this film"" and when they say no, their ego can be inflated.<br/><br/>For those of you who are also confused, yes, I'm talking to YOU the person who gives this 1 star (which implies it is the worst film you have ever seen) and then ask why it has such a high rating, I must invite you to the world of OPINION. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, YOU ARE, I am, EVERYONE IS. I understand you're better than me when it comes to films, that doesn't change my opinion of the film, it does make me think you're a moron, but the film still, I think is good. As for giving it 1 star which I think is unreasonable (kudos to those who give it 4/5 stars and give it the exact same negative review, at least you're realistic) compare it to...the S Club 7 movie and tell me if you think it is worse than that, if you're answer is ""it is obviously not worse than that"" then could it be that it merits more than 1 star? I would like to finish this completely annoying, arrogant rant by explaining my love for reviewers like the ones I have described who are elitist, who watch art house to have a slight personality, because you make my life worth living.<br/><br/>My OPINION of OLDBOY, I liked it, look at the rating it has, it's high, most people DO like it which means you will probably like it due to the simple math of probability...unless you are someone who likes to be different. Just go watch it for yourself and add another comment of YOUR OPINION"

Even the final end might seem confusing if you watch the movie at a late hour (not the best idea I've ever had, I admit). <br/><br/>Secondly, the PAIN. The physical pain wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, but the psychological torture was beyond anything I've seen before. Imagine the strength of sledgehammers, and then imagine the same amount of strength toying with your head. That's why the peak of psychological abuse was a tad more than I could bare.<br/><br/>Personally, I hated the experience and loved the film.

Tortuously plotted in a distinctly Oriental way and very well done if it has to be done at all.<br/><br/>From the beginning we know things are not going to be straightforward when Dae-su Oh, (brilliantly played by Min-sik Choi), is kidnapped for no apparent reason, imprisoned by his captor for 15 years, then released back into the world complete with clothes, money and cellphone. Not so much a whodunit then, (that is revealed midway through), but why? The violence is excruciating; the set pieces quite extraordinary. The problem is, it does go on a bit."

","Old Boy. Why this is a very decent film. For those people who like films and have a sense of theatrical and cinematographic history. If you are familiar with the concept of ""tragedy"" as it has evolved from the ancient Greeks: Euripedes, Aeschylus et al, through Shakespeare and the Renaissance tragedians and, in more modern times, Beckett, Brecht etc... then you will know that as far as contemporary mainstream Western cinema in concerned, this genre is all but dead. However, this is not the case in the Far East, as Old Boy shows. This film explores the great tragic grand narratives but with the inclusion of a Kafkaesque twist. If you are not moved it is because you do not feel. This film is, by degrees: absurd, comic, tragic. Despite its eastern heritage there are touches of The Revenger's Tragedy and other plays that would be spoilers to mention. This is not a film where violence is the central tenet. Violence arises out of the circumstances in which the main character finds himself. Like the best of ancient Greek tragedy it shows us much about the human condition and how we are to live. Watch it - imagine if you had to live it."

It's a masterpiece if I ever saw one. The acting is never short of amazing, even though the story line pushes its protagonists from one extreme to the other, they always remain true. The photography is superb, the editing and pacing keep the viewers glued to their sits for the entire 120 minutes. And the plot itself, is an unequaled wonder. It's a Greek tragedy (or a Shakespearian tragedy if you will) set in our modern world, and yet it always looks real, much of it is due to the breathtaking performance of the cast, but they could never do it if the plot wasn't there to carry them through.

","""Oldboy"" is a mind-bending revenge tale that ventures into the emotional extremes, and no chance of emerging exhausted unscathed. Full of grand passions, bloodthirsty violence, with a wicked sense of jet black humor, ""Oldboy"" is a sadistic masterpiece. The director, Chan-wook Park, is one among several filmmakers who've made South Korean cinema what it is today, and requires a viewing at least once by serious moviegoers.<br/><br/>The plot is utterly unique: Seoul businessman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi), is kidnapped one rainy evening by parties unknown. He awakens in a seedy motel room – complete with hideously tacky wallpaper, threadbare carpet, a double bed, and a television – but in reality, it serves as a cell. Days, months, and years go by with no explanation given for his incarceration. A daily meal comes through a tiny slot in the door, and every so often sleeping gas seeps in as well. From the television in his room, he learns that he is the prime suspect for the murder of his wife –- and now, even if he escapes, he's a wanted man.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Dae-su awakes one day on a grass-covered roof of a downtown building in Seoul, outfitted with a finely tailored suit, a cell phone, and a wallet stuffed with cash. Before Dae-su can begin a new life, he must answer several key questions about his imprisonment. Only after he has these answers can he exact his revenge and turn the page. Meanwhile, his captor decides to turn Dae-su's quest for answers into a cruel, exhausting game that will push him to his limits. Additionally, he has just five days to not to only find out why he was held captive, but to also identify his tormentor, and seek his revenge.<br/><br/>The committed performance by Min-sik Choi strikes a genuinely tragic note amid the mayhem and cartoonish excesses of violence. He does a marvelous job walking on the edge of insanity, while retaining likability and compassion from the audience. Superlative acting across the board, and a pulsating score to compliment the arresting imagery, while the true astuteness of the script will reward only on further viewings.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" has a wild, twisty storyline on such an epic scale emotionally, and it rarely slows down to consider the logic of some of its most outrageous plot contortions. The revelation in the third act is a bit of a letdown considering the thrilling, ambitious set up. Cinematic in the extreme, the movie has an emotional core that will leave some viewers stunned, yet others disgusted. As tough as it is to endure -- it is brutal, yet brilliant -- and it is undoubtedly a work of art.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, directed by Chan-wook Park, preceded by ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (2002) and followed by ""Lady Vengeance"" (2005)."
"patryk-czekaj","9","1","7","9 November 2012"," A smashing movie that will leave you dazzled
","Being a gripping, thrilling and harrowing tale of revenge, Oldboy attacks the audience with its unsettling atmosphere and graphic scenes of brutality. From the very first minutes the film successfully grasps one's attention and doesn't stop to astound until the final, shocking moments. It's an intriguing, mysterious, and bloody seductive movie, which presents a story so gruesome and unforgiving that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br/><br/>When Oh Dae-su is imprisoned for 15 years for unknown reasons and eventually gets out, he has only two questions in mind: why and who? While trying to capture his oppressors he wants to uncover the real purpose behind this outrageous event that ruined his life for good. With the help of a lovely young girl, he succumbs to the lone warrior's way and finds out more about himself and his life than he intended to. <br/><br/>In the film the revenge goes both ways, and as soon as we discover what the whole story is about we won't be able to forget how powerful and, at the same time, discomforting the film really is.<br/><br/>Chan Wook Park did an amazing job directing the film, but probably his greatest decision was casting the superb Min-sik Choi in the titular role. His frighteningly beastly attitude serves everyone right, as he defeats his enemy with cold blood and uncovers all the clues one after another, only to arrive at a conclusion that has much to do with a forgotten past. Great entertainment, not for the squeamish."

Choi Min-sik is one of my favourite parts of this film; his performance as Oh Dae-su is absolutely believable and he shows a lot of heart and passion in his quest for vengeance. Oh Dae-su and we as the audience learn that it is more a journey for the truth as to why Dae-su was imprisoned for 15 years rather than a journey for revenge against whoever did this to Dae-su. This is real indie art-house cinema and it is beautiful, sometimes brutal an other time s chilling, but always powerful. I'll never forget the twist at the end where Dae-su's captor had made him commit incest with his daughter the whole time! Not to mention the painful yet beautifully shot moment where Dae-su cuts out his tongue. The ending was just so beautiful, what a perfect way to end this film with a wintry landscape and a view of a snowy mountain throughout the entire end credits. Oldboy is a magnificent piece of foreign cinema, though some of the violence and the sex scenes I have a problem with, other than that it is a gorgeous and beautifully edited, directed and acted masterpiece!

"Boba_Fett1138","9","1","7","8 September 2011"," I don't even know why but it worked!
","Calling this movie original doesn't even suffice. It's an unique one really, that takes its own approach with its storytelling and keeps on doing its own thing throughout. It's unlike anything else which also makes it hard to explain why it works out so well all.<br/><br/>It's Asian, so you know that 90% of the time you are going to get something weird. Weird sounds perhaps a bit disrespectful but I mean this is a compliment really, since this often means you're getting something unusual, unexpected, unique and I just absolutely love it most of the time, even when I have no idea what is going on.<br/><br/>And this movie can also get complicated but only when you are not paying full attention to it, or watching it without subtitles perhaps. Fore the story of ""Oldeuboi"" is in essence quite simple and very straight-forward. It's a revenge flick, in which a man searches for the one that held him captive for 15 years. On his search and surrounding his story lots of other stuff is of course happening, that are however often important as clues, as to what is truly going on and what the big reveal at the end will be. It's makes this movie work on a mystery and thriller level, without really following the usual pattern of a mystery or thriller movie. Same goes for all of the other aspects, such as its romance and drama. The movie isn't really black & white with any of its themes and good persons aren't just good and bad persons aren't just evil. This whole approach to its themes of course help to make the movie a surprising one, in which you never really know what you are going to get next.<br/><br/>It's also a movie filled with action and plenty of graphic moments. Many people experience this movie as very disturbing because of that, also since it gets all combined with its unusual and uneasy style and atmosphere. To be honest if have seen far worse things done in films and therefore also never really felt too disturbed by anything in this movie but I guess I'm also not average moviegoer, so my opinion of it isn't very representative for the average viewer.<br/><br/>But I think you can say that the biggest power behind this movie is the directing by Chan-wook Park. It's both technically and visually really a well made film, especially also when you're considering that this movie only cost apparently $3,000,000 to make. Not in anyway does this movie ever look cheap or hastily put together. The movie is made with attention to detail and its filled with plenty of unforgettable, well shot, sequences. So lots of credit also needs to go to Chung-hoon Chung, who did the cinematography and we also really shouldn't forget the musical score by Hyun-jung Shim, who did a more than great job!<br/><br/>But Min-sik Choi performance was just as important for the movie really. He plays a really, complex and divers character, that goes through lots of transitions throughout the movie, though people will mostly see and remember him as an extremely awesome character, that backs down for nothing and nobody. Charlie Bronson would had approved of him! He made Dae-su Oh a real classic film character, at least in certain circles.<br/><br/>Fore ""Oldeuboi"" remains mostly a fan favorite and a bit of a cult classic. a Bit of a shame, since the movie is one that deserves a far broader audience. Just don't let the sort of 'geekdom' that is surrounding this movie scare you off and experience this movie for yourself. Big fat chance you end up really liking it.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"gatyngaj","6","1","7","28 August 2008"," It's okay, I suppose
","This film has a whole lot of what I like (I'm a self-proclaimed geek)-- I often get a kick out of fight scenes that are only realistic in comic books and intriguing and somewhat mysterious plots that have an interesting twist towards the last half of a film. I should like Oldboy more than I do, but it falls flat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's the plot that weighs the film down. It does have its redeeming factors. The actors and the cinematography are wonderful. And I like dumplings. And watching a man eating a live octopus is always fun. Memorable scenes are a huge chunk of this movie. Those were the main factors that kept the movie from falling to the depths of Hell. It was interesting how the film sets up its message in regards to talking too much, incestuous relations, isolation and revenge, but the plot is fluff. Speaking of revenge and big mouths, what was the central message that kept the film going? One or the other? It seemed as if the film went back and forth between each concept, among others, such as isolation and whatnot. The film is all over the place. It is not cohesive. Thus, it would have been something almost as grand as its ratings if it was pieced together properly.<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 5, but as I said, its redeeming qualities made this worth sitting through, at least for me. It IS an intriguing plot, although the twists can be seen miles away and it could have been better."
"noizyme","7","4","63","2 September 2005"," Ichi fans will love it, unfamiliar movie fans will have a new love of cinema
","So I saw the trailer for this film because it was on this site (imdb.com) as a recommendation for fans of Ichi The Killer, the first movie I'd seen that features pretty outlandish characters and a violent plot connected to the story. The trailer was awesome (because it including a lot of the visuals that make Ichi so great), but when I rented Oldboy, I found it was lacking many other scenes such as when the guy falls from the top of the building onto the car and so forth. But there's much more than witty special effects to grab hold of your attention throughout the film.<br/><br/>The story is set up to be pretty straightforward, but once you get past the halfway point, you are given a deeper sense of what what going on with this guy and his enemies. Most people know the set up of the movie by the time you read this comment on it, so I'll spare you. What I can say, though, is that fans of Ichi will be delighted with how messed-up a story can get.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this film except that it was a little hard to follow...I can't pinpoint whether or not it had to do with the fact that I was listening to the overdubbed English for the movie and watching mismatching subtitles for it or what...I just lost the plot somewhere in between. It's worth another viewing, though, so don't think you can't watch it all the way through again. I loved the actor who played the main character who gets thrown into the hotel room for 15 years (although his younger, drunker self should probably not have made the movie). I gave it a 7/10 because it is better than just another typical film released in Japan which tries to get American audiences to like it...this genre that Oldboy and Ichi the Killer falls into is one that almost exists by itself and some artsier films like Tetsuo. Go check it out today."
"pc95","7","3","42","30 August 2005"," Trys too hard at the end, predictable - not bad though
","The first third of the movie was well done especially the first 15 minutes or so - it was deranged, strange, and well told with the main character's description of his past and the way the time flashed by. You see the characters torment. Some very witty lines shine too with him wondering whether imaginary TV training can carry into the real world. However the violence often becomes too much of a spectacle and at times too glorified. While the visual content sometimes I question, the style and make-up of the cinematography is well done. Unfortunately as is often the case with movies - the ending suffers; the twist is more for shock value and very predictable - they would've done better going a traditional route with it, or at least something with a little more integrity. Also, the final suicide is absolutely pointless further detracting. How could the father make that decision also?? Anyway, worth a look if you can handle the utter lack of integrity to stoop to for entertainment's sake I guess - are you entertained by immoral, base, and twisted ideas? If so enjoy."

","I don't know why a lot of people were dissatisfied with this film? probably because they were expecting too much. As a whole this film is truly a real breathtaking thriller, oldboy is not on top for nothing. The story is nice and fresh also, this is not the usual mindless story you have seen before. The story is very simple, a guy is put away in a prison and then release after 15 years. He must found out why he was put away in 5 days. yes the film is violent but it is gruesomely watchable.<br/><br/>At first I was scared because a lot of reviews in this site were negative towards the film, despite it's great reviews on the newspapers. After the film I was fully satisfied not only for the story but the way the film was shot. This is pure film-making people, the cinematography, photography and the close ups and the unforgettable twist makes this film operatic. You will agree with me when you will see the superb beginning of the end scene in the penthouse which is filmed masterfully.<br/><br/>Finally, you have some top notch acting, especially the way Oh Dae Su begs at the end. It's sad funny and shameful at the same time. The good editing keeps the pace and the mood of the film refreshing. You won't find scenes too long or too dull, it's fresh and the humour is a bit subtle, it gives charm to the film.<br/><br/>If you ever get a chance to see it don't skip it."
"carlosdev","9","5","94","11 April 2005"," Good Old Boy
","Thrillers often exist in a half-world of their own, with plot contrivances which serve no purpose other than to advance the plot to its conclusion. They rarely feel organic and thought out, existing for their own sake. ""Oldboy,"" a Korean revenge thriller, is one of those rare gems in which every plot point is part of an overall whole, not only advancing the plot but doing so in a logical manner that also rings true emotionally. For doing so, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004. Dae-Su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is a ne'er-do-well, an alcoholic who cheats on his wife compulsively and while on an epic bender, spends his daughter's birthday raving in a police lockup. Bailed out by his friend No-Joo Hwan (Dae-Han Ji), he goes to a telephone booth to call his daughter - and disappears, leaving only his pathetic present of angel wings behind. He wakes up in what appears to be a seedy hotel room, imprisoned behind locked doors; he is fed and cared for, once in awhile after a sprightly tune is played over unseen speakers, he is gassed, and attendants clean him up as well as his room. 15 years pass. He learns that his wife has been murdered and fingerprints and bloodstains found at the scene have led the police to believe that he is the killer. His daughter has been adopted by Swedish foster parents. Even if he escapes, he would be a wanted man, hunted by the authorities, but escape consumes him. He needs to know why he has been imprisoned, and who has done this to him. He desperately tunnels out of his room with a stray chopstick, but just before he would escape from his run-down prison, he is released, left with his journals, a wallet filled with cash, a stylish suit and a cell phone. He eventually discovers that he has a time limit to find out the answers to his questions, or someone he loves will die. But the question he should be asking is not why was he imprisoned, but why was he released. The acting, while occasionally over-the-top, rings true in most cases. The love interest Mido (Hye-Jyong Kang) is lustrous and willing to sacrifice everything, even if she doesn't quite understand why. Oh's obsession and rage are well-played by Choi; while Western tastes would find his work un-subtle, there is an emotional realism to his performance. Director Chan-Wook Park wisely makes his hero extremely flawed, leaping to disastrous conclusions and more-or-less muddling through the puzzle more than anything. He occasionally gets into fights, but is no fighter; whenever he fights, he tends to get his rear end kicked as much as anything. Still, he soldiers on, his need for vengeance exceeding his common sense. When his questions finally do get answered, his whole world - and the audience's expectations - will get turned around on it's ear. This is definitely not for squeamish viewers. There are scenes of torture and mayhem that made me turn away from the screen. There are also many humorous vignettes, keeping the film from drowning in darkness. For anyone, this is an outstanding film that deserves mainstream attention. See the original before the American remake comes out in 2006; no doubt the storyline will be ""Hollywood-ized"" beyond all recognition."

The cinematography is very good, there is a lot of very dark humor scattered throughout, and the story is convoluted enough to leave even the wisest cinema buff guessing what the outcome will be.

","First of all, I NEVER miss a South Korean film even though there have been 200 in all made for release. When I saw OLDBOY, I was mostly captivated by how nice the prison was and thoughtful to give the prisoners television. From there, it all was a question mark as to why people told me I MUST see it. There is no need for all the praise this film received or even the awards. I saw it won the Palme D'Or or first prize at the Cannes film festival which I have attended five times and sat by the jury section, because the head was an old friend of mine in the 60's, and I saw some really dreadful films get top awards and cinema was becoming very French and avant garde with New Wave directors and exuberance was riding the crest of fresh filmmaker and film-making. Well, this is the 21st century and OLDBOY was about as substandard a piece of ""genius"" as I have ever seen at Cannes or anywhere including my lazy-boy and giant screen and theater like stereo. Just remember that the French still consider Jerry Lewis a great filmmaker the next time you stand up cheering ""Bravo!"". IF all of you who thought this was brilliant, you never saw MY SASSY GIRL...talk about revolutionary film-making!

"squelcho","9","4","71","24 July 2005"," Kidnap, rendition and torture. Sounds fairly plausible to me.
","In the age of kidnap and rendition, this movie could easily be asking a more indirect question about blind revenge and skewed perceptions. People being people will always attempt to divert blame for their past follies on to handy fallguys. It's human nature to be spineless and cowardly. And the more wealth and power you have, the more spineless and cowardly you can afford to be. <br/><br/>I get the feeling that this movie has been getting such a panning on these boards because it makes a lot of the (predominantly male) hypersensitive homespun grinches a wee bit uncomfortable. In a world of paedophile priests and an explosive growth in reported child abuse in so called civilised countries, it's a brave film maker who is prepared to jab a red hot needle into the psychotic nerve of the beast called daddy. It's a film about base human nature with all its banal idiotic miscalculations, feeble excuses and self deceit. Which is a fair premise to work with.<br/><br/>A film is just some actors jabbering at a camera on some sets. The meanings and motives are in the eyes of the cinema-going or DVD renting beholder. Is it disgusting? Or maybe the hordes of apoplectic critics are just disgusted at their own reactions to these particular triggers?<br/><br/>It's a film. It's a work of fiction.

"michael-sj-lee","7","4","73","19 December 2005"," Culturally biased, may not be fully appreciated by some
","A majority of these comments are undeserving on both ends of the spectrum. Being a Korean American, there are things in the movie I take for granted. <br/><br/>replies on some previous comments: The octopus eating part which seems to confuse many of my fellow reviewers is something pretty common in south Korea. Wanting to eat something alive is supposed to symbolize strength.. etc. <br/><br/>Are Asian fighting scenes all supposed to be stylistically correct? The way people fight in this film is more realistic and identifiable with a country like south Korea. Even though we'd all like everyone else to think so, not all Asians are black belts (or whatever the highest level is) in their respective martial arts. <br/><br/>back to the movie: This movie relies on the audience's belief in the powers of hypnosis and most of the characters just being out of their minds. If you can't believe either, this movie will disappoint. The movie also heavily relies on the shock value of how far Woo-Jin goes to settle a childhood beef, and Dae-Su goes to save his daughter from knowing the truth as well as the gore and violence along the way. It may seem unbelievable that Woo-Jin would hold Dae-Su captive for so long, spend loads of money, then kill himself all because he had a relationship (one he had no shame for) with his sister that Dae-Su had allegedly told everyone about. Still, with Woo-Jin's extreme wealth and lack of further goals, it is plausible. The movie shows the various attitudes of Korean (asian) culture and how certain values like pride, shame, protection of family and self-sacrifice go beyond logic and reasoning. Desperation is frequently a strong catalyst of the character's motives.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the actors generally gave good performances (no real standouts here), cinematography and musical score were excellent, and plot was okay. The ending could have been less forgiving. I would have been more impressed with more chaos and suicides, but I don't think this movie would have been received well in Korea if it had been so. <br/><br/>recommended to most Asians, not so much to narrower minded, skeptical people.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Satyajit-dutt","10","4","74","24 January 2006"," A Very Different Movie
","This Movie has a very Dark and Different theme than most other movies, One has to watch the whole movie to understand what is actually happening. The story makes no sense to some people and may even be Repugnant and meaningless as it looks very absurd why a person is locked up for 14 years and then he is in this endless quest for finding his Vermin etc etc. What I feel deserves praise in this movie is a very realistic portrait of an Average Korean man who turns into this person who has been framed of killing his own wife and has lost everything for a reason he does not know. The answers are there at the end of the movie. A very natural and good performance by the character playing Oh Dae-Su. Direction is quite slick but has many small flaws like the Man whose teeth are pulled out and he gets replacement Gold Teeth in a day or so (instead of 2 to 3 months) , which is humanly impossible. I have seen remakes of this movie and now realise that Old Boy is pretty well made."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","3","51","30 November 2006"," First of all, why the 2008-scheduled remake? Why?!
","I try not to hate the idea of remaking films, especially since it does not detract anything from the legacy of the original film  but remaking 'Oldboy' strikes me as a puzzling move by Hollywood. The film is not good enough to merit a rehash and it is not bad enough to merit 'let's do better than this' jabs. <br/><br/>Chan-wook Park's notoriously violent revenge-movie proved a polarizing force upon release. On the one hand, it received the Palme D'or in Cannes 2004 and was crowned 'best movie of the year' by many teenage boys while on the other hand, audiences panned it for its weak pay-off. I am hesitant to join either camp, although I must say there are many things about Oldboy that jump out and grab you: the squid-eating scene, the pensive flashbacks, the gruesome torture scenes and the twist ending.<br/><br/>Yet the story is Oldboy's primary export and its mysterious unfolding keeps you on the edge of your seat. Ladiesman Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is suddenly kidnapped one day and jailed in a seedy hotel-room like compartment  for fifteen years. There is a bed, a desk, a bathroom cubicle and a TV, the latter acting as the only refuge for Dae-su. Here the film offers an unflinching look at how insanity sweeps across the tiny cell and into the lonely mind of our protagonist, who screams, beats his fists bloody into the wall and watches yet more TV. His narration to us keeps him sane, and keeps us up to date on how his thoughts are racing. Does someone have it in for him? Is this an elaborate experiment? Is revenge more important than the truth? All questions and no answers. ""You can't find the right answer,"" his jailer tells him when the spell of isolation is broken, ""...if you ask the wrong questions."" <br/><br/>When one day Dae-su Oh is inexplicably released by his unknown jailers, he naturally pends between anguish, rage and befuddlement with violent fits. Oldboy plunges into thoughts of vengeance that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace and director Chan-wook Park becomes ambitious, steering his film onto different paths. He uses a broad spectrum of emotion, action, mystery and suspense to accompany the dizzying story and also blends in some dark humour with deft, creative writing strokes. In other words, Oldboy cannot quite decide what it wants to be. With a seemingly extra-template love storyline courtesy of the young girl Mi-do who takes the maladapted Dae-su Oh in, it boldly defies categorization, tipping over into romance territory. Mi-do inhabits a crucial role in the story of 'Oldboy', but this only becomes apparent in the end and in the rest of the film she feels like a redundant, one-dimensional and stereotypical love interest inclusion. Apparently Hollywood is not alone in crafting characters like this.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I like the look of the film and I like the grainy image it projects. The vast majority of Oldboy is filtered through a grayish kaleidoscope but its marginal fantasy segments and flashbacks are splashed with warm colours and dreamy cinematography, which creates an attention-grabbing juxtaposition. Yet it needs to be said that these segments, clearly aimed to offer insight into the clouded past of our protagonist, are counterproductive. In fact they shed little light and instead befuddle you further by branching out into new story lines, raising new questionsLost style. When they final pay-off is revealed, having sewn the segments together, you just want to stop the film and rewind it, hoping to catch some of the promising mystery it built up only to puncture by an absurd story in the end. It's 'The Village' of Asian cinema but luckily some detours, diversions, twists and turns prove interesting as it progresses.<br/><br/>An interesting and absorbing film it is, but a #122 position in the IMDb top 250 it does not deserve. Violence-buffs will find great stimuli in the gruesome torture scenes and overall Oldboy is bathed in a gritty atmosphere, laden with unflinching violence and stylized martial arts showdowns. Couple this with the patience with which it crafts its story up until the culmination and you have a revenge-film that is not only watchable, but genuinely entertaining. <br/><br/>7 out of 10"

"kgnycnonsport","7","3","52","2 June 2006"," What Does This Film Accomplish?
","I've read a number of the reviews posted on this site for ""Oldboy."" They run the full spectrum from 1 to 10, which in itself has to make any observer wonder exactly what is it about this movie that makes so many people have such divergent opinions.<br/><br/>I guess we need to ask ourselves what is a movie supposed to do? Is it to provide us with entertainment? Is it supposed to give us a message? Or is it supposed to evoke certain emotions within each of us? I'm sure many movie fans can debate this topic till they're blue in the face. As for myself, I believe if the viewer gets one of the above mentioned items from a movie, then the director has done their job.<br/><br/>""Oldboy"" is the first of director's Chan-wook Park's three vengeance movies, however all three movies are stand alone projects and can be viewed in any order the viewer desires. I did this by watching ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" first and then ""Oldboy"" two days later. The English language soundtrack makes ""Oldboy"" more accessible to the average viewer in contrast to the subtitles only, ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."" A number of writers have commended Mr. Park for the premise of this movie and I have to agree wholeheartedly! The concept of a man being locked away for 15 years, for no apparent reason is a solid foundation on which to build any movie. While many reviewers have voiced sympathy for the protagonist, Oh Dae-su, it should be noted that he was an obnoxious drunk who got wasted on his daughter's birthday and once he was locked away he managed to fill several journals with the names of people he had wronged and could possibly be responsible for his abduction, not exactly a model citizen.<br/><br/>After 15 years of imprisonment Oh Dae-su is finally released. It's at this juncture of the movie where people start to split on their opinions of this movie. Many reviewers feel that the movie should have been strictly about Oh Dae-su's quest for vengeance, however in my opinion that would have been too simple. Mr. Park throws a wrinkle into this scenario by having Oh Dae-su's ordeal continue. The individual responsible for Oh Dae-su's confinement has much, much more in store for Oh Dae-su, and as we quickly learn the torment is only just beginning. While Mr. Park may have been a bit over ambitious with this twist and some of the criticism about this fact is justified I think in the end movie fans gained more by the director going this route.<br/><br/>Several people have complained about the scene at the sushi bar, where Oh Dae-su eats a live octopus. Having seen a whole family of Koreans do this on the Discovery Channel I had to ask myself what was all the fuss about? Obviously many reviewers aren't aware of certain Asian customs and values and this could explain some of the negative reaction to this movie.<br/><br/>During Oh Dae-su's quest for answers we have several scenes of intense violence. While I do agree with critics of the fight scene, who say it was poorly done, I have to remind them that this isn't a Kung-fu movie and therefore to ask for similar standard is simply not realistic. The teeth pulling scene has also drawn it's share of negative press, however when all is said and done we were only shown Oh Dae-su with the hammer next to his victims mouth and then a cut away to a table with the extracted teeth being flipped onto it. More suggestion than anything else! Does the movie drag as some have claimed? I would say yes, there are probably a few extra minutes that could be sheared here and there. As I stated above Mr. Park was quite ambitious and in some instances he may be guilty of trying to give us too much.<br/><br/>A number of reviewers have nitpicked the apparent age difference between Oh Dae-su and his nemesis. In some regards this could be considered a valid complaint, however we need to remember that Oh Dae-su was subjected to great mental and physical stress and surely that could explain this situation.<br/><br/>Once we learn why the events we were shown were put into motion the story takes another wild twist, I can say that the vengeance exacted on Oh Dae-su was way beyond any crime he may/or may not have committed. I will leave his guilt in this matter up to each individual viewer to decide for themselves. I can only say that I was extremely disturbed at the vengeance that was exacted upon him. I also was bothered by the conclusion of the movie with the decision which Oh Dae-su made, but then as I also said at the beginning of this post he wasn't a model citizen.<br/><br/>In closing, I return to my original question, ""What does this film accomplish?"" For me it left a very sick feeling in my stomach, much like that which I experienced when viewing ""Seven"" for the first time. If one of the possible goals of a movie is to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer then Mr. Park certainly achieved a success in my opinion. Is this movie perfect, no it isn't, but it is certainly worth a look."

","This is a very unusual but symmetrical story line that rings a loud theme of Greek tragedy. I believe the director's purpose was as much to pay homage to the history of drama as it was to make a psychological thriller. <br/><br/>Aside from the obvious reference to The Count of Monte Cristo, Park doffs his cap to John Schlesinger (director of Marathon Man,) Orson Wells (author and director of Citizen Kane,) George Lucas (director of Star Wars,) Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan,) and Sophocles (author of Oedipus Rex). Who doesn't cringe at the thought of having your tooth pulled or drilled without painkillers? What is Rosebud/ who is Evergreen? You can't watch the scene where Dae Su and the young girl sleep under the influence of the ristedal gas while Lee Joo-Win's deep respirations through the black gas mask blaring without Darth Vader coming to mind. When Dae Su emerges from prison, he smells the man next to him in an animal-like way, as if raised by beasts and dropped off in the middle of civilization. And incest? That's a theme older than western civilization. <br/><br/>The storyline finishes where it began. In prison, Dae Su tattoos one line on his hand for every year incarcerated; when he is de-hypnotized at the end, each step ""the monster within"" takes walking away from Dae Su is a year closer to its death. In prison, he trains himself by boxing against a wall until his knuckles bleed (a good demonstration for compressing time), making him strong against a group of assailants. In Lee Joo-Win's penthouse he is weak to defend himself against Woo-Jin's hair-dyed henchman. The reference to hypnosis begins with the bell long before this is revealed in the story as time passes. The ending is a complete answer to Dae Su's central question: ""'Dae Su' means 'one who gets along with everybody'. Can I become the old 'Dae Su' after my revenge?"" His daughter, not knowing this fact about herself, tells him she loves him. Apart from the fact that she may still be hypnotized, he smiles at hearing this. He has become human once again. Park is true to tradition. And all the time, Park is being firm, gentle and direct with his viewers, picking us up and taking us to the destination he promises to us. The fight scenes have good foley sound effects, and there are some places where elements of design are clear. Park switches between symmetrical and asymetrical composition in his mise-en-scene. He uses interesting transitions between sequences (like the transition under hypnosis from the outdoor shot back to the penthouse and the ceiling shots when bodies are dragged away). Overall, this is a tightly crafted film. I give Park an 8."

","I admit after seeing the Hindi remake of this film (Zinda) i went into this movie expecting the world, shockingly so this movie actually lived up to almost all its expectations.<br/><br/>I thought that the concepts in the Hindi movie were hard hitting but these movie is gut wrenching, squirming, mind bending etc etc all in one.<br/><br/>I always suspected the end but when it actually happened, i was shocked and still stomach churned. It makes Hollywood revenge flicks look like children's play games.<br/><br/>The acting, music and film-work was top notch. The movie really is a cinematic masterpiece and the only reason why is not rated higher by me is because i still prefer the masala (spice) variety of films and i definitely had hoped for a lot more stylish hard hitting action from this film.<br/><br/>Also i would have liked the confrontation in the end between the 2 protagonists to have been different but the way it is also adds to the beauty of this film.<br/><br/>All in all a great film, but i could have done with a little more action. Please watch this movie."
"tomfeltham","8","3","56","26 May 2006"," A beautiful film, gruesomeness aside...
","It seems that preconceptions matter as much as anything in viewing this film. I watched it having read reviews which highlighted Oldboy's mixture of comedy and tragedy, and had in mind a film rather like 'Sin City'. If you watch it in this light, and aren't expecting a pure tragedy, then I think you'll enjoy it. <br/><br/>The characters are very stylised, and, to my mind at least, not supposed to be wholly believable. I'm not sure where anyone got the idea that the film was supposed to be realistic from. Yes, realism allows for sympathy and empathy, but not exclusively. <br/><br/>Beyond the characters, there is much to love about this film. The cinematography is beautiful, even if the innovation is excessive. I'm not sure why that's supposedly a bad thing either, unless you want a kitchen-sink drama. The score is breathtaking. The violence didn't only shock me, it made me feel pity for the characters and therefore I don't think it was gratuitous. <br/><br/>The plot seems only just strong enough to allow you to suspend your disbelief, but again, I was expecting Sin City-meets-Kafka. Only the ending really let the film down, I think, though it was good.<br/><br/>The ultimate point is that Oldboy is based on a comic-book."
"myleenjan","9","4","86","18 April 2005"," Perverse and disturbing, but well-made
","*Spoiler Warning* This movie will affect people in many different ways, but most will say that it's the most disturbing movie of the year. Oh Dae-su is the perfect study of turning the life of an ordinary, flawed man into that of a monster through the most horrific psychological and physical torture imaginable. It's as if someone thought of the most immoral, darkest dreams and put them on screen for you to witness. I could barely watch the last part because of the emotions that were torn out of this man. It was like watching the destruction of his soul, especially when he was subjected to listening to his lovemaking and his desperation to keep it a secret. As far as the cinematography, music and color usage, its use of filth, darkness and dank in contrast to the cold, gray, immaculate penthouse of Joo-wijyn (sp?) was brilliant, and the modern soundtrack was well-done. If you enjoy story lines like Memento and Matrix with the sick scenes of the Cell or Happiness, then you probably would find this movie fascinating. I give this movie 9 out of 10 only because it isn't the type of film I'd like to watch over and over again."
"starspangleddanger","9","4","89","10 April 2005"," O -Dae Su is imprisoned for 15 years and given 5 days to seek the truth.
","Like most English speaking movie goers, I had my doubts when going to see the Korean film Oldboy. Thankfully my faith payed off because the film I saw was mind-blowing. Within the first 10-15 minutes it became obvious that this was the work off an incredible director, Park Chan-Wook, reason being the look of the film is a cross between Se7en and Lost in Translation, which is o bad thing. The basic premise is that the main character, o-dae su, is imprisoned in what looks like a hotel room for 15 years without any explanation by an unknown enemy. He is then released without warning and given 5 days to seek the truth as to why he was imprisoned and who the culprit is. What follows is a bloody trail of destruction that o-dae su walks along. I have to say that it is so refreshing to have a film that pulls no punches, both with the graphic violence and the final revelation. When analysing the direction, parallels are drawn with masters such as David Fincher and it is without doubt that chan-wook will make many more excellent films. The pulsating score gives the movie pace and the acting by the leading man, Choi Min-Sik, is subtle in places and the polar opposite in others but always believable. Likewise, the love interest is a character that avoids the usual cliché's and she is depicted as a kind but lonely girl. To sum up, I have to recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and I would ask vegetarians to avoid it like the plague. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
"OrdinarySun","10","3","63","20 August 2006"," Oldboy (2003)... Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same.
","WOW! I want to go on record of saying I saw this before it was remade and Americanized... There's a few things that MIGHT be considered spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>The Story: It's simple, a man is locked up in a private prison for fifteen years for no apparent reason, when he is released he only has five days to find out why he was locked away for so long. It's stylish and atmospheric, not to mention extremely well written and full of twists and turns. It's gritty feel will immerse you in the world of sex and violence even though it seems unsettling and disturbing at times, you can't help but feel compelled to continue watching. On that note, I can't stress the violence enough, this is NOT for the squeamish, I'm not giving anything away when I say this, but there's a three minute fight sequence where our hero has a knife in his back for two. And there's a decent amount of sex, whether or not the graphic nature of the sex scenes were necessary is up to the viewer... Okay, so I've read a lot of bad things about this, it's plot holes, it's ""stupidity"", it's blah, blah, blah... And for all of those people, TAKE A F***ING BREATH! This is based on a Manga Comic book! Since when do comic books have to make sense? If any of the people down on this film are fans of Spiderman, Superman, or even Batman or any other comic book hero than they're hypocrites! ""Oh, it's so unrealistic!"" ""Oh, it's got a plot hole here and there!"" ""Oh, that couldn't happen!""... Good God people! Do you even know the source material of this film? The Cast: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang... I watched this with an English dub because I don't speak Korean, so I don't really know how well they acted verbally. I do know however that they all acted extremely well physically. Min-sik Choi is Dae-su Oh, the man imprisoned for fifteen years, desperate to find all the answers and seeking revenge for his time spent locked away. He gives a great performance as he looks like he's been to hell and back, his weathered and worn face shows more pain and sadness than any words could ever describe. Hye-jeong Kang is Mi-do, a young girl bent on helping Dae-su Oh she doesn't give the best performance here, but she still does a great job. Ji-tae Yu is Woo-jin Lee, the villain. Sometimes he looks the part of the bad-ass, but sometimes, he doesn't look the part of the bad-ass. But no matter how he looks, you know he's force to be reckoned with. Like I said I watched this with English voice work, and there's something to be said about English talent, and that is, it's above and beyond the call of duty. The voice work is top notch and Oscar Caliber, yeah, it's that good.<br/><br/>One to Five Scale: 5 <br/><br/>My highest recommendations go out for this film. It's truly one of a kind, a great noir-ish mystery through and through. If you're a fan of the genre this is a must see! Go out and rent it, buy it, do whatever it takes to see it! Okay... Now for some ranting and raving...<br/><br/>I found out that this film has an announced American remake due out in 2008... It's been said that it's possibly going to be shelved, and for that, all I can say is that I hope it's shelved because it doesn't live up to the original. I hope this isn't going to be the product of American fame and failure like other insanely poorly translated thrillers like the Grudge."
"ejb45","6","1","11","30 November 2007"," Not So Shocking
","I'm very surprised by the extreme dislike some have expressed for Oldboy. I just finished watching it and while I too am somewhat disappointed with the ending shocker I don't feel that much of the negativity is warranted.<br/><br/>Many have criticized the deux ex machina nature hypnosis plays in the film and the fantastic concept that Dae-Su could train himself to be such an amazing fighter but what seems to be lost here is that there is NO pretense that this is a realistic film. While it is not Kafka, it is a surrealist piece and has to be viewed as such. Park even has a VO commenting on ""can training yourself...work?"" to draw attention to the fantasy nature of the movie.<br/><br/>I think what most are punishing Oldboy for is the hype. I went in having heard about the amazing/shocking/unbelievable ending and then it simply turns out to be an Oedipal story where fate is cruel and named Woo-jin. It was a let down because I was expecting a ""Sixth Sense"" level ending but in all reality the main story was far more interesting and well made than the Sixth Sense. It simply did not deliver in the end and with all the hype that can be unforgivable to people (disappointment can color everything sometimes).<br/><br/>I think if anyone is looking for thematic meaning what they can see is that Oldboy is about how such small, meaningless things can destroy your life. It is about talking less (Woo-Jin: ""Oh Dae-Su talks too much"") and asking the right the questions (""You should not ask 'Why was I imprisoned?' but ""Why was I released?'"") it is only through forced introspection that Dae-Su understands why his life is the way it is and that revenge is meaningless, not because it is your own fault but because the forces that often times act against us are beyond our control and must just be accepted (Woo-Jin's ""omnipotence"" as some have pointed out). This is what I took away from the film."
"geezerboy","8","3","64","8 March 2006"," A Very Interesting Movie
","I just recently saw Oldboy and thought it was amazing. The plot is incredible, with twists throughout the movie. For those who say that the violence was unnecessary, did you even consider the fact that the excessive violence is meant to demonstrate a man who is becoming a monster? The way that the main character acts is just exhibiting his new personality, that of a Monster, a beast. True, the whole thing about him becoming amazing at fighting after fifteen years of shadow boxing was stretching it, but that can be ignored. The fight scenes and the torture just shows the monster inside of Dae-Su. Other people have said that the story doesn't have a moral. Does every movie have to have a moral? Does every great piece of literature have a moral? There was an Oedipus reference before, what was the ""Moral"" of Oedipus Rex? In addition, the whole hypnosis was a Deus ex machina, but so what? It served its purpose as a plot device, as well as introduced a point of discussion for the end. What would you have done? Could you deal with the realization that Oh Dae-Su faced? Or would you go the ""easy way out"" and forget if you could? Instead of just looking at the ""weaknesses"", look at what is shown and for what reason. This movie is amazing."
"goatboy500","8","3","67","14 July 2005"," Missing the point
","I'm posting a review of this dark, complex film in response to some of the comments made by other viewers, as I feel there's a very pertinent point keeping them from enjoying the movie. The main gripe people seem to have is the lack of a sympathetic character to root for, but being a huge movie fan who has seen 1000's of movies (some repeatedly 100's of times), I for one am sick of being told by a film who the hero is, who the villain is, and why their cause is right/wrong. This movie takes great pains to blur every line between hero and villain, which is why some of Oh Dae Su's actions are so extreme and jarring for the viewer, especially early on, and why the 'villain' has only two scenes where he does something remotely villain-like, (ironically one of these instances is done to save Oh Dae So's life.) As for a sympathetic character, how about Mido? She's been an unwitting pawn in the corruption of Oh Dae Su her whole life, beginning with her mother's murder, and ends up with a man who chooses to lie to her and be her lover rather than tell her he her father. And during the movie she's sexually assaulted by a room fool of goons, engages in painful sex with a psychotic and if thats not enough she has to traipse around south Korea looking for a specific restaurant. (man, there must be millions!) While i too was initially disappointed that the Oldboy didn't come out of that room an avenging kick ass angel of death laying kung fu waste to all who stood in his path, By the end of the film I felt confused and somehow hurt, and simply HAD to watch it again.<br/><br/>Which is when you realise how many layers there are to this seemingly horrid, violent pointless movie.<br/><br/>Watch Oldboy if you want to make up your own mind about a character's motivation.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of comments on the coincidental and unlikely nature of some of the events in the film, especially the villains plan. Couldn't you make the same accusation of any movie? Forgetting stuff like Se7en or (the terrible) Arlington Road, you could even level this argument at the Godfather or Star Wars. For me a movie is not meant to exist in reality and should be taken at face value, thats why its a movie. Every movie inhabits its OWN universe (Uma can run along railings in Kil Bill, no-one says a thing, but apparently its unlikely that someone could be locked up for 15 years...) As long as a movie doesn't blatantly break the rules of its own universe then I don't see the point in dissecting it as some other posters have done. (case in point, Training Day spent 75% of the movie depicting a realistic cop drama and then ruined it with a typical Hollywood fist fight at the end where Ethan Hawke is beaten to a bloody pulp, THEN jumps onto a car, and THEN manages to get up, and subdue Denzel. For me that ruined the movie, but I can still enjoy the first 75%. I just turn off after Eva Mendes' beaver shot) As far as I'm concerned, Oldboy is a dark, ambiguous, funny tragic, COMIC BOOK thriller and never once besmirches it's universe.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to convince anyone here to like it, as I never will, I just wanted to say that disliking a movie because you find it unlikely is or you don't sympathise with the characters has always been a moot point to me, but hey, thats what opinions are for."

","Old Boy Director Chan-wook Park <br/><br/>The man Dae Su was kidnapped randomly when he was drunk in the beginning of the movie while he was on his way home to give his daughter her birthday present, angel wings. He was put into a locked room never to leave for 15 years. He went crazy while being detained and trained himself to seek revenge on the man who put him in there. While watching the news he finds out that his wife was killed and since he's missing they figure it was him. He was released and began the search for Lee Joo-Win, the man, who framed him, killed his wife, and locked him up. He met and fell in love with a girl while chasing Lee Joo-Win. Having caught him and having several confrontations with him and his men he found out he was hypnotized almost as an experiment, as was the woman he met, who turned out to be his daughter. The movie came to a climax at the ending and Lee Joo-Win killed himself. The whole thing is a humbling ride while rooting for Dae Su to stop Lee Joo-Win's disturbed ways. The acting was well done, other than the typically lame voice-overs, cause it was filmed in Korean, or whatever. The sound track was suiting and dynamic as well as the diagetic sound effects. Everything else was done typical and to a professional level, but nothing especially special like cinematography, lighting, and editing. Overall though, I would say that the characters of the protagonist and the antagonist really stuck out as being well written. Dae Su, as the protagonist, was written well, cause I could really feel for him and understand his feelings of going crazy and wanting revenge. I entered the story through him and was on his side of the plot. Lee Joo-Win, as the antagonist, was your typical opposition and suited it well. In my mind, he was pathetically evil and yet at times he was human as well. The scenes in the movie were written well and didn't lag on but got to the point and continued to the next, overall the flow of the movie was smooth and quick. I would give Park a 7-8 out of 10."

","I'll admit that if I am not sure about a movie, I will exhaust as many reviews as possible to ""influence"" my viewing of that movie. This is my first comment and it is sparked by the unbelievable amount of bad reviews this movie received on this website by members. This movie was actually pretty good; good story; good acting; great cinematography. The movie definitely held my interest the entire 1 hour and 50 min. run time. THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The movie centers around Oh Dae-su, a man imprisoned for 15 years (no scenes of torture) and then released. He meets a waitress, Mi-do and together their adventure begins. Oh Dae-su begins to track down his captors and eventually finds him. The movie is easy to follow and understand;it all gets explained rather well by voice-over and flashback so their is no confusion as to what is going on. It is discovered less than halfway who the captor is and later on he explains why he imprisoned Oh Dae-su. There was definitely some brainwashing and mind control techniques going on while Oh Dae-su is imprisoned, but it is implied. The movie is not that bloody or gory at all - most of it is implied and not shown on screen. The worst scene for me is at the beginning when Oh Dae-su goes for sushi and meets Mi-do and asks her for something ""live"" to eat. I definitely recommend this movie as it has received an unjust amount of bad reviews. 8 out of 10!"

","I was not impressed by Oldboy, despite having high expectations, given its rave reviews and numerous rewards. I suppose that the fact that Tarantino loved it should have been a red flag. I mean, I like Tarantino´s Pulp Fiction, but some of his stuff is just gratuitous violence to a pornographic degree.<br/><br/>To my mind, the erotic part of Oldboy evoked memories of Haruki Murakami´s 1Q84, which I forced myself to read (also based on rave reviews) but found rather perverse and distasteful. Speaking of distasteful, I am not at all clear as to what the eating of a live octopus contributed to Oldboy beyond shock appeal.<br/><br/>There are many other surprises in Oldboy, mostly (as far as I can tell) shock for shock´s sake, but it is especially unexpected and odd--and frankly irrational--that the protagonist should cut out his own tongue, when the real criminal is the fellow who imprisoned him for fifteen years. Doesn´t make sense at all--nor does the manifest disparity in ages of the two main characters, I might add.<br/><br/>Who should be feeling guilty in this story, really? Certainly not the victim, but of course psychopaths never experience guilt. Some viewers may forgive the convoluted plot on grounds of artistic license, poetic justice, or whatever, but even though some of the scenes display admirable cinematography, the rest of this production does not add up. So count me among those who disagree with the top rating bestowed on this work by both critics and amateurs of film, including many reviewers at imdb.

","At last I review Oldboy. My favorite movie of all time. The first South Korean film to become a worldwide phenomenon. And why is that? Why did this Revenge film make such an impact in the film industry?<br/><br/>Well, I'd say that has to do with the flawless retelling of a story that brilliantly utilized the fall-rise-fall structure. That story is Oedipus Rex. The tale of a man who killed his own father and married his mother before gouging his eyes out after he realized what had happened. Oldboy takes its liberties in changing many facets of the story to tie a classic down to the modern world. However, all the emotion this famous tragedy is supposed to evoke is still prevalent.<br/><br/>In the beginning, our main character, Oh Dae-Su is an obnoxious drunk who is imprisoned for an unknown reason. For 15 years he is forced to endure isolation all the time wondering who did this to him. Here we see him at his worse so far; one day he's free and eager to deliver his daughter her birthday present and the next day he's stuck in a cell with nothing to live for. After failing to commit suicide twice, he figured he may as well better himself. And so he teaches himself martial arts preparing himself for when he finally is able to see the outside world again. When our character is suddenly released for no apparent reason, he's now in the same world he once inhabited only with a different, more determined mindset. Not to mention a new set of physical abilities.<br/><br/>With all the determination to get revenge on his captor and the skills to do it, Oh Dae-Su is has climbed from a pit of despair to become a force to be reckoned with. We have now witnessed the fall to rise part of this story. When he fights 15 men simultaneously, he proves not only that he's someone with above average capabilities, but that he's willing to do anything to solve the mystery. Little does he know that it's exactly this desperate need to find answers that takes him to an even worse place then when he started.<br/><br/>When the film arrives at its climax, all is revealed to Oh Dae-Su. He has laid with his own daughter. A wave of fury hits him before that anger turns to sadness. That's an understatement however. After such an unbelievable turn of events that first led him to being imprisoned for 15 years, then coming out a better person than he was before, someone to be admired, our hero is now in a state of pure tragedy. Instead of admiration, we give him pity. But Oh Dae-Su cannot let his daughter discover the truth, and so he cuts out his tongue in an act of despair. Our antagonist accepts this and doesn't tell his daughter about who she really is. Then we see the villain's motivations for all this; we see his own tragic past and we can empathize with him. The audience recognizes that it was Oh Dae-Su's own fault for hurting Lee-Woo Jin, and that it was his own determination for finding answers that leads him down a path of self destruction making this tale all the more tragic.<br/><br/>At the film's conclusion, Oh Dae-Su undergoes hypnosis in an attempt to erase his dark memories. When he meets again with Mi-Do and embraces her, he holds a smile before it turns into a grimace. Has he forgotten who his daughter really is or is he forced to live forever in tragedy?"

","This was a movie that was virtually unknown over here in the West. Sure some people saw it, said how great it was, but it took a while before it had garnered enough attention to get a release. And when it did it's popularity just exploded.<br/><br/>The story deals with an drunken man who one day, for no reason we know, is captured and imprisoned for fifteen years in a small room. He's fed, he has a TV and a shower, occasionally he'd doused with sleepy gas but neither he or we as the audience know why.<br/><br/>Then one day he's hypnotized, set free again with no knowledge of what transpired or why and it's now time for him to find the people responsible for his imprisonment and exact his revenge. But the people responsible for this are still out there and they're still gunning for him.<br/><br/>There's some amazing fight scenes. Some gorgeous camera work by the director. And a very tightly written story that once it gets going it just doesn't let you go.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for fans of action, psychological thrillers or just Asian cinema. I'd also recommend seeing the subbed version. The dub takes away from some of the emotion."

Every scene of Oldboy - some new visual method. And screenplay shots in your body from all guns without any compromises and doubts. Just like O De Su beats his enemies. But who is enemy in this story - your own decision.

","Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>Oldeuboi is a phenomenal film. This film is excellent for those looking to become in touch with the taboo, the mysterious, and the psychological. I absolutely adore this film, at first I thought this film was a bit melodramatic and vague but it turns out it was all intentional. The film's rousing story line is intriguing in that the steps in the story's sequence seem to be off, until we are hit with the big late game catalyst in Dae-Su finding the the yearbooks at his old school. You at the point of meeting Lee Woo-Jin (for me at least) become attached and almost sympathize with him and when this critical moment is hit is hit and we reach the climax of the film, We (the viewers) feel inclined to feel sorrow for the (at this point) formerly mysterious antagonist.
As for Music in his film:
The Last waltz-is a beautiful longing piece at the end of the film that really conveys the feeling of Dae-Su. 
Farewell My lovely-My favorite piece in the entire film, this song acts as a representation of Lee Woo-Jin's feelings or emotions. The Gunshot sound at the end adds major emphasis on the pain of Lee Woo-Jin .<br/><br/>While some can be very long, the actions scenes in this film are very well choreographed and have a rough and (in some cases) gruesome air about which is done right.
 
This film deserves a high rating and needs to be viewed by more."

"hyoga_saint","8","0","3","5 June 2017"," Over-hyped, unfortunately. Deritative.
","This well-made film which took the world by storm failed to enthuse me for a very simple reason: I could clearly see traces of other films in the plot and the twists in it, hence bringing down the effectiveness of the story and making the whole experience enjoyable, yet a bit lackluster, sadly.<br/><br/>This is a pretty sound thriller in the vein of other similar Asian movies that have come before and after. The pacing is very good, the characters well-played and memorable, and the story, while pushing a little too much the realism envelope, is still (somewhat) believable but, most of all, quite gripping. A couple of scenes are actually brilliant.<br/><br/>However there is no sugarcoating it. The plot, while not a copy- paste, is *very* derivative of a Brian De Palma film called Obsession (1976), which was itself clearly inspired by Hitchcock's Vertigo. While the similarity between those two films has always been quiet apparent, I found Oldboy to be even more clearly inspired by De Palma's movie.<br/><br/>We've seen this before, from the Lion King's clear echoes of Tezuka's Kimba the White Lion to Battle Royale lending more than a few traits to The Hunger Games. Not to mention how much Hollywood borrowed from Satoshi Kon's work, with Black Swan and Inception recalling a fair bit the Japanese master's Perfect Blue and Paprika.<br/><br/>Curiously enough, this time it was an Asian director borrowing from an American peer. Could this be the reason so many have given him a pass? It might help that Obsession is not that well-known outside of film aficionados, but it did take away a lot of the effectiveness of Oldboy for me. As such, I find its rating to be much higher than reasonable.<br/><br/>(+) Captivating characters, great pacing, good visuals, a couple of memorable scenes, all in all, a well-made film.<br/><br/>(-) Its plot and twists are way too reminiscent - if not outright a copy of - other movies, which mixed with a few elements a tiny bit too fantastic, makes it undeserving of its legendary status."

I also loves the way it draws the user into understanding the twisted mindset of the protagonist and his antagonist and the parallels between the two. Normally movies where the main character survives because the antagonist allows him to have a very unsatisfying ending, but this was definitely the exception, when one understands how Dae-su was created to be an alter ego of Choi and scapegoat of his guilt, desires, and search for revenge."
"jelmargerritsen","9","0","3","2 December 2016"," Beautiful piece of foreign cinema
","It's not often that a thoroughly foreign film is a hit on the Western market. Most of the times, they are loved by a very specific and small community, but not by the general public, who find it hard to relate to the differences to Western cinema. This is not the case for Oldboy.<br/><br/>The story is absurd, but at the heart is the classic ""journey of the hero"" as Joseph Campbell described it. It's classic Greek drama, told in a unique Korean style. Because of this it is easy to relate to the story even though it is foreign.<br/><br/>Our main character Oh Dae-su provides the audience with a solid anchor point in the absurd story he is caught in. Despite all of the things he faces, he remains solid, which is very important because it can be hard to stick with a story that is very weird. There's a point where the story gets so weird that the audience will disengage, but thankfully this movie does not reach that point, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie contains many fighting scenes, but does not sacrifice substance for these. It does not devolve into a mindless fighting movie, how enjoyable they can be. It shows these scenes while also displaying many emotional moments which really help the audience find compassion for Oh Dae-su, and help keep them engaged.<br/><br/>Overall a real classic, and a pearl of foreign cinema, which are sadly very elusive."
"willcundallreview","7","0","1","28 November 2015"," Korean film that was good but not quite what I expected
","Oh wow what a tough time I have had trying to compose my thoughts about this, a movie by many considered a modern masterpiece but to me it was although a good movie, nowhere near perfect. So much has been said about this movie and much I expected that I felt let down and it's kind of annoying because this is actually more than OK as a film but because it is so highly regarded by some you expect this to be like some magical ride into a movie. It's basically pretty crazy and has its fair share of violence too, it never shies from trying to shock the viewer and by the end you might either feel sick or have become desensitised. <br/><br/>The story is all about a man by the name of Oh Dae-su who is taken out of nowhere from the street and put into a jail of sorts for 15 years, being gassed and injected with a strange substance continuously. The plot then progresses to Oh Dae-su being released and that sets into motion his quest to find out who did this to him and also any details of his daughter. The movie is really a study of the mind in a sense and tries extremely hard to make you feel grossed out but in a way where it just seems to fit in with the way the movie is going, many other movies I could feel slightly taken aback by teeth pulling, but here it feels common place.<br/><br/>Park Chan-wook directs and does a pretty good job really as he mixes dark style elements with humour of which I feel stands out the most. The opening is truly the great part of this and it makes you interested from the start, the middle starts to loosen its grip in my opinion though and although right at the end it starts to feel alright again, for the most part the second half it is kind of dull and meaningless things are put in. I do feel this movie has very little to it as well with it really feeling like an action movie that has a bit more dramatic effect than others maybe out there but you could also say about the strange style in which this is played out. Parts can feel a little like style over substance and sometimes the look of the movie seems to be the thing trying to move the movie when really it should be interesting plot lines. <br/><br/>Choi Min-sik is the man who plays Oh Dae-su and he is really good actually, mixing crazy with true emotion and really he makes the role completely his own. No other character quite gets the all round mental analysis that Dae-su gets but people like Mi-do (Kang Hye- jung) and Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae) come pretty close to getting a full blown brain scan, the whole movie really tries to dig deep into the characters and reveals many things about them and the way they feel about things going on the story as it progresses.<br/><br/>So all in all Oldboy really is a movie that is memorable but for me not it's skill as a movie, but in what it contains. I wasn't actually that grossed out throughout and although some scenes look pretty bad, the film is never that squeamish you shouldn't watch this. Of course this movie will also be remembered for its crazy octopus scene, the hallway fight, the general weirdness of the prison and of course the ending which is so out of nowhere in terms of the way you think this is going that it feels like some sort of strange movie added on to this already weird film."

The side view hallway bit was just incredible! <br/><br/>Crazy scenes you won't see elsewhere, including a crazy seafood part, trippy flashbacks or dreams, weird Korean stuff we never see, etc. I could write more.<br/><br/>The pacing is very good throughout and it ties in with the story. There are a,few scratch your head what the hell is going on moments, but fear not it all works out. <br/><br/>Again, I'd recommend to anybody who likes violence, torture, weirdness, grossness, revenge, action, and love.

","This is one of the few films that I have repeat-watched, probably about 5 times now. Saw it again last night after a 5-year gap or so. Still a rare 10-out-of-10. As ever, you must watch with the original audio so you get to appreciate the full range of the actors' performances. <br/><br/>Invariably with films where the plot's development is paramount you're also advised to stop reading even spoiler-free reviews...just go ahead and watch it.<br/><br/>If you are reading on, then I think the best advice for whether you'll like this film is if you have a strong stomach for dark psychology (and occasional graphic violence), and if you do, that you watch oldboy as if it's a pulp fiction comic (as in Breaking Bad, or indeed Pulp Fiction itself). The violence and story development is, at times, unrealistic, but this only makes the experience more beguiling as the character arc of the protagonist is so recognisably human. <br/><br/>Here's why oldboy deserves top marks and a steady place in those 'best film of all time' lists:<br/><br/><ul><li>expert acting &amp; dialogue weighted nicely with clever humour, giving the characters depth &amp; relatability, with Oh Dae-su one of cinema's most memorable protagonists. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>engrossing camera work &amp; evocative music. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>violence which is key to the plot, and fun/excruciating to watch! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>perfectly-weighted story development and generally good pacing. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>brutal yet unusual final showdown. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>at least a dozen memorable scenes, you might have heard talk of a scene with a squid, but the scenes that stay with you forever happen later in the film when things finally get explained.</li></ul><br/><br/>It's the very end, the actual final image, that struck the biggest chord with me. It's incredibly nuanced given what went on before...powerful, involving stuff...genuinely makes you think.<br/><br/>My other 10's as a guide to whether we have similar taste:<br/><br/>2001, There Will Be Blood, Excalibur, Apocalypse Now, 1984, Pink Floyd's The Wall"

","There is no better word other than disturbing which can summarize this movie. The movie is not a masterpiece, it may be because I watched the subbed version of the Korean movie but really the film seems to be unintentionally disturbing at times. The climax takes the cherry. The screenplay makes the movie what it is but I found a lot of glitches in the movie.. The movie is surely not well directed because it feels absurd when the person is searching for the truth and I am unable to decipher what is happening. New characters are introduced without giving clear introduction to them. There is a fight sequence where the lead actor has a fight with some 10-12 odd guys.. That is the worst scene, I mean it was so out of the movie, it felt like he wanted to show us a fight and just dragged that part. Music is not up to the mark, and in the music which is played when the movie opens is pathetic, it does not even go with what is happening. The person(Oh-Dae-Su) is tortured to ultimate level which is the best thing in the movie and is very disturbing but the story telling was good but it missed severely in direction department. Many scenes were over directed.<br/><br/>So there it is as a whole you would find the movie very disturbing but worth the movie for a one time view."

","Oldboy is certainly one that is full of entertainment and twists. Unbeknownst of the thriller I was about to watch, this film offers an extremely thick but thought-provoking plot. At each step of the story, viewers try to question and seek out answers--only to be one (or several) step(s) behind.<br/><br/>From the introduction, we follow a flamboyant character who's about to endure hardship like no other. Life is not always fair, and that statement is magnified in this tale. Imprisonment, especially without justification, is torture. Not knowing its extent is even worse. With each day no different than the last, time seemingly runs forever, and sanity is in low quantity as time progresses. <br/><br/>Whether we agree or disagree with the antagonist's decisions is one debate (albeit one-sided), but the lesson taught by this extreme example is one that deserves reckoning. From the ""harmless"" teases to the malicious attacks, everything we do has an effect, whether minuscule or grandiose in nature. Only time will tell our fate, but be conscientious, since you never know what may happen next."

","I've been searching my memory banks for about twenty four hours now and I can't really come up with a movie I've seen with a more twisted story line than this one. I didn't really like the film and don't feel compelled to ever watch it again unless it's to prove that point to someone else.<br/><br/>Here's the thing - I've read some of the positive reviews for the picture on this board and I'm seeing kudos for things like the screenplay, acting, cinematography, plot, music, and it's intelligence, symbolism and beauty. None of them it seems really gets to the heart of the matter. The story, without nuance, has to do with a man, Oh Dae-su, who as a teenager, witnessed schoolmate Lee Woo-Jin molesting his own sister. The girl subsequently commits suicide, (whether she became pregnant or not seems beside the point because the viewer is allowed to have it both ways), and in his sick quest for revenge, Lee Woo-Jin embarks on a fifteen year mission to imprison Oh Dae-su and arrange to have him AND his daughter hypnotized into falling in love with each other, thereby engaging in an incestuous relationship.<br/><br/>So what's so symbolic, intelligent and beautiful about that? Look, I'm not a prude and I guess I'd have to admit that it took some kind of uniquely creative mind to come up with this story. But why? At one point it seemed like the larger issue being dealt with had to do with Oh Dae-su's mission once freed, was he now on a quest for revenge or the truth? That would have been a much more satisfying story if you didn't have the incest angle. And on top of that, Lee Woo-jin would have been behind the murder of Oh Dae-su's wife in order to engineer this whole scenario. Why Oh Dae-su failed to attack Lee and instead turn into a pile of mush near the end of the story just didn't make sense to me, what with all the gory violence and dental hysterics that went before.<br/><br/>Now here's something that I noticed, and this was a real head scratcher. This is on top of the age difference between the two principal characters, fourteen years in real life and looking every bit the same difference in the picture, even though they were schoolmates together. If you keep a close eye on the scene when Lee Woo-jin recalls his sister falling from the bridge, the first cutaway shows his hand with half a pinky missing! Then you see his hand again and all his fingers are intact. Was that deliberate? A mistake? Why was it done that way? Inquiring minds want to know.<br/><br/>So anyway, with all my ranting on the picture, I can concede that it was well put together with a coherent, even if somewhat implausible story. But should it be in IMDb's list of Top 100 Films? That's why I picked it up to watch after all, and leads me to question how these rankings get put together. Then again, I already did that and that's another thing that doesn't make sense to me."

","This movie is just simply mind-blowing. I think this is one of the most unique stories I've ever come across. This movie kept me guessing right from the start, and I was shocked to learn about the truth myself. Choi Min-Sik is absolutely brilliant and delivers an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Some parts of this movie can be rather bloody and violent, but overall it resonates with the whole story and help to emphasize on the main character's development. The fighting scene where Dae-su goes on a rampage with a hammer and his bare fists is really well shot and truly memorable. Although the movie mainly touches on vengeance and tragic experiences, it really gave me a mental impact and it is not one that I will ever forget. I've always thought that rumors are nothing if someone just ignores them. However in this case, simple comments can just be blown out of proportion and made into dangerous rumors. Once the rumors go viral, there's no way to know how much damage it can cause to people. It might seem like nothing to someone, but it can mean everything to someone else. This movie really made me think how crucial it is to keep things discreet. Some things can be said or shared with others, while some are better left unsaid. Things can be told in one way, but after being spread to different parties, it tends to deviate from the original source. I really feel sorry for Dae-su, because he never knew the little story he shared with his friend will one day come back to haunt him in such a tragic way. Even though he told his friend to keep it discreet, his friend still blabbered about it and spread the word unknowingly. That's why I think it's extremely important to choose what to say and who to share information with. This movie has sparked a remake from Hollywood last year since it's first release 10 plus years ago. I have yet to watch the remake, but I believe the original will stand the test of time and remain as one of the best movies ever made."

","Oldboy is an artfully-done thriller, mixing slickness with directorial lyricism and more than touch of brutality to create a mesmerizing film about revenge, destiny, and closure. Ostensibly, this is another film tackling familiar themes with the predictable sameness. But thanks to the trio of writers' willingness to incorporate twists into the story, director Park Chan-wook mastering elements of intrigue and unsettling fright, and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung's beautifully seamy visuals, the film is one to behold, absorb, and contemplate.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a businessman who is kidnapped the night of his daughter's birthday party in 1988 and trapped in a room that mirrors the likes of a hotel room. His only contact with the outside world is a Television, where he learns of his wife's murder and that he is a prime suspect. Dae-su doesn't know, however, that this room will be his home for the next fifteen years. To pass the time, Dae-su practices boxing, plots revenge against his killers, pens a will of sorts, and attempts to escape by tunneling through the brick wall.<br/><br/>In 2003, he is inexplicably drugged and released in the middle of a grassy field, trapped inside a suitcase, with no explanation of why he was held captive, who held him captive, and why he was randomly released. Dae-su, who no longer has a family or relatives, does the only thing he can do - wander around the streets of South Korea. Soon after his release, he meets a female sushi chef Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), a gentle, vulnerable woman who feels sorry for Dae-su and his circumstances. The two begin a relationship, despite Dae-su's questionable mental health state, and both try to find the people that imprisoned him for fifteen years.<br/><br/>Park Chan-wook doesn't make us sympathize or even side with Dae-su in any particular way. His camera simply remains on him, allowing us to think of him as a victim or someone who potentially deserved this imprisonment. Regardless, we want to know right off the bat why this is happening because the idea is baffling on many levels. But even with a solid mystery at hand, Chan-wook throws in revenge and romance elements, making Oldboy a pretty complete package in terms of juggling multiple, difficult genres, especially when they all need to work together to create an entire film. Chan-wook devotes enough attention to each element of the story, emphasizing on intrigue and devaluing the unnecessary, and with Chung's cinematography working to elevate the look and tone of the picture, Oldboy is nothing shy of immersing on a story and visual level.<br/><br/>There are issues I take with the story, however. To begin with, we don't get to experience enough of the agony Dae-su does when he's locked in the room for fifteen years. A good chunk of the film (say, maybe thirty minutes or so) should've been devoted to the monotony and hell of living inside a random place, being beaten, repeatedly drugged, and manipulated for no clear reason. Instead, only about fifteen minutes are spent inside that hotel-room and we see fifteen years skate by in montage. Another issue is, by the end, specifically during the final confrontation, the scene includes laughable dialog and one particular instance I simply cannot accept, even considering how desperate the lead character is.<br/><br/>Despite the issues, the inevitable intrigue and mystery set forth by the story itself make the film worth seeing simply on those merits. Thrillers come and go, especially ones that boast nothing more than star-power and droning action sequences. Oldboy, on the contrary, lingers in your system, and since its release in 2003, sent shockwaves around the world, introducing people to Korean cinema more so than any other film from the country. The film is brash, thoughtful, and pleasantly excessive, and leaves one with an appetite for more of the same material. Or maybe that's just blood.<br/><br/>Starring: Choi Min-sik, Kang Hye-jung, and Yoo Ji-tae. Directed by: Park Chan-wook."

","Oldboy has the pace of a comic strip. In a fight I half expected to see exclamation of Wham, Bam, and Smash as Dae-Su charges like a bull in a china shop into a fight. Almost everything in this film is exaggerated. Even Choi Min-Sik's performance is over the top. In any other movie this would be a criticism. But Oldboy is an exception. The acting style fits perfectly in the extreme circumstances served up to the main character. View this film as a living cartoon and prepare yourself for some dark comic laughs.<br/><br/>If you dislike violence and taboo subject matter then stay away from this film. Avoid if you like a ending to a film that is tied up in a neat little bow. A plot with more twists and turns than a roller-coaster finishes with an ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>Watch this film if you like to discuss what you have seen afterwards. I was left debating revenge once the credits rolled. Revenge is the central theme of the film. If you believe in 'eye for an eye' then Oldboy might make you reevaluate your view.<br/><br/>If you like gore then there are a view moments but I actually think the gore factor is at a medium level. If Oldboy was a curry I would say it was a Madras in terms of goriness. I would describe the film as intense rather than a splatter-fest.<br/><br/>I find Oldboy strangely appealing and have happily watched it several times. For me a good film is one you want to re watch. Just avoid the remake. It is a meagre and cowardly effort in comparison."
"Nothinggrandproductions","10","0","4","23 November 2013"," The definitive psychological thriller
","Oldboy. It is almost impossible to talk about this film without spoiling it but I'll try my best not to. Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and placed in a solitary confinement in an unknown prison-like area. He is trapped for 15 years. Isolated. No human contact. All he has is a TV, food brought to him, and a bathroom within in the room. He hasn't a clue why he is trapped. He just is. At one point very early on in the film as he is watching TV, he learns that his wife has been murdered and that he is somehow the prime suspect. After this 15 year period, he is let go and is on a rooftop in the middle of nowhere. Now, his mission is to get revenge, violent, bloody revenge and try to piece together why he was kidnapped. To me, this is the definitive psychological thriller, the entire movie takes you on twists and turns, you have no idea where it might go next, it isn't afraid to get to the darkest place possible, beat you up as the viewer emotionally, and beat up the characters emotionally.<br/><br/>The camera style is completely unique. At times, it'll feel like a guerilla style of filmmaking. And in particular, there is an incredible fight sequence that feels like a 2D style beat-em up video game with how it's shot in what appears to be a single take, it's different, unique, and absolutely incredible. The acting is superb on all fronts, each actor embodies their role, no matter how psychotic things get. The soundtrack is also top notch with a score that certainly fit's the emotional levels on the film. But, most importantly are the twists. This movie takes you for such a ride, one that'll I wish I could experience again with my memory completely wiped because of how good it was. It is in the realm of Fight Club in terms of how great the twists are, if not better.<br/><br/>It hits on a lot of emotional fronts with it's characters. They are deep and sophisticated, even if it takes awhile to get to there emotional core, it is well worth it. The fact is, a man that has been isolated for 15 years is going to have complex emotions, confusion, anger, tension, everything under the sun. And it plays in the favor of the film in nearly everyway, allowing for an extraordinarily memorable and unique character. For some inexplicable reason (not reallyHollywood just wants money), this movie is getting remade (and actually being released in like 3 days as of posting). My suggestion, forget the remake. Just go watch this great Korean film on Netflix right now with subtitles on. There isn't a single reason why this movie needs to be remade. Essentially, stop being lazy and watch some subtitles is what I'm trying to tell you (besides if you completely ignore foreign films, you are missing out). Overall, this movie is a ride, a strange, unique experience that you won't forget soon, it'll stick with you, it gets crazy, psychotic, and hit's the breaking points of a human being."

","One of the most shocking & disturbing tales of revenge you are ever going to come across, Oldboy is not only a genre-defining classic that sets a new benchmark for revenge-thrillers to follow which as of today still remains unsurpassed, but is also the finest film to come out from the South Korean film industry & in every way is director Park Chan-wook's best work.<br/><br/>Oldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-su, who is abducted on the night of his young daughter's birthday & is held captive in an apartment prison for 15 years, without any clue of why he is there & who has imprisoned him, and is later freed in the same inexplicable manner. Rest of the film is about Oh Dae-su trying to uncover the identity & motives of his captor to exact revenge.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook, Oldboy is the second instalment of his Vengeance trilogy, preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance & succeeded by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance but apart from the central theme of vengeance, every other aspect of this cinema is different from those two chapters for Oldboy tears through the confinements of its genre unlike anything before & is an exhilarating work of art.<br/><br/>Ingeniously written & directed, Park brilliantly layers the plot with clever twists & unflinching violence that slowly unravels its mysteries to give the viewers a cinematic jolt they'll have a hard time forgetting. The picture is also exquisitely photographed & meticulously captured by its stylish camera-work. Editing steadily paces the narrative & also adds a grim mood that further enhances the film's dark elements.<br/><br/>Production design is stellar work in every manner, visual design is extremely enticing, sound design also plays a relevant role and its background score has a slight retro feel to it plus it happens to be heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time. And while there are a lot of favourite moments to choose from, my favourite is the single long take of the corridor fight scene which in my opinion is one of 21st century's greatest cinema moments.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, it's a trio of terrific performances that elevate its premise with most impressive input coming from Choi Min-sik who simply owns his role of Oh Dae-su & overshadows everything else. Next is Yoo Ji-tae giving us a controlled rendition of the guy responsible for Dae-su's imprisonment. And last we have Kang Haye-jung as Mi-do; Dae- su's love interest who plays a vital role in the film's unpredictable & unexpected finale.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Oldboy is a disturbing, unsettling & violent cinema from South Korea that will traumatize most of its viewers with its harrowing & sickening depiction of revenge but then, there is also no denying that with its remarkable blend of impeccable direction, clever screenplay, arresting photography, tight editing, amazing performances & classic score, it's also one of the greatest films ever made. A haunting masterpiece. One hundred percent recommended."

","I think not only does this movie face vengeance and truth but also forgiveness which was not the route that was taken. If da sue wasn't so wrapped up in revenge he would have remembered what was really important.... The fact that he still had a daughter out there! In the beginning after mido goes and finds out the information about da sues daughter she says to him aren't you going to find her . Here he makes a choice ....at this point in time revenge and truth is more important than family. But if he had researched and tried to find his daughter first then he'd find out it was bull and uncover mido is his daughter.<br/><br/>Then jin would have failed but then again i guess thats the point of having da sue confined for 15 years because after so long in solitude we stop thinking like human beings and become beasts. Things that were once important get put on hold. Da sue had turned into a beast consumed only with one thing.<br/><br/>it is also possible that on his journey to find his daughter he could have still fallen for and had sex with mido so........yea :) but I'm approaching an optimistic angle.

","Known for the shocking violence and lengths that a stereotypical Korean film goes to, there shouldn't be too many surprises with Chan-wook Park's highly acclaimed psychological thriller...however there certainly is.<br/><br/>An explicit sexual scene, a number of other raunchy moments, people being battered to a pulp and the leading character yanking out the teeth of his nemesis with a hammer to name only a few. It certainly isn't for the faint hearted though you probably knew that from the outset. <br/><br/>'Oldboy' follows Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) - a man imprisoned for 15 years without explanation and released for five days in a bid to understand why and seek vengeance. He meets an alias in Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang), a mysterious woman who sets out to help him. <br/><br/>While it isn't for the weak hearted as I stated earlier, nor is it for the thick. 'Oldboy' is a film which doesn't spoon feed you too much of what's going on so you will have to have your brain switched on and interpret some key plot scenarios from earlier clues. It has a number of twists and possibilities which make it a riveting ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>The acting is superb with the ""anti-hero"" performed to a tee by Min-sik Choi (he also plays an outstanding role as the sadistic murderer in 'I Saw the Devil, six years on from this production). Ji - tae Yu is also excellent as one of the villains while the remaining cast members are all fantastic.<br/><br/>The main plot twist is disturbing, utterly brilliant yet at the same time disappointing. It feels all a little too unrealistic; in fact while others may argue to climatic half to the film is where its genius lies, I much preferred the opening half before everything unravelled. But that's just my opinion!<br/><br/>'Oldboy' focuses heavily on character and its complex narrative and the end product is very good. In the same genre, 'I Saw the Devil' (also starring Min-ski Choi) is my favourite revenge movie of that nature - it took me by storm! <br/><br/>'Oldboy' is more complex and much beefier in terms of what makes up the running time which is its downfall as well as its merit."

","One of the best movies I've seen in years... Thanks to Netflix. I will have to watch again to give it a better review. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend watching. My Grandmother introduced me to Samurai films at an early age, so in honor of her I started watching them again. Then I started watching the majority of the recommended ones on Netflix. Eventually Old Boy came up and I really didn't have any idea what to expect. Get passed the dubbed voices or subtitles and you have very interesting stories. The revenge is like no other form I can describe... Intricately written and directed movie. Should be on my top ten... Right up their with the Good, the Bad, and the Weird!"

","I thought the movie was really good... but I will watch it again to make sure I understand it completely. I get the main story of the movie, there are just a couple of things about it that I feel I didn't get an answer for.<br/><br/>It is about a man who gets kidnapped the day of his daughters third birthday, and wakes up locked in a hotel room... his captors keep him there for 15 years and then just let him go. He now goes out to find out who stole 15 years of his life and why.<br/><br/>It is a controversial film with some scenes that will stick in your mind. The story is really good and the cast were really good.<br/><br/>This film was made in Korea and is spoken in Korean with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Apparently it is part 2 of a trilogy, but I didn't know that when I watched it and it didn't ruin it for me... but it does make me want to watch the whole trilogy.<br/><br/>The whole film kept me guessing and wondering what was happening and why he was kidnapped etc... when I got to the end of the movie I was shocked. It was a really good twist ending to a movie. I recommend this film to anyone who likes thrillers and doesn't mind subtitles.<br/><br/>I give this film a 7 out of 10... the rating might be higher when I watch it again though.<br/><br/>Plus, there is a live Octopus being eaten too... gross! :)<br/><br/>For more reviews check out my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

The score is always a vital part of a film and here we are well treated.<br/><br/>The film is flawed, however, some parts are not perfect and overall, it may feel a bit forced at times.

","Do not get me wrong, Oldboy is an original and a good movie, but it is way Over-Rated, it is so over-rated I was actually disappointed after I watched the movie.<br/><br/>What I mean is that due to the ""so excellent ratings and over-hyped and over-described reviews"" I thought I would see a ""Masterpiece"". Because of these ratings and reviews I think it killed my expectations and ruined my viewing of the movie.<br/><br/>What is good about this movie is the twists and shocks in the story which lets you wanting to know what is next!<br/><br/>And boy are you for a shock at the end.<br/><br/>The acting, directing and writing are all good and all the elements that makes a good Korean revenge thriller are there.<br/><br/>If you love Asian movies in general and Korean movies especially, than do not miss Oldboy. <br/><br/>Just please lower your expectations."
"depestere","7","0","3","18 September 2012"," An........Interesting Film
","So this was one of the first Korean films that I saw almost over a year ago and here are my two cents. This movie starts off great with, as previously described, unique visuals, great music, interesting plot and generating an overall good ambiance. However, it goes downhill, as our protagonist steps out the door, albeit gradually ending the film with one of the most random and unrelated endings that I have ever seen. I was speechless and after a few minutes I was asking myself, what the heck did I just see? However, I was compelled to see this film again and this time around I did appreciate all the beauty of this film and its boldness for its era. In conclusion, I really do believe that there is a decent film in all of this and that the two extreme ratings are not the only options. It is a matter of preference and how much blood and gore you can stomach to watch. Though if you are a movie fanatic and a huge fan of Korean cinema, I urge you to watch this film twice and truly appreciate its unique beauty"
"g-phanisrinivas","8","0","3","10 August 2012"," Gratifying for its fazing effect
","Well, before I start reviewing this Korean masterpiece, thanks to Sanjay Gupta and his team for making Zinda else I wouldn't have known about this film. Zinda is an unabashed copy of this film. Although, Zinda has hits high points, Oldboy scores over it.<br/><br/>I know nothing about Eastern films let alone Korean. Although I wouldn't call this the best film ever but it is undoubtedly good. It makes you hate it, shocks you and tests how much violence you can digest. Finally, the ending could shock you more than you ever were. Park Chan-wook's direction is excellent and that makes the film very enjoyable. <br/><br/>Cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon is another scoring point in the film. The acting by the leads is just consistent and nothing worth mentioning. Story and screenplay are Oldboy's assets and it makes thorough use of them to overcome all the shortcomings. The opulent fight scene halfway through the film where the lead character fights his way through a hundred goons with a hammer is wonderfully choreographed and shot in a single take. The film deserves a watch for that scene. Then the film slightly drags as it shifts focus to other things but it regains momentum towards the end. The final scene is abstract and confusing but you are shocked enough not to think of that scene.<br/><br/>Violence and a bold theme are the USP of the film and it scores for that. On the whole, the film gives a distorted image of the world around in a very convincing manner which is far from true."
"Mistman92","8","0","3","12 February 2011"," Video that doesn't get the respect it so easily deserves
","Any person who cannot handle a few scenes of violence, animal cruelty *overstatement*, and a little incest none of which is very graphic are the ones who do not appreciate this film for what it is. You have to look into the complex structure of the movie, including the precise camera angles, emotional distress of the main characters, and a wonderfully place soundtrack.<br/><br/>The ending is outstanding, and anyone who didn't get premise of the movie refused to give ""Oldboy"" the attention it deserves. Everything is done so well, even the order of events leading to the shocking end which has several twists and turns along the way. Yet, as in every drama/thriller there are a few plot holes.. Ones the general public shouldn't even be able to comprehend unless they have seen the movie several times or have some historical knowledge. All in all, a wonderful film created for people who can look deeper than the gore and immerse themselves in the pain."

","Loosely based on the Japanese 'manga' of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya, 'Oldboy', directed Park Chan-wook is a violent film, that disturbs it's viewer, but that is it's sheer power. This one turns out to be a legendary watch! <br/><br/>'Oldboy' is about A Man locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing his captor's motives. When he is finally released, he finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and violence.<br/><br/>'Oldboy' is gruesome from the word go. It is amongst the most violent films you'll ever see, but it's bloodshed is so justified, that it grows on you, without the feeling of throwing up. It's the power, the depression & the search of a man, to get his life back, which is now impossible.<br/><br/>'Oldboy' not only promotes violence like never before, but also, throws in stuff dealing with incest. Please be forewarned, before tuning in this now classic. This film is not meant for everyone!<br/><br/>Park Chan-wook's direction is fantastic. He has a strong vision, which he executes in here with violence, as it's shoulder. The Screenplay is arresting. Jeong Jeong-hoon's Cinematography captures the Violence and it's power too really.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Choi Min-sik is outstanding in the lead role. He delivers a haunting performance, that offers strength. Yu Ji-tae excels. Kang Hye-jeong is superb. Oh Dal-su leaves a mark as well.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Oldboy' is gutsy, gory and one heck of a watch. A Powerful Film All The Way!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","3","16 September 2010"," Even Monsters have the right to live
","¨ Even though I'm no more than a monster - don't I, too, have the right to live? ¨ Oldboy has become a cult classic among film fans because the images in the movie are so strong, raw, and nothing like you've seen before, that they stay with you for quite some time (and I mean ¨raw¨ literally because in one scene the main character eats a live octopus, how is that for a first?). The story is very original and the twists keep on coming as the movie reaches its climatic ending. Oldboy is actually based on a Japanese Manga written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiva of the same name. This is the second of three movies that Chan-wook Park directed of the Revenge Trilogy; the first was Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the third Lady Vengeance. I haven't seen either of those films yet, but critics agree that Oldboy is his best one of the three. The three are also separate movies so you don't have to see them to understand the plot. Oldboy currently ranks in the IMDb top 250 films at the 113th spot so as you can see it is a much respected film among viewers. This is perhaps one of the best Korean movies I've seen, as I really didn't enjoy The Host as much as almost everyone else did. I think this is a superior movie and much more complex as well. Yes, there is plenty of violence, but it is very different from other revenge films and it really took me by surprise. The plot is a very original one, it is developed really well, and I have to admit the less you know about this movie before you see it the better because the experience is very unique. My expectations however were a little higher for this film, but it didn't disappoint either.<br/><br/>Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is the main character of this film. On the eve of his daughter's birthday he is detained by police officers for being drunk and for disorderly conduct. Dae-su seems to be the typical alcoholic who doesn't even know what he is saying and you can tell this is not the first time this has happened to him. His friend, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji) has to come and bail him out so he can make it to his daughter's birthday. Once they are released from the police station, Dae-su decides to call his wife and daughter from a phone booth. No Joo-hwan takes the phone from him and lets his wife know that he is safe and he will be taking him soon, but when he hangs up there is no trace of Dae-su. He has been kidnapped for an unknown reason and is imprisoned in an undisclosed room. Dae-su narrates what is happening to him. He remains imprisoned for 15 years without having a clue to who has captured him and for what reason. His only connection with the outside world is a small TV. One night he discovers that his wife has been murdered and police suspect him as the killer because they have found traces of his blood in the house. Dae-su cannot wait to escape and get his revenge although he has no clue who might have done such a horrible thing to him. After a long 15 years he is finally released for no apparent reason and now it is up to him to discover why he had to endure such punishment and he is in search for revenge. After being released he begins a friendship with Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang), a female chef who helps him investigate what has happened. The plot begins to develop from this point on with many twists and unexpected turns which make this a very gripping movie.<br/><br/>The premise for Oldboy is very original and the story really grabs your attention from the very beginning because you want to know what the heck is going on. Why would somebody want to imprison someone only to let them out 15 years later without ever explaining anything? As the plot develops the questions begin to be answered. This is not your typical revenge movie; it is very original and has many twists and surprises. It is also a very raw and violent movie so it is not for everyone. I really thought the weakest part of the movie was the dialog, but the good plot holds your attention anyway. Min-sik Choi does a good job as the main character as he is not your typical hero and has several flaws. He is more of an anti-hero. Some of the action scenes are made really well, there is one memorable scene where Dae-su fights a bunch of guys in a corridor reminiscing Tarantino's Kill Bill. Oldboy is not close to being one of my favorite films, but I have to admit that it is a very unique experience. The film isn't entertaining, it is more artistic than anything else and the final 30 minutes really were the highlight of the film for me. The ending reminded me of Shyamalan's earlier films like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable because of the surprise ending."

","I heard quite a few things about this Korean film, that it was really grizzly, so I was expecting it to be to a horror film, and even though I was wrong on that part, I knew it was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is planning to see his daughter on the day of her birthday, after getting out of the police station completely drunk, but he disappears without trace. He has been imprisoned in a shabby cell with no explanation, meagre amounts of food, one range of clothes, one bed, one television, and gas that puts him to sleep every night, and he counts the time he is inside. He marks his time on his arm with tattoos, and he starts chipping his way through the wall, prepared to fall however many stories up he is, as long as he gets out. All of the sudden he wakes up coming out a trunk in a field, with fresh expensive clothes, money and a cellphone, and of course the knowledge that he was imprisoned for fifteen years, and now he wants revenge. He stops in a Japanese restaurant where he gets a suspicious phone call, and he meets chef Mido (Hye-jeong Kang), and they quickly have a strong attraction for each other. She wants to help Dae-su Oh find the ones who held in captivity, and the reason why, and he doesn't care how he gets to the truth or who gets hurt in the process. Eventually, after a few back and forth moment, Dae-su Oh concludes that it was Woo-jin Lee (Ji-tae Yu) responsible, but he tells a big secret when explaining the reasons. It wasn't just that it was saying a certain something to Mido, or that both of them were hypnotised to fall in love with each other, the reason they were was because they are already married! Also starring Dae-han Ji as No Joo-hwan, Dal-su Oh as Park Cheol-woong, Byeong-OK Kim as Mr. Han, Seung-Shin Lee as Yoo Hyung-ja and Jin-seo Yun as Lee Soo-ah. It is an interesting story, if a little vague in places, but for seeing moments like eating a live octopus, some fight scenes, and of course the teeth pulling scene (inspired by Marathon Man), it is certainly an action thriller to admire. Very good!"
"chiahui79","10","0","3","20 July 2010"," Definitely 1 of My Top 10 Movies! Simply Magnificent!
","I decided to watch this movie after checking the reviews & I was totally blown away. My eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end. Before this, I never thought Korean movies could be so good. I started to pay a lot of attention to movies from Korea especially from Park Chan Wook. There are still a lot of good movies from Korea like Sympathy from Lady Vengeance, Sympathy from Mr. Vengeange, Thirst (all Park Chan Wook's movies), Memories of Murder, The Chaser, Mother, My Sassy Girl, The Host & etc but Oldboy remains as my favourite.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil this movie for you but in a nutshell, it is about a man trying to find out the person responsible for imprisoning him in a private jail for 15 years. Great acting from all the cast especially Choi Min Sik. I would like to see him in Hollywood one day.<br/><br/>Once again, if you haven't watched this movie, do not hesitate & go watch it (it is No. 113 on IMDb best movies). However some scenes might be too gruesome for some viewers (not nearly as gruesome as Saw or Hostel in my opinion). Those faint hearted could find out & skip those scenes especially one towards the end of the movie. It is too good a movie not to watch."
"arthera09","7","0","3","3 July 2010"," expectations ruined this movie for me
","I had really high expectations for the film. I think it ruined it for me. It was a really good movie, but it never flowed for me. The tone never seemed consistent to me. It felt like it wanted to be a thriller at times, an action movie at times, and a comedy at times. I do not think it blended the three themes that well. Visually it was an extremely impressive movie. There were some shots that seemed on the verge of being truly beautiful with some cool color themes, but they always fell short. The one fight scene that the movie is famous for is really one of the most impressive fight scenes I have ever seen. It was nice mix of powerful action that really gave us a feeling of the character's desperation. The relationship between the main characters always felt forced to me and the hypnosis explanation never sat well with me. I guess it explained the reason why the relationship felt forced and out of place, but without a meaningful character relationship the movie felt hallow. I really enjoyed the build up, but the twists never shocked or surprised me. I enjoyed the acting, but nothing really stood out for me as a whole. It was a good movie, but not remarkable for me."

Whenever I watch a movie I can pretty much predict everything, but Oldboy got me going till the end. The last smile still make me wonder. The movie doesn't just show you THE ANSWER, you have to think and come up with your own answers. A lot of people don't get the point of story, or they get caught up in some moral debate. What I've got out of this film is, we all try to live our lives, some keep it simple, others, complicated. But even the simplest lives will commit unintentional acts that might come back to haunt them. And in life, there are no villains or heroes. We all believe we're the good guy, but are we really??

"david-g-725-408845","10","0","2","2 May 2010"," What a ride...
","This is probably the movie that brought me into Asian cinema. I had seen a few films of Kurosawa or John Woo before, but I never took a look further into it. Oldboy changed that completely. Oh Dae-su is kidnapped on his daughter's birthday and then held captive for 15 years. He than one day wakes up on top of a skyscraper, at the exact same spot he was captured. Now he is looking for the reason of his captivity and he wants revenge<br/><br/>I first heard about this movie from other critics calling it one of the best movies of its year or something along those lines. So I rented it and was absolutely stunned. The cinematography is so beautiful yet gruesome, it's full of pictures that will stay in your head days after watching it. Might it be one of the memorable fight scenes or the breath-taking finale. The story is very simple in its premise, but develops very well and takes a few unexpected turns. A guy looking for revenge sounds very familiar and not original at all, but what Park Chan-wook does with it, is something no one else could have done the same way. In my opinion he might very well be one of the best directors of the last decade and this shows exactly why. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae do an amazing job playing their respective roles. The often very unusual scenes aren't easy to play, but the two pull it off pretty good. The other actors do a decent job as well. The soundtrack is just great and has a style close to romantic composer Edvard Grieg. The songs fit perfectly to the scenes and underline the tragic tone of the movie.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the best movies of the 2000's. It has a great story, solid actors and a magnificent score. The film may be a little violent at times and the story with its difficult themes is definitely not for everybody, but you should give it a shot."
"Anyoneatnowhere","7","0","3","31 January 2010"," Stylistically brilliant but way too unbelievable
","I know, I know: it's a movie, I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief etc. But even so, I just couldn't buy the ending of this movie. <br/><br/>The story is very good, though, and the plot twists are believable and work well (up until the end). I also loved the contemporary film noir style of this film. Lots of deep, scarlet reds, purples and black illuminated under fluorescent lighting or stark, low-watt bulbs. <br/><br/>An abridged telling of the story would tell you that this is a film about one man's revenge and penance. Dae-su Oh, a notorious drunk, is imprisoned in a nondescript hotel room for 15 years, without being told who imprisoned him or why. After he manages to escape, he finds that things are eerily set-up to ease him back into life on the outside - a homeless man gives him a cell phone and a wallet filled with cash, a young sushi waitress appears to take a shine to him, after passing out in the street, he's immediately picked up and rescued by a stranger. <br/><br/>It would be unfair to give out any other information, since the first two-thirds of this film are deeply satisfying on an intellectual and a sensory level. It's a rich experience and, even with all the blood and grit, there's a sophisticated neatness to each frame. The direction is sublime and I think you could pause any shot and marvel at how gorgeous this film looks. The soundtrack and visuals, together, make for a stunning experience and the performance by Min-sik Choi needs to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>But then, you get to the last part of the film. The finale, the moment where all will be revealed, and Dae-su is vindicated. And... it all falls a bit flat. IMO. Sure there's a decent twist but I wasn't buying the depths of madness these characters would go to to achieve ""revenge"". The end seemed a tad illogical and it felt like a cop out, as if the writers couldn't come up with a more realistic scenario. <br/><br/>I read somewhere that's it's based on a Manga, so maybe that's why it's so twisted and maybe the ending makes more sense in a comic book but I wasn't convinced. <br/><br/>I would recommend checking this out, if only because it grips you from the start and because it offers such a rich visual and auditory experience. In the end, though, you might be disappointed."

Just try to not be blinded on some of the things....It's a REVENGE and nobody knows how the revenge will turn except in the end, its the most ""how do I say it' it's the worst revenge somebody could get.

","Oldboy is an entertaining film, but highly overrated. <br/><br/>The story is interesting. Oh Dae-Su being imprisoned by mysterious people for fifteen years and teaching himself how to fight inside his zoo-like habitat is an interesting mystery and one that I wanted to find out. The plot reminded me of The Count of Monte Cristo early on, and when the movie referenced Monte Cristo then I realized it would go off in a different direction, and it did. <br/><br/>The movie and mystery dragged a bit when Oh Dae-Su was back out in the real world. There are hardly any clues given throughout the film. A mystery is supposed to unravel piece by piece, and this movie was set up, then ninety minutes of the same questions not being answered, then everything gets wrapped up in ten minutes at the end. <br/><br/>I liked the twist at the end of Oh Dae-Su falling in love with his young daughter, but the way it was kept secret and explained was silly. The villain went through so much trouble, care, and effort to set it all up. When he is explaining the twist to Oh Dae-Su it seems so convoluted and complicated that it loses its impact. There is just too much explanation at the end, done with cheesy flashbacks of the villain and his sister. The idea of the twist is good, but there was just too much to explain. The reason the twist in the Sixth Sense worked was because it took one a second to tell, and then we are SHOWN some previous shots in the film that help support the twist. It lasts about a minute.<br/><br/>Oldboy seems to be a film that people like because of the ending, that is why I am so critical of it. Overall, I was entertained and enjoyed the movie, but it is certainly not one of the best movies ever made, as many suggest."
