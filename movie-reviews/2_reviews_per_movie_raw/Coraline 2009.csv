","The Movie Coraline is an animated film well worth watching more than once. SPOILER ALERT The movie starts out introducing Coraline, voice actor Dakota Fanning, who is new to the Pink palace and is soon introduced to the black cat, voice actor Keith David, and Wybie Lovat, voice actor Robert Bailey Jr., who both are stalking Coraline. We then meet her mother Mel Jones, voice actor Teri Hatcher, and her father Charlie Jones, voice actor John Hodgman. Corallines' new life is shown to be less than wonderful as she meets her other tenants and is unable to realize her dream of gardening. Soon she discovers another world, which is much better in every way tailored specifically to Coraline based on information gathered by a spying Coraline doll carried by Coraline unknowingly. The other mother quickly turns villainess, as she is unable to get Coraline to do what she wants. With the help of the black cat, Coraline is able to escape the other mother and return home saving other children's souls who were less fortunate than she was. As well as her parents who were trapped to lure Coraline back to the other world.<br/><br/>The movie end with Coraline now happy with her real world and realizing she had everything she needed there all along. The theme of wanting more than what you already have and not seeing how good you have it is common among films today. However, the creative imagination of Coraline takes a spin and makes a very unbelievable situation seem plausible. The motif of the movie is seen often as the theme is drawing on what is real and what is too good to be true. When the sound and lighting are as controlled as in Coraline the Director can really impress upon the viewer a believable world that you can see yourself involved. The songs used make the world's first the regular world and then the other world seem like a place of dreary and boring plainness and then a world of pure imagination yet also terror. When the other world is dissolving the technique of fading the edges into white is pure genius. <br/><br/>The angle also helps you see through a subjective viewpoint in the majority of the scenes, even though it is not truly the camera angle but how the slides are drawn to show certain angles. The theme is so crucial in Coraline because few people would think the way Coraline is acting at the start of the movie might even be bad but as the movie progresses you see how she is flawed in her original outlook and judgments of her parents and new neighbors."

","I am eleven years old and I absolutely loved this movie. Every bit of it was fantastic. I read the book before I watched the movie and was quite satisfied. I, for one did not have any nightmares of such. I think adults are completely overestimating what children can't handle. This was a fine movie. But maybe some of the elements weren't appropriate for younger viewers, like when Miss Spink and Forcible were performing in the other world. I may be different then other children because I can tolerate more scary elements. This was creepy and very original. I loved how twisted and strange it was. The movie was very good and I do suggest some of you actually allow yourselves to enjoy it without criticizing the moment you see something that seems inappropriate. I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and trust me if I can endure The Lost Boys, I am pretty sure I can endure this. Parents, stop being overprotective and allow yourself to see the good things."

","As a Neil Gaiman fan, I was, of course, very happy with the book ""Coraline"", and was extremely excited to hear that a movie was being made for it. I had very high expectations from director Henry Selick after seeing 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach'.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>It followed the book surprisingly closely, though there were a few anomalies (the character of Wybie, for instance, didn't exist in the book). It had that Tim Burton-esquire feel about it; terrifying, but in an entertaining sort of way. There were one or two scenes which were a little over-the-top for younger children, but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>You could just tell from the opening scene alone that you were in for a treat. Hauntingly beautiful, well choreographed, and, plain and simple, a bit terrifying; it really hooked your attention and promised a good time.<br/><br/>However, there were two problems throughout the movie that I could spot:<br/><br/>One was that some scenes were a little choppy in the animation; almost like they hadn't quite taken enough pictures to make it run smoothly. Unfortunately, with stop-motion animation, this is difficult to avoid, and it isn't overly distracting anyway.<br/><br/>The other was Coraline's mother was a little... angry. Yes, she's supposed to be constantly frustrated and such, but I think she went a little overboard. Fortunately, Teri Hatcher redeemed herself with her portrayal of the Other Mother, which was brilliant.<br/><br/>Coraline earns a 9.5 out of 10."

","Feisty eleven-year-old Coraline walks through a secret door and discovers a parallel reality. That reality is sort of similar to the life she already knows yet deeply unsettling in a number of ways. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.<br/><br/>All of this immense undertaking is courtesy writer and director Henry Selick, director of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the well crafted adaptation of Neil Gaiman's international best-selling children's novel. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. Selick himself worked on the film for three years. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy-tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. is a masterful movie and an exciting tale of mystery and imagination.<br/><br/>In the rotting nooks and crannies of Coraline's new home the real story begins and where she discovers a hidden doorway behind the wallpaper. Inside is her alternate space where there are doubles of her distracted parents now lavish loving attention on Coraline, the oddball neighbors are friendlier, and her pesky friend long longer speaks. Only her parents' eyes now black buttons give a clue that something isn't quite right.<br/><br/>Selick has created a world as much for adults as children as there are references dotted throughout that the young won't understand. The imagery, however, is very child like. Both talents live side by side and bodes well for Selick's previous work in Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach and even Monkeybone. His work has always been fascinating. Gaiman is to be credited with the story for sure, but this is Selick through and through. This film is sure to become an instant classic and as well executed as this movie is it should be."

","Henry Selick, the director of "" The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"", once again takes us to a world full of imagery and wonder...but this time...some of it is actually frightening. It was filled with such magic and enchantment that I completely forgot that it was a dark tale..until the occasional scares filled the air. It has some highly fun and amusing characters in it also, and that is the strongest thing of the movie. After viewing it, I came to the conclusion it was basically an ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale (girl entering new and strange world, plus the cat that talks makes it obvious) but this world has a dark twist. Filled with a great cast and terrific visionary, I feel this movie is fun for all ages (who says kiddos shouldn't be scared?)"
"jaredmobarak","8","231","306","6 February 2009"," Great, the village stalker Â… Coraline
","OK America, before you go blindly into an animated film with your young children, why don't you do a little research on what they are about to witness. A PG rating and stop-motion animated aesthetic do not always make a child-friendly adventure. Based upon the horror novella by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman, Henry Selick's Coraline is chockfull of heavy material, dark story threads, and bleak possibilities. For a guy like me, those things equal undivided success; for a child aged ten, those things equal nightmare filled evenings and parents writing angry letters to Focus Features for subjecting their children to lewd and horrific imagery. Well guess what parents? No one is to blame but you. I'm not saying keep all youngsters away, but do use some discretion on whether your son or daughter can handle the fantastical elements. This is very much Alice in Wonderland displayed in all its non-Disney possibilities. A cautionary tale on being careful what you wish for, our heroine must discover the difference between a world of people neglecting her and that of people doing all they can so that they may give her all she could ever want in the future. Life is not about getting it all right now, but instead a slow and steady climb built on love and trust, one whose benefits far outweigh the whirlwind romance that is never truly as it seems.<br/><br/>Remember folks, this is a story that won the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers; it's not all sing-songy like Selick's masterpiece A Nightmare Before Christmas. With that said, however, it is very, very good in a very, very different way. Be prepared for a methodically and deliberately paced story. More psychological terror than jump out at you scares, the tale of Coraline escaping into a parallel world, perfectly mirrored of her own only inhabited by animated dolls, is one of enlightenment and discovery of what love truly means. Do we all want the parents that dote on us? The guardians that will do what we want and when we want it? Of course we do. But that idyllic utopia doesn't exist, especially in the times for which we live today. Children need to be raised and supported and that takes money and a lot of hard work. What may seem like neglect in the eyes of a child is really two people doing all they can, sacrificing their time, in order to give him/her a chance at success. Only when Coraline sees the manipulation and truth behind the ""kindness"" her Other-Mother gives her does she realize what she has back at home.<br/><br/>What we are shown is a world through a tiny door in the wall of an old triple-segmented home. There are stories about this door used to explain the disappearances of some local children, including the sister of loudmouthed and shy Wybie Lovat's grandmother. Only a weathered black cat appears to know what is going on, what the too good to be true farce beyond the door is actually masking behind it. This cat can travel between worlds and therefore knows it all, allowing him to warn Coraline by orchestrating events via those she encounters. A disgruntled child is easily malleable and fooled when doted upon and given sweets and a smile. The mantra ""never talk to strangers"" is never more applicable than it is here. With something a tad off-kilter in the fantasy world, Coraline finds herself shaking it off and relishing the opportunity to experience all that she had dreamed of, not knowing that if her parents succeed with their new gardening catalog, those dreams will be fulfilled in reality. Patience is a virtue and youngsters unfortunately don't learn that fact until they are all grown up, finding ways to apologize to their parents for being such confused and naÃ¯ve monsters.<br/><br/>With some very nice voiceworkÂ—Dakota Fanning shines as our titular heroine; Keith David's baritone brings the cat's mixture of foreboding and help to life and Robert Bailey Jr. gets the nervous tick and stammer on the nose for Wybie, (short for WhyBorn, now that's a name you hope your parents never considered)Â—you do find yourself enveloped in this world. A rare thing for an animated film to begin with a cast listing, it thankfully doesn't detract from the escapism by making you think of the actor rather than the character. This fact works best with the mother, played by Teri Hatcher. I would never have been able to pick her voice out, but that just enhances it all the more, breathing life into the stop-motion clay form on screen, becoming the wolf in sheep's clothing villain necessary for it all to work.<br/><br/>Definitely soak in the aesthetic and intelligent storytelling as Coraline is for a thoughtful audience willing to delve deep into metaphors and hidden meaning. There is no ""approved for your Attention Deficit Disorder child"" stamp of approval here. In much the opposite direction, don't be surprised if your child hates you for making them sit through it. However, it is a tale that will resonate for a portion of the public, hitting on their own feelings of selfishness and wanting the spoils without the work. When your child is intellectually mature enough to handle a rich and deep story, you as a parent will know. When he or she can see a couple of big-bosomed, large older women dressed as mermaids with pasties and not laugh or get uncomfortable, that is when you should let them see Coraline. It is ultimately a film for all ages; one that shows you as adults how it all will get betterÂ—junior will one day understand the sacrifices you are makingÂ—and you children a fantastical world to escape to with consequences that will shake you into the realization of what you have right in front of you at home."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","61","78","7 February 2009"," Very enjoyable fantasy with superb animation
","Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" is a smart adaptation of Neil Gaiman's extremely popular award-winning novella. Selick's screenplay is excellent and faithful without being a carbon-copy of Gaiman's story, and Selick adds some of his own dialogue to the film, so his contribution is most certainly not only visual, and chooses which dialogue to use from the novel wisely. Less of a horror story than the novella and more of a dark fantasy, ""Coraline"" features a well-written and well-drawn lead character and brings the novel's bizarre world to life without compromise. The film's fantasy world grows more bizarre each time we see it, and is as discomforting as it is fun. I missed the singing rats from the novella, but this was more than compensated for by the visual splendor of the garden scene, and there are numerous other examples of the changes from the novel making total sense as Selick's vision of the story differs from Gaiman, but doesn't betray the original work of art, only compliments it. The voice cast is very good and one cannot praise the spectacular animation enough. I was very pleased with the 3D presentation here, it was very, very rarely (only once or twice) used as a 'cool effect', and overall was very tastefully used to give the visuals more depth. Perhaps the first really good film to have a wide release in 2009, and looking at the next few weeks I see more than one film I'm moderately interested in, so this might end up being a pretty good year."
"MartinHafer","8","19","22","7 March 2009"," Exceptional, but probably not for younger viewers
","CORALINE is an exceptional movie and I really have to admire the folks who made it. However, I should point out that this is NOT a movie for younger viewers because the movie is basically like walking into a nightmare. I think I'd be very hesitant to take a child younger than 10 to see it--it is that dark and scary.<br/><br/>When the film begins, you are blown away by the amazing stop-motion film work. I assumed it must have been computer generated, but amazingly the film was made using models and figures with interchangeable features. It is many generations beyond the old Rankin-Bass animation or even ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (also by the folks who brought us CORALINE). The artistry was amazing and so many little details and touches made the film look magical. In addition, I found a theater where it was shown in 3-D and I really think it's well worth the extra money to get the three dimensional experience because it was flawless.<br/><br/>The story is about a young girl who is unhappy. Her family just moved into a weird old Victorian era home but the parents are so busy with their job that they don't have much time for poor Coraline. Later, however, Coraline discovers an alternate world--one where everything looks a lot like the real world but seems perfect--so perfect that she'd rather live there. However, being a scary story, things of course aren't as they seem and this leads to a confrontation that could spell doom for the girl and her parents.<br/><br/>Excellent all around and I have no serious complaints. A very good film for older kids, teens and adults....but not little kids, as the film will probably scare them out of their wits. Don't let the PG rating fool you--this is NOT like a Disney or Nickelodeon film but more like an even more intensely dark Roald Dahl story done in stop-motion. Neil Gaiman is the author of this tale and my daughter read his story and the film and although they were different here and there (the film adds Wybie, for example), she said both were equally wonderful."
"uruseiranma","9","123","167","5 February 2009"," Henry Selick's latest film is a delight!
","Almost 3 weeks ago, I attended a screening from Ain't It Cool News to see Henry Selick's latest film, 'Coraline.' I was excited because the screening would showcase the film in 3-D technology, and there was the chance to do a Q&A with Director Henry Selick (unfortunately due to bad weather, Mr. Selick did not make it to our screening).<br/><br/>Before going in to see 'Coraline,' I had read the book on which the film was based. While many acclaimed it for it's storyline, I found it rather dull and predictable. I've been surrounded by fans of Neil Gaiman's work, though so far had never picked up a book written by him (though 'American Gods' did pique my interest).<br/><br/>Going into the film, I was not quite sure what to expect. I had had tastes of the film from the trailers, but the general consensus was that Henry Selick had tarnished Gaiman's story, turning it into 'Disney fodder.' The truth is: the film manages to be both charming and creepy.<br/><br/>For those not in the know, ""Coraline"" tells the tale of Coraline Jones, who moves to a new town and a house with several strange characters. As well, Coraline's parents just seem to have no time for her, and so she takes to exploring her new abode by herself. In her exploration, she uncovers a small door in the house, which seems to lead to nowhere. But upon revisiting the door late at night, it opens onto a parallel world that is much more whimsical and fun than the real world.<br/><br/>The one difference is that in the 'Other World,' almost all the inhabitants have buttons for eyes. But still, the other parents in this world pay attention to Coraline, and the rather blasÃ© atmosphere of the real world is electrified with color and interesting flights of fancy. It seems just so perfect...or is it? Henry Selick manages to take Neil Gaiman's story, and crafts a world that just seems to take great advantage of stop-motion in a world where the obvious choice would be to go for a totally computer-generated world. Seeing minute details such as Coraline's clothing made of actual material makes the world seem even more magical, where invisible giants manipulate the Lilliputians in this miniature world.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, and a number of other vocal actors give voice to a number of wonderful characters, with Hatcher really doing double and triple-duty with her vocal talents. Fanning on the other hand, fleshes out a character that seemed rather dull in Gaiman's work. Her voice gives Coraline the life that I didn't think was possible.<br/><br/>One unsung hero (along with the countless animators who will be passed over in the press junkets) is the composer, Bruno Corlais. Mr. Corlais had never crossed my ears until the screening, but his music lends a touch of brilliance to the film, and makes it seem almost like a European production. Growing up in he US in the early 80's, I saw a number of stop-motion productions from Europe that played on the Nickelodeon show 'Pinwheel.' Corlais' music just transported me to that simpler of times when music didn't need to be 'commercial.' His score really helps to establish the world as well, and uses some instruments that may sound foreign to American ears.<br/><br/>And if anyone is questioning if the 3-D is worth it-it is! This isn't the fly-in-your-face #-D that was seen 2-3 decades ago. It's subtler, but gives dimension to the miniature world of 'Coraline.' I think if you showed this film to a child in 3-D, they'd go home dreaming of creating their own little worlds of stop-motion puppets.<br/><br/>For the year 2009, 'Coraline' so far (as of 2/6/09), is my first enjoyable film experience. I'm hoping my other upcoming film hopefuls (Watchmen, Up, Transformers 2) will also make me feel as positive."
"Vic_max","Null","15","17","9 February 2009"," Dark, Stylish, Visually Amazing .... and not really for young kids.
","First - if you see this movie, try to see the 3D version - not all presentations are in 3D. Second, know that this movie is way too dark (IMHO) for kids under 10. Not only could the visuals be too intense, but the pacing is not that of a children's show.<br/><br/>OK - that said, this movie is great. The strength is in three areas: visuals (scenery, characters, and little 'details'), style (this is movie is simply a work of art - a very dark and offbeat style) and emotional impact (the film visually evokes a lot of childhood feelings about growing up).<br/><br/>The basic setup: A little girl and her parents move into a big, mysterious old home. One night, she learns that a little door in the house opens into a passageway to a parallel world. In this world, there are alternate versions of her parents, friends and everything ... as she journeys back and forth, she learns more and more about this world ... and the story progresses from there.<br/><br/>If that sounds a bit too simplistic, there's more to it in the full story. Plus, it's presented in a serious and dark tone - which adds to it's mystique. The only area I can knock it is in a tame use of 3D. There are definitely some spectacular 3D parts, but the way it's used in general makes it fade into background<br/><br/>If you're drawn to the visual aspects of movies, then this is must-see movie for 2009."

","Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe ""the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!"" (This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when them available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer).<br/><br/>You literally have to see this animation to believe it.....and I'm talking about the 2-D, not the 3-D (which is not even in the same ballpark.) Forget the 3-D glasses and watch this as you would any other movie....and get the Blu-Ray, if you can. You'll be extremely impressed at the colors and detail, and just plain blown away by it all.<br/><br/>Not only to the colors and detail dazzle, but the inventiveness here is really fun to watch and items change from one form or color to another. It reminded me of the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"" but with more sophisticated art.....but the same cleverness. <br/><br/>To me, all of this made the story almost secondary but the latter is very interesting, too. The story is unique; quite different, with a good message getting everything you want not always being as attractive as that sounds. Once ""Coraline"" meets here ""other"" parents, you'll really get hooked into this strange story filled with weird images and characters.<br/><br/>I only wish the Coraline had been a little bit nicer kid since it's easier to root for someone when they're likable but the story should keep you guessing and in suspense. That made the last half of the film very easy to get engrossed in because so many bizarre things happen here, you don't know how it's all going to end. Thus, I found myself not being concerned about her personality flaws. The minor characters in this story, by the way: such as ""Mr. Bobinsky,"" ""Miss Forcible"" and ""Miss Spink"" - are a real hoot.<br/><br/>I'd say this film is more for adults than kid, especially if one appreciates great artwork and creativity."

After she discovers the entrance to an apparently enhanced version of her reality, she'll soon find out that too much perfection can't be real.<br/><br/>Good and imaginative story, delighting visuals, creepiness from the beginning and a couple scary scenes make this an enjoyable film."
"dumontaaron55-1","10","15","18","4 September 2009"," Rare Magic
","**** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Aaron Dumont<br/><br/>A work like Coraline is, much like Pixar's Up, a relieving work. The state of mainstream cinema today---a cynical feeding tube of explosions, borderline-playboys, one-dimensional insults to characters and character development, and pretty much vapid cultural nothingness---seems always to be steeped in a complete lack of ideas, thought or obstacles. That, among several other things, is what makes Coraline so special. Of course, it's still a great work when standing on it's own, but such an unlikely breath of fresh air is simply difficult to come across these days---Coraline is well-near rapturous. The endless sense of unsettling terror, of mystery, of complete perplexity---the kinetic, vibrant balance between emotion, adventure and hallucinatory near-myth is purely stunning. In the wasteland of today's arts and entertainment medium, one so dense with mediocrity that intellect can barely survive in it, Coraline finds itself in the humble, calm, albeit mundane world of a young girl named (ever-so-obviously enough) Coraline. Coraline, bored with her limited surroundings, workaholic parents and (utter lack of) contact and friends, goes exploring in her twisty, spirally house, before finding a small door, leading through a pulsating, acid-like tunnel, before getting dragged right into a darkly perfect alternate life, with an Other Mother, Other Father, delicious meals, ridiculously luxurious mansion/garden/shows and magic/et cetera. Though as Coraline gets more and more obsessed with this psychedelic happy-circus alternate life, she begins to become disillusioned by a series of unfortunate findings; the mandatory buttons-for-eyes, the Other other's insanely cruel punishment towards Coraline's only friend, the trapped souls... I won't reveal much more; such a movie needs to be experienced. During the final moments of the movie, the dusky, cloudy shades from previously bloom into complex interplays of lights, shadows, primaries, often wandering off into more psychedelic regions, often entering a twisted dream logic and topsy-turvy psyche, though the brilliance of Coraline is that is stays earthy and on its feet even when it has its head and arms embraced right into the wildest of fantasies, dreams, nightmares and puzzles---the terrifying, vertiginous scene where Coraline has a final standoff between her and the Other Mother, is one of pure, handcrafted imagination; it's something so antique yet so inventive, something nostalgic yet open and liberating that it can only be one thing, something difficult-to-recognize but more than welcome: genius."
"TOMNEL","9","68","97","6 February 2009"," Imaginative story, amazing visuals and uniquely great music.
","Henry Selick's latest movie, and his first in 8 years is a true treat. It was excellent in every way, except for the emotional punch, which wasn't even really necessary. The 3-D is very good, and without the 3-D, though the movie would lack the depth, it still would stand out. It is the visuals that make this movie so great, but the characters, plot and music are all top notch too, which add up to a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her family have just moved, and Coraline is bored. She has no friends in this new place, and her parents are quite intent on ignoring her. The only other kid that lives close by, Wyborn (Robert Bailey Jr.), is irritating to Coraline, and she finds the dolls in her room to be better friends. After Wyborn gives Coraline a doll that looks like her, strange occurrences begin to happen. Coraline finds a small door leading to an alternate, seemingly perfect universe where her button eyed parents feed her good food and give her presents for no reason. This universe is not all that it seems, and Coraline learns this the hard way.<br/><br/>Henry Selick has always been about the visuals. His first film, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", showed that his knack was for the sights, and amazingly, his animation and style has evolved. ""Coraline"" is just as good looking as any of his past works, if not more so, and the animation has gotten better and crisper. Every little set, and every character is bizarrely designed to fit into this surreal movie.<br/><br/>The main critique for this film seems to be that it has no emotion in it. Though emotions aren't a prominent aspect of Coraline, there is emotion. Coraline doesn't have a clicking relationship with her mom and dad, but that's why she loves the other mother and father so much. Coraline as a character has enough emotion to be the lead to a film like this. This wasn't meant to be a tear jerker animation. It was clearly made to bring Neil Gaiman's strange plot to life with dazzling animation.<br/><br/>Doing the music is Bruno Coulais, and briefly They Might Be Giants. Mr. Coulais's score is beautiful, and strange, and most importantly, fitting. The music sounds how Coraline should sound, and it is a great listen. It is easily comparable to Danny Elfman's score for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". They both have catchy, sad and unique music all rolled into one. They Might Be Giants also wrote a song, which is nice sounding, though nowhere near as catchy or lovely as Coulais.<br/><br/>If I had any problem with this film, it would be that it didn't dive far enough into the alternate universe, but even that didn't lower the movie in my opinion. This was an excellent animated film, and is one that can actually be qualified as a family film, in that all members of the family can and probably will enjoy this.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild language, violence and mildly sexual animation."

When the Other Mother invites Coriline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her.<br/><br/>""Coraline"" is a dark and creepy animation that follows the style of Tim Burton in ""Corpse Bride"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" with non- likable characters. In addition, there is no subtle message for children. Therefore, it seems to be primarily recommended to adult audiences. The nightmarish environment is supported by awesome cinematography and a great music score. None of the characters is totally likable .My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Coraline"""

With the 3-D, nothing really popped out of you, but it just gave it an extra depth that made it more real. I think it was so cool.<br/><br/>The movie was really cute.

","This review is so important that I wanted to watch the film three or four times with a pause in between... so here we are 6 years after the release.<br/><br/>And I can tell you that this is not merely a ""10"" but one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>In the Olympics they only give 10s to ""perfect"" performances. After four viewings, I can see this film is flawless. The story never gets dull or predictable. Every child can relate to the ""grass is always greener"" syndrome and every adult can relate to being a child. The dialog is so sharp it hurts. The voice actors are astounding. The animation is the best I have ever seen next to Little Price and that comparison is not fair but that specific film did not exist in 2009. (It was released in 2015).<br/><br/>I loved the cat. This could be the only film in history that not only has a cat co-star but the cat always acts ... like a cat.<br/><br/>I will see this film several more times in the years ahead. That is a promise.<br/><br/>Watch it because it is fun. Watch it to be entertained. Watch it to see what perfection looks like."
"Apemangalore","10","9","11","14 February 2009"," An instant all-time favorite
","First off, the visuals in Coraline are absolutely, undeniably breathtaking. I managed to catch this film in 3D, and I have to say that I admire the way that it's used here, as it doesn't rely on constant ""flying off of the screen and into your faceÂ™"" moments. In fact, this is probably the most effective 3D movie I've ever seen, right up there with 2007's Beowulf (which, coincidentally, was also co-written by Neil Gaiman). That said, I'm sure that Coraline looks almost just as beautiful in 2D, as nearly all of the environments are just so incredibly lush, and the ones that aren't are bizarre and spooky.<br/><br/>Ontop of being one of the best 3D films I've ever seen, this is also one of the scariest animated films - period - that I've watched. Seriously, there were several kids in the audience screaming during the movie's opening credits (which involves a cloth doll having her innards removed and replaced by The Other Mother, and is definitely one of the more creepishly enjoyable moments of the film). I'm not sure if I would recommend Coraline to anyone under the age of 6.<br/><br/>As far as the story and characters go, and for somebody who hasn't read the book, I was thoroughly impressed. It's an involving, sophisticated fairytale with a ton of heart, and one that I'm sure a lot of adults will enjoy. Ontop of Coraline being such a lovable protagonist, The Other Mother is brilliantly frightening in all of her forms, rivaling some of the best animated villains before her. Another one of my favorite characters was The Cat (voiced excellently by Keith David), who is used as a great ""tool"" near the end of the film. XD About the only problem that I had was that Coraline's real parents treat her with such disdain throughout the beginning of the movie. Again, even as somebody who hasn't read the book (though now I'm really wanting to), I still felt that that was a little...off.<br/><br/>Overall, Coraline is an excellent work of art that surpassed most of my already high expectations. Seriously, go out and see this movie, folks - in 2D or 3D. I'll definitely be seeing it at least a few more times while it's still in theaters."
"joker-4","9","4","4","11 June 2012"," Henry Selick's animation masterpiece
","Henry Selick, director of cult-classic and animation masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, offers up another piece of animation magic and proves that he can do so without the creative help of Tim Burton. Of course, working from a story written by graphic novel wizard Neil Gaiman certainly has its advantages.<br/><br/>The star and titular character of the story, Coraline, is the perfect imaginative kid for a perfect imaginative tale, set in a similar vein as the children from Narnia or even Dorothy GaleÂ… if both were re-imagined by the aforementioned Tim Burton, even though Gaiman is absolutely no stranger to all things eerie as this tale clearly shows. Coraline, voiced by Dakota Fanning, is a bit of an A-type brat and ignored by her typically over-worked 21st Century parents who spend more time in front of a laptop screen than listening to their only offspring. And so the tale begins.<br/><br/>Coraline is whisked away into the troublesome but adventuresome (and aren't they always?) ""Other"" world where, at first, her Other-Mother and Other-Father treat her to a royal treatment, one not used to back at her real home. Then, as is apt to occur with such fairy tales, the young girl indeed finds out that strange things are afoot at the Circle K. Meanwhile, the viewer is whisked away into yet another gorgeous world of stop-motion animation where Selick's imaginative realism borders on pop-art candy for kids and something more sinisterly macabre that would certainly induce nightmares for the under-10 crowd, which includes ghost children, a wanna-be mouse-circus ringleader, and retired actresses whose age could be counted like the rings of a tree.<br/><br/>As it is easy enough to imagine, the promises and threats of the Other-world soon have real implications in the real one. Selick treats the viewer into stunning images of cobwebs, raindrops and creepy spaces along with a fun cast of characters, including a know-it-all cat perfectly voiced by Keith David. Aside from the goth-lite plot and a nearly-too convenient wrap-up, Selick does his very best to keep the craft of his animation at the peak of its form while also using it to benefit the story, something that Burton seemed to forget in the not- quite-as-hip CORPSE BRIDE (2005).<br/><br/>Fun, beautiful to watch and perhaps mistargeted to a kiddie crowd that Pixar usually caters to, CORALINE is a winner. And, perhaps if released in Pixar-free year, would have been an Oscar winner as well."
"kdnor2011","9","4","4","21 April 2011"," Very Creepy
","When people think 2009 in animated movies, they probably think of Pixar's Up, it went on to win best animated feature and even got a best picture nomination. Well as great as Up was, I have to disagree with the Academy, because Coraline was my favorite animated film of that year. This has to be one of the creepiest animated films I have ever seen. According to Doug Walker, Don Bluth had a saying that you can show kids as much dark stuff as you want as long as it all leads up to a happy ending. If that's true, than Coraline is like a modern day Don Bluth movie.<br/><br/>OK, negatives first, Whybie got annoying at times, it has a few immature moments that clash with the dark tone and it doesn't work, and it might be a little too dark for kids.<br/><br/>This is a creepy flick, the colors and lighting really add to the dark atmosphere. The relationship between Coraline and her parents is actually really good, that is how kids really act, granted real kids might swear a little more, but this film shows a real relationship between parents and kids. The characters are a lot of fun, and acted very well. It's pretty funny at times, and even has a catchy song from the other father. Plus it's nice to see animation that isn't computer generated in this day and age.<br/><br/>Coraline is one of the creepiest, and best animated films I've ever seen. It ranks up with some of Disney and Pixar's best flicks. Although I actually think it might scare young children, so if you have a child under 10, you might want to watch it with them."

","I was enchanted just by what I saw in the trailer- it just looked...weird. And weird is what I love. When I finally watched the film I was taken away to a strange, wonderful land- I feat only Guillermo del Toro has managed before. It was just so...imaginative. Every individual thing was so...individual- straight from the imagination of a genius, and I loved every minute. At times, maybe it goes a little over the top, and perhaps it is a bit long, but I'm willing to venture it's better than anything Tim Burton has every done. The difference is that I don't think Burton every quite gets it just right, and this really hits the spot. It's scary, really quite scary at times, but that's fine, I think children should be allowed to be subjected to that, was there never a film that terrified you as a child? But not only that, it's just a fascinating, mystical place, and the whole thing is just wonderful. It's worth watching just because it looks amazing, but with the plot and the imagination of a genius in there too it makes Coraline one to watch with the whole family."

"Pozdnyshev","10","5","6","16 July 2015"," So Many Things Going On Here
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is simply a triumph. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out. Although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone younger than 16; there are some pretty messed-up undertones swirling around here.<br/><br/>The first level is the craftsmanship. It raises the bar of stop-motion work to a level higher than it has ever been before. The voice acting is impeccable. And the music is haunting, inspired, and practically couldn't have been improved upon. This alone adds up to a superbly entertaining experience.<br/><br/>The second level is the writing, which is where the real genius is. On the surface, it appears to be a story about a likable little girl who learns a lesson about appreciating what you have in life. This story is told by introducing a villain -- the Beldam -- who attempts to exploit Coraline's boredom with her family by trying to tempt her into trapping herself in an alternate world. Coraline, in true hero fashion, resists the Beldam's temptations, and all is well with the world.<br/><br/>However, below this lies a third level, borne out in certain details. Who is the Beldam? Where did she come from? She's not quite like the villains in other fantasy worlds, like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland or the Witch in Wizard of Oz. The Beldam is quite aware of Coraline's ""real"" life outside of the fantasy one, and uses that knowledge to try and entrap her. She is not a despotic ruler of some cuddly fantasy world; she's an evil sociopath operating in OUR world. That is creepy.<br/><br/>The paranormal overtones with the ""water witching"" and the ghosts help to suggest that the Beldam is an evil spirit who is attached to the house. There are countless stories by people who have nothing to gain by lying about having been terrorized by discarnate entities that know things about them.<br/><br/>Perhaps most creepy of all, though, is the omnipotence of the Beldam suggested by seeing her face in the real world's garden at the end. As if to suggest that Coraline has only done what she was expected to do. Again, what is the Beldam? Some personality so cunning that he/she is capable of completely controlling people without being held accountable for it.<br/><br/>Now THAT'S f*cking scary."
"AlejandraLopez","10","7","10","20 May 2009"," This movie literally BLEW ME AWAY.....
","I'm not sure where to start. I love Henry Selick's work. The first time I saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" it became one of my favourite films and still is.<br/><br/>Coraline was a film I simply couldn't wait to watch! (I am an extremely huge admire of stop-motion animation, I love it!) I was extremely eager to watch it and the more photos/info/trailers I saw, the more excited I was about it and the higher expectations I had... <br/><br/>The truth is, I entered the cinema with very high expectations. You know how sometimes this can ruin a movie?!? You expect it to be amazing and then it's a complete disappointment?!? This didn't happen with this film, in fact it was the complete opposite! I went in with high expectations and when I came out not only where those expectations fulfilled....They were beaten! It was better than what I even expected it to be! The film was simply mind blowing and I was literally watching the whole thing with my mouth wide open because I was too amazed by it...<br/><br/>The sets, the locations, the incredibly interesting and peculiar characters, the music... The voices all fitted perfectly... I couldn't have thought of a better voice than Teri Hatchers to play Coraline's mother...Everything just blended together perfectly. You can clearly see it's a Henry Selick film. I could see many references to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" but all at another scale, at another level... A bigger challenge, proving what an amazing artist Selick is. It's as if Coraline is the new ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" for a new generation.<br/><br/>The film did scare me. More than an ordinary live action film you may see nowadays. The ideal word to describe it is ""creepy"". It gives you the goosebumps. Some people say it shouldn't be a PG movie. I disagree. Kids like these things. When I was younger and watched ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" I was scared by it, I really was, but nevertheless I loved it and watched it over and over again... I think this is why children liked it and why they will love Coraline. They need those creepy moments to really give it that edge of credibility and interest. Children can associate and identify themselves's more with the story... It's not as appealing if everything is butterflies and flowers... It's a fairytale and fairy tales are dark by nature...It simply makes the magical more magical...It's beautiful...<br/><br/>I cannot recall how incredibly fantastic the animation is in this movie. I bow to all those patient animators who spend hundreds of hours of their time creating these amazing visuals. Every frame, every shot, every movement is perfect and given 100% dedication. It's truly breath taking.<br/><br/>Something that I rarely see in films these days is originality and this was one of the big reasons why Coraline blew me away. It managed to stay out of the ""predictable"" pattern and this is not easy, it's extremely hard to achieve... But Coraline did it... <br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Henry Selick for making such a wonderful creative piece of art. It will surely become a classic, I have no doubt and it shows how wonderful stop-motion animation is. It's movie's like these that really inspire you and remind you how magical and moving cinema can be.<br/><br/>ps. Watching it in 3D is a must..."
"scoutcraftpiratess","10","7","10","7 February 2009"," I know it's only the beginning of February, but this may already be one of the best movies of the year
","Here's the deal. I'm an elementary teacher. This is a movie based on a popular children's book. Of course I have to see it. I hope everyone appreciates that. So I dragged along a date to pick up some 3D glasses in a theatre full of bawling children... who quickly settled down once the story line got going.<br/><br/>This is quality that has not been seen since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". ""Coraline"" is an absolutely spell-binding story with a solid foundation in childhood innocence combined with the eerie and bizarre. I loved the book, and this for the most part stayed very true to the book--most differences were more of expansions of the story than glaring changes. Coraline and her family move into an apartment building full of strange characters. Coraline is sad and bored and her parents just don't seem to have time for her. The only other kid around is weird. So when she stumbles upon a passage way to an alternate and magical world controlled by her Other Mother, Coraline is understandibly thrilled. And then the horror begins...<br/><br/>The animation (or rather, stop-motion) is incredible, and I don't think the movie would have been the same with any other medium. I loved the cast. The soundtrack is properly creepy. This new 3D program is far from gimicky. But still, what truly makes this movie is the haunting story and that is probably what will hopefully make it memorable.<br/><br/>I don't know if I would be bringing the babies into this film, but I did read the novel to my first graders last year and they enjoyed it. Frankly, I would prefer to think of this as a family movie rather than a ""kiddie film"" as I consider the novel a children's novel. It's one of those stories that will appeal to all ages."
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","16","28","24 March 2009"," Curious, bizarre and dreamy
","When it comes to visuals, nobody does it quite like Henry Selick. In unimaginably original and absorbing fashion, Selick gives life to a written fairytale, just as he meticulously gave birth to the figures that inhabit the world of Coraline. More than any traditional fable of say, Hansel and Gretel, Coraline evokes more similarities to Guillermo Del Toro's, Pan's Labyrinth in its curiousness, bizarreness and dreamy essence. <br/><br/>Such material almost seems to discover Selick of its own accord and with his past visions, James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare before Christmas, his use of stop-motion technology and now 3-D, perfectly portrays the mood and atmosphere of the story on screen. Yet, there is such a thing about being too quirky and outwardly eccentric and it is this self-awareness and bizarre coldness that keeps Coraline from reaching the heights that it may have been destined to acquire. This is however a strong contender for this years Oscar ceremony and I truly hope Selick will finally be recognized for his accomplishments in the fields of animation, stop-motion and film-making and storytelling as a whole. <br/><br/>Peppered with well assigned and memorable voice-work, the stars anchor the film further yet into such a memorable fantasy. Staring as the scrappy youngster Coraline is Dakota Fanning, who proves she is a very capable voice actress. Moving with her writer parents to the somewhat eerie Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline feels isolated both from her mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) who are buried in their work while being separated from her friends back home. She entertains herself by visiting her odd neighbours, and avoiding the only other kid nearby, Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.). One night however, a small door in the wall of the creaky apartment seems to call to Coraline and a wonderful alternate world reveals itself. This land of fantasy is filled with kindness, gifts and love (even though its residents have buttons for eyes); the opposite of the world Coraline has grown to hate. But soon a sinister essence begins to show itself and the young heroine must choose between this new world and the one she wishes to leave behind.<br/><br/>Of the few problems that impede Coraline, one of the most detrimental is the somewhat solemn and depressing mood of the film which is sure to put off some children, even if not the accompanying adults. Coraline's parents are distant and somewhat cruel to their daughter as they bury themselves in work and neglect her desire to simply have fun. Even worse, is that there is no catharsis to this character flaw at the finale, and it left me somewhat emotionless. There is also the aforementioned issue with the sometimes hugely apparent, self-referent wackiness, although I won't hold that against Selick and his personal vision. Above all, Coraline differentiates itself from other stop- motion films and will hopefully anchor itself as this generations Nightmare. Parents and older children will be engrossed by the visuals and those older will be given plenty to admire, even love and those younger will be given a film they can love more with each passing year.<br/><br/>7.5 / 10.0<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

"ElMaruecan82","8","2","2","25 December 2019"," A ""Wizard of Oz""-like tale, tailor-made for the 2000s...
","Adapted from Neil Gaiman's book of the same name, Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" isn't a movie I would let my 6-year old daughter watch but it's only a matter of a few years as the film is certainly relevant for an audience over the age of 10. It is also entertaining, spectacular and dark and disturbing, a little less than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" but a little more than ""Pinocchio"".<br/><br/>This is a story about a pre-teen girl who feels (more than she is) neglected by her parents; not because they belong to the abusive sort but because they're all intensely absorbed by their personal project of making a garden catalogue and all their petty adult preoccupations regarding their new life in ""Rose Palace"", Oregon. The moral comfort of their daughter isn't the least of their concerns but surely any child would love to live near a forest with colorful and eccentric European artists as neighbors and in a house looking like the setting of a Scooby-Doo episode.<br/><br/>But Coraline isn't like any child... the titular heroine isn't a model of extraversion, nor is she your typical shy, insecure little girl who needs the presence of an imaginary friend to feel valuable or to make up for the lack of parental love. Coraline doesn't try to be pleasant, she's a self-centered, strong-willed girl who doesn't care about befriending the well-meaning house owner's grandson ""Wybie"" just because he's the only child around. In all this unpleasantness, it comes down to her most infantile trait being the most universal one: curiosity. Coraline is intrigued and fascinated by mysterious traps and doors, including one that opens on a bricked wall.<br/><br/>It is a well-known trope of many fantasy stories, the portal that leads to a different world materializing as a tornado in ""The Wizard of Oz"", a rabbit hole in ""Alice in Wonderland"" or a wardrobe in ""Chronicles of Narnia""... like Alice, Dorothy or Wendy Darling, there's a predisposition in Coraline to envision a better world lying somewhere. And so we understand the stylistic choices of the opening sequence, all in depressing colors and autumnal mood to better highlight the contrast with the other world, like the sepia used for the Kansas part in ""Oz"". The film is told from Coraline's perspective and it's interesting how the atmosphere reflects her mood in a binary way, she enjoys the color and reject the boring grey, like a normal child would do.<br/><br/>The film has another similarity with ""Oz"", which is the presence of doubles for each character except for Coraline and a mysterious cat. It starts with an opening sequence involving the meticulous fabrication of a doll with hands that evoke needles and puncture. The making of a doll starts with the symbolic death of the first one emptied from her content, as if there was no possible form of life and pleasure without a necessary sacrifice to make. And with Bruno Coulais' haunting music, we suspect some creepy undertones behind the pleasantness of the doll that looks like Coraline.<br/><br/>And so many questions come to mind: does the hand belong to an omnipotent God-like figure? a villain? is the doll a friend? whatever purpose this opening sequence carries takes its full meaning once we know who possesses these needle-like hands. Of course, some would make the immediate connection with Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the film came from the director of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" whose idea originated from Burton. Henry Selick remains the unsung hero of an oeuvre that has so many Burton vibes his name was only known by movie lovers. But let's get back to ""Coraline"".<br/><br/>I guess there are two dimensions of appreciation : first it's a movie about a dream any child could have, better parents, living in a beautiful world full of fun and amusement. And the film follows the plotline of many tales like Pinocchio when children discover at their own expenses that for every dream, there's a price to pay. Discovering the other world through the portal, Coraline sees better versions of her parents, gentler, funnier, more dedicated to her wishes. The catch is that they are all doll-like figures with buttons instead of eyes, what starts as a cute little gimmick turns into a creepy and lifeless vision of ""forced"" beatitude.<br/><br/>So we get the other side of the coin, and the real coming-to-age aspect of the story is when the heroine understands that she better accepts her own people with their flaws than the so-called idealized vision, it's the usual ""there's no place like home"" with a subtitle for 2000's audience: ""beware what you wish for.<br/><br/>Coming of age is the reason why this movie works more for children, just watch the different travels Coraline makes: first she bumps into the ideal world where she sees better versions of her parents and her neighbors, it's accidental. Then it's deliberate, she wants to have fun and has the time of her life admiring the circus, the ballet and musical numbers that remind of Disney extravaganza. After that; she understands the price she has to pay for the ideal world, which means abandoning a precious capability : to see things for real... later, she has to get back to save her parents. In four travels Coraline grows up and learns more about life and herself and becomes altruistic and mature.<br/><br/>This a wonderful evolution of character in the same vein than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and all the classic tales I mentioned, one that teaches kids about the limits of imagination and idealization and where dolls are both attractive and creepy. Horror, fantasy, and fairy tale magnificently blend in Selick's film, a wonder of animation that proves how stop motion is such an underrated genre of animation, the same year than ""Mary and Max"", another movie about a child looking for a meaning to her daily life... until finding a meaning to life itself."

It has a moral and lesson to it, be careful what you wish for, because it might not be what you expect it to be and be a complete nightmare.

","The film begins with Coraline Jones the voice of Dakota Fanning, an adventurous city girl that relocates to a dreary old house in the country. The old country house is divided into three apartments occupied by intriguing neighbors that once were performers. In the mist of Coraline's boredom she stumbles upon a mysterious door at the bottom of her living room wall. The Theme of Coraline is an example of the phrase the grass is not always greener on the other side (envy or desire) and strength. Coraline believes that her parents are neglectful and inattentive to her needs, but her parents just moved and have pressing deadlines in order to get paid. Coraline will soon have to leave her alternate world in order to save her family and reunite with her parents. Coraline manages to find the key that unlocks an alternate world; in this world she is introduced to a loving ""Other Mother,"" an amusing ""Other Father,"" and a silent version of her new friend Wybie. All of the characters from the alternate world are also the voices in her reality; Mel Jones, Coraline's mother is the voice of Teri Hatcher; Charlie Jones, Coraline's father is the voice of John Hodgman; Wyborne ""Wybie"" Lovat is the voice of Robert Bailey Jr. Coraline soon realizes that the goal of the Other Mother is to keep her forever. Coraline's alternate world temporarily fulfills all of her wants, but she is unable to create a connection. Coraline will then learn that she would prefer her dreary boring life over never seeing her parents again, and acquiring buttons for eyes."
"bob the moo","Null","7","12","6 June 2009"," Dark and inventive film even if it is perhaps too scary for particularly young children who will not understand the context and only see images
","I had not heard of the book on which this film is based but the involvement of Selick was enough to convince me that it was worth a look even before the uniform spread of five star reviews of it starting appearing in the media. I wanted to see it even more when some of the same media outlets starting having ""complaints"" from parents who had taken their toddlers to an animated film safe in the knowledge that NOBODY had ever, ever made an animated film that wasn't aimed at toddlers. Well, actually it turns out that, as well as countless other films, this is not a film for very young children â€“ by which I mean children who are not yet old enough to be able to cope with a narrative and be able to take their heads into a story, there is not a specific age on that, which is why generally one expects parents to do the job of weighing that up on behalf of the humans they created.<br/><br/>As I'm not a parent I'll not pretend to be able to advise others but I certainly know that the film will scare kids because it is dark enough to make me enjoy it on that level as an adult. This is not to say that it is not a family film though because outside of those being overly protective, this is the modern equivalent of a Gothic fairytale or a ghost story around a campfire â€“ something that will chill and grip a child with a fear but not to the point where reason or hope goes out the window. As such it is a great film because the story is strong at the core with an engaging scenario that reminds me of the ""ideal"" world of David Lynch, where the darkness is only just below the surface. So it is for Coraline where the supposedly perfect family behind the door turns out to be much more sinister. Throughout the telling the delivery makes it fun and engaging â€“ with a patient pace that isn't ever slow but never seems to be rushing things. The ""message"" isn't rammed down our throats but is there for children old enough to think through what they are watching.<br/><br/>Although I didn't see it in 3D the film still manages to look great. Whether it is the warmth and softness of the perfect family home, the weird and wonderful creatures or the effects in the later reveals of the ""other"" mother. It all looks great with the animation being technically impressive but the imagination also being a big part of it. Some of the images will be too dark for younger children but, aside from providing age-appropriate scares for older children, it is well pitched. The voice work helps things without being particularly distracting in the way that some of the ""who is that"" voice work in other animated films can be. Fanning seems to have gotten past her precocious-sounding stage and does a solid turn in the title character. Hatcher is better though, capturing sweetness while being sinister and easily being evil later. Saunders, French, Hodgman, David and McShane all do good turns but again do so without being themselves, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Coraline is not for everyone and should certainly not be seen as being for all ages simply because it is animated. It is an engagingly dark fantasy with content and imagery that provides an effective Gothic fairy tale for those older children able to process it beyond what they see. Of course it is another sign of quality that, in the absence of any child of any age, adults can still easily enjoy it."

"Turfseer","5","19","43","16 February 2009"," Storyline fails to fulfill its potential despite excellent animation
","Coraline is a film that employs computer enhanced stop action animation. So visually it's sort of a combination of the old and the new. What's more, some theaters show it in 3-D and it was neat wearing the special glasses and occasionally being startled as images seem to be jumping out right off from the screen itself.<br/><br/>Coraline, a young girl, who seems to be around eight or nine years old, has just moved into an old house with her parents, who can best be described as workaholics. While Coraline doesn't really dislike her parents, she feels a bit disconnected from them. The old house they've moved into is connected to a few other old houses which are occupied by some older neighbors who are flaming eccentrics (there's Mr. Bobinsky, a retired circus master and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, elderly and rather plump opera buffs). Also in the mix is a local kid, Wybie, who Coraline finds exceptionally annoying (mainly because he talks too much).<br/><br/>Coraline is very similar to Alice in Wonderland since there is a secret portal in the house which leads to a different worldÂ—an alternate universe. Coraline follows a mouse through the portal and discovers her ""other"" mother and father. They look exactly the same except they have buttons for eyes. At first, Coraline is seduced by everything the new parents have to offer. She's treated to sumptuous meals and given a tour of a garden outside the house which is full of fantastic creatures which Coraline finds enchanting.<br/><br/>The Coraline story loses quite a bit of energy and focus in the first hour when she enters the secret world and then goes back to her ordinary world more than once. Contrast that with a story such as the Wizard of OzÂ—when Dorothy enters the fantasy world of Oz , she remains there until the climax of the film. By remaining in the new extraordinary world, the protagonist now has the opportunity to be tested and go up against an evil opposing force. From the beginning of Oz, there is an arc of increasing tension which culminates in the final confrontation with the all powerful Wizard.<br/><br/>In contrast, the tension in Coraline doesn't really become palpable until the second half of the film. That's when the 'other' parents suddenly become malevolent and attempt to imprison Coraline in their world for the rest of eternity. Where Dorothy has three charming sidekicks (The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion) to aid her in her battle against the wicked witch, the 'other mother' in Coraline has taken Wybie's power of speech away from himÂ—which deprives Coraline from having a sidekick to battle the forces of evil in the other world (instead, a talking cat is substituted but we feel no emotional connection to that character). I would have liked the real Wybie to have somehow made his way through the portal and helped Coraline in her quest to escape or defeat the other mother.<br/><br/>There also didn't seem to be enough of a contrast between the eccentric neighbors in the real world and the fantasy world. Mr. Bobinsky seemed to be contorting himself all over the place BEFORE Coraline finds him leading his group of dancing mice in the alternate universe. The same goes for Miss Sprink and Miss Forcible who seem equally weird in both worlds.<br/><br/>In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's alienation from her family occurs after Auntie Em is unable to prevent Miss Gulch from taking Toto away from her. In contrast, the alienation between Coraline and her parents is only vaguely defined (somehow, the parents' preoccupation with their own work doesn't seem to be a strong enough reason for Coraline to be alienated from them). Somehow, there needed to be a much more compelling reason for Coraline to initially consider accepting her 'other' parents'. In other words, the stakes simply aren't high enough.<br/><br/>In the end, Coraline suffers from a lack of originality. It's a story that we've seen too many times before without enough new twists. Furthermore, the characters (including Coraline) aren't CONSISTENTLY charming enough to engage us emotionally. Coraline has some great special effects and art design and I would recommend seeing it on that basis alone. But unfortunately one must also focus on the story, which clearly has not fulfilled its potential."
"FilmFanatic03","7","3","4","7 June 2011"," An unusual, twisted animation for all to enjoy
","""Coraline"" is slightly different from, let's say, a Disney animation. However, this is not a criticism for the permission to go a little deeper and darker allows the filmmakers to present the audience with a unique animation with a great adventure. Of course, I would not advise young children to watch this for it is pretty dark for them and some scenes may be a bit too much for them but for older children, teens and adults, they will be able to handle what ""Coraline"" has to offer. The titular character goes on a journey to appreciate her family and the real world. A lot of great, amusing characters and a great adventure.

"ForeverAndADay001","7","4","6","12 February 2009"," Visually Stunning, this film is definitely meant for the 3D screen
","I went into Coraline hoping for an enjoyable film, but not particularly expecting a masterpiece. I'm a Neil Gaimon fan, but in my opinion the majority of his talent isn't in producing something amazing, but in not producing stuff that's bad. Previous films I've seen based on his books have been charming, creative and fun, but nothing has really been breathtaking.<br/><br/>That being said, Coraline is more of the same. Which isn't to say I don't fully recommend it.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely pleasurable to the eyes and ears, particularly in 3D. It's soundtrack is surprisingly lovely and dreamlike and the animation is gorgeous. Like most things written by Neil Gaimon it's very imaginative and charming, as well as bizarre and creepy at times.<br/><br/>However, like most things based on stories by Neil Gaimon it does seem to have a slightly weak story. Although the visuals flow beautifully the story doesn't. It starts off fine, if not a bit predictably, but seems to almost get lost a bit as it goes along. It's also a bit anticlimactic.<br/><br/>I still think it's one of the better animated films I've seen in theaters as of late and it is magnificent in 3D. I'll probably go see it again. And I DO recommend it."

","""Coraline"" has an appealing dark sensibility, and avoids the formulaic nature of so many popular films. But there's no point in being dark if you can't also be interesting, and even unpredictable films must make some sense in order to be satisfying.<br/><br/>I haven't been this disappointed in a film in decades. It provided no dramatic momentum for ages; and even after the plot got going, none of the characters was likable enough to invest in. The three characters in peril are never really explained.The 3-D technology was wasted.<br/><br/>The film carefully sets up a parallel universe, but then fails to make sense of the parallels, in that the parents are equally weighted in one world but wildly out of balance in the other, with no real reasoning for the discrepancy.<br/><br/>Other reviewers praise this as a movie for ""kids who think,"" but it's more likely to be tolerated by the kind of kids who will stare at anything that passes before them. The ones who pay attention will be alternately bored, confused and creeped out. Others also praise the movie for being so ""visual,"" not noting how clumsy and redundant it is at delivering information visually and then again aurally -- the equivalent, for instance, of showing the handwritten note and then having a character read it out loud. A step backward for animated film.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the voice work of Teri Hatcher, whose acting I have never had cause to notice before, and Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French did their best to drag in some entertainment, though their characters' voices could hardly match the less-enjoyable grotesque images.<br/><br/>I have nothing against Neil Gaiman; I am a huge fan of ""Stardust."" But I can't understand why so many people on IMDb are using phrases like ""the best movie known to mankind."" A little bit of goth style is enough to dazzle some people, I guess."

","I believe that the lucid imagination puts their own markers in the public conceptual landscape. <br/><br/>Regular readers know that many of these for me are films that anchor personal structure. But I have some books that do this as well, and probably at a more fundamental level. One of these is ""Alice in Wonderland"" and it is a minor game to recognize that work in contemporary copies.<br/><br/>This film is blatantly patterned after Alice. The two worlds, the vaginal transition. Mirrors, small doors. Animated flowers. Wicked queen. There's the business of returning to the origin by walking away and even the cat that advises. All of those bits are here, plus a dash of ""Pinocchio."" But there is another influence that may not be so obvious to you.<br/><br/>I encountered a very special piece of stop-motion work a couple years ago: ""Blood Tea and Red String"" which is also derived from Alice, has this surrogate ragdoll notion and also supports a storyline of capture for love. The stylistic elements in this later project clearly were influenced by that film which I gave my highest rating. So in watching this, I touched two of my most important markers, plus having the folded notion of one world similar to the other, but more magical except for artificial eyes. Its an example of Ted's law, one which may help to extend or better understand it.<br/><br/>The dimensionality of the thing â€” advertised heavily in my area â€” was trivial, uninteresting.

"Jacques98","3","22","58","7 February 2009"," Hansel and Gretel without Hansel. And without imagination.
","* Just to get this out of the way: I did not view this in 3D, thus cannot comment on that aspect.<br/><br/>When you go and see a PG-rated animate film, what do you expect? A few laughs, a fun main character, something to keep your kid's attention, a creative story, and, possibly, that nostalgic feeling of childish wonder. Fantasy writers seem to think they understand this wonder-filled feeling more than anyone else, and thus I've yet to see a single fantasy writer who didn't pump out a generic coming-of-age, horror-teamed, Disney Land-inspired children's book at least once before the end of their career. Neal Gaiman, the writer of the original Coraline children's book, is no exception. He's also no exception to the unwritten rule among such generic fantasy writers that this children's book that I just described has be as unoriginal and predicable as humanly possible, otherwise it's too much for the children reading it to comprehend. Or, more likely, they just lack a single creative idea within their heads. I've read a lot of Gaiman books before, and this lack of imagination seems to be something that is contentious among all his works. Simply put, I could write up a page-long list of other authors that pre-date Gaiman and write the exact same stories he does, and they all think they're oh-so-original. I can also come up with a page-long list of movies that pre-date Coraline, but tell the exact same story. Is it so much to ask for a little creativity these days? <br/><br/>The setting for Coraline, the film, is completely generic for modern fairy tales like this. A big house. Coraline, the character, is also completely generic. An adventurous little girl with a slight punk edge. The secondary character, again, are all generic. Weird little boy, cat, unloving parents, fortunetelling old ladies, acrobatic old man. So, from the set-up alone, it's impossible to ignore how clichÃ© and imaginationless Coraline, the film, really is. You've seen this a thousand times. You saw it with Alice in Wonderland, you saw it with Narnia, you saw it with The Corpse Bride . . . and if I had to, I could list at least thirty more. This is completely, wholesale unoriginal material, and that's apparent from the first five minutes.<br/><br/>The story is even more generic. It's Hansel and Gretel, minus Hansel. The generic main character finds a wonderful place filled with everything she lacked at home, and then things go wrong. Oh my! Who would have guessed?! I realize I'm criticizing this movie from the point-of-view of the bitter old man that I am at heart, but even my little sister, who I took to see this, admitted Coraline was completely predictable and forgettable. It's exactly what you expect. If fantasy writers understand children as well as they think they do, then why don't they give them a little more credit that they know what stories are repeated to the point of nausea? Seriously. In my theater alone, I heard countless little kids telling their parents how bored they were. At least half the families there left the theater before the last thirty minutes. If you want horror-themed animated movies that aren't just rehashes of the same predictable plot, I suggest A Nightmare Before Christmas (obviously) and Monster House (severely underrated).<br/><br/>Another problem with the boring factor. The movie repeats itself constantly, and you'll see the same exact scenes play out at least three times each by the closing credits. It drags on and on.<br/><br/>Coraline does have some entertainment value, and I will give it that much credit. The first thirty minutes were very well-done, if not severely predictable, like the rest of the film. The animation is well-done, if not average for the bar set by Tim Burton animated movies. The animation does have a slight unique rag-doll quality that was pretty cute for the first ten minutes. Some of the sub-plots are very interesting to watch. But none of this makes this memorable. It will pass time without too much problem, but it's nothing you're going to remember the rest of your life, because, as I said, the story is so unoriginal.<br/><br/>I realize this review is going to be unpopular, and, quite honestly, I don't care. I have standards, and I'm not going to lower them just because this is a children's film. I've seen countless children's films with originality and real imagination, but Coraline just doesn't have any. It's generic coming-of-age horror with a generic character and a generic moral that you've heard in fairy tales before you were old enough to talk. So, really, what's the big deal? What is everyone raving about? Even if you were to only focus on the positive, it's hard to ignore that hollow feeling in your gut. The one that comes when you realize the movie you think you enjoy is just another generic rehash. That certainly isn't the magical feeling you're supposed to get when you watch children's movies, now is it? <br/><br/>3/10"

","I am a big fan of animation, but the love for this movie has me scratching my head. I'm sure the families who fled mid-movie, and the crying children in the audience might agree. I haven't read the Neil Gaiman graphic novel that the movie is based upon, but the story is another Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland wannabe, replete with a curious young girl and the eccentric characters she encounters in an alternate world. CORALINE, however, lacks the wit and social observations of its predecessor, and more strikingly lacks the humor and heart of most any Disney/Pixar animation feature.<br/><br/>First of all, when are parents going to learn to heed the movie rating system? This is definitely not a movie for young children. There are ghosts of dead children, for one thing. Another scene - a burlesque with two old women - is very graphic in showing one woman's HUGE knockers covered by the tiniest of stripper's pasties. It makes Little Annie Fannie from Playboy look flat-chested. One family left right after this scene.<br/><br/>For an adult like myself, despite all its wonderful visuals, it still seemed plodding and overlong. Halfway through I raised my 3-D glasses to rub my eyes, wondering when it was all going to end, and I made an important discovery. In 3-D, the movie loses its color and intensity, due to the dark glasses. The difference is like the night switch on your rearview mirror. If I had any desire to see this movie again, I'm sure I'd prefer the 2-D version with its brilliant colors over the dull 3-D version."

All of the characters are annoying, absolutely no one you could cheer for in the bunch.<br/><br/>Then, it becomes the most horrifying film I've seen since the Excorsist. I mean truly disturbing, a couple of weeks ago I saw My Bloody Valentine in 3D. I think a small kid, 10 or 11 years old, has a better chance of watching that one and not have night mares. I honestly may have nightmares after watching this thing. Which is why I give it a 5, if the last third had been like the first two thirds I'd be giving it a 2, and 1.5 of that would be for the 3D.<br/><br/>The only film to come close to being as disturbing as this one in the past 30 years is Hostle, but believe me, this one is worse.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, boring as hell, cool 3D, deeply disturbing."

Well, Coraline has none of that.<br/><br/>All of the main characters were uninteresting soul-less unsympathetic cutouts. The even managed to make the talking cat an unlikeable bore. The story has zero suspense or surprises, you pretty much know what is going to happen ten minutes into this thing.

Because of the depth of the action sequences and the rich textures in the animation, it's too much for some younger viewers to handle.<br/><br/>Second, what in the world is up with the big-breasted naked woman??? That was traumatic, even to me! I can't believe this got a PG rating, knowing that young children were going to be drawn to it.

It has minute-long shots of dancing mice and dancing flowers, a really lame song of the other father and invents even a whole new character which is simply dull and unnecessary.

","Not for small children or the faint of heart - but if you can handle the creepy OogieBoogieMan in Nightmare Before Christmas you can handle the extremes of Coraline (although I could do without the girl squishing bugs with her bare hand!!!)

I can only image how much more 3-D adds to it (we deliberately skipped a 3-D showing as I HATE wearing 3-D glasses over my own specs. I could hardly see the 3-D effects when my girls dragged me to Hannah Montana earlier this year.) If you have normal vision or wear contacts try to see this in 3-D if you can.

","I thought that Coraline would be one of those stupid animated movies that comes out once in awhile. It took me some time to get myself to be able to see it. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful, imaginative story behind the director of Nightmare Before Christmas. This movie has a very dark tone, definitely Anti-Wall E.<br/><br/>The story is about a girl named Coraline. She just moved with her family and is bored with her life. After exploring the house she discovers a portal that enables her to be with the ""Other"" Mother. But is this mother any good? The movie is full of visual effects. That's the most stunning part about this movie. There is one thing I have to criticize. This movie should be rated PG-13. Coraline is way too scary for little kids. But, I'm glad I saw this. I rate this film 9/10."

","I was very pleased to see this movie, because it has the same visual effect as many master-pieces of Tim Burton. And I was not disappointed about that segment of movie. Also, the music fits perfectly and gives the right sense of atmosphere during the whole movie.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, in the end, we got just one-way-message... to the kids. It made me wonder something about most modern parents and how they treat their children. It is obvious that they have to work to provide good life for their kids. So, it means, there is no specific ""punishment"" or valuable lessons for them because they simply have to do their jobs. I think that's very important for all parents to spend time with their children even when they have to work. But, in this movie, we have the opposite situation. The kid will learn the valuable lesson, but not the parents. They will survive the same situation as the kid, but in the end, they won't be even aware of anything they passed through, I think that screenwriter could find much more realistic solution both-for the kid and the parents.<br/><br/>After all... could have been better-7"

","I finally saw Coraline on the big screen today, and it was an absolute feast for the eyes. That Real Digital 3D is very impressive. Yes it's a gimmick, but it works so very well. I can see why so many animated movies are using this technology this year. The images have so much depth, and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Anyways onto the film.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones is an adventurous girl with a huge imagination. When her family moves to a new house in a new town, Coraline is bored out of her mind. Her parents don't pay a lot of attention to her, so when she finds a strange door, her curiosity peaks. It leads to an ""other"" world which includes her mother and her father. However, they're very different. They have buttons for eyes and they seem a lot more interested in her. She refers to them as her other mother and her other father. She sees this world as a dream come true, but it really is one of the most terrifying worlds around.<br/><br/>The voice work is all very good, Terri Hatcher does a wonderful job playing Coraline's mothers. I also really liked the team of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, who played the very funny Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two stage performers. Their play was particularly memorable. Henry Selick's direction is very, very good. A lot of the scenes reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas. A lot of the shadows, and even some of the animation had a very Nightmare Before Christmas-esquire vibe. I'm glad he got out of Tim Burton's shadow.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"neil-476","7","2","3","14 May 2009"," Technically good, missing some heart
","Coraline 3D - I was expecting to like this a good deal more than I did. Which is not to say I didn't like it - that wouldn't be true - but my enthusiasm was noticeably more muted than anticipated, and I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>I like the source material - Neil Gaiman's story strikes me as Alice Through The Looking Glass only with spiders crawling all over it - and the movie adaptation remained suitably creepy. The look of the film is great, and the standard of animation is phenomenal. The voice cast is exemplary, so what went wrong for me? I think maybe it has something to do with the fact that I found the film self-consciously clever at times. The old ladies/trapeze sequence, and the flamboyant garden sequences (for instance) felt to me like the film-makers were showing off, and were almost irrelevances to the story. For that reason the movie never really engaged me - I should have been on the edge of my seat rooting for Coraline, but I almost didn't care what happened to her.<br/><br/>Even the 3D wasn't as effective as I had hoped - there were a few moments where I was impressed (oddly, these were moments like wide shots of a relatively flat and boring kitchen shot, but with incredible depth visible out of the windows) but much of the 3D had little impact.<br/><br/>This story would possibly have been better served by a live-action movie. For now, probably best to stick to P Craig Russell's comic adaption."

","Coraline is such a fun little flick. I guess you could call the film a Grimm's fairy tale of sorts for children, and it also serves as a good cautionary tale about being careful for what you wish for. The stop motion animation gives it a very otherworldly feeling. The movie is also very unsettling and this is coming from an adult. Show this film to a spoiled child and he'll walk the straight and narrow I assure you. On the plus side, the film has got a stellar cast. Teri Hatcher is great in duel roles as both Mel Jones and the Other Mother. Dakota Fanning also does solid work as the titular character Coraline. Lastly, you have the always reliable Keith David as the voice of The Cat and he's always a MVP. The Cat serves as Coraline's guide to the other world. Definitely check this flick out if you love stop motion animation. I do have one caveat though, I wouldn't show this film to any child under the age of 10. Unless of course you want to scare them straight."

","From the magic that perfect stop motion effects bring the audience, to the fusion created by the reality projected by a typical little girl, who lives with the illusion of a fantasy world that completely envelopes you, CORALINE stands, thusly, as a TRUE classic animated movie creation. Perhaps the first time you watch this movie, you might perceive a basic story about a girl whose parents don't really pay her enough attention. But after a series of events she learns the value of the family she has. After having the opportunity to watch this movie more than once or twice, you enter a universe with infinite possibilities for understanding the development of the story. So, every time you watch CORALINE, you are going to find out new things about the comportment of the characters, and some scenes that may seem ""irrelevant"", but take on the importance they deserve upon deeper analysis. You can create different hypotheses about the story threads, and maybe the ending just isn't what you imagined. You can compare this movie to any quotidian situation and that will help you realize that we each have a lot in life, yet we are blind to so many of the simple things. CORALINE provides us the opportunity to experience a new ideal life that we could look forward to, but that we just maintain as an imaginary ideal world in our mind. CORALINE has more cryptic story threads than you might notice in a first viewing. Your perception of the characters will probably change...Perhaps they aren't who they seem at first glance! There is really a lot more for You to encounter in this story ...and I invite You to have so much FUN discovering it all for yourself!"
"edgepros123","10","1","1","25 September 2018"," A Masterpiece
","Almost 10 years on now, I fully recognise Coraline as one of the defining points in my life. Coraline is a film loved by critics and hated by parents. It's use of creepy imagery, it's groundbreaking animation and simple yet powerful plot trap you into its horrifying web of a message.<br/><br/>I don't feel I need to explain the story, IMDB can do that for me, all I will say though is that the film is a phenomenal moral tale about parenting. In a similar way to the way Spirited Away goes about its fantastic analogy, Coraline uses simple ideas for great effect.<br/><br/>And of course, parents hate it. Why? It might be down to the fact that the film includes some horrifyingly tense and scary moments that, as a kid, frightened me. I was nine when I watched this film (yes guys, that does mean I'm only 18 now) but the effect of this film grew on me by each day I thought about it and to this day it still gets better.<br/><br/>In the same way The Twilight Zone encapsulated kids of the 60s and Doctor Who had our parents hiding behind sofas, Coraline is an extremely important story psychologically for children and is thrilling to watch. The moments of my childhood I remember with film feature things like the melting faces moment in Raiders of the Lost Arc, the Rabbit Massacre in Watership Down and of course, Coraline escaping from her Spider Mother.<br/><br/>It's the buttons, it's the tapping of the needle legs, it's the screaming children who've lost their eyes, the rats made of sand and the stitched mouth of Wyborn (can't remember spelling) as the mother makes him smile.<br/><br/>Every element of this film is designed to scare, thrill, entertain and push the boundaries of what is acceptable. The parents are wrong. Coraline teaches an important lesson about fear, that we need it and need to learn about it.<br/><br/>If you're a parent and you're wondering if you should show this to your kids, do it. It's one of the moments in film that affected my childhood and turned me into who I am today. For a film to affect me this much after ten years is incredible and I wonder what I'd be like if I hadn't seen it. Maybe I would not like horror movies? Maybe I wouldn't like movies in general? This film taught me what film can do, it's power to make people feel. I remember my sisters reaction (she was only 7 so maybe she was too young). She cried that night and wouldn't go to sleep. However all these years later, she considers the film to be as good as I do. For a film to make someone stay up all night in fear and tears and still make the viewer fall in love with it is astounding. And I still enjoy it as much as an adult now as I did when I was a kid.<br/><br/>This film is a masterpiece."
"davispittman","7","1","1","2 March 2018"," Interesting, unique film
","Coraline is not your average animated film. It is far darker than any animated film I've seen, definitely not for younger children. This film focuses on a pre-teen girl who has just recently moved to a new place with her parents. She discovers a new world where she has everything she could ever want. Wonderful nice parents, great food, beautiful surroundings.... She starts to visit this place regularly, through the little door in the house, and before too long, she begins to realize that this new place might not be so great after all. This place turns out to be a dark place full of trouble. I liked Dakota Fanning as the voice of Coraline, and I also liked Teri Hatcher as the voice of the mother. The animation is done well. The writing is fine, it's not great to be honest, but it's certainly not bad. It's just that I was expecting more than what I got. The plot was interesting, but I do think that the film had more potential. Overall, I suggest Coraline mildly, it's not the best but it's still pretty good."
"herzigmary","Null","1","1","20 February 2018"," Coraline (2009) One of Laika's best.
","Coraline is a stop-motion film done by the famous Laika studios, that aside from Box Trolls creates wonderful films with intriguing stories and amazing stop-motion effects. It is also directed by Henry Selick, the director if the Nightmare Before Christmas and is based on the book by the master of creepy and weird Neil Gaiman. 
Coraline is about a bratty girl who is being ignored by her work-a-holick parents and hates the new house they moved to; especially the boring and strange neighbors. However, Coraline then finds that there is a magical world behind a small door where a woman, who looks like her mother with button eyes, gives her everything she could ever want and more. As things go along, everything starts to take a turn for the worst as she discovers that the 'other mother' is not what she seems. 
The film has a very tightly woven story with no too fast or too slow moments, and of course is beautiful to look at. The characters are fun and well voiced, and of course the music, composed by Bruno Coulais, is atmospheric and phenomenal.

It's beautifully animated, well written, with unique characters and a very interesting plot. Unfortunately, it lacks in terms of action and to my disappointment, it features a highly anticipated and predictable finale which sorts everything out almost out of nowhere and at a blink of an eye.

"vrg-69972","7","1","1","13 December 2017"," Full Movie Review
","Coraline is a film about a girl who is out of place. She does not have any friends, all of her family and neighbors are dysfunctional, she has just moved into her new house, and she does not know what to do. With this as the basic plot, the movie could progress in any number of different directions, but it chooses the one of self-reflection, and does so by exposing the viewer to relationships in duality. Each separate relationship exposes a different flaw in what Coraline desires, and in doing so allows the viewer to reflect upon themselves. This subtle yet wholly enveloping theme of ideals paired with the quirky visual style creates an environment that feels tactile, odd, almost realistic, and yet fully and completely fiction. By utilizing interpersonal issues and the ideals created by them, Coraline simultaneously draws in an audience of those who relate to the protagonist, and allows them actualization and acceptance in their own interpersonal issues. 
In some music, there is a term called a ""hook"" which refers to a section of the song that draws in the listener. The point of it is; if they enjoy the hook, why not give the song a listen (as it generally just builds off of the notes in the hook itself)? The hook for Coraline would be the traditionally styled credits at the beginning of the movie. The credits themselves are not the focus here, even though that is the purpose of the section, rather, the animation is. The style itself is consistent in its creepiness, and will maintain this for the remainder of the film, yet exact and almost mesmerizing in its detail and realism. The thread moving seamlessly (pun intended) through the air as though it were an actual thread, ready to be tightly sewn into whatever needed sewing, the constant usage of sprawling, repeating patterns, and most significantly, the lofty and elegant movement of the horrifying fingers extending from the metal hand of the other mother. The way that this visual is presented-somewhat terrifying, yet beautiful and intricate-provides a perfect platform for the audience of somewhat disenfranchised teens, those who do not quite fit in, but are not outcasts either. In placing the credits at the beginning of the movie, the film is automatically set at a calmer and less cluttered place, where a quiet animation with some eerie yet pleasant instrumental music playing in the background sets the stage for a quaint home with a strange family and an inquisitive girl.
Now, the bulk of this film does not highlight any astounding animating per say. There are some good bits, but that is not the focus. The focus here is, in one word, juxtaposition. It happens everywhere to everything and everyone. From the moment the movie begins you grasp that there will be another side to this story. Initially, there is a large highlight on dysfunctionality. Coraline lives with parents that care too little for their child as they are too focused on their work, who write a gardening catalog and do not even garden, and who live in a pink house on the top of the hill with two sets of old acting neighbors. Upstairs, there is Bobinsky, a man of comical nature who tries and fails to train mice in a circus. Bobinsky is a very old, wily, Russian acrobat. The bulk of his weight rests in his torso, and there is next to none in his arms and legs, giving him quite strange proportions. Bobinsky appears grimy, overly physically capable, blue, and slovenly. Now, spoiler alert, but there is another world that can be accessed through a door in Coraline's living room. This door leads to a world where her parents do as she asks and act perfectly nice, where all ideals and aspirations are met and go above and beyond the expectations. In this world, Bobinsky looks very fit, does not dress or act slovenly, has a circus of perfectly trained mice, and where he himself seems to look more natural. But, as it is later revealed, nobody in this world is actually real and they all are flawed to the utmost point. By juxtaposing the initial problems of Bobinsky and the other characters, then progressing to a point of ideals, then revealing those ideals were achieved through abhorrent means, and then shifting back to the initial problems, there is sort of a parabola where the viewer is able to see the full scope and realizes the initial flaws are not bad and can actually are quite good. 
Now, the concepts of a world slightly flawed and an ideal world might seem a little abstract, but there is a sort of connection between the two, one that points out the differences and similarities between--not obviously, but to just the extent that you are able to see what the author is getting at. This connection between is the cat. By utilising the deliberate lack of definite answers via exposition, Gaiman is able to insert a character that provides as a plot device and also as a companion. The cat serves as a partner, who follows Coraline through both her world and the other world. He is the only other character in the movie that can do this, and that makes him Coraline's accomplice. The cat provides answers to questions Coraline (and the reader) might have, which allows the movie itself to have a more coherent grounding. But, due to the inherent style of the movie, the cat simply cannot act as a mere tool of exposition, as it would break the immersion of the mystery, of the abstractions of the occurrences of the other world. Because of this, the cat is the perfect companion to have: cats aren't terribly helpful or kind like a dog might be, and they have a selfish nature about them. These two characteristics work very well with the plot of Coraline, as they provide good concrete reasons as to why Coraline's sole partner does not have the answers, and keep the feel of the strange and wondrous mystery, without keeping their audience in the dark. 
As far as the plotline for Coraline goes, it is one of cliche and predictability. Coraline, like many other mysterious adventure movies, has a gateway between worlds represented through a common household object. This enables the story to surprise and entertain audiences while keeping it relatable on the other side. It also relies heavily on character traits that are unoriginal and not necessarily mesmerizing, causing a weird paradigm between the two worlds. The story itself follows a tried and tested formula of showing one world, showing the other, and relying on said paradigm to show the benefits of the former. It's not something special or commendable, but that is not saying that it is a poorly laid plot. Yes, all the details ands actions reek of cliches and predictable twists, but those are only cliches because of their ability to convey a story. All in all, the plot is decent, just don't think into it expecting too much deeper meaning.
Through the combination of these stylistic and character choices, the author is able to create a film that allows for the youth watching it to go through the same mental process Coraline does. By going through this process, the audience is not changed in their environment they were at the beginning when they are at the end. The change in between the two has a profound and lasting effect on the audience's perception of themselves that will allow them to be more accepting of their own quirks and issues, just as the characters in the film were."
"foster-35506","8","1","1","9 December 2017"," Frame by Frame, World to World. Coraline is another chapter of the childhood dark fantasies which have been brought to life by Henry Selick.
","Coraline is a 2009 stop-motion animation film that is written and directed by Henry Selick. Selick's name may sound familiar because his other more famous works include The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and James and the Giant Peach (1996). With Coraline you get another great package deal by Selick, the main cast compromised of Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Coraline's mother being voiced by Teri Hatcher and father by John Hodgman and even some great supporting work by Ian McShane who voices a washed up but still eccentric and energized carnival entertainer who parades around some performing mice. Coraline herself is an outdoor, hands-on type of girl who just wants to embrace the new environment that her family has moved her to, however with the chores of settling in and finishing up on other laborious writing projects, the parents are not so envious of Coraline's desires and time.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is to ""focus on style or texture"" (Petrie, Boggs, 2012, p. 20), as previously mentioned, Selick's other works point out his unique talents in creating dark, fantasy worlds that are just passable and manageable for the older kid groups. Telling a story similar to James and the Giant Peach you find yourself following a younger person who doesn't exactly like their current situations and seek out a little more, only to find themselves on a dangerous adventure filled with unimaginable beings or creatures. The artistry in Coraline is always present with large miniature sets on display and various camera work to mimic a live action film. Nearly every time Coraline leaves the house to go outside we are treated with the ""the zoom lens"" (Petrie, Boggs, 2012, p. 117) showing us just how magnificent the scale of the set and detailed modeling used. The choice of colors should be noted to in Coraline as they generally are gloomy and contain shades of off blue and purple, making us all feel uneasy as to what is happening or can occur throughout the experience.<br/><br/>As you dig further into the story and this unnatural but seemingly better world, you learn along with Coraline that not everything is as it seems. Unraveling the disguises and illusions, you become fully sensitive to the style of film this is and appreciate the stop-motion effects. From bizarre transformations to impossible realities, the movie proves Selick to be right in how he can compete with a lighter storytelling method used by companies such as Disney and Pixar. So much so that the award-winning 2016 movie Kubo and the Two Strings takes direct influence from Selick's work, giving us all a Tim Burton Beetlejuice feeling that there is something to be made in the stop-motion fantasy worlds.<br/><br/>A common item to decipher the normal world to the other world in our story of Coraline would be the replacement of the eyes with simple buttons, a ""motif"" if you will. (Petrie, Boggs, 2012, p. 27). These buttons symbolize a dark meaning of course as to lose one's sight would mean you cannot see and naturally would become lost over time in a place that you may have believed better than the world where you could see. The dark fantasy style that Selick has become known for is after all what this film embodies and is held to, a high recommendation for those who dare to explore."

Not true.<br/><br/>Well, yeah, I didn't see it in 3D to completely verify that claim, but I do know if the only reason a movie is good or a must-see is because of a technical aspect or in some cases, a gimmick, then the movie's got problems. This movie might have been even more fun with the visuals popping out, but dang it, I had a complete blast watching it without the additional dimension.<br/><br/>Coraline was a marvel at storytelling, visuals, heart and adventure. The art of making these stop-motion films should be an Academy Award on its own for the countless hours, energy and passion the geniuses devoted. I love these kinds of movies 100x more than any CGI cartoon. But, you still need to have a story.<br/><br/>Wow, Coraline has the worst of all parents and that sets up for the fantasy of the little girl travelling to Wonderland to meet the duplicated, albeit polar-opposite family and surroundings of her real world. But, if it's too good to be trueÂ…<br/><br/>While many movie's premises slowly gets progressively worse, this movie does the opposite. I did like the movie up front, but as it moved forward, my eyes widened and my soul relished in each new inventive scene, great dialogue and wondrous adventure they had in store for us. <br/><br/>This came out in 2009 and as recently as 2016, they're still making them. I am stoked they are. These cannot be easy to make, they keep getting criminally passed up for best Animated Oscars and they usually don't have huge box office receipts. But, if you care about true art being made â€“ in all formats, true spirit in cinema and some of the best and most realistic stories in some of the best and most fantastical realms, you need to check out these Laika beauties. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: That's two for two for me! What I playfully called my ""Surreal Saturday"" movie double feature turned out way better than I had thought. First off was the fantastic Pan's Labyrinth and I followed that with Coraline.

"Animated_Antic","9","1","1","24 October 2017"," Both a very creepy and very good film.
","Ever since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" came to theaters in 1993, stop motion has become one of the most common forms of animation in films right next to computer animation and traditional animation. Most of these kinds of the movies I've really enjoyed and ""Coraline"" is yet another. The film is a glorious return to stop motion animation for director Henry SelickÂ and has a very creepy characters, some fantastic animation and memorable characters that I can easily consider it a modern Halloween classic. Here's my explanation of why this film works.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) moves with her parents (Teri Hatcher andÂ John Hodgman)Â from Michigan to the run down Pink Palace Apartments (which is really a divided house)Â in Oregon. Â Because her parents focused on finishing their garden catalog and her neighbors being to strange to talk to, Coraline becomes very bored and decides to explore the house only to find a small door that is bricked up. That night she opens up the same door only find a corridor to the Other World, which is the same as her normal life with a catch. Everything seems nicer and better and the people in this world are known as the Others have buttons as eyes. Coraline becomes very attracted to the alternate world and starts to visit it commonly not realizing that she is going to fall in a dark and twisted trap.<br/><br/>The film is based on the novella written by Neil Gaiman who even admitted in an interview I found online that he actually got scared by the movie. That is the sign of a really good adaptation and ""Coraline"" is easily that. The film's story takes the novella and expands it very well by adding details that don't feel unnecessary and characters you can easily like. I also love how the film gradually goes from being very happy and glowing to very creepy and disturbing and not making it feel rushed. The animation is also by far, the best element of the film. Unlike other stop motion animated movies where the puppets were typically made by clay, the people at Laika decide to make the puppets faces using a 3D printer which is something I think has never been done before. Apart from it great because it'sÂ brand new, it looks great because the film has a different assortments of colors which establishes the mood perfectly. The characters have very identifiable personalities, yet the best thing about them is that they're not perfect. What I mean by perfect is not their always happy nice.Â Even Coraline isn't a perfect character as she does get jealous and egotistical at times. I love characters that are like this. The lastÂ thing that I really loved about the film was the film's musical score written by Bruno Coulais. The music had the right mood by being both very calming and very unpleasant when its needed.Â As far as flaws with them are, I do find the parents in the beginning are a little unlikeable. I know that it's to set up the story with Coraline, but I think they could have been a little less grumpy.<br/><br/>""Coraline"" is just fantastic. It's a film that has the right amount of creepiness thatÂ leads to a new Halloween classic with it's great story, animation and characters. I hope Henry Selick can continue making movies like this as this film is proof that he can make good movies without the help of Tim Burton."

","I thought since this was my first review that I would review my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Coraline is an easy example for a movie masterpiece to me. The movie has perfect pacing, Believable Characters,a Beautiful innovative atmosphere, a phenomenal OST, and to top it all off, Stunning 3D stop motion Animation. <br/><br/>A short synopsis: Coraline Jones is moving into a place called Pink Palace it's somewhat of a boarding home, Whilst Coraline's Parents are always working it leads to her being curious and wanting to adventure. eventually she finds a boarded up mini door, Being her curious self she gets her mom to check inside, only to find bricks that is; that same night though Coraline is awoken and lead to the door by a mouse. Now the door leads somewhere beyond her imagination.<br/><br/>Coraline's only flaw is that it ends."
"WondrousMoose","9","1","1","18 July 2017"," Coraline is an imaginative, creepy, and wholly unique animated experience.
","Animation is a contentious medium. Some consider it to be exclusively for children, while others insist that it can appeal just as much to adults, if not more so. Personally, I agree with the latter, and I can offer films like Waltz with Bashir and Grave of the Fireflies as examples. Coraline, from the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, is a film that I feel bridges the gap between children's entertainment and adults' art especially well. On the one hand, it is a stop motion feature about a young girl who discovers a fantasy world from inside her home, but on the other, it has garnered huge critical praise, and almost anyone who sees the film as a child is completely terrified by it. Who is it made for, then? I'd say that it's for exactly the person who wants to watch it.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) has just moved with her family to Oregon from her home in Michigan. Her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) ignore her and spend their time writing for a gardening catalog, and the neighbors â€“ an elderly pair of former actresses, a crazy man who claims to train mice for a circus, and a boy named Wyborne (he goes by ""Wybie"") who follows her around â€“ are all a bit strange for her liking. In her new home, though, she finds a small door that leads to a world almost the same as her own, only better.<br/><br/>Here, her parents pay loads of attention to her, the actresses are beautiful acrobats, her crazy neighbor actually has a circus of kangaroo mice, and Wybie can't talk! After a few trips to this world, she is just about ready to stay, until she hears the catch: she must gouge out her eyes and replace them with buttons. Her parents have also been captured, and so she must defeat the monstrous Beldam who controls the fantasy and set things back to the way they were.<br/><br/>It isn't often that a movie captures me as fully as Coraline does. The characters, story, animation, music, overall design, and little details in the world and between characters all come together to create one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen. Coraline herself is a wonderful character, and we get to watch a bored girl with a poor attitude develop the strength to accept that while her world is not perfect, it is what she has, and she can love it for that.<br/><br/>This film sets up its macabre and charming tone from the opening shots â€“ under fairly creepy music a hand of needles empties a doll and builds a new one, before sending it floating out of a nearby window. For lovers of stop motion, Selick's past works, or creepy movies in general, this is one that simply can't be missed."

But the second half was a lot better and more entertaining.<br/><br/>But this movie looked great, the combination between computer-animations and stop-motion really made it special and beautiful, and you can see that a lot of effort was put in to it.<br/><br/>Although the characters weren't that interesting the voice-acting was good and I especially liked Keith David and Ian Mcshane.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie 7.3."

","Coraline is a modern day, adult fairy tale. Neil Gaiman is known for his imaginative, genre-bending tales, and Coraline is no exception. It shifts in tone from whimsical to frightening to somber, but it's all presented in a truly engaging manner. <br/><br/>Even if the story wasn't as good as it is, Coraline would be worth seeing for its strikingly beautiful art style and fluid animation. It's different from that used in The Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride, but it does remind one of them. <br/><br/>Kids may like this film for its pretty images, but it lacks the snappy humor and wackiness that many modern fairy tales have. It takes a older child or an adult to appreciate the subtleties, melancholic sensibilities, and depths of Coraline."

","I only recently watched Coraline after hearing so many positive things about it. I think it has some moments that causes the viewer to think about the deeper hidden meaning of the story, hence the whole ""be careful what You wish for"" title on the DVD. The moral is obvious and simple, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it depends on how it comes across. Basically the movie is about a 12 year old girl who has parents that could care less about Her, She finds a door to a secret world, thinks it is all fun and games but soon learns otherwise.....from what I heard I expected a little bit more out of the plot, the trailer makes the movie look a lot more interesting than it really is to be honest. The movie has good moments towards the end, but before then the movie was a little flat. There could have been more detail about the main villain of the movie ""the other mother"" and why exactly She kept children's souls locked away. I must say however the voice acting, and animation were on point. This film is probably enough to entertain a kid 12 and under but it is not my taste."

She finds her parents are more attentive with buttons instead of eyes. She finds the world full of color and magic and everything is what she hoped for in the real world.<br/><br/>If there is one problem in this movie, it's that Coraline is a bit of brat especially with her parents. She doesn't treat the neighbor boy Wybie that well either. However the Other world is just so infinitely fascinating and at the same time creepy. I can really buy that she would be seduced by the Other and at the same time be leery of it. Writer/director Henry Selick have done great works before.

","""You probably think this world is a dream come true, but you're wrong,"" said the cat to Coraline. This warning to Coraline (Dakota Fanning), in the film Coraline (2009), is something she has had in her head since the beginning. The director, Henry Selick, has made other mother movies that are also stunning. Richard Roeper compares Henry Selick's work: ""Writer/director Henry Selick follows The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with another meticulously crafted visual gem."" This movie is visually stunning which intensifies the creepy scenes and leaves the audience frozen. <br/><br/>The movie Coraline is all about a girl who moves into a new home with her father and mother (Teri Hatcher). He life is boring and dull and her parents pay no attention to her. Coraline is not able to do what she wants and explores he new house and finds a small door. However it is all bricked up, but that night she finds the door again and the bricks are gone and she goes through. Coraline gets to the parallel world and meets her ""other"" mother (also Teri Hatcher). Everyone in the world has buttons instead of eyes. Her ""other"" mother and ""other"" father treat her as though she is the best thing in the world. Coraline is amazed with this other world and when she falls asleep she wakes up back in the real world. She thinks its all a dream until the next night where she goes back and she is faced with more wonders made by her ""other"" mother. She loves this world and never wants to go back to the real one.<br/><br/>To make a good horror film it was said that, ""[ . . . ] by the time you get to the climax [ . . . ] your familiarity with the beast allows you to assess them in a different way"" (Fear in the Dark: A Spine-chilling History of Horror Film). Coraline fills this criteria and is a good horror film. I don't think it is for young children or people who are looking for the biggest thrill but it is creepy in its own way. Overall Coraline sends great societal messages and a cute but creepy movie to its audiences and both children and adults with love the horror and thrill for a long time."
"Cat-Wings","6","1","1","19 October 2012"," Fascinating visuals and imaginative film making.
","Coraline is a film released in 2009 and directed by Henry Selick, who is famous for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993). Coraline uses an animation technique called stop motion (stop frame), where it manipulates photographic subjects such as clay dolls or stuffed animals by moving them one frame at a time, so that it appears as if they move by themselves. The expressions of characters are rich like a human being.<br/><br/>The story starts off with an old house where Coraline moves in with her parents. Coraline finds no interest in the house, has no friends, and feels neglected by her parents. While she is looking around the house, she finds a small door blocked by a brick. However, only during her sleep, she goes through the door into another world, where another nice mother and father look after her. The ""other"" parents look the same as her real parents and they are way too nice for Caroline, except that they have button eyes. When she realizes what the other mother wants, she tries to escape from other mother's desire in the evil world and fights with the other mother in order to get her back to the reality.<br/><br/>Overall, the visuals of the film were imaginative and fascinating, but the story was still one you can predict. And this film is easily compared with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which is better. So, I would say, this film is not something you want to watch in a theater."
"robotbling","10","1","1","12 December 2011"," Animation so polished it rivals computer-animated films
","(www.plasticpals.com) I'm a stop-motion animation aficionado, mainly thanks to the directorial talents of Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas, James & The Giant Peach) but for whatever reason I missed seeing Coraline when it was in theaters. I recently made up for that mistake by watching the Blu-ray release, and came away quite impressed. Coraline is based on a novel by acclaimed scribe Neil Gaiman, a kind of modern-day fairytale for kids who don't appreciate how good they've got things in life.<br/><br/>Coraline's family moves into an old house, and to kill the boredom of a workaholic mom and dad, she starts exploring its nooks and crannies. She soon notices what appears to be a doorway that's been wallpapered over, and immediately needs to know where it leads. She successfully nags her mom into excavating and unlocking the door, only to find it leads to a plain old brick wall.<br/><br/>Coraline-1smDisappointed but not dissuaded, she returns to the door after going to sleep one night and finds a secret passage way that opens intoÂ… the same old house. She soon discovers things aren't entirely the same in this alternate universe: her dad showers her with love and attention and her mom cooks and bakes delicious food just for her. Everything seems great except for one thing: they have buttons for eyes.<br/><br/>If it wasn't already, stop-motion has been raised to a high art with this film. The endless set details, the characters' elastic facial expressions, and the wondrous special effects are a testament to the medium's staying power. It's quite easy to forget you are watching something that had to be made by hand piece by piece. In one spectacular scene, a few dozen mice dance for our enjoyment, while an unseen animator is driven mad. So talented are the craftsmen and animators that one could quite easily assume it was entirely computer generated. Selick went to great lengths not to resort to digital effects; where (I assume) post production cleaned up wires or seams in the puppets' faces, the pain-staking work is completely transparent.<br/><br/>Untold hours of work are revealed in the special features, which show the process of creating effects like fog and fire (none of it CG), as well as the wonderfully robotic armatures (inner skeletons which give the puppets their stiffness). It also comes with four pairs of magenta/green 3D glasses for its 3D mode. The effect varies from decent to downright broken, and for my money the color desaturation that occurs makes the experience less enjoyable than without. Unfortunately the at-home 3D experience isn't the same as that in theaters where polarization creates the effect.<br/><br/>Thankfully Coraline doesn't fall into the same trap as the mediocre The Corpse Bride, which had stunning animation but a terrible story. The tale feels like a mix of Alice in Wonderland, Labyrinth, and Hansel and Gretel, but never feels tired or clichÃ©d. And do take its PG-13 rating seriously, I imagine this is high-octane nightmare fuel for really young kids."
"Ali_John_Catterall","9","1","1","8 July 2010"," Button Swoon
","That's Coraline, pronounced 'Caw-a-lyne'. Seems the only people to get that right are Coraline's mum and dad. All four of them. Four? Well, after her family moves into the 'Pink Palaces Apartments', Coraline (Dakota Fanning) discovers a parallel dimension, accessed through a tiny door in reception.<br/><br/>There she discovers a candy-coloured mirror world, in which parents mark II are never too busy to play. They prepare dinner tables laden with mouthwatering roasts (and a literal gravy train) and compose songs (They Might Be Giants-penned songs but, really, you can't have everything) on magic pianos, dedicated to the very ground on which Coraline walks. The kind of stuff her workaholic, self-absorbed real-world parents have neither the time nor inclination for. ""Rain makes mud, mud makes a mess"" Mom no. 1 (Teri Hatcher) snaps when Coraline wants to go out and splash around. Conversely, Other Mom (also Teri Hatcher) just adores mud, glorious mud. ""Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies...!"" <br/><br/>Oh yes, the perfect parents in every way. Well, okay, there are the buttons. You're looking at the buttons, right. The black buttons Mom and Dad 2.0 have in place of their eyes. Maybe it is a bit yucky. Only now, Other Mom's insisting that Coraline has the same operation. And when she resists, things suddenly turn very nasty. As that mysterious talking cat (Keith David) warned her all along, ""You probably think this is a dream come true - but you're wrong."" And when Mom No.2 transforms into the awful spider-hag we guessed she was all along, Coraline must get herself, her real parents and some other trapped souls the heck out of this poisoned domain, before her eyes get poked out with sewing needles. Button Moon it ain't.<br/><br/>This reviewer bows to nobody in their admiration for the works of Neil Gaiman, from the 'Sandman' saga to 'Stardust'. Though some may quibble that Coraline hasn't an original bone in its body - referencing everything from The Wizard Of Oz to Snow White's witch-queen and Alice's enchanted gardens (along with many elements from Gaiman's own Sandman novels) - there's only a handful of plots in this world, and the wise ones know it's all in the telling.<br/><br/>As a weaver of myths and spinner of stories, then, Gaiman is at the top of his game, man. Director Henry Selick isn't exactly a slouch either when it comes to fashioning astounding vistas. Contrary to popular belief (and its, er, title) Tim Burton didn't actually direct Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - it was Selick; another ex-Disney animator like Burton, and the chap behind the James and the Giant Peach adaptation.<br/><br/>As expected - but even exceeding expectations - Coraline, the longest stop-animation feature to date, and the first to be shot in 3D, is technically brilliant. From the minute curl of an eyebrow to the sheen of dust on a window, the gilding and frosting is unprecedented. If the set-pieces (including that enchanted garden with its snapping snapdragons and praying mantis tractor) overwhelm with their ingenuity, the sideshows featuring Coraline's bizarre neighbours are hardly less impressive: a phantasmagorical big top of circus mice; a bawdy burlesque voiced by our own French and Saunders, featuring lithe young trapezists bursting through the skins of old ladies with bosoms like gas balloons, for an audience of flying Scottie dogs wearing harnesses of angels wings. It's a stream of consciousness turned loopy, feral and dangerous.<br/><br/>And Coraline is terrifying. Unlike, say, WALL-E, which also springs from an essentially depressing set-up, this film isn't interested in charming your socks off. Like its eponymous heroine, it knows exactly who it is, and if you don't care for it, you can go to blazes. Or Hannah Montana: The Movie. Coraline has no warmth, no charm, no cheer - and it likes it like that. Its primary purpose is to make you crawl under a popcorn box, or tickle the same part of the brain that likes tiptoeing down the creaky cellar stairs - then bolting up the same.<br/><br/>Why? Because kids can't get enough of it. Because, in the face of all currently received wisdom and advice - the kind of stultifying over-cautiousness that led to the likes of March Of The Penguins being saddled with a 'mild peril' warning - kids love 'icky stuff' and they love being scared out of their wits. As Gaiman argues, and everyone from Angela Carter to the Brothers Grimm would surely agree with him, this is healthy stuff, an important part of a child's development.<br/><br/>Much less healthy, in fact, is the presence of local boy Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr), short for ""Why Be Born?"" of all the lovely things - a totally unnecessary addition to the source. In the original, Coraline calls on every ounce of her own courage and initiative to defeat the button-eyed 'Beldam'. Here, it's the otherwise entirely useless Wybie who saves the day, as if a mere girl couldn't be trusted to be self-sufficient. It all seems horribly representative of an increasingly reactionary, anti-feminist stance in American-made dramas, and which now appears to have extended its pernicious reach to family cartoons.<br/><br/>The much-vaunted 3D is similarly problematic. Coraline's palate is vivacious and bright, but those dull grey glasses automatically cast a pall over proceedings, rendering clear scenes gloomy and muddy: a truly crackpot interference. Sure, it's meant to be dark, but not like this. The technology isn't nearly exploited enough anyway: after a tease of an opener in which sewing needles are perilously thrust towards the eyes, it consequently drops in and out, so that you might find yourself constantly taking the glasses off and on to get the most out of the picture. To be continually reminded of a technical process is not exactly ideal for such a supposedly immersive feature. But perhaps it should have dispensed with it altogether; Coraline's world is audacious enough on its own terms without further feathers and bells and whistles."

I watched the first 15 minutes or so in 3D with the glasses, but didn't find it satisfying viewing, and watched the rest of it in 2D without glasses.<br/><br/>Here we have an animated movie using small puppets primarily, with facial movements that reminds me of the claymation of the 'Wallace and Gromit' movies.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning voices Coraline Jones, an intelligent and active girl of about 10. Her mother and father always seem too busy to pay attention to her. When she notices a small baseboard-level locked door in the new house they are renting, she finds the key to open it. Behind the door she finds an interesting, shimmering, moving circular tunnel seemingly made of fabric. Undaunted she goes right in, only to emerge right back in her house. Or so it seems.<br/><br/>In this ""alternate"" world she finds her mom and dad, her ""other"" parents, who treat her very well. She gets the attention she doesn't seem to be able to get at home. Plus everything else she craves. But these ""other"" parents have buttons where their eyes should be. Coraline is certainly curious about this, but it does not scare her off.<br/><br/>Teri Hatcher is good as the voice of both her mother and her ""other"" mother.<br/><br/>The reason I can't pull myself to call this a ""good"" movie is because it becomes more than a bit unclear what was going on in this alternate reality, why some kids were already trapped there, and why the ""other"" mother wanted Coraline to stay with her permanently. Maybe it was just because the ""other"" mother wanted a child to love her, but still it never hit home with me. Not like ""Monsters, Inc"", for example, which I consider one of the better animated movies."

PG-13 is what it should have been rated with the grown up content and all around mean spirited nature of the movie. I would not recommend this to anyone bringing their kids to the movies to see a cartoon for some light get-a-way fun. Save the drama for the grown ups.

"jrwygant","6","6","15","12 February 2009"," where's the story?
","Sorry, folks, but ""Coraline"" is not ""James and the Giant Peach"" or ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" If the other two scored a 10, this one would be no more than a 6 on the same scale.<br/><br/>Technically it is stunning, including the 3-D. Where it fails is the story, with disappointing principle characters, empty iconic images, and a plot that holds few surprises. The mix of real world and fantasy just doesn't work very well here. The real world is in fact boring, and Coraline and her parents are not particularly likable. She sports an unbecoming Bush-Cheney smirk; her parents consider her a nuisance and mostly ignore her. That may be realistic, but it's not very interesting.<br/><br/>The film does manage a few flashes of brilliance when Mr. Bobinsky, Miss Spink, and Miss Forcible are on screen, which is all too seldom. They are reminiscent of the best in Nightmare and Peach. They are also not realistic, which is great.<br/><br/>The iconic images of the button eyes and the three balls that hold the spirits of the three dead children are never really tied into the story well and never seem to represent anything other than gimmicks. The best tales make much more of their ""McGuffins."" This story just presents them to the audience and then walks away. Do the button eyes mean something beyond the unpleasant notion of a replacement for real eyes? How do they get implanted, when and if they ever do? Would the character choose them or be forced to submit? It's never made clear, and whatever conflict might have accompanied that threat is lost. How do the little balls represent the dead children? How were the children's spirits captured in them? If we knew that, Coraline herself might have been under greater threat -- making a more engaging story. And where is the clever mechanism that a good story would present for freeing the captured spirits?<br/><br/>Nightmare had Tim Burton as one of the writers, and Peach had Roald Dahl's book. After director Selick's fans have finished praising ""Coraline,"" the rest of us can't help remembering that it's the story that makes a good movie, not just the technique used to tell it."
"bigben5","6","6","15","7 February 2009"," Surprisingly one dimensional...
","Let me frank here: I love Neil Gaiman (his work, that is), I love Henry Selick, and I love animation. Coraline was the first Gaiman novel I ever read, and when I found out they were making a movie, I literally leaped for joy! <br/><br/>Then I saw the clip online and thought it was weird for Coraline to have blue hair -- okay, not bad. Then I heard she was going to be voiced by Dakota Fanning (Ew), that they rewrote the story so that some kid named Wybie would be in it, and that They Might Be Giants would supply the soundtrack. My hopes were fading...<br/><br/>I'll sum it up for you right now: this movie has the BEST animation Henry Selick has ever done -- bar none! The visuals are breathtaking--no, spectacular! The music was catchy, the jokes were good, and the acting first class. The problem is that the pace of the story moves too quickly and none of the characters, except for Coraline, are given any kind of development.<br/><br/>Coraline obviously proves to the most engaging character throughout the story, but everyone else feels sorely misplaced. Her parents are mean to her one minute, then nice to her the next; Wybie is zero one minute, a hero the next; and the cat goes from being a sarcastic freak of nature to being Coraline's best friend. What happened here? There is virtually no character development.<br/><br/>And what about the plot holes? Yes, I'm sorry to say that even in a film as beautiful as this there are plot holes. Such as, why on earth did Wybie give Coraline the doll in the first place? Why didn't the Other Mother just give it to Coraline herself? Why isn't Coraline the least bit scared when she sees the Other Mother for the first time? Would she really be courageous enough to eat there after just having eaten in the real world? How come Coraline's parents can't remember what happened after they've been released from the snow globe? And why does Coraline act like nothing is wrong when the cat suddenly begins talking to her in the tunnel. Obviously, I'm over-analyzing things here, but many of the film's faults are glaringly on the surface.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say that The Nightmare Before Christmas still remains my favorite Selick film. Coraline is GOOD, but at least ALL the characters in Nightmare were one- dimensional, whereas Coraline is the only three-dimensional thing going."

","This movie was a great, great disappointment, and we are at a complete loss on how it has earned the generally good reviews everywhere. The story is a dull and hap-hazard patchwork of truly imaginative fairy tails, lesser imaginative children's stories and other bad copies of true classics. But more importantly, it is in absolutely no way suited for children. It is deeply rooted in the genre of horror movies and makes ample use of fear-producing settings and techniques. Starting off in a clumsily drawn situation many children can relate to - being misunderstood by their parents - it begins to address the topic of imagination as a helper in difficult situations. Here, a wonderful opportunity lay at hand to in pictures talk to children about the themes of emotional over-strain and retreat and the dangers that are associated with it. However, the movie from then on completely fails to make use of this possibility and regresses into an imbecile fight against a fuzzily, badly painted antagonist. This antagonist is anything but stringent, it switches back and forth between different clichÃ©s and it is obvious that the makers of this movie do not have any creativity in themselves at all to create a coherent vision. To make up for this lack of imagination, the movie is filled up to the rim with horror scenes, much too much for anyone below 14 at least, I would say. Even my partner and me were stunned by such an unnecessary use of fear-creating. The psychological insight of the creators does not go any further than randomly inserting some references to the constructive and destructive side of love. When you think that you completely wasted your money, it gets even worse, as the story is from a possible closing again forced into a second rising, giving additional prove of the complete loss of creative vision and inability of storytelling of the makers. It is a disgrace how this movie is presented as being in the tradition of Alice, Amelie, or others. It is not. Do not pay to be made sit through a complete failure."

","Warning, this is not a kids movie, if you bring your kid to this movie they will probably get nightmares and a traumatized childhood. Aside from that, this movie is an amazing work of art. I highly recommend everyone (but kids) to see this movie. It has the chills and suspense of a horror movie and a thriller put together. The only thing that ruined it for me is that the ending could have been better which is why i rated it a 9/10. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. ITS NOT A KIDS MOVIE! Ohh by the way, i saw this movie with 3d glasses, not sure if it is 3d everywhere but it is better with them. This flick is a future classic and sets the bar high for horror flicks. Yes i said horror flicks... if this movie was made in real life it would be a cult classic for horror fans... truly creepy as hell.<br/><br/>If i could sum this movie up in one word it would be,<br/><br/>Chilling."
"theclarabellevilla","6","3","6","4 December 2009"," Use your parental discretion
","As kid's films go, this is less of kid's film. If your child is street-wise they'll probably love it for it's different take and its sheer weird majesty. If not, and only YOU can judge this, you may be soothing night terrors for a little while. Id recommend a very street-wise 7 as the youngest age.<br/><br/>That said, the film has an excellent message and features an imperfect yet strong female heroine who learns more than one valuable lesson while giving us access to a fantastic visual treat. Sans schmaltz!!<br/><br/>It's a little slow in places but all in all very enjoyable and a welcome departure from the 'too sweet' impression of the world we frequently see portrayed in kids films. As a worldly wise adult you may particularly appreciate 'influences' that Neil Gayman appears to have been under while writing the book.<br/><br/>Areas for possible concern: There is a point in the film where we receive more than an eyeful of a pair of unfeasibly large and barely covered wobbling breasts. The idea of eyes being removed and replaced with buttons, when depicted, is actually beyond creepy in some places, however, as an adult I've seen horror films to make the associations. A kid probably hasn't got the same references so may not find it as disturbing."
"w00f","6","6","16","7 February 2009"," Visually OK, Otherwise Weak
","While the animation is quite good in spots, the film itself lacks warmth or chemistry. Much of the voice acting, particularly that of Dakota Fanning, is flat and sounds forced. While the 3D was interesting enough, several scenes felt like they'd been inserted for no other reason than to stick something in the audience's face. Example: the banana slug scene, which added nothing to either the story or character development. Parents should take note: many children under 9 or 10 in the theater in which I saw the film were scared to tears by the villain; I heard quite a few ""Mommy, I'm scared! I want to go!"" and similar complaints resulting in young children leaving the cinema. All in all, Coraline is visually nice, though not particularly noteworthy (old videos for the band Tool did better with the same sorts of material, for instance). The story is an interesting one, but this adaptation will likely leave most viewers over the age of 15 cold and those under 8 too scared to enjoy it. This is certainly nothing on par with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and even ""The Corpse Bride"" was a stronger animated film."
"chetbakergold","2","7","20","24 June 2009"," Predictable, Not for young kids
","This movie should not have gotten such good a rating. It was incredibly predictable. 20 minutes into the movie I had already predicted the rest of it, and 3/4ths of them came true. And Iit's really not for young kids, hey, I'm a 7th grader and I got creeped out. It was meant to be a horror movie just for kids, and it sure was. <br/><br/>The characters, to me,seemed empty and almost lifeless, unlike other and better animated movies. My first impression of Coraline was a heartless, cold girl that liked causing trouble. And my opinion stayed that way throughout the movie. That boy Wybie was completely unnecessary. The only creature I actually liked was the talking cat. <br/><br/>Coraline also seemed oblivious and a little dumb. I mean come on, if I walked into my kitchen and saw my mom with no eyes, just buttons, I'd run down the street screaming for the police, wouldn't you? But no, she acts like it's a completely normal occurrence in her house. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I wouldn't recommend this for kids is the scene with the old ladies doing their show. Not for kids to see. Also, it most likely scared a lot of kids that the 'other mother' murdered three children, took out their eyes, and locked their ghosts (and remains) in a dungeon-magic-mirror thing.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, I had hundreds of questions. Why did Coraline have to go in the tunnel? Why didn't she go to the library, rent a movie on on demand, something instead of climbing through a gross looking tunnel and practically get herself killed? Etc, etc."
"Leofwine_draca","2","7","21","5 July 2014"," The dullest animation ever made
","Neil Gaiman isn't doing very well in regards to his film adaptations, with this following on from the disappointing MIRRORMASK made a few years ago. CORALINE is the most dull, uninteresting and downright annoying animation I've seen in recent years, which is a surprise given that it was directed by Henry Selick, who made THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas so endearingly odd all those years ago.<br/><br/>The problem with CORALINE is the dumb Americanised storyline and the irritating characters. The titular character, complete with Dakota Fanning's whiny voice, is the worst offender, but even the likes of the normally reliable Ian McShane come out of this badly. The only one who fares well is Keith David playing a cat, but then he's barely utilised.<br/><br/>The animation was apparently done with stop motion, but you can't tell. There's none of the endearing jerkiness you expect from stop motion, instead this looks and feels like just another soulless CGI monstrosity. In addition, the storyline is extremely slim and stretched to breaking point by an over-long running time, and the visuals just aren't there. CORALINE is a film I can recommend to nobody, unfortunately."

","The stop-action is a little jumpy, but the concept designs were brilliant. The story is interesting and moves along at a clip. Visually, it stands alone within its genre. The same story could have been achieved with actors, but not the intended mood.<br/><br/>And it is the mood aspect that will probably not find its way into the senses of most American audiences. Its aura is foreign. It embodies European-Gothic impressionism with dancing, marionette-like characters. It is dark and somewhat macabre. Even the music sounds foreign, though some of it is haunting and helps to provoke mood.<br/><br/>Coraline is a masterpiece. It is not, in my opinion for kids under 8, but it really depends on the kid. As for adults, the film has the same entertainment value that can be found by mixing Toy Story with Cirque de Solei. If you enjoy these, you'll have a good time here."

","With Henry Selick as the director, you know, the man behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, I expected a special treat when I watched Coraline especially in 3-D. Don't get me wrong, I did like the images that were presented throughout the movie in the rare stop-motion animation style in an era where everything else that's animated is usually done by computer. And there were interesting characters that made one want to get involved for the whole picture. It's just that after a while, there seemed more style and not enough substance to really keep you involved in the story with your eyes and ears thinking awesome the whole time but your heart wondering if there could have been more to the characterizations. In fact, since this was based on a novel, I'm sure there were some cuts that had to be made to make a certain running time. But like I said, while there wasn't enough intensity to make this truly thrilling, Coroline still was pretty exciting at certain points and many young children watching this will not get bored when the climax comes. So on that note, I am recommending Coroline for animation buffs and anyone who doesn't mind if their under-12 children holds on to them for a while..."

Out of all the films being released in 2009, this is the best kids movie I've seen (I also haven't seen Up yet).<br/><br/>First, the visuals are fantastic. The storyline? Tightly woven and very strong. Characters? Creative, interesting, and very fleshed-out...except for Coraline. I couldn't stand her (especially at the beginning, though she did get better) and Dakota Fanning's awful voice work nearly ruined it for me. Everyone else's voice acting was near perfect, except for hers. The major drawback to this film was the casting of Fanning in the lead role.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I don't like this movie, I do. It's just nothing special to me, either. I love dark fables like this, but I don't know. I just feel like it's a bit overrated.

","There's some nice animation, even some occasional decent 3D visuals but nothing is sustained for long. It's a shame, because the lasting effect is one of disappointment not enchantment. The story is flawed which makes the denouement tame and limp. As a modern day 'fairy tale' it is anodyne and overly domestic in scope. The parent characters are recognisable modern harassed 'knowledge' workers - freelancers chancing their arm in a sea of competition, looking for a utopia that doesn't exist. As their daughter, Coraline inevitably shares their idealism and is set on a journey to re-conceive her life experience. Oh it's so droll and ultimately boring. Who ever animated the facial expressions got it spot on - perhaps they spent a lot of time looking in the mirror? A lot of navel gazing, methinks by all involved. A decent film for a young person. Nah, not really. Pretend you're back in the fifties and wear the goggles for the 3D - it's sideshow at the funfair experience. It'll remind you most of Comfort adverts."

The plot draws you in, my wife and I both found ourselves captivated by the story line. But be forewarned, this is a horror movie designed for children and it was done well enough that it has real potential for horrifying your children. <br/><br/>One of the characters is an older women with enormous breasts. At one point, she appears in a costume that consists of a bikini bottom and pasties, while she jumps up and down repeatedly, breasts bouncing at the while. <br/><br/>The villain has godlike powers and is terribly cruel. She tortures some dead children and holds them hostage, not to mention she steal everyone's eyes and sews buttons in their place. She is made of needles, but eventually morphs into the shape of a spider.<br/><br/>Older children may be able to handle this movie, though I would not consider it appropriate.

","This movie scared the pants off me. Which in turn, scared young children and women with small hips, as I walked out of the theater, pantless.<br/><br/>With CORALINE, the MPAA once again proves how little grasp it has in correlating asinine Ratings to actual content. Even as I entered this PG-13 ""3D stop-motion"" animated movie, there were lines around the block for the premier of the R-Rated Friday THE 13TH, yet I cannot imagine how axe-killing teens could be more chilling than a parallel world where people have sewed-on buttons for eyes! <br/><br/>From a celebrated book by Neil Gaiman, director Henry Selick (director, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas) brings us this morbid tale of a cute little blue-haired girl who goes ""through the looking glass"" (actually, she crawls through a small door in the wall) to a mirror world where her parents do not ignore her (like her real writer parents who are always hunched over computers), feed her delicious dinners (instead of glop), and lavish love on her (instead of what seems like barely tolerable babysitting). Everything is the same but opposite in this Other World - except her Other Mother and Other Father have buttons sewed on in place of eyes.<br/><br/>That in itself is something out of a medieval torture tale. But it gets worse. Much worse. And by worse, I mean better.<br/><br/>Coraline, the wide-faced, blue-haired girl, is voiced by Dakota Fanning, her parents, voiced by Teri Hatcher and ""the PC Guy,"" John Hodgman. They move into a townhouse complex in the desolate country, where the neighbors define wacky (probably because they're so isolated in the first place); Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French (ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, dahling!) voice two frumpy old actresses with cute Corgis smoothly gliding about on feet covered by their long fur (who keep their dead Corgis stuffed on a shelf, dressed in angel wings); Ian McShane voices a stick-thin old circus performer with a beachball belly who rears performing mice. And Coraline meets a local boy with a terribly insecure stoop, Wyborn (Robert Bailey Jr.), whom she starts taunting darkly with her nickname, ""Why-Were-You-Born."" <br/><br/>Coraline finds a doll in her new house that looks like her, except with buttons for eyes. She calls it Little Me, and its secret is revealed soon enough when Coraline discovers her eerie utopian mirror family.<br/><br/>There are fantastical musical numbers in this Other World, an especially stunning piano interlude by Other Father (performed by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants).<br/><br/>The ultimate ""crossing over"" for Coraline would be to let her Other Mother sew buttons in place of her eyes!...<br/><br/>CORALINE is not for little kids. Unless we ourselves have foisted on them so much vanilla for so long that we don't realize kids are actually intelligent enough to handle terrifying visions like a piano with hands holding a man's mouth shut to stop him from revealing secrets, a ringmaster's suit being animated by hostile rats from within, despairing ghost children trapped behind a mirror with missing eyes...<br/><br/>The dark marvels come at us unrelenting, one amazing spectacle after another; it's not even ""darkly funny"" - it's just freakin' DARK.<br/><br/>This movie is apparently the first to be made with this new 3D Stop-Motion process. It is astounding to look at. This is not your LITTLE DRUMMER BOY stop-motion (1968, Rankin-Bass), or even Nick Park's superior WALLACE AND GROMIT (1989) - although an honorary mention must go to the man who made stop-motion an art form, Ray Harryhausen - CORALINE is smooth enough to be a 3D cartoon, yet retains that suggestion of jerkiness that lends it an organic feel. The use of lighting is amazing: shadows moving across a field as if clouds are passing in front of the sun, use of darkness and fog and three-dimensional background turning two-dimensional.<br/><br/>We've been subjected to the advertising for so long that we imagine it's ""Tim Burton's"" THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, but now we see the darkness might not have been all Burton's; it was Selick all along who brought the darkness to the celluloid that Tim Burton expressed on the written page.<br/><br/>The parallels with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS are many: the talking cat, people trapped in mirrors and snow globes; the crazy characters having tea, a wicked matriarch, a grin sewn onto a boy's face... even the clever trick of Coraline's name (reverse two letters, it is ""Caroline"")...<br/><br/>But it's the parallels with Alice Cooper that are the reason why I need to go back through the looking glass to find my pants.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy the Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","I had never seen this film which is an adaptation of another Neil Gaiman book, but I had seen the trailer and I had gotten curious. So I bought the movie on DVD and after I had watched it, I love it. The film is made in the stop-motion animation by Henry Selick, the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas...though I not really interested in that film.<br/><br/>In the film, Coraline Jones and her parents, Mel and Charlie move from Pontiac to Ashland in the Pink Palace Apartments, which is a converted mansion that they share with retired actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and retired Russian circus performer Mr. Bobinsky. Coraline's parents are busy working on a gardening catalog, which leaves them with little time for Coraline. On a walk with a dousing rod, Coraline meets Wybie Lovat whose grandmother grew up in the house, and a cat that Wybie says is feral. They find an old well on the hill above the house. Wybie is a little surprised that his grandmother agreed to rent to the Joneses; usually she tries to find tenants without children.<br/><br/>Later, Coraline's mother gives her an old ragdoll that Wybie brought over. A note says that he found at in his grandmother's old chest. The button-eyed doll looks strikingly like Coraline. He also tells Coraline that his grandmother had a twin sister who disappeared as a child, and that he's never been inside the house. Later Coraline finds a small locked door that had been wallpapered over, and when she insists her mother unlock it, she is surprised to find nothing but a brick wall. That night, Coraline is awoken by the sound of mice, and follows their trail to the small door. Opening it, she finds a passageway instead of the brick wall, and crawls through it. On the opposite side, she finds herself in the ""Other World,"" which is inhabited by button eyed doppelgangers of her parents. The ""Other Parents"" seem to be much warmer and attentive than Coraline's real parents, particularly her ""Other Mother,"" who does everything she can to impress Coraline.<br/><br/>Coraline continues to return to the Other World and is entertained by ""other"" versions of Wybie and the neighbors. Over the course of several nights, Coraline spends time with the fantastical Others, but when she falls asleep, she finds herself back in her normal world. Of course it raises tension between her and her mother, who slowly tries to be more affectionate to Coraline. During her third visit, she is warned by the black cat, who can warp between worlds but can only talk in the Other World, that not all is as seems in the Other World and to be careful. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends<br/><br/>I am thinking of reading the original book...I know that is a bit unorthodox but that's me. This is an awesome movie, very well written, and the animation is excellent. The story was perfectly funny and full of suspense. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film - from beginning to end."

","CORALINE If you liked 'The nightmare before Christamas' and 'The corpse bride' then you're in for a real treat with this 3D masterpiece! Coraline is the creation of the makers of 'the nightmare before Christmas' and offers a dark alternative to the animations by pixar and dreamworks. The pinnacle of this creation is the 3D effects which make it a joy to watch without the trek to the IMAX. The story begins with the central character of 'Coraline'(Dakota Fanning), who feels ignored and under appreciated by her overly busy parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman). She discovers a small door which leads to a mystical world where she meets different versions of everything in her world however everything is magical and based around her happiness. But to carry on this perfect existence she must sacrifice her eyes. This fuels the chase to escape the mystical world, her parents and those trapped within it! Coralines experience takes the audience on a journey where she discovers that her parents may sometimes be too busy to spend time with her but still love her; and she learns to appreciate what they do to give her a good life. The film manages to display the hidden moral that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Her journey introduces the audiences to eccentric characters; both lovable and peculiar; they provide the humour in this tale through the character Bobinsky's antics and eccentric behaviour of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (Dawn french and Jennifer Saunders), in particular, the semi-naked burlesque shows they perform. This sets it apart from an animation geared towards the young and makes it enjoyable for the adults too! Even with its brilliance the film does have a few downfalls just like all the greats. The films drives me ask why the witch doesn't want to or can't enter the normal world and how she came to be in that place. Another thought it provokes is the replicas of people that the witch has in her world and raises the questions of whether everyone has a twin?? Furthermore there are also correlations between this and the cult Steven King thriller 'IT', in which the antagonist becomes a spider. However, it was more fitting in this film because it portrayed the web of illusions caused by the witch in the film perfectly. Nevertheless, the film makes up for any drawback with the riveting vocals by the cast, the recognisable voices manage to amuse those who didn't know the cast beforehand and enjoy guessing them. ""Coraline"" continues to stay entertaining throughout and leaves you guessing. The suspense is enough to leave you at the edge of your seat! This is a must see film that displays the thrilling adventures that is synonymous with that of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and the fun of ""The nightmare before Christams""; making it a reason to take a trip to the cinema and sporting those unpleasant 3D glasses."

","I ran out and bought this movie yesterday, first day that it was released on DVD. I watched in theaters and was kind of blown away by it. So I went out and bought it and watched it one and half times yesterday. So here it is, my movie of the day critique of Coraline. Directed by Henry Selick the very same director of the acclaimed, ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" I just knew it was going to be a real treat to watch. Fully comprised of stop-motion animation, and is the longest such movie yet. From the very first scene I just knew it was going to be a real gem. The animation is really creative and is really mind blowing, to think that each scene is handmade. I only have a few flaws and they're just personal pet peeves. I just thought that Coraline's character was a little snooty. But she's suppose to be that way, by no means is she a ""James"" or a ""Jack"". But that's all I really have as a negative comment. The music really did blow me away, a mystical and whimsical operatic tone. It really fit with the style of the movie. Coraline was colorful, beautiful, dark, and scary. I thought Dakota Fanning did a stupendous job playing Coraline, as she starts out a ungrateful, mean, rude, snooty little girl. Then develops into a more enjoyable character, risking her own mortality to save her family. And Terri Hatcher's portrayal of Coraline's ""Other Mother"" was really really great. Eerie in the beginning, and freighting towards the end. I cannot ramble on enough on what great directing, and acting was in this film. It really was a treat to watch, and a feast for the eyes at the same time. This film is really gorgeous and beautiful. And about as unique and can be, it's really original. I can't think of any movies that this story reminds me of. I loved the characters, all of them. I just thought it was really imaginative, and transports you to another world of magic, imagination, adventure and fantasy."

","Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) feels that she isn't living the happy family life she should be with her parents (Teri Hatcher & John Hodgman). The family has just moved to a new area against Coralines wishes, the parents are all caught up in their work and there's not much to do for Coraline in the new, alien and secluded surroundings she's put in. She feels unappreciated by her parents â€“ and she's more than delighted when she finds a secret door inside the house which leads to a different kind of reality where all her wishes seem to come true... Then the buttons come into the picture and everything goes haywire - you'll understand when you watch the film.<br/><br/>Coraline's (2009) a stop-motion animation (with some CGI-thrown into the mix) and it looks amazing. The characters and the sets are well designed and brought to life with a great attention to detail. The characters are well animated and the voice work for each and every one of them is just right. Especially Dakota Fanning as the titular Coraline deserves extra praise â€“ if she hadn't done a great job the whole film would have fallen flat along with her performance. Luckily for the film she's great in the role. What I also really liked about the characters was that even though how bizarre or ""over the top"" they were, or regardless how few minutes of screen time for some of them was given â€“ they all seemed to have something more than just the first and the most obvious ""layer"" in them, something going on ""behind the scenes"". It brought that much more life into them and into the story itself.<br/><br/>The film's look is very much alike with the one of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) â€“ and it's no wonder, the films share the same director: Henry Selick. The design is very Gothic- and dream-like and looks spooky and amazing at the same time. Along with some creepy design, the story isn't all kid-friendly either. There's nothing scary in it but in some of the scenes the tension does build up a bit.<br/><br/>The storytelling get's into motion a bit too slowly and it get's overwhelmed at first by the amazing visual look. But still, Coraline (2009) has a great story to tell and the whole film is a fine example of a ""family movie"" anyone can enjoy. 3/4"
"ahrawls","10","2","4","3 March 2009"," An Artistic Masterpiece
","I've been aware of Stop-Motion for a while now and never had any real opinion about it. Well, not anymore. I saw ""Coraline"" in theaters on opening day and I must say beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is a rare gem of a movie. I would equate to it being the equivalent of a breath of fresh air. A complete and utter far cry from the standard formula of Hollywood. This is one of those movies were you could watch it 10-20 times and you'll still catch/see/notice something new. There's just so much to take in be it the narrative, visuals, etc. Not only that but it did something I thought was impossible, it proved that 3D could be used as a story telling medium. ""Coraline"" is proof that 3D can used beyond the usual ""Let's see how many times I can poke your eye out"" gimmick. Personally, I'd say ""Coraline"" does to 3D movies what ""Toy Story"" did for CG movies. I wouldn't be surprised if an article comes out announcing how it has revolutionized 3D and Stop-Motion alike. I've seen most purely Stop-Motion flicks and ""Coraline"" out does every single one of them. The bar for stop-motion has been raised in virtually every way. <br/><br/>The story is indeed predictable, but is more than made up for by the sheer uniqueness of how it's told. I will admit that the pace of the story is rather slow and deliberate. Thankfully it is done within the context of the events driving the movie forward and ends up feeling very natural. Roughly speaking, the pacing seemed to characteristically follow through the motions of title character ""Coraline,"" in short, the pacing became a subtle embodiment of her actions and situational difficulties (hard to accurately describe, very very subtle). A very interesting touch to be sure. I found myself liking the characters a lot, even if at times they can be a bit strange (read: over-the-top). <br/><br/>I really am not kidding when I say that ""Coraline"" has more imagination in it's 'toenail' than most movies do in their whole running time. It's hard to explain but there is so much that the 3D aspect of ""Coraline"" adds to every conceivable thing related to atmosphere, story, mood, characters and so on. This is the first 3D movie I've seen that made me forget that I was even wearing the glasses. Most of the time ""Coraline"" seems to forget that it's a 3D film at all; and benefits all the more because of it. It completely sucked me in on all fronts.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but to put it simply, any and everybody who appreciates Cinema in any way, especially as an artistic medium, owes it to themselves to watch ""Coraline."" Everything from the characters to the story and beyond is top-notch. Done very differently, but above and beyond nonetheless. One last thing, anyone who ever wondered what the proper dosage of dark, moody, even macabre elements in a family film can point to ""Coraline"" and say ""pretty much that."" Proof that blood and violence isn't needed to make one's heart beat fast. Weird thing is, ""Coraline"" leans more toward a lighter tone than not. Like ""Return of the Sith"" (Star Wars+PG-13= shock and worry) and the ""Incredibles"" (Pixar+PG=overreacting)this is one of those movies were a parent can easily freak out. In this case, issues involving the horror aspect. I stated my case above and meant every word. Note that this is coming from a man who has one. Weird thing is...<br/><br/>When a large group of kids are jumping around after the movie asking to watch it again AND other positive lines, you know something big has gone down. A gift of imagination and visual story telling. Watch it, you'll never see another movie like this for another 5-10 years.<br/><br/>To any worrying parents, there is a scene were a large lady is singing on a stage wearing a very very questionable bikini. The scene is there for laughs and is more in the context of ""The Birth of Venus"" by Botticelli than anything else. Still, if you're still iffy just know this; when Coraline utters the line ""she's practically naked,"" the questionable outfit lady will show up in roughly 20 seconds. If it's too much, I would recommend having any infants with you simply close there eyes. After about a minute she is gone and will never return. There's no need to go farther than that."

","Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a young girl with less-than-perfect parents. Her mother (Teri Hatcher) and dad are work-from-home writers trying to put out a gardening catalog, giving very little attention to their pre-teen daughter. Dad does the cooking but meals are less than optimal, also, as shopping sometimes gets rushed or overlooked. Then, too, they have moved their household to a fabulous old Victorian mansion in the sticks and Coraline misses her friends and former city abode very much. One day, her parents, working feverishly on their catalog, encourage, er, demand that Coraline explore her new house, for it has many rooms, nooks, and crannies. Finding a secret door, Coraline is perplexed to discover that the wall behind the door is bricked up. Yet, at night, a mouse draws her to the doorway and, lo and behold, a secret entrance has appeared like magic. Crawling through a tunnel, Coraline finds herself in an alternate world, where her new mother and father shower her with terrific meals and fun things to do. But, strangely, both of them, while looking like their real world counterparts in most ways, sport ""button"" eyes. Since Coraline finds a mysterious doll in her room, who likewise has buttons for eyes and Coraline's features, this is a mystery. But, because her second set of parents are so doting, Coraline can't wait to get back to their world the next night, even though she receives warnings from the neighboring ladies, a young country boy, and the eccentric Russian man who lives upstairs. Is this really a perfect world that Coraline has entered? Not on your life! This is a great film with absolutely stunning visuals, enhanced by 3-D glasses, if you are so fortunate to see such a showing. It would be difficult, indeed, to find a more colorful or imaginative animated film in all of cinema. Most viewers will be oohing and aahing at every turn. The story, too, is strong, interesting, and, even a bit scary for the preschool crowd, without someone's hand to hold. All of the actors voicing their parts, from Fanning to Hatcher to Ian McShane as the Russian man, are very fine, also. In short, Coraline is a terrific film for virtually everyone, young and old, following in the footsteps of such movies as Fantasia or The Nightmare Before Christmas. It is well worth the effort to bundle up the family and march on over to the nearest theater, for it is a ""big"" screen film in the scope of its breathtaking animation and it will generate contended sighs all around."

","I really believe that the basic story of Coraline has the capacity to be an absolutely terrifying parable but neither the original novella nor this movie really tap into that. I'm not trying to sound like some tough guy, I still can't quite watch Dumbo alone. (There's no accounting for terror).<br/><br/>But nevertheless there's lots to like into more professional rendition of a modern folk tale that eventually becomes are blockbuster style story. Ornately gothic and stylish as we move from the humdrum world of a neglected girl into a world of make believe realized. Festive and funny and then deliciously sinister in that fairytale way.<br/><br/>More worthy of the legacy of Tim Burton's movies than any actual Burton movie since Corpse Bride, the humour, imagination, chills and thrills make this something I should imagine the parents will enjoy AT LEAST as much as the younger people.<br/><br/>Coraline herself makes for a charming heroine, though she may be taciturn, it's for understandable reasons and it is very satisfying to see her journey of self discovery in this case of be-careful-what-you-wish-for but which, subtly, is ultimately a story of a little girl that just wanted some parental attention.<br/><br/>Always atmospheric and pacy, expect none of the sanctimoniousness or portentousness of the book."

","When a child's parents doesn't pay enough attention to a child, they're bound to make up imaginary friends. These imaginary friends will also have a perfect world - escapism for the child, and a world he secretly longs for. This is the main premise of 'Coraline'.<br/><br/>While there's much to love about the film - like the stunning animation - there's also some issues. What is the target audience? Children will love the animation and the cute little girl in the lead, and the cat (although the cat is a horrible looking thing!), but will they understand what the film is all about? Adults might understand the premise better, but will they relate to the characters as children would?<br/><br/>This animated film has a very dark theme, with evil lurking around every corner. Some scenes might even give very young kids nightmares. Parts of the film reminded me of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. I must be honest, though, towards the end I found it difficult to understand what was actually going on. The film became very weird. After encountering ghosts of previous child victims, Coraline is given an adder stone - similar to 'Ouija' - to find their real eyes (now having buttons for eyes). Ghosts, witchery, evil spells, luring children - these are all themes not really suited for a young audience.<br/><br/>'Coraline' certainly is magical and mystical, and the animation is beautiful.

","I'm a Neil Gaiman fan when it comes to his novels and comic book work, though I admit I've come across a miss or two among his hits. I never read 'Coraline', so I don't know how to compare it to the movie as others have done on this board. Be that as it may, I thought it was a pretty clever story utilizing the alternate reality the main character discovered by crawling through the tunnel behind the brick wall. It reminded me a little of 'Alice in Wonderland' where she met up with all the weird inhabitants of that fairy tale land. This film is a bit on the dark and scary side I would think for real young kids, with Gothic elements exhibited by the characters both 'human' and 'animal'. There was a point in the story when I thought it was all over, but the final denouement was still to come with the defeat of Other Mother. As animated films go, this one was original and creative with a compelling message of not accepting things at face value until you've taken the time to understand what's behind the facade. For that, Coraline had a pretty good head on her shoulders."

","20 February 2009. It's hard to separate out the visceral magic of 3-D from the amazing experience of stop-action animation in ""Coraline."" How much of a hyperjump in ratings, 3-D goes in upping the razzle-dazzle factor is difficult to judge. ""Coraline"" is an intense, emotionally raw balancing mood piece that belies the happy-thriller-horror animated world that ""Coraline"" as a young girl gets to experience as well as the audience. The animation is superb and the script and scenes are well suited to the 3-D experience without having to exaggerate and distort the special effects. The special visual experience seem to exude and evolve naturally out of the movie's plot and structure itself. The characters are weird and strange but at the same time personal and oddly familiar. ""Coraline"" like ""Spirited Away"" (2001) brings the world of rich fantasy into the movie theater in a captivating and compelling way. Yet, when all the special ""Chicago"" Richard Gere razzle dazzle is torn away along with a wonderful musical score, what is left is a more basic, simple version of the ignored young girl who looks for her fantasy dream elsewhere and lurking underneath is a more mundane, almost plodding movie experience. It would have been interesting to see more of a conflicted ""other"" mother in the climatic scene to really provide an intense interactive, memorable scene as well as parents who seem a little more sympathetic and real to offer a bit of authenticity. It is only with the fusion of the 3-D and the natural fit that the story is brought into an amazing living experience that delights. 8/10."

","Henry Selick's animated rendition of Neil Gaiman's novel spins the tale of a young girl who finds a 'better' version of her own world after passing through a mysterious passageway in the wall of her new home but, as the posters warn ""Be careful what you wish for"". The stop-action animation is excellent and the figures (especially Coraline), though not realist depictions of people, have tremendous personality and appeal. The open scene, the methodical deconstruction of one of the mysterious dolls that populate the story, is creepy almost to the point of disturbing. Danny Elfman's score is perfect for the film and the voice talent, especially Dakota Fanning's Coraline, is great. One of my favorite of the 'new wave' of animated films, along with Selick's equally striking ""The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). All in all: a fun, if slightly unsettling, 'late night in a dark room' movie."

","This movie shows reality and an alternate reality. When Coraline Jones voiced by Dakota Fanning, moves, her parents seem preoccupied and she is left to explore her new house. Since she is so bored with everything she wanders off and meets Wybie, who leaves a doll that looks exactly like her with her mother. and finds a brick door and enters it.. On the other side of the door, she finds her ""other mother"" voiced by Teri Hatcher, who looks just like her real mother. This alternate reality is more exciting and the ""other parents"" seem to be attentive to her and she likes the attention. She keeps going back and forth between both realities and begins to notice changes in the other mother.
The lighting fluctuates between drab and illuminating depending on which reality she has entered. The music is also the same way. It is dark at times and then it becomes happy. This is due to the dark overtone of the movie. It reminds me of the movie A Nightmare Before Christmas, which is also directed by Henry Selick. He is a great writer/director."

","Coraline follows a little girl who, after moving into a new house, realizes how boring her life is. She eventually discovers a secret door that leads her to an alternate dimension where everything is better, yet as she goes there more and more she begins to receive warnings against the place. <br/><br/>This was one of those movies where I hit the thirty minute mark and had basically solidified a 10/10. <br/><br/>To start the visuals are great. This is a clay-mation movie though, so it's kind of expected, but there were still loads of great big visual spectacles scattered throughout. Not only that, but every character design is great. From Coraline herself to Wybie to Beldam (especially Beldam), everyone looks fantastic. <br/><br/>The plot is, while not horribly original, presented in the best way. It's complemented by interesting and fun characters who lead it along, one of whom is a little girl who is actually smarter than most of the grown women we see in other horror movies these days, yet she's not so smart that she's unrealistic.<br/><br/>The movie actually isn't all that scary, but instead takes it's time in building up the characters and conflict until the climax where I felt more tension than I did fear. Sure, I figured I knew the ending considering it's supposed to be a kid's movie, but that didn't stop me from getting invested. It was scary more through subtlety and knowing things that maybe the characters didn't, or not knowing things that the characters also didn't. The main villain, however, was very intimidating and creepy especially towards the end. Surprisingly, the opening sequence also managed to be pretty unsettling. <br/><br/>I was surprised to find that the soundtrack was actually really good. It fit the movie really well and I just liked how it sounded. I've listened to it outside of the movie and still really like it. <br/><br/>Overall Coraline was fantastic. Everything about this movie is exceptional, so I really don't see any reason why I'd give it anything less than a 10/10.

A dark, gritty plot, superb animation, excellent voice casting and a strong message are some of the things that make 'Coraline' a must for any child who enjoys a good scare and a guaranteed good time for adults and teenagers. If I hadn't been practically traumatised at 7 years old by it, this would probably be one of, if not my favourite animated movies. It's one of those movies that you feel compelled to call a masterpiece."
"Seraphion","7","0","0","28 August 2015"," A serious presentation in an animation
","The movie may look like it's solely aimed at kids audience with it being animated and the story base is centered on an adolescent girl, but it sure hides a very serious presentation of the story developments. Despite having so much fantasy themed developments here and there but the movie nicely incorporates significant mood and tonal changes in the mix that really charged things up as one watches this movie. The characters nicely developed in their own unique final product that adds so much nuances to the movie and enriching the story as a whole. The overall coloration really supports the whole story, and also the contrasted coloration choice in the 'other' world. I really like how the movie presented moments that might resemble horror movies' jump scares. The voice acting is nicely well. Dakota Fanning did enough in giving life to her role. Teri Hatcher really did well in livening the two opposite characters she voiced."
"bowmanblue","9","0","0","16 February 2015"," Brilliantly creepy
","First of all I will start by saying that I absolutely loved 'Coraline.' It has a fantastic look and feel to it and, despite being (amazingly crafted) 'stop motion' puppets, contains more depth and storytelling than many 'live action' films. And, if you're in the UK at least, you'll see that it has a PG (parental guidance) certificate. That translates to most people that it's suitable for kids. Or is it? The answer is of course 'yes,' otherwise it wouldn't have got that rating. However, it's worth noting that the general 'themes' are pretty dark in this movie, meaning that parents who have children who aren't really into anything too heavy may want to research this film a little deeper before deciding on whether their children should watch it or not.<br/><br/>Many people have â€“ pretty rightly â€“ said that it's like something directed by (typically Gothic) Tim Burton and seeing as Coraline also utilises puppets compares it to 'A Nightmare Before Christmas.' The two certainly do share a lot of similar traits, namely the dark creepy atmosphere and pretty frightening overall feel.<br/><br/>In Coraline, the titular character is a young eleven year old girl who moves to an old (spooky!) house in the middle of nowhere with her parents. Now, although her mum and dad aren't the worst people in the world, they're pretty busy with their jobs (aren't we all?) and don't always have as much time for their daughter as they would probably like. This, in turn, leaves Coraline to her own devices. And, while exploring her new home, she comes across a door to another world â€“ one where everything is the same, only better. She has a perfect house, populated by different (i.e. perfect) versions of her parents who love and dote on her. Or do they? Naturally, as the story progresses Coraline discovers the old saying 'Better the devil you know,' because things in this 'other world' are certainly not all they seem (and I'm not just talking about the fact that everyone there has buttons for their eyes!).<br/><br/>I won't do into too much detail regarding the plot, as I wouldn't want to spoil it. I will only say that the look and feel of the film is perfect, as is the acting and storytelling, making it pretty much as perfect as it can get. Also, just because the film is rated a PG, don't think that adults won't enjoy it. I often wonder whether if you were to remake Coraline with real actors as opposed to puppets, it might actually get a 15 or 18 rating, as the story would end up being something more like 'The Ring, The Grudge,' or 'Dark Water' in its theme and tone.<br/><br/>So, if you like your horror films, don't write this one off as just another 'kids' movie' â€“ it's so much more. But, as I said to begin with, if you're thinking of watching it with very little children, check what's in store for them before you let them watch it. This may be stop motion, but it's nothing like anything the much-loved Aardman studios have ever done!"

","Fantastic fantasy, just that we have had such journeys in cinema long while ago.<br/><br/>From an Alice in Wonderland to many fairy tales, we have seen a girl jump into a fantasy world and explore it. The same happens with CORALINE, just that she says people as how she wants them to be. Having said that, this is by no measure bad cinema ad in fact it's interesting too. Just we need to be patient.<br/><br/>The whole animation is done like the ones we used to see in our childhood and those were puppets used in stop-motion cinema, so we have wooden made faces here and not the standard animation. Well, the design and the look is not so appealing or to say the least gorgeous as it is old fashioned. Yet, a few aficionados of those good old times may like this.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good and at times is just awesome in terms of the way we are revealed those things what Coraline sees in her adventure. The costumes too are well suited too, to make it look a but creepy and something that we are certainly willing to know. Above all, acting and the concept is one thing that ail make it a watch, if all else is something that we are not much interested in. Dialogues are just there as if we speak lines naturally and at times out of place too, so much praise to writing here.<br/><br/>So that's mostly about it, a good animated film that is not a must watch but not a must miss either.

","Coraline is the warped, horrific yet beautiful story of a preteen girl taking on a soul-stealing entity known as the Beldam, which is residing within an alternate version of her new neighborhood. Coraline Joes, former Michigan resident, has moved into a rundown housing complex with her dull and at times neglectful parents. She immediately hates the place; her only joy comes from planning on planting a nice garden in the yard. She meets a strange geek dressed in a trench coat named Wybie (somehow he also got a motorcycle, no idea how at his age). She is creeped out by him and spends much of the film avoiding him.<br/><br/>Coraline starts having strange dreams at night about a surreal, alternate world where everything is seemingly perfect. Her parents in this new world are joyful and adventurous, Wybie is more of a shy mute than a nerdy loser... the one thing she notes that is rather odd is that in this world, everybody has buttons for eyes. Meanwhile, in reality, she has a boring school, uniforms included, to look forward to. Her new neighbors are a pair of aging actresses, both rather senile, and an eccentric former Chernobyl liquidator named Bobinsky. One day she decides to visit the alternate world where she is happier, and is told she can live there forever, on one condition... she has to have her eyes replaced with buttons. At this point the film takes a definite turn for the freaky, when Coraline's parents go missing, she meets a trio of kidnapped ghost children, and the alternate version of Wybie is murdered by the Beldam.<br/><br/>One of the great things in Coraline is the immense amount of subtle details added in. The reason I knew Bobinsky was a Chernobyl liquidator was by the medal he is shown wearing, those medals were given out to the firefighters who went into the burning nuclear reactor, many of them getting sad and scary effects from the radiation in real-life. It was mentioned in the novel as well, so I find it very interesting that the animators who designed the character remembered that detail.<br/><br/>Rather than Coraline being a British girl with longer brown hair as in the novel and comic book adaptation, in this movie she is American, and has shorter, blue-dyed hair. She's kind of a brat sometimes but a likable character. I normally hate Dakota Fanning's work; I think she is an overused, not very talented actress, but Coraline is the one exception. It's hard not to like any of the characters in the film, except for the Beldam. Both Coraline and Wybie are sort of misfits, and while Coraline's parents certainly aren't abusive they are often very oblivious, neglectful and very flat in terms of personality. Although Coraline is a film for children, I think anyone can enjoy it, no matter what their age is.<br/><br/>With trashy and pathetic films like The Hunger Games coming out these days, it's nice to know that there are original films like Coraline out there. I've heard some people say that Coraline is a rip-off of Alice in Wonderland, but I don't think so; Coraline is in a class all its own. I also recommend the novels ""The Lovely Bones"" and ""No Place for Eco-Sinners"", and the movie Paperhouse (1988), if you're a fan of Coraline."

","We all know the feeling we had when we were kids: our parents are lousy; if we had another set, they'd love us cos we're just so precious.<br/><br/>Well, this isn't exactly like that, but the premise is similar. Coraline feels neglected by her parents, that they don't make time for her or listen to her, or give her what she wants. She crawls into an alternate universe where her Other parents treat her the way she thinks she should be - food she likes, clothes she likes, all the time and attention in the world.<br/><br/>But as in all fairy tales (and it's a fairy tale if you think parents will just give you everything you want), there is a caveat. They aren't really the good ""Other"" parents; there is a catch that I'll let you find out for yourself. It's both fun and disgusting at the same time.<br/><br/>In the end of course, she finds out she really treasures her own real parents after all, warts and all. The process of finding that out, and a subplot of helping the other ghost children trapped there, is a visual and storytelling treat.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this. I only wished I had caught the 3D version when it was out in the theatres - I had to watch this 2D and I had the nagging feeling I missed a 3d visual feast."

","I don't like child movies, you know like Disney movies or any other kind of animated movie; however I've just watched a few times this film and I really like it. Of course this movie is above regular animated films, it has a truly deep message for children, the movie has also a unique style and definitely worths to be watched.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is really good, because while other movies show that parents have to understand the bad behavior of their children because they can't spend time with them, this movie actually shows that children also have to understand their parents and that the reason why the work really hard is because they want to give a better life for them.<br/><br/>Well, another thing that is really good about this movie is that its style is unique. The story was directed by Henry Selick, the same director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Those movies were really good with a mix of horror, comedy and fantasy. What I like about this movie is the creepy style and of course the stop-motion which is for me a million times better than CGI.<br/><br/>Definitely this movie worths being watched, when my sister watched it for the very first time it was funny that she was kind of surprised at the beginning. YOu get to like everything about this movie, especially every scene and all the characters that have been well designed and of course the script is amazing. Based on the story of Neil Gaiman. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is truly amazing and if you haven't seen it you must watch, you won't regret it. Its unique style make it so attractive and also it has a really positive message."

","I've heard of this film for a long while, but never had interest in watching. Only yesterday, with nothing else to do, I ended up seeing this story about Coraline, a young girl who feels ignored by her parents and enters a new world where apparently everything is perfect, the way she would like her world to be. <br/><br/>But appearances can deceive...<br/><br/>'Coraline' is far darker than your usual animated film. There is the distinct feel of a Tim Burton story and that is no coincidence: while he himself had nothing to do with this film, Henry Selick, who worked with him in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach', is the one behind 'Coraline'.<br/><br/>Unlike those two films, though, 'Coraline' actually managed to captivate me to an extent. The animation is faultless, and the story is deceptively dark yet charming. There is a good diversity of characters who are mostly very well thought-out, even if they tend to get too goofy once in a while (plus the rather pointless inclusion of Wybie, who does little for the film).<br/><br/>Most children will not understand, or even notice, some of the darker implications the plot contains; meaning it can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike."
"FlamingHobo","8","0","0","29 July 2013"," Coraline is a joy to watch.
","So for a long time I've been fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, as well as other Tim Burton productions such as: Sweeney Todd; Edward Scissorhands; Corpse Bride and the like. So when I saw the trailer for Coraline I instantly thought that this was another Tim Burton film, but too my surprise it was not, I was half right though. Coraline is directed by Henry Selick, who also directed The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as James and the Giant Peach (1996). I liked the look and feel of the trailer, and soon enough went to check it out.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying, this film is truly a gem of film making. The visual style of stop-motion animation, as well as the musical score, make Coraline a film that definitely qualifies under the ""Films are art"" category. The imagination that went behind the script is ever present in the film, and is brilliantly shot. I don't mean to sound as though this is the greatest film ever, because it isn't. What it is however, is one of the best films that I have seen and quite possibly, one of the best you'll see.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Coraline and her family moving in to a new apartment which is named, ""Pink Palace Apartments"", if you hadn't guessed already the apartments are all painted pink. After the movers and their van drive away, we are introduced to Coraline, she uses a stick she has ripped off from a nearby Oak bush to find water or a well. The contrast between the bleak grey of the surrounding world, and the brightness of Coraline's yellow jacket and bright blue hair sets the tone of the movie very well, as well as the accompanying music. Whilst she is searching for a source of water, she is stalked by a black cat, who she then meets again at the well. The cat however, is not alone, we are then introduced to the character Wybie. After the two have met, Wybie reveals the well to Coraline and to her surprise she was standing on it all along! He also explains to her, that the stick she was using to guide her to the well was made of poison oak, before being called away by his Grandmother.<br/><br/>After this Coraline returns inside and here we get the first look at her parents, who are dull, job-obsessed and downright boring. Coraline attempts to get permission to go outside in the rain, her mother denies and so she ventures upstairs to her father and asks the same question... only to get the same response. Her father then tells her to go around the house noting down all the squeaky doors and leaky windows that are in the 150 year old house, she does this with a due sense of dread and boredom. Eventually, she discovers what seems to be a passage way in the wall, to her dismay it's locked. She calls for her mother to open it only to find a brick wall, after having dinner she heads to bed. This is where the film truly starts, and Coraline ventures into the ""Other World"" with the ""Other"" characters.<br/><br/>The performances from most of the characters are very strong, but I found that the dialogue some of them were given was a bit weak and clichÃ©. With that said, the voice actors do a very good job of keeping you immersed and not one seems out of place that ruins the atmosphere. Also I found that the cast was fairly unknown to me, which helps the film to keep its atmosphere. When you hear a character speak, you don't think: ""Hey, that's FlamingHobo!"" Instead you think what any good director wants you to think. The characters are themselves, not actors. Oh, and for you Mass Effect fans, you'll hear from Captain Anderson in the film, but I won't spoil it for you just what part he plays in the film.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is spot on, even if you have seen this similar art style from Selick's previous film The Nightmare Before Christmas. Coraline does not copy The Nightmare Before Christmas's art style completely, Selick has done enough to give Coraline a life of its own, which in-turn makes it beautiful to look at. This also keeps the credibility of the film intact, as I could not imagine this film in any other form, if we were to swap the puppets with the actors in their bodily forms... the film just would not be the same and some of the magic would be lost with a move like that. The contrast between the brightness/darkness of the world between the brightness/darkness of the characters is ever present and keeps the film look fresh, scene to scene.<br/><br/>The music is used to good effect, though it is not quite memorable, save for the opening and closing music. The score of any film such as Coraline, is one of the many keys needed to keep your audience interested and locked into the film. Bruno Coulais has done an admirable job at creating a fantasy music set that keeps the mood of the film just right.<br/><br/>This film isn't really for very young children as it may suggest, the dark scenes may frighten them so if you're a parent who would be wanting to show this to your younger children, I would recommend watching it with them. Coraline is a gem of film making, and genuinely beautiful to look at. Though the story may have been done a thousand times over, Coraline does enough to justify itself as unique and interesting. I definitely recommend that you see this film."

I enjoyed both as two different stories. The book, despite being slow, kept me wondering about what will happen next without falling asleep. The movie, on the other hand, still has Gaiman's Coraline, but has its own colours, and there were nothing left unexplained.<br/><br/>I'm not going to babble about the detail of the story, but I might be babbling about some other movies for comparison, so please excuse me. Well, here's the thing, the reason why a movie could ruin the story is that too many scenes from the book were deleted and left unexplained, I mean, someone who haven't read the book can't actually enjoy it as it has holes from the original story. It's a trick, I suppose, so that the viewers want to read the book, but it could be backfired as well. People, who are disappointed with the movie might become unwilling to read the book, I'm one of those people.<br/><br/>And then, here we have Coraline. I think everyone can enjoy it without ever having or willing to read the book the story based on. The plot was flawless and neat, even additional characters didn't look like sticker, everything blended in nicely and seamlessly that you might forgot that it was based on Gaiman's book.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a really nice movie.

While Tim Burton is making movies like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"", Neil Gaiman is write novels such as ""Coraline"" and ""The Graveyard Book"". This is not a better person to bring this story to life than Tim Burton collaborator, Henry Selick. Coraline Jones is a young girl who feels neglected by her parents and doesn't want much to do with her neighbors Miss Spink, Miss Forcible, Mr. Bobinsky, and her new friend Wybie. While exploring her new house, she escapes to a strangely sinister, yet perfect world. She finds better parents, better food, and a better home. The only strange thing is: everyone has buttons for eyes. The more she spends time there, the more she realizes that it is not what she wanted. In this spooky tale, you will find great lessons of thankfulness and appreciation. However, it is not a movie you will want to be showing to sensitive or easily frightened children, as it is creepy and filled with abnormal images.

","It was just yesterday when no one would've imagined an animation studio going toe-to-toe with the reigning heavyweight champion known as Pixar, but the creative minds at Laika studios have done just that. Coraline, which arrived on DVD and Blu-ray this past July, is a work of art from top to bottom. It's a real shame that it's taken me so long to sit down and review the film, but, at long last, I was able to devote an afternoon to taking in what can only be described as a truly exquisite feature.<br/><br/>The story follows a young girl by the name ofâ€”you guessed itâ€”Coraline. She's just moved from Michigan to Oregon, and isn't at all happy about having left her friends and the life she knew. This should sound instantly familiar to most moviegoers, as being displaced from a familiar locale is often used as a catalyst for unrest by many writers (it's the whole ""fish out of water"" mechanism). What's especially relevant about Coraline's situation, however, is that she comes from the Motor City; her family has been forced to move because of the economy, and that's something many people can relate to. Symbolism is pops up in more tangible forms too; namely in the form of Wybie Lovat (""Wybie"" is short for ""Whyborn,"" which aptly accentuates the disconnect Coraline feels from her parents, who are constantly working in an effort to pay the bills).<br/><br/>What makes Coraline so effective, though, is its perception of a child's imagination. As Coraline explores her early 20th century apartment home, she takes pleasure in the rusty water heater, the leaky windows, and an inexplicably small door cut into the living room wall. Beyond this door is a world that caters to all of Coraline's desires, and she discovers this through a series of ""dreams."" In this ""bizarro world"" she encounters her ""other"" family, who have buttons for eyes and pay her all of the attention she could ever want. The design of this colorful playground is reminiscent of a Disney/Burton hybrid: it's at once startlingly beautiful, but warped (and borderline Gothic) in its undertones. As the illusion of the ""other"" world existing only as a dream is dissolved, Coraline quickly becomes immersed in a very dangerous situation. In fact, I could easily see this freaking out very young viewers. It's rated PG, but there are times when the creepiness abounds and the proceedings approach horror film territory.<br/><br/>But let me return to the beauty of the animation. For the most part it's extremely fluid, and rarely does the realization that it's all stop-motion result in a distraction. One of the best ways to describe much of the art design is to imagine a Van Gogh painting (and, toward the film's conclusion, the echoes of The Starry Night are impossible to ignore). The smooth animation combined with the stark contrast between the gray ""real"" world and the colorful ""other"" world is mesmerizing, and I can't see a youngsterâ€”or an adult, for that matterâ€”being able to look away. I watched it as a 2D Blu-ray, although it did give me the option for 3D. From one of the very beginning, in fact, it's clear that this was a movie made for 3D: a sewing needle remains motionless in front of the camera for a good 3-4 seconds, suggesting that an ""in-your-face"" effect was the intent. This, combined with a relatively tidy conclusion, dampens what would be an otherwise unforgettable film.<br/><br/>Still, it's more than worth your time, especially if you have children. Sit back, relax, and marvel in the beauty of what director Henry Selick has created. Just don't be surprised if said child wants to sleep with the light on afterward (you know, just in case)."

","Coraline is a dark horror fantasy stop motion 3D animation that just sticks out in your mind as one creepy movie. It stalls you and keeps you in the dark as you try to decipher where the terror will be coming from, and when it does arrive, you find yourself wishing this is one of those films that the good guy wins, although there are numerous of them this just got to be one.<br/><br/>Coraline doesn't strike me as a film for children although it does carry a message of how you should be thankful of what you have, the grass may look greener on the other side but there may be a high price to pay to get there and stay there.<br/><br/>Coraline is based on a book of the same name by British author Neil Gaiman (who also wrote the novel Stardust that was to a film adapted of the same name in 2007), it was published in 2002 winning the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. It was later adapted by Henry Selick (he was also the director of the 1993 The Nightmare Before Christmas) into this movie that we are going to talk about.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about a girl named Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) who she her parents moved into an old house that has been subdivided into flats. The other tenants were Miss Spink and Miss Forcible two elderly stage actors and Mr. Bobinski, who is training a mouse circus.<br/><br/>One rainy day she discovers a locked door in her room, which has been bricked up, strangely as she goes to visit her neighbors, Mr. Bobinsky delivers a message to her telling her not to go through the door.<br/><br/>But Coraline ignores the warnings and goes through the door which leads her to a parallel version of her house where she meets her other mother and other father, who were better and treated her better than her real mother and father, the difference was the people in the other world have buttons for eyes.<br/><br/>Coraline was well received by critics and did averagely well in the box office, although the game version of the film received very poor ratings. Henry Selick will be making another Neil Gaiman book adaptation named The Graveyard Book, who knows maybe the movie will also be a stop motion animation.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","Getting to know the characters and how they contribute to the story is a good place to start but only selected characters. The movie begins with the making of a Coraline doll with which only the hands of the maker can be seen. Now this scene already tells us that something is not right and this is perhaps because of the fact that the hands we see has needles for fingers making us think that this must be some kind of robot or a machine or something. The sharpness already gives a sign that this character cannot be trusted. The parent characters in this movie portray actual parents in which most viewers can relate to. Both parents work, they are both writers and are pretty much full-on with their career on making catalogs but what they write about is merely something that would sell and pay the bills, meaning they don't really do what they say, ""I can't believe it. You and dad get paid to write about plants, and you hate dirt"". This is quite typical for anyone who gives advice but I'll be heading off to a tangent here if I elaborate on that subject. For the most part of the movie, the parents appear to be disagreeable because of how we see them interact with their daughter, Coraline. They do not see eye-to-eye and they do not take her too seriously, pretty much because she is still a child.<br/><br/>Coraline. I almost fell down a well, yesterday, mom.<br/><br/>Mom. Uh-huh.<br/><br/>Coraline. I would've died.<br/><br/>Mom. That's nice.<br/><br/>The dad is seems to be more approachable. But as the story goes on, we begin to change our view of them wherein the mom decides to hide the key of the little door to keep her from harm. We somehow agree with the real mom here because of the belief of her having what we call ""Mothers' Intuition"", which is almost always correct. The mother character shows that even if she is a workaholic, she cares for her daughter and wants to keep her safe. The father in the movie appears to be oblivious of the fact that the 'dreams' can harm her and so the dialog that talk about it does not have any contribution from him except about the monkey slippers.<br/><br/>Coraline, the most important character in the story where without her there is no story, well duh. She looks like a girl who is slightly matured but nevertheless is still young and naive. Often times in the movie she has had the chance of actually knowing that the other world is not so perfect, too perfect to be real. In her first meeting with the other mother and the other father she's surprised by their button eyes. But since she is still young and naive, she is more likely to believe that what she sees is heavenly and so even though she has her doubts, which we can see when the words appear on the cake, she gets distracted and forgets about it. It is only when they offer to have her stay forever that she starts to see things a bit more clearly. She is reluctant of the exchange, buttons for eyes and pain for a 'perfect world' and the thought leaving the real world for good is enough to serve as a wakeup call. Or it's just the disappointment when she was still in the other world after waking up from trying to sleep on the bad news hoping be in her real bed when opens her eyes, ""Mom! Dad! Â…. Oh, God. I'm still here?"". From beginning to end she does have a will of her own and she gets stronger, more confident, and brave knowing that that is the last thing can and must be.<br/><br/>The other mother is the villain in the movie. But when Coraline first meets her, she's different but lovable because we can see that she's sweet to Coraline and shows us that she wants her to be happy. However, we are not a hundred percent persuaded by her because intuition tells us that she is hiding something, a very dark secret that prevents us to fully trust her. It is much more obvious that she isn't normal because every meal time she doesn't eat the food she cooks but leaves Coraline to stuff herself up. ""Don't leave me! Don't leave me! I'll die without you!"" This line has a double meaning. One in which is common for us. It is supposed to make Coraline feel that she's betraying someone who loves her. But what really means is that if she's gone then the other mother will literally die for not having eaten her. This makes the cat's description more plausible, ""She wants something to love, I think. Something that isn't her. Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.""<br/><br/>I love this movie and I could actually watch it over and over without getting tired of it. Normally, my interest in animated movies is limited but not for this one. The graphics are great like the manner in the scene of how the other world started to disappear, that was cool. The music score is perfect for the movie. It suits everything. The concept of the story itself is good because the message it wants to bring out is so clear by how it is presented. And it is intriguing because the cat disappears giving the impression that there's more than one way in and out the other world."

","It is impossible to avoid the Alice Through the looking glass comparison but this film does have its own direction.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, although it is a bit of an oddity.<br/><br/>The film is quite long for an animation and can be quite dark in places. I don't know if this will unsettle smaller children (although I expect as I child I would have found buttons for eyes a lot less disturbing as I do as an adult) Its Subtle colours and lack of frantic action gives it a European feel. The score is mainly gentle piano pieces and some of the sets are satisfyingly creepy.<br/><br/>This is not a Disney movie no Elton John sound track or cloy characters.

","I really enjoyed this film and time and time again i come back to watch it because it is too entertaining. The voice acting, the animation, the music and the storyline is pretty much perfect.<br/><br/>The film is set where Coraline Jones manages to find a portal or a passage to the ""other"" world where people have buttons for eyes and her fantasies come true. Selick does a great job with the telling of this story and not once do i ever lose concentration from this film because every morsel of this film is good.<br/><br/>The intricate characters like Mr. Bobinsky, Ms Spink and Ms Forcible give the film a quirky tone but also makes the story interesting and not stale if we only had one character to focus on. I also have to say that the music in the film is brilliant and the animators of the film did a remarkable job.<br/><br/>One issue i did have with the film is that there wasn't a back story to how the other world came to be but i guess i am just being fussy because the film didn't really need any extra padding.<br/><br/>So go see this film, it deserves a watch, or maybe a few watches"

","In the wake of all the recent PIXAR family-friendly, uplifting animated entertainments, this was a refreshingly welcome alternative fairy-tale of an altogether darker hue. The eponymous heroine is a commonplace teenager, uprooted from friends of her own age, struggling to have her preoccupied parents pay her much notice. Worse, she has no pets, their new house is a cold, bare, uninteresting apartment in the middle of nowhere with only quirky neighbours, like the two middle-aged sisters and a Russian acrobat, all seeking an outlet or their ""talents"" in a carnival show or circus. Only a talkative young boy and his mysterious cat offer her any outlet for her wish for recognition and adventure, until, that is the boy brings her a doll which is her own image, only with buttons for eyes and she next stumbles across a secret door which provides her with a gateway to a brighter world where her ""other"" parents have more personality and more importantly time for her too. But things get stranger and darker with every midnight visit she makes to the ""otherworld""...<br/><br/>Unlike other fairy stories, even the darker ones, this one takes frequent detours away from the narrative to introduce the supporting characters, usually in surreal situations. In this it chimes in with the unnatural but vivid world we enter in our dreams and nightmares. There are mixed-up elements present of classic stories gone by, most obviously ""Alice In Wonderland"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", the ""Narnia"" tales and others while the animation recalls the work of Terry Gilliam and artists like Salvador Dali and the darker imaginings of Van Gogh, but there's an originality at work too which is refreshing and entertaining.<br/><br/>The music too is original and sympathetic to the production and even if the story does end up at the required happy ending, it doesn't get there the most obvious way, taking in a Harry Potter type quest to get there.<br/><br/>The animation itself is excellent with many noteworthy sequences, transitions and backgrounds. Perhaps lacking a little of the wit and knowing humour of the best PIXAR films, this feature nevertheless shows that there is life in animation outside of Shrek, Toy Story et al."

","I saw clips of this film during the time of its release, and I recognised the same style of stop motion animation from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I had to see this, from director Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach). Basically Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) and her parents, mother Mel (Teri Hatcher) and father Charlie (John Hodgman), have moved from Pontiac, Michigan into a new three-apartment building in Ashland, Oregon called the Pink Palace, which is old and decaying. Also living in the building are retired actresses Misses Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Forcible (Dawn French), and eccentric Russian acrobat Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), but Coraline has left behind her best friends, and feels lonely, bored and ignored by her parents who do almost nothing but computer work. One day though while looking around, Coraline comes across a door covered up by wallpaper, and given the key she unlocks it and travels through the hidden passage, and on the other side is an alternative parallel world. In this world it seems almost exactly the same, but everything is much better in condition, and all the characters have with buttons for eyes, and of course her Other Mother and Other Father are much kinder and caring than the real world, it is like a dream world she has always wanted. Coraline goes through the hidden wall to have well made and delicious meals, have the Other Parents treat her like she wants to, and have some fun, but she can't convince her real parents that the place exists, only the building landlady's geeky grandson Wyborne 'Wybie' Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). Coraline knows that this world is not real, and soon there are signs that she is trying to be kept there by the her Other Parents, they invite her to stay and she refuses, and that is when danger comes in to play. They are trying to force her to stay so that can fulfil an evil plan, sew buttons onto her eyes, and turn her into one of them, trapping her forever. But with the help of her friend The Cat (Keith David), in between both worlds, Coraline is able to find her way out of the world, and rids herself of the key so she can never return and can feel fine about staying right where she is. The cast all suit their characters with their voices, especially Fanning as the curious and adventurous girl and Hatcher as both the good (well, regular) and bad mother, the story is full of both fun and peril in equal measure, and the both dark and colourful imagery and animation is near (a few tiny glitches) immaculate, there are some scenes possibly intense for children, but it is an animated fantasy for the whole family. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"

","I liked the character Coraline, and the film certainly is creative. Unfortunately, for me, the movie lost some punch because I could not tell if The Other World was intended to be Coraline's dreams or her reality with dangerous things in it. Since the movie is a fantasy, I don't care which. I just wish the storyteller had chosen one or the other. If the former (Coraline's dreams), then the ending is hard to swallow. If the latter (Coraline's dangerous reality), then the movie needed to be clearer about it. After all, many of her visits to the Other World started with her in bed, implying that The Other World was a dream. Did I miss something?"

","Coraline is a stop motion animated movie based off the novel by the genius author, Neil Gaiman. Directed by Henry Selick(Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach) Coraline expands the story from the original book and makes it into it's own glorious movie.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones has just moved into a new house called the Pink Palace. The house is split into three ways; the main house, the attic, and the cellar. Coraline shares the house with her strange neighbors Mr. Bobinsky who is training a group of mice for a circus, and Ms. Spink and Forcible who were once great theater stars. Coraline's parents are making a catalog for a botanical magazine and are much too busy to satisfy Coraline's boredom. She befriends a neighbor boy, Whyborn(Whybie) Lovat whose grandmother owns the Pink Palace.<br/><br/>One night Coraline is awoken from her sleep by a mouse and is lured to a mysterious tiny door in the wall of her living room. Using a button shaped key, she opens the door and goes through a tunnel to a parallel world of her own. There she meets The Other Mother who looks the same as her regular mom but with buttons for eyes. The Other Mother makes fantastic food, and shows Coraline many wonderful things. Such as an actual mice circus from the Other Bobinsky, a show by the Other Ms. Forcible and Spink, and a magnificent garden tended by her Other Father. But everything is not as it seems. Coraline soon realizes the only way to stay in that world is to let the Other Mother sew buttons into her eyes. Soon Coraline discovers the true intent of the Other Mother and the once wonderful world becomes distorted and terrifying. Coraline needs to escape from The Other Mother and get back home to her real parents. If they're even still there.<br/><br/>Coraline is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's dark and beautiful style amazes me every time. This whole thing was done by hand for many years and you can tell everyone put their heart and soul into it. The voice acting is also great. Dakota Fanning gives Coraline a spunky personality, and Teri Hatcher's voice performance made The Other Mother all the more horrifying. The rest of the cast is great as well with actors like John Hodgman, Ian McShane, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, and Keith David bringing life into their respective characters.<br/><br/>If you get the chance you should buy the 3D version. Unlike most films the 3D version was made before 3D TV's were available to the public and instead comes with regular red and blue 3D glasses. This makes the visuals feel a little weird at first but the 3D is some of the best I've seen. Overall, you owe it to yourself to watch Coraline. Either buy it from your local store or rent it from somewhere. It's an experience you will not soon forget."

","i always feel that stop motion animation is a lost art. everything now days is cgi. however, when this film came out, i thought that it would instantly bring back the art of stop motion. it didn't, but it is still an awesome movie either way. <br/><br/>this film will one day be a classic, i can already tell. but anyone who sees this movie would say that. the story is great. a girl gets board of her normal, dull life and stumbles across an alternate one. in here, literally everything is perfect: her parents aren't drags, her mother actually cooks great meals, her neighbors aren't crazy (in fact, they are the best neighbors any kid could ask for), and her ""other"" parents will let her do whatever she wants. but there's one catch. i won't spoil that for you. i think this movie is so great because it can appeal to everyone. if you don't like one thing, you love another. don't care for one character, but you can't get enough of another. the villain, the beldam (other mother), is surprisingly complex. she's also very scary. i mean, Really scary. i don't know what it is about her, but her very presence gave me nightmares for a week, and that was when she was pretending to be the perfect mother. <br/><br/>if you haven't seen this movie, check it out. you won't be disappointed."

","I was really impressed by Coraline, though I have to say I didn't expect any less from Tim Burton or Neil Gaiman. I hadn't read the book beforehand - nor had I even heard of Coraline until going to see it.<br/><br/>The animation was beautiful! Story unique and quirky. The characters amazingly eccentric and Burton-ish. I personally found Coraline a little whiny and annoying at points but I think this only makes the film better in a way - she has her own outspoken personality making her character more developed and fun. However, I do feel it is a little too scary for...I dunno...say ages 8 and under? And I'm not one to say that often - I do believe children shouldn't be pandered so much when it comes to imaginative movies.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, if you're thinking of renting this movie for your younger family members I would investigate the parent's guide and content. The protagonist is quite nightmarish (especially towards the finale) and the idea of the 'magic door' being in the house sounds fine but my 8-year old cousin was freaked out by that. I think every kid should have a bit of Burton to remember from their childhood! If you're looking for a similar film (but maybe a little more easy going) I would recommend 'The Corpse Bride' - equally fantastic and though it may not sound it, is far less scary."

Although the script is predictable, it is original and dark in the right amount, so keeps the viewer engaged. I loved the design of the garden of the alternative world, the family of neighbors in the real world, and the fight against the witch, and the decomposition of the fake world into a nothingness that is white.

"manicman84","9","0","0","22 March 2010"," outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines
","Coraline has been created as a result of cooperation between animation genius Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) and English iconic writer Neil Gaiman (the movie is based on his award-winning novella). The lovechild of these two individuals is a hypnotic stop-motion animated tale that combines old-fashioned storytelling and astonishing visuals. Selick approaches Gaiman's novella in an uncompromising way. While he adds his own elements to the story, he maintains the dark, gloomy atmosphere keeping ""horror"" overtones in the right place. As for the plot, this is basically a new version of Alice in Wonderland. It can't be regarded as a shortcoming in this intricate fantasy though: Coraline is simply too engrossing for that. The main point of the movie that can be summarized by the tagline ""be careful what you wish for"" realizes itself in a clever script being tight and well-paced with every detail relevant later in the movie. The characters are often freakishly bizarre, which fits the story perfectly and makes for some incredibly inventive scenes. The movie can be described as a triumph of imagination as Selick presents the spectacle enhanced by superb 3D effects. Selick outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines. His level of precision and overall scope are just admirable. All in all, Coraline is exceptional in its depiction of wonders that traditional stop-motion technique of animation can bring."

","This film is perfect! Perfect if you enjoy tediously boring and clichÃ©d CGI films, that is. The part where Coraline discovers a hidden door in the old house the family have just moved into (yawn) is a case in point. And the CGI direction is completely uninspired. Instead of attempting to be inventive, the director simply performs lots of 'virtual' camera zooms and boom movements.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the opening credits sequence, showing an old doll being given a complete makeover by some kind of robot. Seeing that, I thought to myself ""I like this film already!"" - oh, but what a lesson in why one should not be too hasty in ones judgements. The computer-generated images get gradually less imaginative and more amateurish with every sorry minute that the film drags on. It's like all the energy went into those opening couple of minutes.<br/><br/>I confess I didn't finish the film. I just couldn't justify to myself why I should waste any more of my life on this cynical, soulless, unimaginative CGI-by-numbers rubbish. I made it to just about half way, and only then by extracting two of my teeth with pliers to prevent my mind being numbed completely by this dirge. I maybe could have persisted with the film, but only by sticking pins in my testicles - and I decided I preferred the 'just walk away' option.<br/><br/>Take my advice. Save your testicles.

","1st watched 10/18/2009 â€“ 4 out of 10 (Dir- Henry Selick): Disturbing & creepy animated feature from the Director who brought us ""The Nightmare B4 Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" This story is about a young girl who is not happy with her current life and the lack of attention she gets. She is given a doll that looks suspiciously like her by a neighbor's grandmother and then while asleep is introduced to another world thru a hole-in-the-wall where everything is the way she'd like it to be(except everyone has buttons for eyes). She likes this other world until she's told they have to give her buttons for eyes as well, and she would prefer this not to be done to her. At this point in the story, this alternate world becomes very evil and the other world's mother is revealed to just want to possess her(which she's apparently done to many other children). This is where the story becomes out of whack and never really recovers. I think the other problem with this movie is the lack of humor. There aren't any characters that provide this, so you're treated with this crazy girl's mixed-up reality that goes haywire but nothing brings you out of it. The animation is really well done and very unique at times but the story doesn't have much of a heart. What's lost is the ""why"" behind everything. The girl really doesn't learn any real lessons and no characters are very interesting except maybe the cat that talks in the alternate world.

","What a truly spectacular CGI masterpiece. The acting is superb, the effects are dazzling and the plot/storyline is placed together sensationally.

Teri Hatcher plays Coraline's hard-working mother, as well as Other Mother and she plays the part extremely well. Teri's performance is amazing, as is the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Whilst the target audience is probably for kids under 15, the story certainly relates to adults and is enjoyable for an all-round audience.<br/><br/>The film is probably inappropriate for little kids, due to some scary and disturbing scenes, and some of the violence depicted exceeds a PG level.

","CORALINE (2009) **** (Voices of: Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn Fanning, Robert Bailey, Jr., Ian McShane, Keith David.) Excellent stop-motion animated film adaptation of Neil Gaimon's book by wunderkind filmmaker Henry Selick about a young girl named Coraline (Fanning) whose seemingly unhappiness with her family discovers a doorway into a parallel world where she finds an Other Mother and Father, and realizes the motto of 'be careful what you wish for' as a golden rule. Filled with phantasmagoric elements of fantasy not unlike ""Alice In Wonderland"" but with a slightly darker edge and spookiness but a truly remarkable display of an art form that is rarely given its props and Selick and his team of magicians create an amazingly incredible tour-de-force of painstaking artistry to behold.

She also laments just about everyone she knows in the little world around her house. One day, she discovers a tiny door hidden behind a dresser, and she crawls in, and discovers a parallel world in which her parents are nice, and treat her with unrealistic love and generosity. As she moves through this world, she has visually stunning adventures, and is given a choice to stay with in this world with these parents, or return to the more realistic parents she has.<br/><br/>I have to say, this is truly an art film, and Henry Selick a true artist who creates the most unusual and stunning scene elements, characters, and visually involving background one could ever imagine. You will love the artistry this movie is made with. The characters are warm, the images unique, and the entire experience fresh. I was not for a moment bored or uninvolved with the screen.

","If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, then ""Coraline"" delivers high praise to quite a few books and stories. However, the imitation here seems to be the result of a paucity of ideas on the writers' part. Examine almost any plot element and without much work you'll find the classic from which it was plucked. The well into which something evil is thrown - Tolkien. The door in the wall - Alice in Wonderland. The mice - Cinderella. The form the witch ultimately takes - Snow White.

","""Coraline"" makes a nice companion piece to ""Mirror Mask,"" with the stop-motion film skewed to younger viewers than its live-action sister, but with no less bite, or visual flourish. There's no question ""Coraline"" should be viewed in 3D if possible; it's stunning, although digital animation has come so far recently that it makes one wonder if anyone notices that this is puppet stop-motion work--for all the incredible, painstaking artistry in ""Coraline,"" would anyone but a professional know the difference between this and digital, or care? It would be a shame if not.<br/><br/>Matters of plot seem to be a mere inconvenience to the film's authors (try describing it: ""A little girl finds an alternate world where people have buttons for eyes and there are these dogs with wings, but you have to collect magic balls so the kids can go to heaven because the witch, who is sort of like a spider, is your Other Mother who lives in a world through a tunnel in the wall. But the neighbor upstairs is an acrobat!), but the plot is secondary to the jaw-droppingly beautiful set pieces, and fortunately doesn't get in the way of the overall experience.<br/><br/>The universe of the film is visually splendid, oddly familiar while at the same time feeling alien. After an obligatory set up concerning a discontent little girl with a strong personality and singular point of view, we're thrust into a breathtaking alternate reality where All Sorts Of Things Happen and Problems Must Be Solved, with a host of memorable characters, human, animal and otherwise, along the way. Like ""Silent Hill,"" which ""Coraline"" resembles in some places, the film is something like a hybrid between a video game that one plays and a movie that one watches...there are clues the protagonist needs to pick up and something like a ""big boss"" character that needs to be defeated. It's a style of film storytelling that was ahead of its time when it premiered and even now may not be for everyone, but is definitely unique and worth checking out."

","this film appears to be a sweet, innocent children's film that is suitable for all young audiences, when in fact it is dark and disturbing, and frankly, if a young child went to see this film, they would definitely have nightmares to say the least! the ideas are twisted and spooky- for example, the sewing of buttons in place of eyes, sewing a childs lips together to 'keep him quiet', plus a visually frightening set of characters- both the 'other mother' and the 'other father' become weirdly distorted as the storyline collapses towards the end. throughout the film, there is a foreboding theme of feeling trapped- as Coraline becomes imprisoned in the 'other world', and is locked into a doorless room with ghost versions of the other mother's previous victims. this will no doubt unnerve the audience. these are just a few examples of many disturbing scenes from the film- there are plenty more! in short, this is still a reasonably good movie, but however the rating should be at least a 12."
"sonick_yooth","6","2","6","25 May 2009"," Eerie without the feel
","Henry Selick is a stupendously imaginative film artist. His stop motion movies are pure eye candy, full of magical and bizarre settings and characters. Coraline takes it all even further. It is a beautiful, surprisingly colorful world filled with incredible set pieces and settings. There are some slight annoyances, like some over animated characters that have just too many moves or facial expressions. I'm not quite sure how to elaborate on this, but when, for example, Caroline follows every single word with whole range of different facial expressions, just so we could gasp some more at the animators brilliance, she loses some part of her character in the process. But, that is not the main problem of this film. <br/><br/>Main problem of the film is the screenplay. I have come to know Neil Gaiman primarily through his Sandman comics, and one thing I can say about him, is that he is too imaginative for his own good. Every single story line he wrote in there was brilliantly simple to start with, full of eerie, magical mythology and characters, some very, very nice fantasy for young adults. But then, he would continue on, and stuff every story with just to much intellectual mambo-jumbo. He would put artificially intellectual words into characters mouths just so readers would go on and say: woow, this guy is really well read. And I am aware that some teenage emo girl will fall in love with this paper thin kind of intellectual snobism that is wrapped in eeriness and cool blackness, but in all honesty, it is quite tiresome after some time. <br/><br/>And that is true in Coraline's case. Story line is fantastically beautiful on paper, girl finds a door in her house, door leads to ""other family"" with buttons for eyes, cats can talk and she is surrounded with nice and yet creepy characters. There isn't much for an older viewer to appreciate apart from visuals. Coraline herself is somewhat annoying character, you don't quite care for her, and all the wacky characters don't serve much purpose. Of course there is some Shakespeare quoting thrown here or there (it is a Gaiman story after all), just so older viewers could think that they are watching something deep, and that is not quite the case. Movie is trying really hard, but, once again, apart from brilliant visuals, there isn't much going on here. Even though there is something going on all the time. It is quite a feat, I must admit. <br/><br/>And, as always with this kind of movies, little details are it's best part. Is it the piano that plays the father or angel dogs, it is little things that Gaiman always excels at, and Selick really lifts it way up high. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a poor man's Alice in wonderland, minus the genuine originality and plus forced eeriness and narrative spices without flavor. It is not bad by a long shot, but I kind of feel that this movie should be watched inside it's young teenage target audience to really be accepted as a masterpiece. And I know if I was fifteen right now, that I would be in love with it."
"LemonyShepard","8","2","6","10 February 2009"," A Bold and Refreshing Break from ""Madagascar""
","(I haven't been compelled to write a movie review since The Dark Knight. This movie, however, inspired me to play the role of the critic yet again.) Today I've come to a fantastic realization: animated films are getting smarter. With the development of GCI films, filmmakers have found a new way to produce bizarre and creative fairy tales for adults to enjoy as well. Shrek was, essentially, a grown-up fairytale, with a few jokes about bugs and farts to appeal to the kids. Then, the always-brilliant Pixar gave the world Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E. Even Seinfeld's under-appreciated Bee Movie was directed towards adults. Of course, the world is a ridiculously narrow-minded place. If it isn't rated R for excessive potty humor and sex jokes, adults will instantly classify any and all animated films as ""kid movies."" That's why intelligent animated scripts are directed towards children.<br/><br/>The latest animated film to win my semi-adult heart over is the brilliant, beautiful, and downright terrifying stop-motion movie, Coraline. It was directed by Henry Silick, the genius who gave us James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and based off of the equally-chilling children's book by Neil Gaiman.<br/><br/>Coraline centers on a curious (and somewhat lonely) 11-year-old girl with a name that is almost always confused with the name ""Caroline."" After she and her parents move to an apartment in Oregon, Coraline is forced to count leaky windows and creaky doors to subside her horrible boredom. Her parents are working for a gardening magazine and basically neglects their daughter, forcing her to explore her new neighborhood with a talkative boy named Wybie. Her new neighborhood is filled to the brim with interesting and bizarre characters, each of them having no time to listen to this girl.<br/><br/>After Coraline finds a mysterious door underneath the wallpaper, she stumbles into a world that almost mirrors her own, only everything is much more appealing and downright fun! Her button-eyed Other Parents cook, sing, and, most importantly, give Coraline the attention she's always wanted. In fact, everyone in this new world seems to love Coraline. However, it doesn't take the girl very long to realize that her Other Mother wants her to stay in this seemingly-perfect world. Forever. This leads to a series of strange, magical, and frightening events that Coraline must overcome, leading her to the conclusion that maybe her ""boring"" real world isn't so bad after all.<br/><br/>The story is one that I think children's movies should be made of: great dialogue, a relatable main character, and a lesson that's subtle, but efficient. The movie treats children with respect, not dumbing down the story to make it ""more appropriate"" like many other kid's movies today. Instead, Coraline follows in the footsteps of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, where the dangers are real, deaths do happen, and the filmmakers are not afraid to shove it into the kids' faces. Children hate being treated as such, and with movies like Coraline, they feel like they're watching a genuine film instead of just another kiddie movie.<br/><br/>This being said, this movie isn't necessarily for younger children. It does have many frightening moments in it, ranging from creepy ghost kids to a giant, lanky spider-woman who attacks with metal claws. The opening of the film deals with someone ripping a doll open and ripping it's stuffing out, a scene that, combined with the eerie background music, is one of the most spine-tingling moments in the film. There is also a moment involving an elderly, yet ridiculously-large-chested, woman that will no doubt result in many parents covering their children's eyes, if not walking them out of the theater altogether. It was definitely awkward and not really necessary, but it hardly distracted from the overall feel of the film.<br/><br/>The film is in 3D, but it's in such a way that I've never seen before. There are no pop-out gimmicks in the movie, allowing the 3D effect to act more as an enhancer rather than a crutch. After seeing it in 3D, however, I honestly can't picture seeing it in any other way. The entire movie is absolutely beautiful, the stop-motion so flawless that a quarter way into the film, I forgot that it was stop-motion and not only accepted Coraline's crazy world, but believed it. If you look back at Nightmare Before Christmas (or even the more-recent Corpse Bride), you'll notice minor lighting or movement inconsistencies. Coraline has seemed to perfect the stop-motion format, and the 3D gives the audience the ultimate viewing experience.<br/><br/>In all honesty, this is not a film that can be described in one review. You won't be able to fully appreciate the story and the art direction if you only read about it. This movie is one to be experienced, especially in 3D, if you have the chance. Coraline, like Silick's previous films, is an instant classic and the first must-see film of 2009."

"elicopperman","9","1","2","18 February 2018"," Laika's Wonderful Debut
","While there aren't really that many mainstream animation studios that specialize in stop-motion today, the one notable standout besides Aardman is Laika inc. This studio constantly keeps pushing the limits of what stop-motion is capable of while also telling powerful gripping stories with dark themes and intriguing characters. So when their first feature film came out in 2009, it was inevitable that it would get an Oscar nomination. Coraline, based off the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman, was directed by Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, and what a bang up job he pulled off. <br/><br/>The story itself focuses on a little girl named Coraline Jones who moves into a new home with her family. Once in it, she discovers a parallel world hidden behind a secret door. While the world seems bright and cheery at first glance, it actually contains a dark and sinister secret that Coraline must face to get back to the real world. With a premise like that, there are bound to be some dark obstacles on the way, and the film never shies away from showing the true horrors from the alternate world. From Coraline's other mom and dad, to the buttoned eyes on everyone, to the neighborhood cat who might know more than meets the eye, this film creates a prefect contrast between the real world and the sinisterly dark surreal world. <br/><br/>As for the characters, Coraline herself does start off kinda moody like any child, but she still remains likable enough to sympathize with, and her encounter with the supernatural makes her become very brave and worth rooting for. Her real parents may seem rather moody and slobbish, but they're only looking out for what's best for her, and it's hard not to feel sorry for them given how hard they work to support themselves. Also, Coraline's other mother is one of the creepiest villains in cinema history, as she seems trusting at first, but then becomes one of the freakiest creatures ever conjured up in cinema. Other characters like Wybie, Mr. Bobinsky, April & Miriam and the cat support Coraline to help confront her fears in the alternate world (especially compared to their heinous alternate forms), and they're memorable enough to leave an impression from their eccentricities alone.<br/><br/>Even for a first time feature by a then brand new studio, the animation is very impressive. It's able to create a unique contrast between the gloomy real world and the alternate world. While the alternate world looks somewhat colorful, bright and creative at first, its true colors shine with many neutralized and grim backgrounds and colors that really help bring out the dark atmosphere to all new heights. The characters themselves look somewhat grotesque yet still look appealing, the character animation is very smooth and lively, and the sets look fantastically well crafted. Even the effects (which were either done by hand or on computers) stand out from how vibrantly sketchy and twisted they look.<br/><br/>When I think of a dark fantasy film for the whole family, this is what I think up of. A film where its creativity in visual imagery starts off sweet and charming, but then takes the huge risk of showing a whole new world with disturbing creatures to show kids the meaning of fear. And what really helps are the fantastic surreal imagery, the spooky voices, the spot-on music score and the film's message to appreciate what you have because the grass is always greener on the other side. This frightening yet well executed message can stick to any person for how simple yet effective it is, and for it's mature honesty, that is why this film remains one of my favorite movies of all time."

"YourFamilyExpert","9","1","2","17 January 2017"," The creepiest PG movie ever
","Since the Brothers Grimm penned their morbid fairy tales (and probably before), children and adults have escaped into fantasy to safely explore the dangers of reality. Tales such as Hansel and Gretel, and in the last century The Wizard of Oz, have provided imaginative worlds with dangers at every turn. The purpose of such tales was always to warn, educate, and provide a backdrop for moral instruction.<br/><br/>Such is true of Coraline, a cinematic fairy tale crafted by writer Neil Gaiman and director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas). Based on a book by Gaiman, this visually astounding stop-motion masterpiece is a reminder that not all fairy tales have wistful princesses and happy musical numbers (sorry, Disney). This is a return to the creepy morality tales of yore, and while young children may have nightmares from the unsettling mood and tone, older children and adults will likely delight in both its imagination and its message.<br/><br/>Coraline's title character is a plucky and resilient child (expertly voiced by Dakota Fanning) who has moved to a dusty, lonely old house in Washington with her parents. Both are neglectful in their own way: her father is caring enough, but is constantly aloof, while her mother (voiced by Teri Hatcher) is so busy that she hardly notices her daughter, and is often annoyed by her when she does.<br/><br/>One night, Coraline discovers a portal into a parallel existence: same house, same parents, but here everything is exactly as she wishes it were in reality. The dreariness of her true home is replaced by vibrant colors and spectacle. Her neglectful parents are replaced by updated versions who live only to lavish her with affection and wish-fulfillment. Soon Coraline begins to greatly prefer the alternate life to her actual one. It's all seems perfect, but she (and the audience) cannot shake the unsettling suspicion that something isn't quite right. Only a sage old black cat (who is realistically silent in the ""real world,"" but suavely vocal in other) seems to understand the dangers behind the seductive facade of Coraline's dream world.<br/><br/>To say more would be to ruin the surprises, but suffice to say that the film contains excellent messages for those who look for discussion points to share with their children afterward. The dream world serves as a perfect metaphor for the cunningly disguised lies of harmful people, as well their tactics of using subtle counterfeits to grant people's wishes in the short run, while slowly entangling (and later chaining) them in the long run.<br/><br/>As my mother always said: ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" With regards to Coraline's dream parents, they may be seen as a practical warning against slick strangers who might lure children away by promising them exactly what they want (much like the ""candy man"" character in Chitty Chitty Bang-Bang). The black cat, whose warnings initially go unheeded, may be seen to serve a similar purpose to parents, friends, and teachers. He is a wise, caring character who sees and understands things that the protagonist does not yet comprehend, tries to keep her from harm, and helps her when she is in peril.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film not only reminds parents of the need to give their children attention and affection, but also helps children understand the stresses of parenting and the need for gratitude for the parents they do have.<br/><br/>In addition to serving as a lasting morality tale, Coraline is a terrific artistic achievement. While computer-generated animation is en vogue at the moment, the terrific and nearly seamless stop-motion animation here is something different and gorgeous to behold. The film is currently showing both in 3D and as a regular feature; I recommend that you see it in 3D if possible, as the richly designed sets and characters were meant to be experienced in that format. Far from a mere gimmick, the 3D in this case actually brings more life to the story, revealing layers and depth that were actually created by hand and filmed, one meticulous frame at a time.<br/><br/>Parents should be warned, that while the film contains no real violence, it is full of unsettling images and a creepy atmosphere that will doubtless give nightmares to little ones (much like the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz, though this is a good deal scarier). There is mild profanity. A scantily-dressed and buxom elderly woman, though a clay-animated figure and far from titillating, may be offensive to some. That said, for older kids, teens, and adults who possess rich imaginations and an appreciation for this type of film, Coraline is a terrific night at the movies, and worth the added fee to view in 3D."

","Coraline is by no means a child's film. Despite the impression it is, and the advertisements aiming for children, i doubt there would be a boy or girl under 12 to watch this and not toss and turn at night. Hell, I'm praying i don't do the same. Yet, through its darkness and horror like storyline, it still remains to me, to be one of the best animated children's films that i have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the genre is so full of CG animation, with the ever endless same story lines, but this movie puts a little twist in the usually bland and often forgotten category. Admittedly, i was extremely shocked to find that the director of this movie was not Tim Burton, as the disturbing images and stop-motion animation would have had me believe otherwise. However, even without Burton's absence the film does itself proud in its own right, and the fact that it is stop-motion i feel really helps to bring out the fright in this tale, as the jittery movements and exaggerated body parts support the macabre atmosphere. <br/><br/>The film is based around a relatively isolated house, which has been broken up into separate apartments. The angry and upset Coraline has just moved in, and is unhappy with the lack of attention she receives from her work ridden and economically unstable parents. This leads to the discovery of a small doorway which leads to a parallel world, where everything that appears to be wrong with her current life is right. <br/><br/>As always, everything seems fine at first, until things inevitably slip and a more chilling atmosphere descends on the film. Overall however, there are some dark elements, and very adults themes. That is not to say, however, that it is any less of an interesting, and visually treatable picture."

","I have been curious to watch this animated film since I saw the trailer since late last year. I do not think it was ever shown locally in the theaters though. Anyway, I was finally able to watch it this Christmas Day.<br/><br/>Coraline is a feisty pre-teen girl who is exasperated by her parents' apparent lack of concern and attention for her. She was thus easily enamored and tempted by the seemingly ideal ""Other mom"" and ""Other dad"" whom she met when she crawled into a small door in their house. That is, until she knew what this would cost her. Will Coraline be able to rescue herself and her family from the clutches of the evil witch? <br/><br/>From the trailer, I kind of knew this was not really for kids. The shapes and the colors indicate a dark and sinister plot. And watching it just confirms this suspicion. What drew me to watch this was the amazing artwork and animation work. I did not know before I watched that the story was based on a work by Neil Gaiman, and the director was also the one who directed ""Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas."" So you can sort of get the drift of what I am saying. The story is mature and the imagery is disturbing. The technical aspects of this film are undeniably exceptional, and the main drawing point.<br/><br/>The primary lesson I picked up is not necessarily targeted for kids though, but for busy parents. Parents should get their priorities straight first, and give their kids the time they need. I must admit I was uncomfortable watching these scenes of parental insouciance and neglect. I shudder at the thought that my kids would see these scenes and, God forbid, identify with poor Coraline. The lesson kids will get that they should love the parents they have may be a belated realization."

I would say it's a pretty good film, but the whole film just feels like it's a short story with one or two creative concepts with a bunch of uninteresting aspects added so the movie wouldn't be too short. <br/><br/>I watched this movie with really high expectations, which is probably why I was slightly disappointed at the end. I was mostly disappointed that the best scenes in the whole movie were spoiled in the trailer. If you watch the film and than watch the trailer you can tell they had to spoil the best parts of the film in order for the trailer to get you interested in the movie. For those that have not seen the movie and have not seen the trailer, I warn you not to watch the trailer, it will make the movie much more interesting and unpredictable if you don't.<br/><br/>The plot seems to have a pattern where basically two ideas in the movie are repeated constantly through half of the movie. I wish they added something to the plot that made you more interested in the constantly repeating ideas. I can see they tried to do that a little but it didn't do well enough.<br/><br/>There is something about the pace that bothers me also. The movie is too fast pace in some scenes.<br/><br/>Coraline is one of those films that has it's best moments in the middle of the movie. Unfortunately the exciting middle is TOO much more interesting than the beginning and end. So after the exciting middle was over I didn't really feel very interested in how the movie was ending, the last 20 minutes of the movie just seem like it was something they made up at the last minute so the movie wouldn't have an ending that comes too soon.<br/><br/>The music and animation really keep this movie on it's stand. I love the music at the main titles, it's creepy but relaxing at the same time. The end credits is like a fast moving energetic version of the main titles. Coraline isn't a musical, but it does have two short songs, which works perfectly for the movie. The animation is the best thing about the whole movie, which is probably why the movie doesn't have that good of a story. The story was okay but just by a few points I would sadly have to put Coraline in the category of ""movies that focus too much more on animation than the story"". However, it's well worth watching just to see the amazing images and flawless stop motion. <br/><br/>So all in all, worth seeing. Just keep low on the expectations and avoid seeing the trailer."
"ThurstonHunger","7","1","2","21 November 2009"," Parents consider reading the story first...
","First off, as a parent I echo the sentiment mentioned here and by Sam/Hannah's Dad to me, that this film is not for all kids. Indeed the theme that the Mom/Dad you want might not be the Mom/Dad you need is a mature one, and the fearful factor of a child abduction by the ""other mother"" is scary, even if you are not in a blended family.<br/><br/>Stepmothers rarely fare well in reality and fantasy, and mirror-mothers less so.<br/><br/>The idea of sewing buttons in the eyes, to make allegiance to the mirror mom complete, well that is pretty horrific concept. But done with stop-motion animation this is not a ""Chainsaw Massacre."" I had read the story to my boys when they were six, and decided to watch it this year around Halloween when they were seven. Watching it in our home on a small screen I also think is less assaultive than seeing it on a big screen. In general, my guys are a little more attuned to the macabre and we definitely talk about how TV is not real, etc...<br/><br/>So it worked very well for us, and maybe you as well. The movie introduces a new character who was a hit with the twins, WhyBe added humor and also a role for a boy. (All those great Ghibli films always seem to have a strong *girl* as the lead...and here of course Coraline is the *star*).<br/><br/>The film looked great to us. I just asked one of them what they liked/remembered and he cataloged quite a few specific images (from the garden, the robot, the bat/dogs, the walls that became mouths...which I didn't remember) and so on. I sometimes forget how visual the little guys are. And this film has plenty of trick-or-treats for the eyes. Also if you read the story first as we did, it might help your kids that then they know a happy ending of sorts is coming.<br/><br/>As always, I'm grateful for something my kids *and* I can enjoy that is not pathetic pablum."
"ennieday09","7","1","2","6 October 2009"," Intriguing, good characters, but still missing something
","I was drawn to this movie due to the fact Henry Sellick directed it who brought us the timeless classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Coraline has many of the same elements Henry Sellick uses in his movies but it was still missing something to me to make it a great movie. <br/><br/>Henry is a master at creating unique characters that amaze the audience. Coraline is no exception as the different characters and amazing scenery is what stuck out to me the most. The plot of the movie was also on point about a young girl escaping the real dismal world into a fantasy world where anything is possible. Many other aspects of the movie make it great as well like the amazing score and art direction but the pace of the movie is what slightly bothered me. <br/><br/>Some scenes in the movie to me were drawn out too long and the point some of the characters were trying to make were halted for some unnecessary scenes. I guess with the many different characters in the film, there needs to be a lot of screen time to get their story across, but some scenes to me were not needed and dragged the film a little longer than it needed to be.<br/><br/>But overall, Henry Sellick still proves he is a master of creating unique characters, stunning imagery and developing a great musical score to make any movie of his a must see. While Coraline has some flaws, it is still a good movie and a recommendation for anyone whose a fan of his work. 7/10"

","Holy camoley ! This film is by far the best animation film for 2009 ! I like everything about it; the animation, the storyline, the creative idea, the brilliant colors and great music ! This isn't your run-of-the-mill remake animation, as this film is original and creative. It also is not what animation is usually for; cheerful cuddly characters performing antics and making viewers laugh.<br/><br/>This animation talks about serious issue, hidden subtly in its presentation. It talks about how kids (and teenagers) usually dislikes their parents and their environment, and yearn for life different from what they have. They wanted something different, and they thought the grass is greener on the other side.<br/><br/>In this animation, it is not always so. There are baits of 'better' life when actually it is reserved for something sinister.<br/><br/>I like the spooky feel of this animation, the dark environment and the surreal set-ups. It is cleverly woven, with art-like precision to make this film a nice watch, whilst being spooky, not gory.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone who likes animation. And to those who only began to like animation, I recommend them to give this film a try.<br/><br/>P/S : Watch it in 3-D, so cool !"

","Coraline is a journey of the imagination. With great visuals and highly creative story telling this movie will be sure to be one that has a great following of salivating fans. With an endless number of twists and a story that draws you in, Coraline delivers an exciting three dimensional experience. The film is a masterpiece. You will be amazed by the 3d, the story and the great visuals. One minor warning would be that the movie is not really one for children. A cartoon it may be, yet it takes a mind that is developed at least to the age of twelve to really get something out of it. This was proved to me by the 8 year old sitting next to me who was watching and continually asking its mother, ""what happened?"". Also there is a moment of near cartoon nudity. Pasties, I think they call them? But a great movie for teens and adults for sure."
"kefka989","10","1","2","11 February 2009"," A new Classic movie to remember
","I've always loved good kids movies, because good kids movies do more then entertain kids, they entertain the whole family (Not a good idea to bore the parents taking their kids to see a movie to tears with drek). I also have special movies of my own childhood, and I appreciate movies that really push things to the limit of what should be appropriate for children to see, old classics such as 'Return to Oz', 'A Mouse and Child', and 'Monster Squad' to name a few.<br/><br/>This movie really seems to fit along those lines. It's not a simply happy tale like you might expect a kids movie to be, this movie has bite too it, hence the PG rating rather then a tame G rating. This movie also has some of the best work done on it I've seen in a while. I've seen stop motion before, even the latest one which I believe was the Corpse Bride. But this one was so well done, there were many parts of the movie, the majority of it, that was so well done, I could not tell it was stop motion. It looked far too good, more along the lines of CG films like Wall-e and Shrek. That takes skill and time and effort you never see in movies anymore, where making a quick buck is not the exception, but the rule.<br/><br/>The story is simple at first, a girl moves to a new home, an old house that has been converted into a 3 level apartment, and is struggling to deal with her parents, who are hard pressed with their work and too busy or tired to deal with the attention demanding girl. She is forced to deal with her neighbors, a crazy and eccentric circus performer and two retired bickering actresses for neighbors, a black cat that gives her the creeps, and a typical loudmouthed and rambunctious boy named Wybie, short for Whyborn. He annoys Coraline (mostly because he is a boy and also because of the fact that he was raised out in the boonies, he has few social graces) but gives her a doll he found in his home, which for some reason is identical to Coraline. Not long after Coraline stumbles onto a strange small door in the gathering room of their flat, but finds the door is not only locked but leads to a brick wall. Its not until that night that Coraline follows a mouse (Her eccentric circus neighbor claims to train dancing mice in his home) to the door, but finds it now leads down a dark tunnel, which leads to a mirror image of her own home, only its populated by strange versions of everyone in her world. Mostly she finds it a dream come true, her 'Other' mother and father, everything Coraline wishes her real parents were, doting on her with gifts and attention, meanwhile her neighbors are transformed into successful versions of themselves and perform for Coraline's amusement. The only other difference is that everything and everyone in this other world has buttons for eyes, and as Coraline visits this place every night, she is offered the chance to stay and be happyÂ… if she replaces her own eyes with buttonsÂ… <br/><br/>I honestly think this movie should be something every child should see. It has moments in it that are so dark and twisted it reminded me of such things as the Silent Hill games, so I'd say make sure your kid does not scare easily. But then again kids need something to scare the snot outta them once in a while, it builds character. Too many things now are pacified, defanged and declawed, left harmless. This movie is sweet and endearing, but can also make you writhe in your seat and even jump from it at times (the 3D does tend to help with this). Honestly I have to say that this movie spooked me out a lot more then any horror movie I've seen in recent memory. It's use of subtle changes and twisting images that we would normally find comforting and safe to be concerning and insecure. I'm immediately reminded of such films as Return to Oz where everything we remembered from the first movie was rendered stagnant, dangerous, and decrepit, leaving you to feel very unsafe in a familiar yet horribly unfamiliar environment.<br/><br/>Hopefully, we will see more films like this, and maybe more film makers will be willing to put a bit more effort into their works, focusing on creating classics rather then market success. As for this film, I would recommend it to everyone. Give your kids a good scare, they could probably use one, as it builds character. If you are concerned about scaring your kids too badly, then make it a point to not admit your kids unless they are around 8 or 7. This story definitely reminds me of the older stories children were once told to scare them to sleep or keep them in line, though this one is far more entertaining."
"Thatguywiththeface","2","3","12","5 September 2012"," Coraline, along the same lines as a bunch of other movies, but nowhere near as good.
","This is basically the stuttering, stumbling, non-sensical version of Pan's Labyrinth. A movie that feels a LOT like Tideland, but where as Tideland stayed odd the whole time and kind of found itself at the end, This movie just keeps getting more odd, and NEVER finds itself. Henrey Selnick once again is extremely unimpressive, and once again tries to rip off Tim Burton's visuals and music... it doesn't work.<br/><br/>About the point where Coraline's in the dream world and the two fat ladies are wearing pretty much nothing, I turned and asked, ""What the hell am I watching?""

I decided to watched the movie to see what actually happened.<br/><br/>Many good things to say about this movie, as a lot of people has pointed out. For me a movie is more or less ruined when the plot doesnÂ´t really make sense. In this movie its mainly Coraline making a lot of decisions that doesnÂ´t make sense. She is too daring, naive and she is taking chances that is not realistic considering the danger. The concept of the two worlds is never really explained, and Coraline isnÂ´t really asking too many questions about them either. She just does something really risky and suddenly it kind of works out.

It was very disturbing and scary that she wanted to harvest the souls of children and eat them."

","I read the book, well listened to the author read the book (awesome reader by the way but preferred him reading The Graveyard Book), and enjoyed it. The movie takes a few unnecessary liberties, such as the creation of Whyborn, but there all tolerable. What I did not like about the movie was Coraline, I hated Dakota Fanning whose voice I found extremely annoying and it took me till the end of the movie to get over. I also fault Dakota Fanning for making Coraline unlikable character with her guttural sighs and screams, which I found to be obnoxious. It is worth watching as it is visually interesting but parts of the movie I felt were a bit too campy for my taste and did I mention how much I did not like Coraline's character?"
"Shalotka","6","1","3","29 March 2010"," So why are beetroots better than flowers? Great potential and lots of room for improvement.
","As a great admirer of doll animation I was fascinated and impressed by the amount of work the creators of the movie has put into it. A close look at the clothes, interiors and the enchanted flowers was like appreciating a piece of art. It applied to everything but the characters, which seemed to be way too sharp-edged, their proportions were too disturbed and often the general impression too grotesque as compared to classic animation.<br/><br/>After reading a brief synopsis, no to mention the book, you already know the whole story. Real life and real people seem so dull and cold and the other world seems so luring, until it becomes a real nightmare.<br/><br/>Having fought the evil witch and destroyed the illusion of the other world Coraline learns to appreciate her real family and neighbors. However, I don't see how the change in the characters did take place. Coraline shows more affection towards her parents simply because she missed them and they at least don't want to kill her or sew buttons on her face. The parents seem more cheerful and less distant than at the beginning of the movie, but not because of the adventure. They don't remember anything that happened in the other world, they simply feel relaxed and optimistic because they have completed their job that had kept them busy. Could that be a permanent change? Was the witch gone forever after the spider-needle-hand was tossed into the well?<br/><br/>The story doesn't justify how the real world transformed from really unfriendly (ice-cold parents, disturbed neighbors) to fairly normal. It is disappointing because I expected a real allegory of repairing family relations and mirroring of the real world in the other world not only by the looks but by the course of events (somewhat like in ""The Pan's Labyrinth"").<br/><br/>Another big doubt about the movie is the age of a target audience. It is way too creepy for little children, but not challenging enough to grasp teenagers' and adults' attention.<br/><br/>A real beetroot is better for you than an illusion of a flower, yet I'm not sure if it was exactly what this symbol stood for. Maybe it wasn't symbolic at all. The movie is without doubt memorable, but I'd rather have a little more beetroot than flower in it i.e. more story over the picture."
"fwomp","10","1","3","31 January 2010"," Target Audience? Who Cares!
","Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. ""Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?"" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esquire rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...<br/><br/>Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., THE HAPPENING) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, CRASH) adds to this sense.<br/><br/>Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, THE DEAD GIRL) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why? The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.<br/><br/>This isn't WALL-E or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas and you'll be closer, but not quite there.<br/><br/>The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.<br/><br/>The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.<br/><br/>This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens."

","I remember when I read the book ""Coraline"" and I was thinking how creepy the book was. But, when I saw the previews for this film in 2009, I thought that there were going to be drastic changes to the film from the book, such as the film being on a lighter note. Well, I actually saw the film and I was so surprised at how dark and scary it was, just like the book. Truth is, I actually love this movie because it stayed true to the book and the animation was beautiful. I especially love the main character Coraline as she was truly courageous and has a lot of spunk. Other characters that I have enjoyed greatly were the Other Mother, because she was truly scary, especially towards the end of the movie and Mr. Bobobinsky, the Russian circus performer who was weird yet entertaining to watch. I would strongly recommend anyone to see ""Coraline"" because it is definitely one of the top movies of 2009 because of its creepy yet adventurous plot and interesting characters."
"nickdelopes","10","1","3","12 December 2009"," Beautifully creepy and startlingly scary
","Coraline is one of those films that adults will enjoy a lot better than the kids. Full of creepy imagery (the spider lady at the end terrified the dickens out of me) and even some sexual animation(Miss Spink's and Miss Forcibles's routine), this was not created with children in mind. Despite that this film has all the visual flair and edgy music to create a world of darkness within.<br/><br/>Coraline is a bratty, tomboyish little girl who wants nothing but to go back to her old town. She certainly does not like living in the Pink Palace, and her neighbor Wybie (short for Wyborn) is a pest. Her parents love her, but are such workaholics that they don't even pay attention to her. Who would blame her when she wants to go through the little door she found in the living room. Unfortunately, it's bricked up, until night that is, where it leads her to this other world.<br/><br/>There she is greeted by her Other Mother and Father, perfect replicas of her parents but better looking and with buttons for eyes. The world on the other side is perfect with every detail of the real world made better and brighter. Even the neighbors are more exciting. But as Coraline soon finds out, there is more to this world than first appears.<br/><br/>What helps this movie a great deal is the visuals and music which work together to create this impression that we are in the middle of a nightmare. In the real world, colors are dampened and animation is somewhat sluggish, but in the other world, colors are bright and the screen bursts into life. Yet, as this other world begins to reveal its true intention, the colors dissolve into shadowy blues and edgy, fluorescent purples. Some of the imagery is mesmeric, almost like you are going on an acid trip, and the character design has all the distortion that made the characters in Nightmare Before Christms memorable. Coupled with music full of dreamy choral interludes and hallucinogenic strings and you have an atmosphere that keeps you on edge.<br/><br/>This is one of the films that you want to take home, turn the light off and watch. Taffy monsters, a praying mantis tractor, a jumping mouse circus, all are freaky and disturbing in just the right amount. Voice work was excellent, and Dakota Fanning was the perfect choice for Coraline. Sarcastic and stubborn, she won't just be treated as a child, and she will stand up for herself when the going gets tough.<br/><br/>10/10 for style, 10/10 for music, 9/10 for voice work, 10/10 for visuals, and 9/10 for screenplay. A winner."

","Coraline brings back Henry Selick (director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach) to direct this amazingly scary enchantment. Coraline is full of wonders that you wouldn't expect to see in any ordinary movie. It is exciting, fun, somewhat scary but for all its worth an amazing thrill ride. Coraline is a movie where you truly have to appreciate art. For Coraline you have to use your mind to understand some of the visionary art that is used in this movie. For example, in this movie you will see a mouse circus. That doesn't sound like much, but when you see it you won't believe your eyes. Coraline is a movie that little kids probably wouldn't want to see (probably because of the scary scenes). But it is still a great movie that just about anyone could enjoy (espically with the 3D). When it comes down to visionary art, great story, an amazing cast, and something thats a little dark so adults could get into it. Then watch Coraline, with Henry Selick being the director he won't let you down. Like I said earlier Coraline isn't any ordinary movie its better."

","Right from the opening credits, you know you are in for a visual animation treat which uses the same stop motion capture animation technique as in Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>But it is the storytelling and creepy tones of the film that sets this apart from other children's animated films. I would say the tone of this film is quite similar to the great Miyazaki films such as Spirited Away. And if I was to make a comparison to an American animated film then I suppose the superb Monster House would come closest. There are plenty of humour but played out in an innocently naturalistic way, no slapstick.<br/><br/>The story starts out in a very Alice in Wonderland way with our antagonist, Coraline, bored out of her wits because her parents have no time for her and trying to get use to her new lonely dwellings in a house that has only 3 eccentric neighbours including a little boy who stalks Coraline. Coraline is rather ungrateful and not very understanding of why her parents cant give her undivided attention. She then finds a portal through what seems to be a parallel world but a world where her parents have all the time in the world for her and gives her anything she wants but is it all too good to be true for little Coraline? The story then continues to get creepier and creepier until it becomes downright frightening! Yes kids will be scared out of their wits. That is to say, they will love it! This film is a masterpiece of children's storytelling. Stunning visuals of both the whimsical and hellish variety. I was enthralled, entertained and frightened as much Coraline was in the film.

","I'm back after long tour of North India and confused among all the heap of DVDs lying on my table from a month or so and than I found this fine animation film. I'm impressed by the wonderful imagination world of story writer and Director Henry Selick.<br/><br/>Coraline is a sweet little girl whose parents are busy in their own world and don't pay much attention to her. So she felt bored and neglected in her newly shifted home. One night the girl discovered a secret magic window leads her to different world. The fantasy becomes her other home with replica button eyed parents fulfilling her every demands. She meets her weird friend Wybie and flexi neighbor Bobinski in this other world too. It becomes routine matter for her to witness this other fantasy home at night and returns to real world in the morning when she wake up. But as the story progress it intrigues you completely as in the case of cute Coraline who lured away by the scheming of other fantasy home. All glitter isn't gold always.<br/><br/>The blending of graphics and animation is full of innovation and originality and shows pool of creativity and that's make the film different from all other earlier seen cutie animation flicks.<br/><br/>Recommended to all animation lovers.<br/><br/>Ratings-8/10"

","Have you ever order something that sounds ordinary in a restaurant, and don't think much of it and then after your first bite you find out that not only the food was excellent, it was something familiar yet very satisfying. That is how I feel about this movie.<br/><br/>WOW is just a word I have to use when describing this movie. I thought it would be just another kids movie. Boy, was I wrong. This is NOT a children movie at all. I think kids will be absolutely terrified by it. Even me, a 24 years old fine young lad is creeped out by it.<br/><br/>That said, I love this movie so much. I think this is one of the best movie that has come out in years. That was not very easy to say since I'm very picky and critical in terms of movies. I can't describe how satisfying watching a movie like this is. There was no boring moment for me. The pace, the plot, the characters development, the familiarity, it was all perfect, just perfect.<br/><br/>I have not read the book before by the way, I didn't even know there was a book until I read someone say it in IMDb. Doesn't matter, the animators were brilliant. The story complex yet familiar and satisfying. It smashed all my expectations away."

","Let's start with Henry Selick, he has immense imagination compared to some other directors; a great example would be 'Nightmare before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach' after that both i had high expectations of this movie. After i watched the movie trailer from 'Coraline' , i had to see this animation movie. And i can tell you that this was actually one of the best animation movies i have seen for awhile.<br/><br/>Absolutely i wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The music of this movie was top class! For the movie ""Coraline"" i would give 10/10, that is pretty rare from me, but the movie is just perfect! there is nothing to polish of this movie! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

","I took my eleven and eight year olds to see this and they loved it. There was not one single scene that I thought inappropriate for them. It was so much deeper and more thought provoking than the usual Disney schmaltz (although the kids love that stuff too). I would recommend it to anyone with a bit of imagination who was to watch something that makes them think a little bit more than the average cartoon. Our family love Nightmare Before Xmas so this was definitely a film we were looking forward to and we were not disappointed. This is up there with animated greats such as NBC and Spirited Away. There were certainly some Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass themes but generally a nicely conceived world for young and old minds to explore. We will certainly be buying the DVD to watch again and again."

","For Coraline Jonesâ€”an imaginative, free-spirited young girl burdened with the curse of workaholic, dispassionate and distanced parentsâ€”her life up until now can more or less be summed up as a typo; a careless error of mispronunciation or just incompetence. Life it would seem is just a series of misfortunate, boring mistakes that aren't her fault; she's lost within a world of greys and pale-skinned coffee addicts lacking her own shades of vibrancy and lust for adventure. Seeking some sort of escape from her dreary reality, Coraline finds refuge in a distant home that fulfils her every whim and desire. Yet the people who provide thisâ€”her parents who are an eerily chirpy polar opposite of their real counterpartsâ€”don't offer such a paradise for young Coraline's gratis benefit. No, they want her eyes, the key to the soul and her only way back to the smoggy and bleak landscapes of her totally boring existence.<br/><br/>Telling this tale that will be familiar to most audiences, Coraline is a feature that mixes the absurd and artistic with the jarringly authentic to startling effect. In fact, despite the screenplay's tendency to get bogged down by the narrative's overly familiar web of themes and plot devices, the majority of the movie surprisingly transcends the usual ho-hum formula present within too many of today's children's features. Instead Coraline with its cerebrally engaging aesthetic and bizarre sense of reality offers an experience that adults will probably enjoy a little more than their younger counterparts. Yes, it's true that children will still find plenty to latch onto a enjoy hereâ€”but the truth is that Henry Selick here twists and spins an experience bursting with thematic subtext, gorgeous imagery and some wacky characters who stay true to established formula without coming off tired and mundane. Existing somewhere between the realms of Nightmare Before Christmas and Pan's Labyrinth lies the dual realities of Coraline Jones in all their mesmerizingly off-key beauty.<br/><br/>Taking centre stage for our story is of course Coraline herself, who, despite falling a little flat at times nevertheless gives the feature a subtle sense of overriding intelligence. Indeed, there's a distinctly modern and witty prevalence to Coraline's nature that echoes last year's Juno without stuffing it into the viewer's face. While a key element to the young, adventurous protagonist is in fact her intelligence, it is instead her short-sightedness that provides the movie with its central pulling power. For Coraline, the thought of escaping her drab life on her side of the wall in order to live with her much more loving and caring family who cook her lush meals, compose songs in her name and create vast gardens modelled after her faceâ€”the temptation is almost enough to shut the door on her ""other, other Mum and Dad"" and instead live in luxury coated with a bizarre sense of imagination and nightmarish undertones.<br/><br/>Conveyed wonderfully by a mix of creepy animation, lighting and Bruno Coulais' score however, the world that Coraline escapes to at night often carries with it an ominous, sinister underbelly hidden from clear view. In this world, dreams indeed come true, but rather than play the piano itself; the piano instead plays you. It is during these segments that the feature takes its most compelling form, mixing surreal imagery with awe-inducing set pieces combining otherworldly music with the bizarre, contorted animation style that Selick is distinctly known for. The only problem with such moments however is that they only draw attention to the extremely dry and monotonous nature of Coraline's reality; at the beginning of the movie we see her decree her new home as utterly boring, and yet it isn't until the later parts of the film that we truly emphasise with her. Of course, such a polarising element is a double edged sword that conveys the movie's central themes with poignancy, but perhaps with too much of a vigour (or lack of such).<br/><br/>Despite the many instances of jarringly unsettling gloom and doom however, there exists a prevailing sense of whimsy charm to much of Selick's feature here that has been hidden under the floorboards of all his major works. Indeed, while Coraline boasts plenty of scenes that top even the grimmest of horror movies in terms of establishing mood, atmosphere and tensionâ€”it is the central character, her struggle and the magical world that she finds herself in that makes that largest impression. Again, children will surely enjoy it on a purely ostensible level but adults will no doubt be able to latch onto the feature's thick subtext and eerie surrealism that provides something notably childish, but placed within the manipulative world of adults. In this vein, Coraline achieves a tone akin to most well known nursery rhymes or bedtime fablesâ€”cute, whimsical and told with a melancholic melody in tow; but sinister, broken and deeply rooted in the darker side of the imagination all the same.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","What do you get if you mix together the Wizard of Oz, the Chronciles of Narnia, Spirited Away, Alice in Wonderland, The Amber Spyglass and Tim Burton? You get Coraline, a big screen adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novella.<br/><br/>The last film based on the work by Neil Gaiman made the very enjoyable Stardust. Whilst Coraline has a similar theme, it is so very different at the same time.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) is a young adventurous girl who has just moved to the rainy state of Oregon. Her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are writers and are too busy to spend time with their daughter or do the activities she wants to. Her mum is cold and irritable at times whilst her dad is kind-hearted but a bit hopeless. The neighbours include a local boy Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), the formers actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and the gymnast Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) who training mice to do jumping tricks. Coraline is bored, frustrated and ignored, but she discoveries a magic door to another world. There it seems perfect, with her parents doing anything she wants, like cook nice meals and see magical performances by the neighbours. But every time she wakes up in her own bed and she has to face to reality of her own world. She longs to go back to the Other World, but she gets warned by the black cat (Keith David) that the world was not as it seems, and she soon discovers that it a very dark place indeed.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful, with fantastic puppet, stop-motion which can rival Aardman Animation. There are lovely subtle touch and the designs of sets and characters which makes the film worth seeing in itself. It clear that by the style of storytelling and animation that the director Henry Selick was from the Tim Burton school. Even the opening is like a Tim Burton film. The story itself is wonderfully original, but because it Gothic feel and be scary at places it is not advised for young children to see this film. It is a good to see a young girl as the lead protagonist.<br/><br/>The voice acting is good. Dakota Fanning shows why she is one of best child actresses around. Teri Hatcher is good and shows her range in this film. It's good to see French and Saunders in an American film and carrying on her double act with a love-hate relationship. I also enjoyed Keith David as the cat. But the performance I enjoyed the most of Ian McShane who had excellent comedy skills and very different to his role in Deadwood. His character's appearance also reminded me of Dr. Robotnik.<br/><br/>I saw the film in 3D which made for increasing viewing and was stylist, but the novelty worn off because of the power of the story-telling. It would easy enough to watch it in 2D.<br/><br/>This is the first animated film I have seen in the cinema since The Increadibles, and it was a good choice. It good to see an animated film made out of love and not just a cheap cash-in.<br/><br/>A lovely, 4 out of 5."

","Having already watched and loathed two movies based on Neil Gaiman talesâ€”Mirrormask (1/10) and Stardust (3/10)â€”I was extremely hesitant about seeing Coraline, but was ultimately lured by the promise of an extra dimension (I'm a sucker for a gimmick).<br/><br/>And to my amazement, I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The perfect viewing choice for anyone who adores dark, twisted fantasyâ€”or for parents wishing to warp their children's delicate minds (the film contains disturbing imagery guaranteed to upset kiddies of a nervous disposition)â€”Coraline is an absolute tour-de-force of exquisite story-telling, stunning 3D visuals, breathtaking animation, wonderful music, and brilliant voice-work (from a cast including Dakota Fanning, desperate housewife Teri Hatcher, and my least favourite comedy duo of all time, French and Saunders).<br/><br/>Gaiman's freakish story follows 10-year-old Coraline, the frustrated daughter of inattentive parents, as she ventures through a mysterious hidden door in her new home that leads to a seemingly perfect alternate world, complete with extremely considerate and caring versions of her mother and father. The fact that everyone in this doppelganger dimension has buttons for eyes is a little unnerving perhaps, but Coraline doesn't mind, so long as she gets to keep her eyes.<br/><br/>So when her new, button-eyed parents offer to keep Coraline forever, just so long as she agrees to a new pair of plastic peepers being sewn onto her head, the little girl decides that perhaps her real home isn't so bad after all. However, her alternative mother is keen to hang on to Coraline, hoping to feed off her life-force, and isn't about to let the girl go without a fight...<br/><br/>Other bizarre and memorable characters include Wybie Lovat, Coraline's 'stalker'/friend (who helps save the day), Mr. Bobinsky, the gangly legged owner of a musical mouse circus (who provides the highlight of the film, as his talented rodents put on a spectacular show), and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two strange, old actresses with a collection of stuffed Highland Terriers (and whose past performances include the dubiously named 'King Leer' And 'Julius Sees-her').<br/><br/>Although I highly recommend seeing this film in it's full 3D splendourâ€”the FX definitely add impact to the visualsâ€”Coraline's narrative is so engaging that, even without the added depth, it proves to be unmissable stuff."
"stephenhinton","10","1","3","11 May 2009"," Terrifying and Beautiul....an instant magical classic
","Having just watched Coraline it is with out doubt a magical film.<br/><br/>The story centres around Neil Gaiman's beautiful story telling of 'Coraline Jone's' a feisty, very grown up 11 year old girl imaginably voiced by Dakota Fanning who has just moved to new town and house along with her parents voiced by Terr Hatcher and John Hodgman who seem to have no time for there daughter their busy stressed out life's.<br/><br/>So it is here that Coraline sets about exploring the new house which appears sometimes creepy at times and discovers a secret door which upon opening takes our heroine into another parallel world. This new world seems exciting, magical and full of vibrant colour unlike the drained out real one she is used to...and this new world seems perfect...or it would seem? It is here that Henry Selick jaw dropping and exquisite stop motion animation takes place and in my book this even better than The Nightmare Before Christmas - and one that's gives Pixar a run for their money. The arch of an eyebrow perfectly expressing a character's attitude, the shine on the icing of a cake making it look edible and this will shine Oscar time next year.<br/><br/>As we are entering the year of 3-D films (and I cannot wait to see what Avatar as to offer) I recommend you seek out a cinema that is showing it in this as this adds another magical dimension to the film.<br/><br/>Yes as some reviews might say on here the film may appear a little scary at times for children...but does it?

","I went to see this film last night with my friend from work, alittle worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. This film is probably not for those of us who are self confessed wimp (like my friend) but it IS fantastically creepy and engaging. Although I was at times alittle freaked out, I was also with Coraline all the way. Even my friend admitted that she was so involved in the film that when it seemed that Coraline had no hope she was actually panicking about how she would get out of her predicament, something which I can honestly say no other Kids film has managed to get me to do.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this to those brave souls who like to be freaked out-even some kids would love this. But I would warn parents of younger or sensitive children, this is probably too much! If your kid is scared of the bogeyman and the dark, avoid this, or there will be tears at bedtime!"

As her parents are too busy to spend time with her she goes exploring and comes across a doorway in the living room wall which leads her to an alternate reality where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father and a the usual morality tale ensues.<br/><br/>This children's movie is directed by Henry Selick, the genius behind The Nightmare Before Christmas the kids film that adults enjoy more than any child so although it is bright and colourful be warned that the plot itself is told in a really dark manner which is not suitable for young children. The Other Mother is a fantastically scary Character that even Maleficent would have nightmares about. There were a couple of five to six year olds that were not happy during some of the scarier moments of the movie and to be honest I was more scared during Coraline than I have ever been during an adult horror movie.<br/><br/>Unlike most children's films there is a very strong story being told on screen and there is something very unsettling about the buttons for eyes idea.<br/><br/>The version I watched was in 3D and there were some nice moments but this movie, although gorgeous to look at is all about the story so if you cant see it in 3D then do not worry.<br/><br/>There isn't the usual celebrity voice cast which is refreshing and the movie contains some very clever set pieces and characters.<br/><br/>I would give it an 8/10.

","This odd little film turned out to be one of the best kid-type films I've seen in awhile. Mind you, little-little kids under the age of 6 or so may find some parts a bit un-nerving but older kids (like my nephew Sam who's 10) really got into it. Sam has the attention span of a gnat but he sat all the way through this, rapt with attention (which can't be said for the travesty of a film called ""Hotel For Dogs"", which found my nephew bored silly, making paper airplanes out of the empty Raisenettes box he had). Anyhow, this film has a magical, otherworldly feel to it with a great little message about ""being careful what you wish for"" throughout the movie. Dakota Fanning voices the sometimes bored, sometimes insolent, often frustrated Coraline perfectly. Teri Hatcher surprises here to, switching between the modern, impatient mother of Coraline's reality and the ""Other Mother"", a creepily saccharine character in the other realm. Ian McShane's ""Mr. Bobinsky"" is a hoot and it's always cool to see the comedic teaming of crazy Brit chicks French and Saunders as outlandish neighbor ladies with a penchant for taxidermy on their multiple scotty dogs (whether the dogs are ready to go to the ""great beyond"" or not). This film was cool and original. It may be too different for kids (and adults) who prefer the cookie-cutter Disney mold with predictable stories but for people who enjoy an interesting and darkly imaginative tale, this is for you."

Yes it's true, I have never seen a movie in 3-D and boy was it something, but enough about the 3-D aspects. I wanted to see the movie way before I found out it would be showing in 3-D, I wanted to see the movie because this same director did the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas and I have been a fan of those clay-type animations with a dark storyline since. Based on a novella by Neil Gaiman, this movie gives you a sense of Alice in Wonderland with dark overtones. It is a great family movie in that it teaches everyone that (1) the grass is not always greener on the other side, and (2) be grateful for what you have. So watch the movie with someone and see what type of reaction you get from them at the end of movie, it may be an animation movie, but it does show you where your true value in life should be (family & friends)."

","A young girl walks through a secret door in her new home and discovers an alternate version of her life. On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life - only much better. But when her adventure turns dangerous, and her counterfeit parents try to keep her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home - and save her family.<br/><br/>It took me about a month to watch this but I finally did and I would like to say, it was worth the wait. To start things off, I would like to say this is a disturbing movie, more for the adults than to the kids, actually because of the subject matter. Is this a movie too scary for kids? It depends. If your child loves to be scared, probably like you were when you saw ""Jaws"" and ""The Poltergeist"" when you were a kid, this is the perfect movie for them.<br/><br/>The movie isn't scary, per se. It just has a lot to do with the mind. The movie is disturbing because the story itself is disturbing and if you can't tell by now, that's a rare thing. The movie is also, technically, very beautiful, including the 3D to heighten up the senses. The designs, the sets, the look, etc. is all very beautiful and sometimes very elaborate.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I was moved by parts of it, disturbed by parts of it, thrilled by parts of it, and humored by parts of it. The voice cast is good, although nothing special to mention about. However, there are some parts where the movie moves slowly. After all, the movie runs about 100 minutes, longer than most animated films. The film isn't perfect, yes, but it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and the best 3D movie I've ever seen! It's quite incredible. Well done, Henry Selick!"

I was very excited to see this because Henry has worked with Tim before, and both of their works are always AMAZING. <br/><br/>I loved how they did it in stop motion animation and it was incredible in 3D, very real. <br/><br/>This movie is about a young girl named Coraline who is a little bit neglected by her parents. She's a little bit of an outcast, she's her own person. They've just moved into a new house and she gets no attention from her parents.

","Even though the soundtrack includes a children's choir and a They Might Be Giants song, please don't bring toddlers to this movie, unless they are into hating their mothers and burning their dollies. Coraline excels at the bizarre and grotesque, and touches on the scary, even for us grown-ups. While I applaud most movies with ""facial structure supervisor"" and ""puppet wrangler"" in the credits, the 3D mastery and attention to detail in Coraline make this film visually orgasmic, from the dust on a car to the elaborate psychedelic garden to the drunk neighbor's billowing repulsive gut you can almost smell. A subtle theme, as one character in the film articulates, is in the realm of ""thou art alive; thou art still living"" but the real take-home message is this: Even though your parents may be neglectful and mean, at least you're not threatened with eternal damnation in a home with a woman claiming to be your mother who really just wants to steal your eyeballs and sew buttons in their place."

","Coraline- ****/**** <br/><br/>It is ironic that I found a more satisfying experience in terms of pure storytelling craft in a (supposed) children's film, than I do in most films released these days. Henry Selick's Coraline is a dark, stop motion fantasia. The film's roots can be traced back to the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm and the works of Lewis Carroll (as a reconstruction of the fairy tale it recalls the wonderful Pan's Labyrinth), fine company indeed. By essentially reworking Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the film begins with a predictable premise, but creates two separate worlds that are presented in enchanting 3-D.<br/><br/>Coraline Jones is a young girl who has recently moved to the Pink Palace, an apartment house inhabited by wild characters. However, Coraline is a bitter little girl, who is constantly feeling ignored by her workaholic parents. While exploring her new house, Coraline encounters a mysterious door leading to an alternate world, where everyone Coraline knows is changed to fit Coraline's image of what they should be. However this quasi- Utopia is revealed to be a much more sinister place than Coraline first thought. <br/><br/>Make no mistake, this film belongs to director Henry Selick, who has wrought not one, but two fascinatingly designed worlds, and as the film drives forward Selick continually ups the visual ante, making even the most tired clichÃ©s breathe with vibrant, rich life. This is a film with visual wonders to nourish the eye, visuals that follow the story all the way with its darkest implications.<br/><br/>Some have taken the film's script to task. Indeed, Coraline may have benefited from the touch of a writer strong enough to match Selick's visual artistry, but as it stands Coraline is competently written, or at least written well enough to render the script a non-issue.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, this is a visual film, as most animated features are. In its own plucky way Coraline is as great an achievement as Pixar's Wall-E. Some have complained that the film could lose ten to fifteen minutes, but I disagree. This is a film that I wish was lengthened, allowing this world to be presented without the machinations of plot. I want to be immersed in these worlds, even as the darkness inches closer."

","Last year, 2008, DreamWorks Animation Studios pulled a fast one on all of us by offering up an animated film that seemed poised to steal the coveted Best Animated Picture award at this year's Oscars, Kung Fu Panda. Awards king Pixar Studios, however, wasn't about to let that one go unanswered, as they subsequently unleashed their greatest masterpiece yet, WALL-E, the critical darling of the year and would-be Best Picture candidate.<br/><br/>This year, freshly-minted animation studio Laika has delivered what is likely to be the greatest blow to Pixar in many a blue moon, Coraline. Director Henry Selick, known for his The Nightmare Before Christmas job, improves on his previous effort with superior animation, pacing, and storytelling. Selick has crafted here an entrancing and original piece of art that, I believe, will reign supreme in next year's Best Animated Feature Oscar category. Coraline manages to be quite subtle in its first half, with a slow-burning tension and quiet, offsetting realism most films only dream of achieving. The anticipation builds as a bizarre and charming cast of characters are introduced, with purposes not entirely disclosed until we reach the wholly surprising final half. This set-up is incredible, and the multiple payoffs are even more so.<br/><br/>At precisely the moment the audience is begging for the characteristic grotesqueness of Selick's stop-motion animation features, the film explodes in a torrent of surreal, chilling, effectively creepy sequences that are relentlessly inventive. From a very mysterious, shadowlike feline, to the frightening spider-themed villain. From a walk around the circumference of an imagined dreamland, to a haunting circus tent, to a nightmarish garden, the settings here act as their own characters with astounding effectiveness.<br/><br/>This film has an extraordinarily classic feel to it, which may elicit audience members to reach back into their subconsciousness, asking themselves, ""where have I seen this movie before?"" You haven't, you only think you have because the story is so intrinsic that it feels like an amalgamation of every children's story you've ever heard in your life. No, this film is strikingly original, and it feels right at home tucked into the recesses of our mind where those other disturbing and unforgettable tales reside.<br/><br/>With haunting intensity, Laika has managed to craft here one of the greatest animated films of the decade. As we continue to follow Laika's future projects, I am hopeful that the added competition exhibited by animated films in recent years will allow some of our finest filmmakers around to pump out more and more masterpieces. My prediction for 2009 is that Laika's Coraline will outdo Pixar's newest offering, Up, in critical praise, and end-of-the-year awards.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

The only other kid for miles, Wybie (Robbie Bailey), is a rambling nerd with a strange pet cat, her mother (Teri Hatcher) is absorbed in meeting her deadline, her father (John Hodgman) is, well, simply absorbed, and her neighbors are elderly oddities, especially Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane, in a role that suits him), a former acrobat from Russia with an appreciation for stinky cheese. Things aren't necessarily bad, just weird and dull.<br/><br/>That is, until Coraline unlocks a door in the house far too small for most humans, and discovers another world, where another family awaits, similar to the first family, but with everything Coraline misses. All too soon, the lines between fantasy and reality blur, and Coraline is forced into making a decision that will either change her life or end it.<br/><br/>The usual nitpicks may rear their ugly heads when comparing the film to the novel, but in general, this is a great adaptation, in that it captures the essence of the story. Reality and fantasy blur as quickly for the viewers as they do for Coraline, which helps to plunge us into the urgency. The flowing animation, some of the best I've seen for stop-motion OR go-motion, rivals the best CGI; even surpasses it in digital! Details are well-pronounced, from Coraline's wardrobe (as well as the other characters'), to the evolving garden outside, to the near ever-present moon, which plays a peculiar role in marking time and stretching the suspense. Again, the film is best experienced in digital, and a worthwhile experience in 3-D, if you can plunk down the extra cash.<br/><br/>While the pace may drift in a few places, that is certainly a minor gripe. If you like a good suspense story, there's really no reason to stay away from the Pink Palace, unless of course, Grandma tells you to."

","Good day for Dakota Fanning fans, as she stars in 2 new flix opening this week; Coraline's the one to see 1st; Push (which I rated 7) is the one where you get to see HER.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's name appeared in front of 1993's The Nightmare before Christmas (7), but it was director Henry Selick who did most of the work. Selick's back with another round of the fiendishly painstaking technique known as stop-motion animation, this time of Neil Gaiman's novella, winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for 2003.<br/><br/>1st off, the film is an absolute visual delight, wonderfully well realized. 2nd, it's an even richer story than the novella. 3rd, it uses 3D effects tastefully; there are no yo-yos, lances, or pickaxes poking out of the screen at you.<br/><br/>The Jones family is newly moved into the Pink Palace Apartments, and Mom and Dad, both gardening writers, are frantically trying to meet a deadline, so they have no time for Coraline. She pokes around on her own, meeting the eccentric nabors, and eventually stumbles onto a secret door that leads to an alternate universe where her Other Mother and Other Father are much nicer and more attentive. They encourage her to stay permanently, something that will happen if she lets them sew buttons into her eyesockets, just like theirs. At this point, Coraline is understandably totally creeped out and wants to get back to the normal world, but Other Mother is, shall we say, both persistent and resourceful.<br/><br/>The art direction here will certainly go down in the history of cinema as a classic. That the film itself falls a tad short of that pinnacle is due to a slight distancing of Coraline from the audience; she is somebody we watch, not somebody we identify with, and that makes a difference just significant enuf to keep this otherwise excellent effort from my top score of 9."

It's a wonderful,colorful, and exciting adventure of a young girl with dark, almost morbid twists. It has very interesting animation and an eccentric collection of characters.

"dfranzen70","9","1","3","7 February 2009"," Technically immaculate, daring 3D adventure
","Coraline Jones moves into an old, pink house with her neglectful, condescending parents and finds a door to another world - a world that seems insanely perfect, including the presence of loving, attentive parents with buttons for eyes. And then things get weird in director Henry Selickâ€™s highly imaginative fantasy, filmed in dazzling 3D stop animation.<br/><br/>Thereâ€™s so much to like about this movie, but if you werenâ€™t a fan of The Nightmare before Christmas (also directed by Selick), you may as well stop reading: this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>There are two other tenants in the apartment house: an elderly British couple, stars of the stage (played by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French of Absolutely Fabulous) and a Russian acrobat whoâ€™s all limbs and belly (played by Ian McShane of Deadwood). All the tenants are oddballs who, one would think, would provide the bored Coraline with plenty of stimulation, but theyâ€™re a bit self absorbed - the actresses constantly competing with each other for any purpose, and the acrobat constantly working on his act with trained mice.<br/><br/>When Coraline stumbles upon a locked crawlspace door, sheâ€™s immediately intrigued, but unlocking it reveals only a brick wall. But then that night sheâ€™s awakened by a mouse under her bed who leads her back to the door, which, when she opens it, now shows a tenuous pathway to another, far-off door. Being the curious little girl she is, Coraline goes through the door, emerging in an exact replica of her own kitchen. Except different. The mother in this room is cooking, for one thing, which her real mother never does. And when the mother turns to greet Coraline, thereâ€™s another, even greater difference: she wears two black buttons for eyes. Gasp! Seems that this new world Coralineâ€™s discovered is perfect in every way, with wonderful, caring parents who dote on her every whimsy. Not only can her mom cook, she cooks everything Coraline wants. And her dad is a musician - the piano plays him! Oh, itâ€™s madness, I tell you, sheer madness. Then thereâ€™s outside! In the real world, itâ€™s a desolate yard, unencumbered by plant life (the irony here is that Coralineâ€™s parents are gardening writers), but here thereâ€™s a magnificent display, a visual cacophony of light and flowers and birds and bees. Itâ€™s astoundingly rendered in stop-motion animation, and itâ€™s even more wondrous in three dimensions.<br/><br/>But things arenâ€™t as they seem. The stark beauty of this other world and the kindness of the Other Mother are mere props in a greater play. The question posed is this: Will Coraline decide to stay in her new world, even if she must sacrifice to do so? Beyond the impressive cinematography (by Pete Kozachik, who was nominated for The Nightmare before Christmas), thereâ€™s also excellent voice work offered by Dakota Fanning as Coraline as well as Teri Hatcher (as Mother and Other Mother) and John Hodgeman (the IBM guy in those currently ubiquitous Apple ads). Fanning in particular was a good choice as the hurting, neglected Coraline.<br/><br/>Coraline is brilliantly conceived and stupendously executed. It has all the mystery and show-stopping magnetism of The Nightmare before Christmas, and it has even more heart. Know why? Because more so than Nightmare, this is a tale about love and redemption; you root for Coraline not only because sheâ€™s a psychologically lost girl but also because her antagonist is so hissably awful. The villain here is really a symbol for the feeling all kids have at some point of not being wanted or appreciated; Coraline must slay that dragon to survive."

The only moment I did smile was when Coraline threw the cat to the Other Mother. I find the Other Dad as well as the Real Dad a little annoying. His face was so long, it could have touch the floor and the eye bags! Oh, and the fact that the REAL parents were scribbling 'Help Us' on the mirror and later forgot about they, being trapped make the whole scene looked so fake. I mean, how can they not know that they were trapped in a place so cold and snow was falling off their clothes and they didn't realize that? I am pretty sure there will be a Coraline 2 as I can see the story hanging there. Perhaps the Other Mother manages to open the little door and began to haunt the city, so Coraline defends the entire city with Wyborne and a few more characters, perhaps. Can't wait for the next one and hopefully the crew can add in more action and suspense."

","I decided to watch Pink Floyd's THE WALL with my friend, who had just watched CORALINE for the umpteenth time, and wouldn't you know that old classic film is still showing itself in modern movies. I mean, a modern kids' movie is the last place you'd expect to see a drug and violence littered psychoanalysis, or is it? A rough, short list of visual comparisons: ~ The evil mother in CORALINE vs. the evil wife Silhouette that appears on pink's hotel room wall after his fit of crazy rage. ~ The two Ladies in the play Coraline goes to see, a haggard fat one and the other with tits that outweigh the rest of her body, bare a striking resemblance the Pink's wife and mother waiting backstage during ""the Trial"" ~Other images in CORALINE that appear in THE WALL include a praying mantis, originally used as a symbol for women after Pink flips out and later as a mechanical planter in Coraline's garden. Also, the image of the brick wall that separates Coraline from her dream world likewise separates Pink from the real world throughout THE WALL. Not mention all the flowers and who yet knows how many other images. ~Quick note, people who worked on CORALINE also worked on THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas, namely Henry Selick, and Jack Skeleton's head looks quiet a bit like the little doll caught in barbed wire during ""the Trial."" ~This is just an ""at a glance"" comparison, but we agree there are too many similarities for it to be coincidence. Some of these animation directors must have been sitting around, watching THE WALL, letting those pictures seep in and influence them 25 years later. So once again, no ideas are original, but they can sure get twisted, can't they?"

The other parents....
NONONONONONONONONO DON'T MAKE ME TALK ABOUT THE OTHER PARENTS!
The worst and most sickening mechanic in this film is how wonderful the other parents are!!!! They were supposed to be nice, very nice, but NORMAL PEOPLE, and the same goes for the meal and all the features of the other world were supposed to be great, maybe even magical, but they had strong sense of normality to it that really made it believable, and even to some people scary, something that I feel the film failed to pick up on.
Coraline is one of the brattiest and unlikeable characters I have ever seen. That's really all I have to say on that matter, why would some writer for whatever insane studio greenlit this abomination think that making Coraline the definition of spoilt would make people 'relate' to this 'character'. I would have considered the fact that Coralines an unlikeable character and I should deal with it and that this isn't the book if it made sense for her to act all bratty, but sadly it did not as her parents did anything but spoil her.
The dynamic between Miss Spink and Forcible was disappointing due to the failed potential as although the chemistry of the characters was great it was ruined by the bad writing, this for me made it one of my least favourite parts of this sea of filth.
On the subject of the writing the writing of this film, film, is that the right way to describe it? I found that if the writers read the skimmed over the book drunkenly and the next morning put in parts that they remembered from it every 20 minutes to remind you what film you're watching it would be a truer and more believable adaptation, in fact why don't they remake it using this method.
The movie is so dumbed down to pander to the growing audience of illiterate people that I would recommend it to a two year old that has very low standards! 0.0001/10"

I can see how it would be creepy for a child to watch and besides that, Coraline isn't a very good role model. She is a very unpleasant child, not nice at all. She is always nasty to friends and her parents, and she always has some sort of attitude. It is obvious that she gets her bad behavior from her parents. They don't seem to be the most adoring of parents. They never have any time for her and they sadly have no shame in letting her know that. Along with all of her other negative behavior, Coraline has bad manners. She merely throws things on the floor when she is through with them and is quite demanding with her parents.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of Coraline, the character or the movie. Aside from all of the negative character flaws, the film was slow moving and dull. Children would be attracted by all of the colors and graphics but there isn't much excitement.

","Like others said, really dumb characters and boring overall.

She's constantly reacting ridiculously to insane situations. Was she meant to be low-key mentally challenged or something? Because otherwise she's just plain badly written. Very unlikable and constantly putting herself in danger because she's that stupid (and badly written).<br/><br/>And again, overall very boring, with no redeeming qualities, and by all means - not for kids, not only for it's ""horror elements"" but out of fear that such arrogantly dumb characters may influence your child during a crucial developmental period."

","'Kid-friendly horror' is an interesting, if somewhat oxymoronic, concept. It isn't a genre - or, perhaps, idea - that's explored all too often. 'Coraline (2009)' is probably the first, and most effective, example of it that comes to mind. It confidently walks the tightrope of being tame enough for (older) children yet strong enough (to more than likely) scare those children just the right amount - all while, of course, being narratively and aesthetically appealing enough, in a creepy kind of way, for the adults in the audience, too. It's definitely a difficult thing to accomplish, yet the piece does so with ease. One of the ways it does this is by focusing on the adventurous, 'face your fears' aspects of its genre. This, along with its engaging and believable protagonist, makes for a compelling and accessible story that isn't mired in jump-scares, an oppressive atmosphere or gore. It's never dour and it actually leaves you feeling quite happy. When you think back, the emotion that first comes to mind isn't necessarily fear. Don't get me wrong, though, it's very much a 'horror' movie; it fits right in with those conventions, even if it also weaves in decent doses of fantasy, comedy and adventure. Personally, I don't find it scary but I don't think I'm supposed to - I'm an adult. You have to remember its target audience. It's meant to be a gateway horror to introduce potential new fans to the genre. It actually plays into legitimate fears - based on legitimate, if short-sighted, desires - and is resonant because of it. Besides which, it's just downright entertaining and that's the most important thing. The design of the flick, which is brought to life with beautiful stop-motion, is brilliant. The initially wonderful 'other' world contorts from whimsical to creepy in incredibly inventive, world-consistent ways. There are some spooky set-pieces that feature superbly unsettling, but still suitably pastel, imagery. Plus, the colourful characters that inhabit both of the picture's parallel planes are thoroughly enjoyable. It's interesting, and almost disturbing, that the characters created by the 'other mother' are essentially slaves; they're aware of their status as constructs but don't actually want to serve their function and constantly try to warn our hero of the danger she's in, often suffering horrible consequences and losing what little imitated humanity they were initially afforded. On top of all this, the flick has strong allegorical undertones which bolster its strong central message. You come away from it feeling elated. Ultimately, it's a uniquely presented, consistently entertaining and, in many ways, daringly dark family film, one that you can watch again and again. It's just delightful. 8/10"

Well, the problem with children's movies is that the critical moment is always slow to unwind and tiring to watch, but I understand that it is for childrens and have to be that way, I don't like, may I'm wrong.

But even though there isn't everything from the book in the film, it is brilliant. If you liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, then you will love this!<br/><br/>The story is of a young girl who moves to a new home and discovers another world inside a little door, where everything is better but this wonderful place isn't exactly what it seems.<br/><br/>I remember watching this film at the cinema and my mum got up to go to the bathroom and I went with her, I waited outside the loos and she said ""Aren't you going"" and I said ""No I just wanted to get away from that film"". No don't be put off by that comment because it was the first creepy film I'd watched and I was about 7. But I was determined to love this film for what it was, so I watched it over and over and I am no longer scared by it!<br/><br/>The animation is stunning and the work that everyone has done on the film is magnificent *small applause*. It is so amazing that everything is made by hand and they have been so creative with what they use; the blossoms on the trees are painted popcorn and one of the flowers is a dog toy that has been cut in half.<br/><br/>I would say when Coraline realises what is really happening in the Other World, the scenes become a little disturbing but I would just watch it because it's a great film.<br/><br/>I don't want to put you off this film because it is wonderful! I am so glad it has been the start of a new journey for Laika as well, with films like ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls following after it.

","The summary is important to the experience but admittedly trivial to the story telling. You all know how I adore fun and smart storytelling. Alternate realities or what if scenarios have their place in cinema but are best not set up as such. Let us discover there other worlds and realize the goods and perils on our own. Thanksfully we are left to our own smarts even if the movie watcher deal of plausible mythology falls short on delivery. Same issue with Pans' Labyrinth. Here we have another dark child's' story whose villain is on par with serial kidnappers. Our three ghosts at the end confirm the wickedness at hand. That exceeds children's story lines in my acceptable script book, but then that story is seeming left to the parents to explain later. Mythology fail. Carolines' determination to be independent and then return to the scene of the sumptuous horror to save her parents is equally heroic. This works on face level without being all saccharine and plastic roses, thankfully! Another reviewer has detailed the Alice In Wonderland links, so I'll just say that the ""home"" and ""grass is always greener"" messages were evidently accessible where the ghosts of the past simply left the Parents holding the bag of explaining evil in the world right after the kids have been shown to appreciate what they've got."

","This Gothic animation feature comes from Henry Selick, the man who brought us THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (1993), which is frequently mistaken as Tim Burton's work (actually Burton is only the co-producer and co-writer, as a matter of fact, Burton directed his debut animation feature not until CORPSE BRIDE in 2005). <br/><br/>The dark palette of our indomitable Coraline's fairytale distinguishes itself from other light- colored Hollywood cartoons interwoven with motley kids-friendly visualizations and vapidly didactic tone. Since the opening scene, my expectation of being thrilled had been hovering high, and I baldly assert that its audience's threshold age could be much older, which should had been a deadly challenge for a mainstream animation, nevertheless the film conquered its demographic range and gained a sprightly success in the box office and a nomination of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE in Oscar 2010. <br/><br/>Speaking of the film itself, the 2-D character-designing deserves some standing ovation, the wackiness resides seamlessly inside each of them. Meanwhile the narrative reflects a deep empathy upon everyone's own grown-up issues, such as there is no unearned harvest in the world, never believe something which is too good to be true. <br/><br/>The voice cast is superb, I even could not recognize it's Dakota Fanning if I had overlooked the opening credits and Teri Hatcher carries a nuisance between her two opposite roles as real mother Vs. evil mother. <br/><br/>One little complain here, I am still not able to figure out the whole cause and effects of the evil mother's ""button-eye"" plan, which lacks a plausible explanation for me to digest. Besides that, the film excels in every each way to be considered a successfully unorthodox innovator in its own category. <br/><br/>P.S.

Coraline at first loves this place, but then she gets creeped out by it once she learns about the eyes. As do we.

","What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for? Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy. But as the old adage says, ""Be careful what you wish for"" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this ""perfect"" world and these ""perfect"" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time. Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time. The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to. As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal. Like all good fantasies made for kids, ""Coraline"" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can't even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).<br/><br/>But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful ""other"" world that Coraline visits - not by a long shot. For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales. Thus, since ""Coraline"" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences. Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.<br/><br/>The animation is first-rate on every level. The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas""). Yet, ""Coraline"" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on."

Plaudits all around the world rightly justified the achievement made in order to adapt the Neil Gaiman novel. The effects really are superb. Back over a decade ago Selick's renowned picture The Nightmare before Christmas was likewise a sharp advance in the animation world.<br/><br/>The days before Pixar are almost forgettable exempt for cartoon Disney. And rightly so that picture still remains a classic, and where this doesn't have the panache of that hit, it should be praised for the breathtaking visuals and bewildering dark plot.<br/><br/>The impressive title sequence with all the knitting works a treat as we see the scale of the task of 3D working away magically. And though we don't know it yet this little sequence shapes things to come.<br/><br/>The first couples of plot events are pretty standard social setting with Coraline isolated and looking for things to do. And at first the blue haired child is certainly aggravating. Her constant whining and bothering with her parents are reminiscent of today's modern youthful stereotype. Nevertheless Coraline's curiosity and imagination are to be admired and as the plot gets darker and more dangerous, the title character becomes easier to watch. The collection of characters together make interesting viewing as ""The other mother"" demonstrates a delicious slice of hidden evil whilst it is wonderful character development regarding the father figure in both worlds. The black cat is great fun for the kids as well.<br/><br/>This concept regarding the two worlds is highly imaginative and a wondrous challenge to tackle as we viewers join Coraline as she tries to decode her own reality and desires. The weaving of emotions into dreams makes everything juicy and springy. The contrasts of positives and negatives, dreams and nightmares and good and evil are all present with a script thriving on drama and fantasy.<br/><br/>The scene settings are picturesque to capture the plot's ever changing moods whilst the lighting and animation consistently spill the goods.<br/><br/>However given everything that works in the making of this, there are still a few major doubts. For one the plot isn't what you would describe as excellent as the dialogue in the action sequences make for questioning. There can also be too much talk at frequent significant stages where more action would have been better placed. And in all honesty, a large proportion is conventional fantasy and drama. The kid hates her family, wants escapism; the bad people are egotistical and script-fully inevitable.<br/><br/>Though the original nature of his previous smash is missing Selick really has created a spellbinding picture, and let the animation development continue."

","Coraline Jones is a girl who is bored with her life and wants to find some excitement. Her dream comes true when she finds a secret door in the new house she moved into. Which takes her into a alternative universe where everything is just the way she wants it, but all isn't what it seems. I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman but from what I heard and read it follows is pretty closely. This is a film that kids and even adults can enjoy, it's atmosphere is a bit dark and kinda like watching a crazy dream come to life but you just can't help but be enveloped in this world. The whole premise was hauntingly pretty to look at and it's even choreographed really well. For me it was like watching a very dark version of ""Alice in Wonderland"". I am not a fan of Dakota Fanning, but she really does shine in this film and her voice acting is superb. ""Coraline"" is a film for all ages to enjoy and have a good time with.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","Coraline: 7 out of 10: Whom is this movie for is a question that dashed through my mind while watching it. It is too scary and adult for most children. The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.<br/><br/>As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.<br/><br/>While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coralineâ€™s two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep. To bad the water was a little cold for this swimmer."
"Tweekums","10","0","2","15 October 2009"," Brilliant animation
","Having seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" many times and loving every minute of it I was keen to see Henry Selick's latest stop-go animation story. When I learnt that the film was based on a book by Neil Gaiman I was even more certain that I would enjoy it. When I watched ""Coraline"" I was not disappointed in the slightest. I hadn't seen a 3D film since the awful Jaws 3D so wasn't sure how the 3D would work here, thankfully it felt immersive rather than just having the occasional item appear to jump out the screen. Watching on DVD meant wearing red/green glasses which obviously had an effect on the colour of the film, while many colours appeared washed out others appeared much more intense such as Coraline's blue hair and yellow coat. Thankfully this just had the effect of making the film slightly more creepy.<br/><br/>The heroine of this film is the eponymous Coraline, her family have moved from Michigan to rural Oregon. She is bored there and her parents are too busy to do anything with her. While exploring the old house they have moved into she finds a small door; at first it is bricked up but later as she is asleep it opens, she wakes up and follows a mouse through the door. When she get to the other side she finds herself in what appears to me her own house but it isn't quite the same, everything is slightly better. When she goes downstairs she finds her mother cooking, at least she thinks it is her mother till she turns around and reveals that instead of eyes she has two black buttons. After initial concern she begins to love the new world and is tempted to stay until she learns what the price of staying is... to have her eyes replaced with buttons. Things then get creepier as her ""other mother"" is determined that Coraline will stay.<br/><br/>As one would expect from the creator of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" the animation is fantastic, be warned though this is a much darker story which parents might want to watch before letting younger children view it, while many children will delight in its creepiness others might have nightmares. The voice cast did a fine job notably Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Teri Hatcher as her mother and French and Saunders as the two ex-burlesque dancers who live downstairs. I certainly recommend this film for adults and most children, just remember it might be a bit scary for very young or timid children."
"aschein81","9","0","3","3 October 2009"," Brilliant...the best animated movie in years
","First, let me point out that this film could easily have been rated PG-13. In fact, the 2nd half of this film is more frightening than most of the other PG-13 movies out there, even though it is animated. That being said, this movie is probably too scary for anyone under about 9 years old. I also believe its story is too complex for anyone under about 9 years old. Parents will have to make their own decisions regarding this, but just don't be surprised if your child is a little confused by the story or a little bored by the lack of action scenes. This is basically a character study film aimed at a more intelligent audience with somewhat developed attention spans.<br/><br/>One of the first things I noticed while watching this movie in the theaters (and I also have seen it about 4 times on DVD already) is how very little ""action"" is in the film, especially for an animated film. At 1 hour and 40 minutes long, it is about 10-20 minutes longer than most every other children's movie these days. Its focus is not on fun or adventure, but rather on telling a character study based on Coraline's lonely and insecure life. This will bore many kids who go to the movies expecting the loud, colorful, chase scenes that animated movies usually have to keep the attention of their target audience. No, instead of going for action Coraline is brilliant by taking its sweet little time to build up atmosphere and intensity. One of the ways Selick does this is by filming 95% of the film either inside Coraline's house or just outside the house, somewhere in the yard. As you watch the film, this claustrophobic feeling starts to build, as you realize that you are stuck in this house and in this yard, just like Coraline. This really creates the intensity and emotion, along with the fear that comes in the 2nd half of the film. The beautiful musical score contributes to this claustrophobic feel as well.<br/><br/>Unlike some animated movies that feel like they have about an hour's worth of script material, then spend the next 15 minutes on some climactic action scene (again, this has to do with a studio dumbing down the plot to please the attention spans of the kids), this movie has A LOT of story to tell during its running time. And it's a good story. A compelling, engaging, and complete story. And it is told so smoothly by Director Henry Selick. It does not at all surprise me that this book won the Newberry Award some years ago.<br/><br/>I'm just very pleased to see that studios have the guts to tell engaging, high-quality stories like this. Along with Wall-E, this is a positive sign that not everyone in Hollywood refuses to stifle creativity. Yes, it is scary at times, and yes parts of it are reminiscent of parts of the Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Pan's Labyrinth, etc...but this film is still so original when compared to the crap Hollywood makes these days. This film is truly a work of art, and I hope Henry Selick starts getting more work!"
"jburtroald95","9","0","2","27 September 2009"," Marvellous!
","As incredible as Coraline is, we cannot say it is an ""unexpected delight"". When it became known to us that this film would be based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, the author of Stardust, and that Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' Henry Selick was going to direct and write the screenplay, we knew we were in for a treat. The voice cast here â€“ which includes Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Keith David and Ian McShane â€“ is superb, and the remarkable originality and creativity that surrounds this wonderful story makes this a serious contender for this year's hotly contested Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.<br/><br/>The adventures of feisty young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning,) the neglected daughter of two dull grocers Charlie (voiced by John Hodgman) and Mel (voiced by Teri Hatcher) begin when she meets the talkative yet friendly Wybie Lovat (voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.) a boy who lives nearby who finds and gives to her a stuffed doll with buttons eyes that look exactly like her. This is the start of a monstrous plot invented by the ""Other mother"" (Hatcher again) to spy on Coraline and find the faults in the young girls life, then use this information to create a perfect and intoxicating world to impress Coraline, luring her into it with a mysterious secret door.<br/><br/>Regardless of the fact that this is of course a children's film, you'll find that there is genuine tension created by the film's mid-way point. This is not only due to the brilliantly crafted plot, but by the ingenious and meticulous design of the always delightful claymation that possesses a charm, devotion and power that CGI lacks tremendously.<br/><br/>Though Selick's direction isn't quite as tight as his screen writing. The script of Coraline contains the same flaws as those of other, similar animated films such as Nightmare Before Christmas and 'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' (2005) where the overall concept of the narrative is sensational and highly imaginative, but the results of the writers' difficulties in turning it into a story of reasonable length are rather tiring and tedious."

","Lewis Carroll had read a lot of Charles Dickens when he wrote ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through..."" a century and a half ago. He understood the formidable mind of the neglected child with an IQ of 130 or more.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","2","20 September 2009"," Creativity makes ""Coraline"" one of stop-motion's finest
","It seems like Pixar is the only company producing outside-the-box animated adventures these days, but don't discredit ""Coraline,"" Laika Entertainment's second stop-motion feature after Tim Burton's ""The Corpse Bride."" Based on the Neil Gaiman book, ""Coraline"" is one of the more creative stories and executions of family entertainment to have come out in awhile and almost unquestionably one of the best stop-motion films ever made.<br/><br/>Although ""Coraline"" is certainly not for kids under 7 years old who are easily susceptible to nightmares, that doesn't change the quality of craftsmanship. Director Henry Selick, easily one of the best stop-motion directors next to Nick Park of the ""Wallace & Gromit"" series and maybe the more creative and daring between the two, brings a creepy surrealism and an abstract design to a story that begs for it.<br/><br/>""Coraline"" is about a girl of the same name who moves into a new house with her apathetic parents that don't seem interested in her needs at all. She finds a small door in her new house that leads to an alternate reality with seemingly perfect parents -- only they have button eyes. But things aren't as rosy as they seem and Coraline soon finds herself in trouble.<br/><br/>Immediately, ""Coraline"" charms you with the creative imagining of its world. I'm unfamiliar with the book, but I believe it's without pictures, making Selick and his creative team's vision a true accomplishment. Not unlike Selick's work in ""The Nightmare before Christmas,"" the figures have abstract shapes and exaggerated bodies whether it's Coraline's dad's slightly long neck or the neighbor Mr. Bobinsky's tiny appendages but ball-shaped midsection. Even the slight tilt in Coraline's head adds something to her character that peaks your curiosity in a way that a more traditional CGI animation might not necessarily do.<br/><br/>The beauty of the story is that Coraline learns a very fine lesson in reality versus idealism, that reality can be deceiving in both good and bad ways and that our parents, even if they're not always the nicest and best and giving us what we like, are the best thing we've got as a child. It's a perfect fit for stop-motion -- the subtle (and not so subtle) distortions between reality and alternate but ultimately fictitious reality -- and Selick really uses that to his and ultimately our advantage. ~Steven C<br/><br/>http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

Like Lynch films, it seems to exist in a universe of its own, where an entirely different set of logic applies. The imagery in the film can be quite frightening at times, but it's also quite beautiful in its own way.

","I saw this movie a few months back in theaters. When I saw the trailer I wasn't sure how it would be, but once I got to the theater it turned out to be really good! I never read the novel though the movie was very enjoyable. Coraline is a young only child who lives with her two remote parents in an old rickety house. She lives a pretty depressing life, and often finds herself bored. Her mom and dad's persona is very limp. The only friends she has is a boy next door whom she does not even share much in common with. Towards the beginning of the film she starts to explore her surroundings. During her adventure she comes across an old well next to a forest, two quirky old ladies, and a tall blue man. She also explores the house. During one exploration she finds a little door. She goes into the door, and passes through a tunnel which takes her into a dream-like setting. The setting is composed of a mirror image of her world. Except everything is different. At first it seems to be a perfect version of her world. But she soon finds out that it is really a nightmare and has to find a way out. This movie is very imaginative and intelligent. I was really impressed. It's really creepy and suspenseful for an animated movie... actually for any movie. Don't let your kids watch it. Neil Gaiman, is the author of Coraline. His books are refereed to as ""Horror for Children"", and that's what Coraline is. Coraline isn't just a movie, watching it is like entering another world. Watching it is like entering a haunting, scary nightmare. There are no rules and anything can happen. And the scariest things imaginable do happen. It's a very good movie."

","A little too spooky for the under-10 crowd. Younger children could be frightened by overtly threatening nature of the last third of the movie, but the older viewer will be able to appreciate that the truly unnerving part of this film is actually in the middle, beginning with the little hints that something is not quite right with this world. This feeling is enhanced by the dramatic irony (that Coraline does not yet recognize her peril). The scenes with the silent Wybie were, to me, the best in this regard.<br/><br/>My favorite quote (and it's not even in the IMDb quote list): Coraline, to herself, watching the cat disappear with the rat in its mouth: ""Gooooood Kitty."""

","We weren't quite sure what to expect with Coraline. We knew it would be good since it was a Tim Burton film and we ended up being very pleased with it.

It would be a little too creepy for children who aren't able to distinguish fantasy from reality, so I would recommend it to children 7+.<br/><br/>The film is done in claymation, but it is done so well that after a few minutes, you hardly notice it. Mr. Burton did a wonderful job on all of the characters. He did a great job matching personalities and looks to each of the characters and they are characters that anyone can relate to. The music was absolutely wonderful and quirky and carried you through the scenes. I would love to see this in 3-D. Adults are able to enjoy this just as much as children and I am very pleased with this film. It's original, creative, well-done, and worth a look. Definitely worth a purchase.

","Without doubt the most inventive animated feature of the year. Cinematically Gothic, yet deliciously cute, designed with unparalleled creativity by Henry Selick who brought us The Nightmare before Chrismas and Monkeybone.

She and her parents move into a new flat complex in rural Oregon (actually it is a very old flat complex). Coraline is unhappy and bored with the place until one night she finds a door to a parallel world and the adventure of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Henry Selick's vision is unique and original, yet it shows hints of possible influence from some of the great artistic visions of the 20th century. The world comes to life in a very Dr. Seuss, or Wizard of Oz kind of way, and with caricatures similar to those of famed children's illustrator Tomi Ungerer (Moonman, The Three Robbers) Of course it also bear great resemblance to his Gothic classic, The Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>Coraline is a little too dark perhaps to be a good family feature, I certainly don't recommend it for little kids, but it is perfect for everyone else."

","I went into the film as an avid fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is of course also directed by Henry Selleck and not some guy called Tim Burton like every other person seems to think, including my film studies teacher.<br/><br/>So I was hopeful and even a little expectant in what I wanted from the film. The trailers had hinted at an eerie sub-plot to the movie and this is carried out delightfully throughout the film. But sadly this main point of story is what detracted from the film, but only minimally. The opening of the film spends too much time lumbering over character and setting, showing the undoubtedly beautiful animation at its very best. But its pace was slow, and I felt that if a film at 100 minutes running time feels slow then there is a problem.<br/><br/>Aside from this slight lack of cohesion the film was brilliant. It picked up pace furiously towards the climax, which is easily the best part of the film. Its characters were likable, there were a few funny moments, although no laugh at loud ones, and there was an enjoyable experience for all to have. Whether its for children being immersed into this gloomy environment or for adults marvelling at how beautifully and skillfully the film was made.<br/><br/>I came into the movie desperately wanting to love it, but came out just admiring it wildly."
"Sturmknecht","8","0","2","2 June 2009"," Utter Brilliance
","If I had to sum up this movie with two words they would be the following: Utter brilliance.<br/><br/>This picture is outstanding in every single way - of course you have to be a fan of stop motion films - but if you can enjoy their charm and have a little flair for surreal fantasy I promise that you will not be disappointed. In my humble opinion this movie even beats 'A Nightmare Before Christmas', for itself a truly great film already. But lets stop with the praising and bring on some facts.<br/><br/>I was astounded by the way the whole movie looks. The design of the whole movie very special and thought through to the tiniest bits. It is obvious that the makers of this movie really put a lot of effort into the small details - you may not even notice them the first time you see them, but they make the world and the whole story in Coraline that much more fun and make everything seem to 'fit together'. The voice acts are chosen very good as well, they really bring out the characters that the visual design is presenting on screen.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the story. Without any spoilers: It is a clever mix of spooky fantasy tale that 'leaks' into the real world and mixes up with the problems the little girl Coraline has with her parents. The concept is not new at all, but the details are nicely worked out nonetheless - and to be honest while watching the movie I was far to much baffled with all brilliant animations and things going on to wonder about the story.<br/><br/>The animations of this movie deserve their own special kudos. As a spectator you can sometimes hardly tell if what you're seeing is real, or stop motion or CGI - it just blends in perfectly. And you will get to see things I did not even think possible with stop motion technique. Make sure to stay after the credits for a very short outtake where you see the making of a stop motion scene before they retouched the supporting props.<br/><br/>The score of Coraline is another praiseworthy feature. It got a distinct character and a recurring theme that is picked up multiple times over the whole movie - but without being repetitive or cheap. The soundtrack really helped to capture my attention during the whole of the 100 minutes.<br/><br/>All in all: Coraline is in my eyes a truly great movie for everyone, especially if you're into stop motion pictures or sinister fantasy stories. To parents out there: Although it might look like it this is not a children's film, so you might think about seeing the movie first before you show it to your eight year old kids... (There isn't any inappropriate content at all, but the story and the visuals are rather intense.)<br/><br/>I hope my comment has helped you.

The visual presentation of Coraline' world (and the other world) is amazing, the animation is so real, whether it is wonderful dreamland or eerie creepy land. The plot's obligatory moral applies to both children and adults. Who does not want more? And yet, people who want so much and then want some more are bound to regret that they have not treasured what they already have."

","Coraline is visually arresting and somewhat twisted, but what would you expect from the minds behind the film? Neil Gaiman's voice has always been a bit Gothic and warped, but it adds to his appeal. You can see a Henry Sellick picture a mile away, even if many confuse him with Tim Burton simply because Sellick directed a Tim Burton written film (Seriously though people, the film would not have been the same without Sellick. Give him some freakin' credit!) and had it be his biggest success, and truly his best film. Until now.<br/><br/>I didn't really know what to expect going into Coraline, although I love Neil Gaiman, I have yet to read the novel, but I did at least figure the film would be good if it stayed to his distinct style. Thankfully, it did although much more in the vein of his more lighthearted stories such as Anansi Boys than the neo-Gothic of American Gods. The film is still plenty dark though, just enough to grip an older audience and put a little fear into the younger ones, but not enough to scare them off. Just as the dark parts are engaging, the humour isn't half bad either. There are several scenes that are chuckle worthy and have that distinct Gaiman-bite that made his more comedic pieces so much fun. A lot of the humour comes from the titular character, which makes her a bit more likable, considering that she's not your typical heroine. Rather than being brave and abstractly noble, shes a little brat. Well, okay, so things change for the climax, but Coraline is portrayed a bit more realistically when it comes to the way your typical spoiled 8 year old would be. Dakota Fanning does a great job playing Coraline as well, and is probably a better voice than live actress.<br/><br/>In the end, Coraline is a highly entertaining film. It has amazing visuals, a fun, sometimes twisted and creepy but imaginative story, and great characters, each with their own quirk that makes you glad they came onto the screen. It's nice to see a family film that takes a few risks and delves into a darker territory, but it knows where to stop without going to far, and it knows how to please a fully adult crowd as well.<br/><br/>Here's to another Neil Gaiman-Henry Sellick collaboration in the future."

","I must say this was one of the most visually stunning film that I do not think will ever be matched again, unless Henry Selick decides to do more claymation in 3D. I am really excited about this 3D revolution and what it can mean for movies, but there will be enough movies where it is just a gimmick, but this film it is wonderfully implemented and possibly claymation is the perfect medium for 3D. The world actually felt like I should be able to reach out and touch it. I completely forgot almost immediately that this was stop motion and that it was in 3D at all. I really was emerged into the world completely. The score was fantastic and the voice acting was as good as it needed to be. The best part was that we have a visually stunning film combined with a top notch story. I really enjoy how Neil Gaiman does not try to make a fluffy kids film, but made a kid's film that taps into the fears of a child and creates a world, that seems as if I might have created as a child. The story is a kids story, without doubt. But adults can love the story in the same way that any adult loves playing with a child within the limitations of the kids imagination. I cannot express my love of this movie anymore, but I must insist that this is seen in 3D. I hope 3D does not just turn into a way of showing off latest technology, but a tool a good director can use to help immerse the viewer into the world. I also have to note that I saw this movie with really high expectations and all of them were surpassed. A quick word about the viewing experience. I probably the last 3D showing in the Albany area and it was at 10:30 or so at night so I was literally the only one in the theater. So basically everything about the experience was magical. To throw one quick criticism out there I wished there were more than just a few hints at the mysterious connection of the real world with the other world."

","I've had a lot of respect for the Pixar folks over the past several years. I enjoyed THE INCREDIBLES and WALL-E and to a lesser extent FINDING NEMO and RATATOUILLE. CORALINE is a different class of movie altogether. While Pixar has been breaking barriers in realism, CORALINE follows Alice down the rabbit hole into a world of fantasy. And it's a fantasy land I haven't visited in a while: a welcome change. CORALINE's world is designed to beguile her with wonder and Henry Selick manages to beguile the audience with wonder too. This is the first 3D movie I've seen that actually knows what to do with the process. While the story is as classic as a trip down the rabbit hole or to Oz, its sinister twist and vivid imagination make it a fresh experience."

","I could easily pile up a mountain of superlatives here and say there won't be a better movie this year; it's very early, so there might still be a chance. Whichever the case might be, it's going to be tough to top the levels of creativity, beauty, and talent we see in this masterpiece.<br/><br/>With some obvious parallels to the basic storyline in ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Coraline"" has some big shoes to fill, and this is done from its very early scenes, as the craftsmanship, modern cinematic advancements in 3-D, and the skillful direction show that we are going to witness a special film. After our mouths close from looking at the gorgeous universe of Coraline's ""boring"" world, we are deftly enveloped by the magical script, and the experience continues, as we meet what we believe are the main characters of the story. In reality, nothing is what it appears to be, and since we are identifying with Coraline's frustrations and ennui, we must also channel her reactions and have a taste of what is to come.<br/><br/>Very little will prepare you for our introduction to the world that will attempt to seduce our heroine. There were hints of the powerful visuals that superb artists can create with stop motion and thorough knowledge of colors and shapes, but the beauty and composition in the ""parallel universe"" is like nothing we have seen before. For a moment, I felt like the 1939 audiences must have felt when Dorothy walked into the wonderful world of Oz. Here is a world where fantasies can come true, wishes become reality, and our lives might never be the same.<br/><br/>We will expecting much more from our movies after this superb and sublime film. It is like staring at the muses of the Greeks in the face, seeing how simple shapes and colors, basic concepts such as love, loss, fear and happiness are manipulated to give a fresh twist to stories we have seen before.<br/><br/>Much credit should be given to two of the actors in this film who give life to Coraline and her two mothers. Without their flawless interaction, the film would not soar. There is also a lovely score that charms, haunts, and seduces us into believing there is some magic left out there.<br/><br/>There is a very simple moral to the story, but its presentation is anything but routine; it's a marvel to behold and to emulate, something that should be treasured forever."

","I happily got to see this not just in 3-D but with Neil Gaiman in attendance, and he talked about how the whole story is basically an edit of the bizarrely appalling stories his five-year-old daughter had told HIM. I hope that settles the question of whether semi-horror material is suitable for children, already. The interesting thing is how the genre is transformed by the demographic - in place of shocks, we get cold creeps oozing out around the edges of extremely terse tonal control. It's so level, so deliberate, that at first it's kind of disorienting, wrong. But that's just another way of situating the horrors in the 'real' life of the heroine - they are a continuity or a mutation, not a break, from her neurotic home life. Neurotic, not evil - another coup; the parents are dimensional and comprehensible even though they are also a serious pain in the ass. Looks great, of course."
"Argemaluco","8","0","3","14 March 2009"," Not great,but it's a very solid movie
","How many times will writer Neil Gaiman recycle Alice in Wonderland ? I have three examples of that : the graphic novel A Game of You, the screenplay of the movie MirrorMask, and the short novel Coraline.And,thinking it well,the graphic novels The Books of Magic (with a male main character) and Death: The High Cost of Living (investing the oneiric world with the real one) could also fit on that category.But well...I guess we can ignore those repetitions if we consider them the as ""recurring subjects"" from the author.If someone has won the right of rethinking Lewis Carroll's formula is undoubtedly Gaiman,whose perfect domination of fantasy and its perfect balance with the real world has brought us literary masterpieces like American Gods,Good Omens and The Sandman.I was thinking all that when I had finished watching the movie Coraline.This movie is not great but I could forget of any comparison with Alice in Wonderland because I had had a very good time with its simple but at the same time deep story,its emotive moments,its correct observations and with director Henry Selick's visual magic.I am very happy to see Selick finally getting recognition,after being unfairly ignored for his solid work in the film The Nightmare Before Christmas,which is considered for many people,as a director Tim Burton's work,when in fact,it was Selick's.Honestly,I think Coraline is superior to The Nightmare Before Christmas for the simple fact the original material is more ingenious and that,combined with Selick's bizarre sensibility,it gets an appropriate balance between eccentric humor and disturbing fantasy.Fortunately,that sensibility is not out of control in Coraline (at the difference of Monkeybone) because,at working with Gaiman's short story,Selick had to ""domesticate"" his bizarre imagination and use it as a tool for telling the story.The result is very entertaining and with some creepy moments.I have two complains against Coraline.For one sight,some elements feel a little bit forced and out of place while there are a few moments in which the movie looses the focus of story.However,in spite of that,Coraline is a very solid movie which is not great,but it is very entertaining and I like to see a Gaiman's work very well adapted,specially after the disappointing Stardust.I recommend this movie with confidence because I liked it pretty much."
"Seamus2829","10","0","3","13 March 2009"," Kudos To Henry Sellick
","Henry Sellick is one gem of an animator to be reckoned with. His contribution to stop motion animation is superb. I had my world rocked big time with 'Nightmare Before Christmas',as well as 'James And The Giant Peach'. Sellick mines the harbor of author Neil Gaiman (American Gods)with the story of Coraline, a feisty 11 year-old girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning)who is very unhappy with the fact that she's been moved from her original home (as well as her best friends),to live in a creepy old house, with some pretty weird neighbors. When Coraline finds a portal into a alternate dimension with parents who seem like the ideal parents,Coraline seriously decides to cross over to that realm,for good. Somehow, something seems...well...not quite right. The film gets some good mileage from the other voice talents on parade here (including Terri Hatcher as both her Mothers). This lovingly stop motion animated feature film is available in both 3-D digital projection, as well as standard 2-D,for the benefit of cinemas that do not have the set ups for 3-D,digital projection (if you have the open window of opportunity to see the 3-D edition,by all means,do it--although the 2-D animated prints would be just as much fun). Handed a PG rating by the MPAA,this film serves up some situations that are pretty creepy & scary for the little ones (much like 'Nightmare Before Christmas'was). Older youngsters will eat it up."

"Jonny_Numb","8","0","3","4 March 2009"," Dazzling and Beautiful, Macabre and Hideous
","Underneath all the conceptual quirkiness of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a story about characters finding and accepting their true identities (lesson learned: Halloween and Christmas just don't mix). Adapting Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name, director Henry Selick also turns ""Coraline""Â–the tale of a disenchanted young girl who retreats to a fantasy worldÂ–into a character study whose appeal stretches past its obvious ""12 and under"" demographic. Above all, the film is a visual feast (even more so in 3D) of ceaselessly imaginative imagery that runs the gamut from dazzling and beautiful to macabre and hideous. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a blue-haired, sarcastic preteen who moves to an isolated rooming house with her cold, distant parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman); her only 'friend' is a gawky neighbor boy who furnishes her with a button-eyed doll that bears a striking resemblance to our heroine. In an act of boredom-curbing exploration, Coraline discovers a hidden door in the house that acts as a gateway to a flipside world, where seemingly perfect dopplegangers of the people in her ""real"" life possess button eyes, but are ominously attentive and caring. Parallels to the works of Lewis Carroll and Bill Watterson are apt (Coraline gets worldly advice from a talking feline), and what complements the stellar imagery is the metaphoric intelligence of the story: ""Coraline"" is a dark fantasy, but its anchor is the mature revelations of its main character and the familiarity and sanctity of the family unit (while admirably abandoning any tendencies toward cloying, melodramatic Family Values)."
"refresh_daemon","7","0","2","4 March 2009"," Wonderfully artistic with a strong story; but loses a little steam in the second half
","Coraline, an animated adaptation of the Neil Gaiman book, appropriately directed by Henry Selick, who you might know as the director of similarly scary children's films such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Coraline follows suit with incredible visuals and an interesting story, but there are still a couple story issues that keep it from fully matching the wonder of the visuals. Oh, and I watched it in 3-D and will have a couple things to say about that too.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the movie is a visual treat. All the imagery looks fantastic and imaginatively different from mainstream children's fare, clearly more in line with Selick and Burton's work. The combination of stop-animation and computer graphics is impressive, but more impressive is the art design, everything having such a cohesive look. I do have to put a note of caution in that the film does have a touch of minor grotesque/comical near-nudity in it and although I don't find it problematic myself, someone else might prefer that their children are not exposed to it. All the same, the visuals are spectacular.<br/><br/>Also, the stereoscopic 3D effect is pretty cool, I have to admit, even if the glasses are uncomfortable and make me feel funny in my head. It certainly adds a depth to the movie and while it isn't a necessity, I liked the effect. It didn't seem to be used in a gimmicky way in Coraline, so that was nice.<br/><br/>As for the story, it's basically about a girl who moves into a house with a mysterious door that leads to an ""other"" world where everything's super fun and nice, only that everyone has buttons for eyes. The first half is this wonderful cautionary tale about fantasy and then the story ends and a whole new story begins. This second story is where I find some fault with Coraline as Coraline has essentially overcome the major conflict of the story and so everything we watch is no longer all that thematically important. Also, the structure of the narrative hems very close to the flat nature of a fable and often had me thinking of a Mario video game, only less fun.<br/><br/>This lack of gravity to the second half (essentially a much extended ending) pulls a lot of the magic out of the film, but I still admit that the first half was so strong that it doesn't pull all the magic out of the film.<br/><br/>So, I have to say that Coraline is a decent flick, especially early on and I can say it's a decent film to catch on the strength of its visuals and the strong story in the first half. It does lose its way in the second half and whether that's an artifact from the novel or a matter of its interpretation, I don't know, but I don't think the let down is so great as to prevent a viewer from otherwise enjoying it. So, recommended, including for children. 7/10.<br/><br/>One note is that there is a little bit of exposition in the middle of the film and younger children will likely get restless. They certainly did in my theater."
"rjyelverton","9","0","2","3 March 2009"," Stop motion animated film offers scares and delights
","""Coraline,"" is a fantastic mix of the traditional and the cutting edge. Utilizing beautiful stop motion animation and presented in 3D, in some theaters, the film offers a time-honored message in a state of the art package. 3D has advanced to the point where it actually serves the story as opposed to being an end unto itself. In the opening credit sequence, we see long, spindly iron fingers above the screen as they construct a button-eyed doll. There is menace in these metallic hands and the three dimensional effect adds to the sense of dread. The hands seem close and capable of reaching out to us. When the characters on screen stand outside a doorway, the viewers are tempted to lean forward in order to peak into the room. The 3D is effective and enriching.<br/><br/>Coraline (Dakota Fanning), the pre-teen heroine of the film, is moving into an apartment complex in the filled with eccentric neighbors. Her parents both write and leave Coraline feeling alone and neglected. She hates her dad's cooking and misses her old friends. And then she finds a mysterious door in the wall and while playing one evening chases a little mouse through the door and into a mirror universe that looks similar to her own, but seems better. The food is better, the world never boring, and her button-eyed Other Mother and Father give her everything she wants.<br/><br/>The film, based on an excellent novel for children by Neil Gaiman, has a strong message at its heart. ""Coraline"" posits that hedonism is both empty and dangerous. Also, in order to fully indulge you must become blind to the suffering your pursuits will cause. It's a bit surprising that in a package as cutting edge and fantastic as ""Coraline"" that we are essentially being presented with a traditional moral warning. The film is not heavy handed, however, and your pre-teens will not quickly pick up on the message. In the context of the film, the message is completely sensible.<br/><br/>The animation on display is excellent, but as the movie showcases its character design and animation set pieces the story loses some momentum. Once Coraline discovers her quest, however, the movie becomes engrossing and tense. In fact, the film's extended climax will likely be too intense for the very young. The voice work is delightful with Terri Hatcher surprising in two roles as Coraline's mother and the film's villain. She is obviously enjoying the role and it enriches the entire experience. Also listen for a cameo by John Linnell of ""They Might Be Giants."" The artistry on display is delightful and the film offers a unique animated experience. Go see this one soon, but leave those under five at home."

","Coraline/2009/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Coraline: Dakota Fanning Mother/Other Mother: Teri Hatcher Wybie: Robert Bailey Jr.<br/><br/>They don't make movies like Coraline very often but perhaps that's a good thing. Why? It's simple. If shown too often, stop motion animation would lose its novelty. Only fourteen years ago the spectacle that was Toy Story was released and it received tons of attention and rave reviews not just for its very witty screenplay but also for its rare look. Not one film had looked like that and had a FEATURE LENGTH running time to it until Toy Story was released in 1995 by Pixar. Yes, Pixar had released fully and digitally animated films but they were all within the duration of ten minutes or less.<br/><br/>But now what do we see AT LEAST 5-10 times a year? An animated film. I'm not saying this is bad. It's alright if it's digitally animated by computer as long as the screenplay is very good. Pixar has absolutely no problem with clever screenplays in their animated films. Wall-E was sheer brilliance as was Ratatouille the year before. But I'm still partial to Toy Story more than any other film Pixar released. DreamWorks, however, might need to work a little on those screenplays, excluding their best work, Shrek.<br/><br/>Coraline is based on the graphic novel by Neil Gaiman about a bratty little girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) that finds a secret door in the family room/living room of her house that leads into another version or rather alternate version of her life. This alternate version you will find is quite different from her real life. Completely the opposite, in fact. It reminded me so much of the joyous atmosphere of the dead in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and the completely dull life of the living. What an ingenious contrast.<br/><br/>Coraline is ingenious in itself as well but in a different way. Not only is the animation astounding, the screenplay decent, the originality brilliant, but there is a moral as well. One that's not too hard to find out but also one that is pretty important to keep in mind. The story is different and this moral has been used before.<br/><br/>Coraline is a pessimist, always finding something to complain about; whether it's her life or the situation she's in. Nothing seems to be going her way. Even the boy living nearby, Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), annoys her. But, she's curious and adventurous and gets her nose into every little thing. As she's browsing around the house to pass the time she notices a door. It has to lead somewhere. She manages to unlock it after a bitter argument with her mother but nothing's there. This doesn't stop her. Finally, following some mice, she enters this portal if you will. It reminded me of an air duct. She passes through it and arrives in the same house! Only this one is brighter, more colorful, smells of delicious food and features buttons for eyes. Her parents are much more cheerful. In the other world her mother (Teri Hatcher) is boring and so is her father (John Hodgman). The other mother and other father, however (played by the same people), are completely exuberant, almost forcing their smiles. The ringleader you could say is the other mother. There's also other Wybie and all the other neighbors in cheerful versions and if they're not, this is to be fixed.<br/><br/>Coraline loves it! At first. But she is pessimistic and pretty cynical and if something doesn't go her way or someone wants her to do something she doesn't want to do, she'll get ticked off. It's all a gradual process in the other world, kind of making her be like everyone else. Does she follow suit?<br/><br/>The whole button metaphor, or, at least the way I interpreted it, plays a major part in the story and is total genius as is the film as a whole. Like many Tim Burton films, this one has so much originality, vision and quirky characters, it comes to be one of the most entertaining stop motion films I've seen.<br/><br/>Movie written for the screen and directed by Henry Selick."

Do not take your young children to see this movie. It will either frighten them or perplex them. It is like the best psychological horror films in its ability to create innate tension through droll environments. It doesn't sound novel on paper, and it isn't. Coraline is a dark fantasy story brought to life (or death) through 3D technology. It's also one of the first non-Pixar movies I've watched that doesn't treat 3D as a gimmick.<br/><br/>I've not read much of Neil Gaiman's, but I've seen many movies adapted from his work. Many of them contain an Alice in Wonderland story, in which a character discovers another world. Stardust and Coraline are both in this vein. I found the former to be inappropriately silly. Whatever the main guy's name is doesn't seem affected by his otherworldly discovery. Coraline is sinister, and therefore the preferred approach. The other world is a dangerous, inhospitable place. The heroine is adolescent Coraline Jones, whose parents have recently relocated to a desolate apartment in nowheresville. They spend all of their time working in poorly-lighted rooms. There is only one other child Coraline's age and she doesn't like him. Wybie, the other child, tells Coraline that many children have gone missing in the apartment. She doesn't believe him, of course. So she pokes around the house until she discovers a strange door. Inside is a Candy Land world where everything she desires is present. Her ""other"" parents are expressive and loving. They lack human eyes, instead sporting buttons, which do not affect their ability to see. Coraline begins visiting frequently until the Other Mother asks her if she would like to stay permanently. Other Mother is revealed to be an ageless enigma, preying on the unhappiness of children. The children are kept forever in a purgatory state, unless they can find their human eyes. Coraline escapes back to the first world to discover that her parents are missing. She must return to Other World and rescue them, along with the eyes of Mother's other victims. She wants to set them free. It's a cheap storyline device that forces the story forward to its scary conclusion. The story falls flat once the other world is discovered, so a new evil is invented. The last segment has a video game quality to it. Watching Coraline collect various items, while using an object to discern the true nature of the other world reminded me of a similar plotting element from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.<br/><br/>Coraline isn't your average Bolt-like children's movie. It's frightening and unsettling. I even jumped out of my seat a few times, dare I admit. Selick's art design may be similar to Tim Burton's but nothing more. The film's pallet is dark until the very end. Think about the opening shots of Wall-E. No uplifting songs or sympathy with characters are present in Coraline. She's a disagreeable child who doesn't try to be lovable. She really needs a spanking. Coraline reminds me of her parents, in her callous disregard for other people. She isn't burdened with responsibility yet, so she's just unsociable. I can see her writing at the kitchen table for whatever reason like her mother does.<br/><br/>Some movies, not this one, are made to be viewed in 3D. If it isn't worth the ticket price, then have no qualms about watching it in 2D. Selick uses 3D to emphasize certain objects before Coraline approaches them. Remove all thoughts of My Bloody Valentine 3D from your head. The story is capable of scaring you without resulting to desperate pickaxe-in-your-face shots.<br/><br/>Selick has stated that the movie is for ""brave children of all ages."" I'd have to disagree with him. Coraline is a film for adults of all ages and some of their children. The drab set design, Other Mother's skeletal figure, and various cinematic elements will not appeal to youngsters. It's similar to Monster House. I'd love to see Selick adapt an adult Neil Gaiman novel or something else intended for an older audience. Horror anime has been available for years, yet the West has produced no suitable substitute. With a film like Coraline, we are beginning to fill that gap. This is the first great movie of 2009 and a Best Animated Picture candidate. Leave the kids at home when you go see it."
"Quinoa1984","9","0","2","15 February 2009"," Henry Selick's slightly familiar but nonetheless inventive and wonderful journey through the light and dark of child's dreams
","It's important that films are still being made with stop-motion animation, the all-encompassing and painstaking art that involves hundreds of animators and designers to move pieces of plastic and mold and clay and whatever second by second and frame by frame. We still have the Wallace and Gromit guys at Aardman working well, and later this year Wes Anderson, who used some stop-motion in Life Aquatic, will be releasing a stop-motion adaptation of Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's not quite a dying animation form that may or may not need resuscitation like regular cell animation.<br/><br/>But the form also needs ideas and fresh invention and some kind of approach that keeps innovation going on with where to take any sense of fantasy and wonder up for grabs. Henry Selick, thankfully, is a master having been the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, and he was the right and maybe only choice to give Neil Gaiman's Coraline an inventive perspective. This is a children's film that is not limited for its audience. Kids will eat it up and mostly be good for it (the screening I went to had barely a disruptive peep from the under 12 tykes), but it also stirs up a sense of enchantment with older viewers like, for example, those who were kids when 'Nightmare' came out. It has some obvious comparisons to make to Alice in Wonderland and other fantasy lore, and its slight sense of familiarity in the conventional parts to the story keep it from being the animated event of the year.<br/><br/>But, as I said, it also provides the unexpected. For example a comparison to make which some may not pick up is that the first half of the film is akin to Michel Gondry's The Science of Sleep. Both films have that immensely powerful and intoxicating and just plain damn fun quality that is child-like with its main character's connection to dreams as a means of experiencing what is much more gratifying than in real life's doldrums and disappointments. This threw me off in the best way; the trailer and previews made it seem like Coraline has this ho-hum existence being in a new home in Oregon with her distracted parents and slips through the hole in the door in the wall and stays there for the whole movie. I was content with that expectation, but the facet of dreams meshing with reality- and reality itself already being strange enough as it is with its inspired and odd characters like the European trapeze artist and the two aged female performance artists with stuffed angel dogs- added a whole other dimension.<br/><br/>This time it becomes about this little girl Coraline's temptations of staying in this dreamworld, where her ""other"" parents have button-eyes and offer up constant treats and goodies and the father makes a garden around the house to look from the sky like Coraline's face, and how she has to overcome some pretty startling obstacles to get her real parents back into reality from the evil twisted version of the ""other"" mother... sound complicated? It's not.<br/><br/>This is such a whimsical movie that it's hard to describe everything that makes it so jaw-droopingly amazing. There may be a bias for those who gobble up new and crazy sights in stop-motion, and here some of it is just conventionally strange like the next-door neighbor boy of Coraline's with the frizzy hair and half-bike-half-motorcycle, or the trapeze artist voiced by Ian McShane with a propensity to feed his kangaroo mice (in the 'dream' side of things of course, one of my personal favorites of any movie in years), or the dead ghost children the evil skeletal mother keeps locked away who need their real eyes back. The story proposes nightmarish visions for children but nothing so shocking as to send them crying down the aisles... or maybe so depending on their temperaments (I really jumped in my seat from some shocks Selick delivered), and it thrills precisely because it doesn't pander to a child's imagination. <br/><br/>It's a film that understands how dreams work, and how intoxicating they can get, and why for perhaps all the dangerous reasons it's essential to have them. It also reminds us why to keep little doors that are supposedly bricked-up to stay that way. 9.5/10"

","In all honesty, this movie looked only okay at first. I went into the movie theater, expecting nothing too amazing. Of course, I knew that Tim Burton was one of the big names behind this movie (he's the same guy who made ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") but I still - more or less expected an average movie. Little did I know how wrong I was. <br/><br/>Coraline was a brilliant movie. No, not as good as Finding Nemo or Wall- E, but still an outstanding movie that I give my props to. I'm not a real big fan with the doll style of animation, but I put that aside. The story itself portrayed that good old moral, ""Be careful what you wish for"" in an amazing way that I have never seen or read before. The visuals, despite my dislikes, were very good seeing how hard it must have been. Combined with that and the music, it creates a vivid world for you to digest easily - along with your popcorn and soda or whatever food you may choose.<br/><br/>Little kids may enjoy this movie, but I think mid-age children up will find this movie more interesting or at least get the moral better. Above all, I think this is one great movie that is a must-see for everyone."
"bbSouthstreet","9","0","2","12 February 2009"," Henry Selick's Newest Masterpiece
","When first hearing about this movie in 2003, I was a little weirded out by the ideas that Nightmare before Christmas director, Henry Selick, had in mind for this film. But I guess I learned from viewing this movie that the stranger the plans, the better the story.<br/><br/>After his unfortunate, ""Monkeybone,"" I believe that Selick had to really pull something off along the lines of ""Nightmare"" standards to surpass this mess of his. He successfully beat his Monkeybone (ha ha, I know, I know) and brought us, the audience, something that joins the ranks of ""Nightmare"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" Having read the book before seeing the movie and then seeing the trailer, I was a little skeptical as to how true they were going to be to the wonderfully imaginative novel by Neil Gaiman. When hearing about the addition of a new character named Wybie Lovat and changing Mr. Bobo's name to Mr. Bobinsky, I knew that asking for a true adaptation would be asking too much. Fortunately, I was proved wrong as the movie keeps true to its adaptation and even has a few pleasant surprises in store.<br/><br/>What really won me over was the brilliant idea to present this movie in 3-D, because this is just one of those movies that deserve to be seen in three dimensions. With 3-D technology, the audience will be immersed the story and even get a feeling of pure surrealism the likes of which no one has ever seen. One scene I really enjoyed in 3-D would have to be when the character, Coraline, goes to see her theatrical spinster neighbors, Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible in the other world, put on a show of high flying acrobatics and even involve Coraline in their act. Very well done if I do say so myself.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have against this movie is the way that story plays out. It's almost like a roller coaster in some ways. There are some parts that take you high in the sky and go for a thrilling drop, i.e. the mouse circus put on by the ""other"" Mr. Bobinsky, and then there are those parts that seem to make the roller coaster into a slow and boring train ride, i.e. the scene where Coraline is begging her mother for a pair of gloves. It's too bad that this movie is already out in theaters as the pace could be changed in a few spots.<br/><br/>Other than that, if you are a fan of ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach,"" a devoted follower of Neil Gaiman's astonishing novella or just in need of a good movie, I highly suggest you find a theater that shows movie in 3D and go see Henry Selick's latest masterpiece, ""Coraline."""
"ryan42790","9","0","2","11 February 2009"," Visual Masterpiece
","First let me profess my love for just the look of the film. Unlike Selick's work with Nightmare Before Christmas (Which was more of Tim Burton's vision) This is more colorful and artistic. The 3D is spectacular and makes one believe that 3D has a true future in cinema. We have little Coraline who your basic little girl who moves into a new apartment with her neglecting parents. She then finds a portal within the apartment that leads to another world completely opposite from her own, and when she thinks that this world that she found is her dream come true, it turns into a nightmare. Now we have seen this story many times, and that can sometimes bring a movie down, but with this movie it's done so beautifully, that it's easy to forget all the movies that had the same premise. Now please note this can be very disturbing for little kids, this is a very tight PG rating. Some parts can be overly creepy, which got my little cousin crying and wanting to leave. Overall It's and an amazing accomplishment, for 3D, and for For cinema in general"
"dolenraug","9","0","2","11 February 2009"," A night out with Coraline
","From the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Henry Selick, comes Coraline, the story of a young girl who discovers an ""other world"" where life is always happy...or so she thinks. One part Alice in Wonderland, one part--naturally--The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline is a fantastic film employing the well known but seldom used stop-motion animation.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Neil Gaiman (Beowulf, Stardust), Coraline is about a girl, Coraline Jones (played spot-on by Dakota Fanning), who is unhappy about the way her life is playing out. Her parents, both writers, seem to have no time for her, and thus Coraline is left to her own devices in her new home. Stalked by a creepy Quasimodo type named Wybie and his mangy, feral cat, Coraline spends her time exploring her new place of residence. It is here that she finds a small doorway that leads to an ""other world"". Just like her own universe, the other world has dopplegangers of those she knows. Everything seems wonderful there, as long as you can look past (no pun intended) the whole having buttons for eyes thing. Coraline soon realizes everything isn't quite so happy on the other side of the doorway, and it's up to her to set things right and save herself and those around her.<br/><br/>This is a film based on a children's book, but I was surprised at some of imagery included. Things do seem very magical, but at the same time, I was always dealing with this very strong sense of being disturbed. Everything was too perfect. Inanimate objects come to life and are at first playful, but soon become obstructions in Coraline's path to freedom. Her ""other mother"" is loving in the beginning, but it soon becomes clear that she is something more wicked. A wolf--or maybe spider--in sheep's clothing, the ""other mother"" wants to fit Coraline with a brand new set of shiny black button-eyes and keep her there--forever. I have to say, this film may require another viewing in theaters. Not only is it a spectacle that I fully endorse for theatrical viewing, but it was almost a movie that instigated sensory overload. I just got out of it and yet there was so much to look at that I may have missed something. I KNOW what I saw and I know the things I saw gave me a strong sense of unease, but I can't describe it here. Suffice it to say, you must go see this film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, you're probably not going to have nightmares (although some of the younguns might), but like I said, it just evokes this FEELING; something you can't quite put your finger on. Seeing the ""other mother"" in her true form, seeing ghosts of the children that came before Coraline, seeing people who are so normal become button-eyed zombies, the imagery is like a nightmare come to life. Nothing quite so strong as to make you wake up screaming, but the kind of ""what the f***"" dream that will make you snap awake and question your sanity.<br/><br/>Also, for a PG movie, wow was there some seeming inappropriate imagery when it came to women in the film. One of the characters, the first time I saw her, I was nearly dumbstruck at the size of her chest. And yes, there was even physics applied to 'em; she walks, they bounce. Just seemed to me to be a bit much for a PG movie made for children.<br/><br/>Still, this 22 year old thinks this may be in his top 10 films of all-time. Granted, I'm coming down from that first-time high that comes from experiencing something that astounded, but that's why I said ""may be"". I wanna watch it again before I give a solid vote of ""yay"" or ""nay"".<br/><br/>Regardless, this film cannot be overlooked. It is, technically, a feat of wonders. The animation is incredible. And I have to give it to Dakota, she really holds up her end of the film. Actually, the acting all around was top notch. A little over-the-top at times, but it was what was called for. The 3D, although I didn't see it in a theater capable of such, was NOT over-the-top. It wasn't a barrage of things flying of the screen. Instead, the 3D was used to make the world come to life, to really give it a sense of DEPTH.<br/><br/>Worth the time and money. WELL worth it. I gave it a 9 but a 9.5 would have been the best choice."
"mechachan15","8","0","3","11 February 2009"," Coraline: A decent movie in my opinion.
","Well, on Monday my mom and I went to go see Henry Selick's newest movie ""Coraline."" I really wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this one.<br/><br/>First off, let me say a little about the music. The music in this movie is awesome and very well composed. Most Notably the music in the opening credits of the movie. Those who have seen ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" know that it has a bunch of songs in it. This movie has only two songs, both of which are intended to be ridiculous.<br/><br/>Next, the plot. The plot centers around a young girl named Coraline Jones. She discovers a door in her house that seemingly doesn't lead to anywhere. One night, she discovers that there is a tunnel that sometimes appears behind the door. She goes through the door and finds ""the other world"", a place where there are alternate or ""better"" versions of her neglectful mother and father. Night after night, Coraline visits this ""other world"". After a while, she finds the world is not what she thought it was at first. That is all I'm going to say. You'll have to watch the movie to find out the rest^^ Something I noticed about this film is the pacing. The pacing is very very slow. I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but in some parts of the movie, you may feel a little bored.<br/><br/>The mood of this movie is quite dismal, but not depressing. You get a certain sense of dankness from the real world that Coraline lives in.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie reminds me of Henry Selick's other stop motion animation ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". It's like we have gone back in time to more choppy animation. The style of the characters and the sometimes awkward way they move may bug some people.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie in theaters before seeing it anywhere else. I think I actually enjoyed the movie more because of the theater experience.<br/><br/>The short version: I recommend seeing this film. Because of the slow pace and the fact that this movie has some frightening images, I don't recommend bringing little children to see this. I don't advise bringing any child under the age of 10. Every kid is different, so your little 5 yr. old may love this movie to bits. Who knows:). This is seriously the Weirdest movie I have ever seen, so if you don't ""do"" weird movies, this one probably isn't for you. It is a bit morbid and very Gothic pretty much the whole way through.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8/10 for the somewhat predictable storyline, but it has so many redeemable qualities that I still gave it a high rating. What are you waiting for? Go see Coraline already!"

I have never read the book so i can't compare it, but apparently the book is pretty good =].<br/><br/>It is one of the most original films i have ever seen. Going into this movie, i thought it looked neat, but wasn't expecting very much... after all it had Dakota Fanning voicing the main character. But she actually did a great job voicing the character. although i haven't heard any bad reviews of this movie yet, i can't see how anyone could give it a bad rating.<br/><br/>I was originally going to see ""Taken"" tonight for my birthday with 2 of my friends but neither of them had the money, so i decided to check this out instead. And I'm SOOOO glad that i did. truly an amazing film. If you have the chance to view this film, DO IT.

","Every bit as good as Henry Selick's masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas. Like that one, the film finds a perfect balance between beautiful and creepy. I would describe it as a children's horror film. In fact, I think this might go down as one of the scariest children's films ever made. The story is about a young girl, Coraline, who finds an odd doorway in her new house that leads to a mirror-image world, where her parents pay attention to her and give her anything she wants. It's wonderful, but odd Ã‚â€“ everyone has black buttons for eyeballs. Coraline's first few trips to the alternate world are fun, but soon her ""other mother"" insists that she get her own buttons. The story is familiar. It reminded me a lot of Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away. The plot also takes a couple of obvious shortcuts that don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, these things are hard to notice when you're watching Selick's eye-popping design. Pixar's got its work cut out for it if it wants to win Best Animated Film at next year's Oscar ceremony. It also has one of the most amazing musical scores I've heard in a while, by Bruno Coulais."
"cultfilmfan","9","0","1","8 February 2009"," Coraline
","Coraline is a stop motion and three dimensional animated film based upon the book of the same name by Neil Gaiman. The story focuses on a young girl named Coraline, who has just moved into a dark and dreary town with her two parents, who pay little to no attention to her at all. When Coraline goes to sleep she dreams of an alternate version of her new home and a much warmer and kindler family. Coraline wishes she could live in this dream world permanently, but as she soon discovers it really is not as it seems and there is actually a lot of danger lurking in this seemingly happy and carefree world, Coraline must eventually save herself and save the day and all of this is done in fantastic animation complete with 3D glasses the theatre gives you to view the movie in. There has been a lot of animated films as of late and for the most part they do not really appeal to me and for the most part I do not end up seeing them. I also do not care much for 3D animation all that much. I find it feels too computerized and I miss the days of hand drawn animation. Even the stop motion animation used in Coraline and the director's other film The Nightmare Before Christmas, I much prefer to 3D animation. It just looks a lot more interesting and I do not know if this is just coincidence, or not, but the stop motion films seem to have better stories and more originality than I find the 3D ones have. I also like the new computer type animation where the director films live scenes and paints over them with a computer program as seen in films like Waking Life. Back to Coraline now. The film with it's visuals, animation and the 3D glasses that accompanied the film made it a visual feast and it was a complete pleasure to look at and I really enjoyed that aspect of the film. Coraline's story was full of dark and more grim story telling, but I have always had a fascination with that kind of material, so it pleased me to no end. I also found the film to be fascinating, it moved along quite well and I wouldn't normally comment on something like this, but I found the voice actors for the film were really very well suited to the characters they were playing. Coraline is a film for anyone who likes the unknown, or mysteries, or for fans of 3D, or just animation in general I think it would be hard for anyone to not appreciate something of this film's top notch animation and the wonderful storytelling that went with it. This film has tons of excitement, great visuals and is all and all a very entertaining night out at the movies, which is often needed in the dark and grim months of the winter, much of like where Coraline lives. This film is highly recommended."

If you are lucky enough to see it in 3D(RealD), then do not pass up this opportunity. The beautiful 3D effects and eye-popping images support this movie throughout. Don't prejudge this movie before you see it. It is not a ""child's movie."" It reaches beyond that and makes it enjoyable for adults as well.
