","I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.<br/><br/>And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.<br/><br/>Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.<br/><br/>By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.<br/><br/>Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.<br/><br/>
If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).<br/><br/>It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.<br/><br/>This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.<br/><br/>And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.<br/><br/>I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.<br/><br/>Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually."
"bzb2001","10","439","558","28 November 2004"," A deeply loving film rich in character
","It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.<br/><br/>I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.<br/><br/>I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?<br/><br/>Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?<br/><br/>It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.<br/><br/>**** (A)"
"clairerosemaryjane","Null","270","358","25 October 2004"," A film for those who can cope with more than just one story line.
","This was a most intriguing film. There are of course other reviews of it here, but the one common theme that seems to exist in all reviews is the simple fact that you can never please all the people all of the time.<br/><br/>For myself I loved the film and the way that all the stories were intertwined. You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were.<br/><br/>But there were two very special moments for me in this film. One was where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) finally told Juliet(Keira Knightley ) how he REALLY felt about her, through the medium of the messages on the cards, (surely many of us have experienced that sort of unrequited love), the other was the brilliant brief speech given by the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) to the press conference at which the American President was present. (Both of these appear as quotes elsewhere on this site.) I felt that it was a very brave move on the part of the writer (Richard Curtis) to allow the Prime Minister in the film to state what so many ordinary British people are feeling about America and its politics right now. <br/><br/>I also feel that we, the British, are finally beginning to move away from under the Hollywood shadow, and are starting once again to produce some really excellent films of our own. And for me, this film just underlines this fact. May this trend continue. <br/><br/>Claire Rosemary Jane."
"jackburden","Null","340","461","19 December 2004"," A Holiday Fantasy Classic (Yes, Fantasy - Negative Reviewers Get Over It ;-)
","This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. <br/><br/>I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught it first in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to back on a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Duplex."" Since I've caught it on HBO, and I've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedly when flipping channels for a quick ""pick me up"" that only fantasy movies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, if that clues you into my argument. <br/><br/>The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes of Magnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flick place that device in interesting contrast. <br/><br/>I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic."
"BrianWatchesMovies","8","177","239","19 December 2003"," A fabric woven of happy and sad threads
","What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.<br/><br/>The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.<br/><br/>These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.<br/><br/>There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the ""fat"" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the ""fat"" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.<br/><br/>In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good."
"Turambar-3","8","163","228","19 December 2004"," Clever and delightful, actually.
","This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film."

","It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he's been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!"
"AirBourne_Bds","10","137","205","26 August 2004"," The Ultimate Romantic Comedy: Served in a British Vein (Trying for Unspoiled, cannot guarantee - Actually!)
","Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part...<br/><br/>Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of the just-widowered Liam Neeson's character by pass Customs to pursue true love of a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-American girl(this was where love did not know Race... Color-Blind), but he did everything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effed up his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrapping sequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque all at the same time w/o conflicting.. Amazing!!)<br/><br/>Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous; Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman's wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM who effed up Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bushy"" prez was superb and I liked the girl from EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class! Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually...<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in the weirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, they were sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy's send-up really did do well in the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!"
"Michael101","Null","165","254","9 January 2004"," Bravo Richard Curtis
","Like most guys I would never have seen this movie on my own or with male friends. However my girlfriend was in town and I thought a romantic comedy would make an ideal movie for us to see together.<br/><br/>I had heard about the reference to 9/11 made at the beginning of the movie and was dreading having to sit through that part. However I was pleasantly surprised to note that the reference was very minor and not particularly cringe worthy either so I am not quite sure why it annoyed some people so much.<br/><br/>As regards to the movie overall I quite enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as an ideal date film. A lot of the reviews here have disparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love and very unrealistic. But I think you have to accept that the movie was made to make people laugh and bring the spirit of love into the Christmas holiday period. If you watch the film in that context then it does its job admirably well.<br/><br/>However for me the best moment in the film was the press conference given (standing side by side) by the American president and the British Prime Minister. I actually felt like standing up and cheering when Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister) finally tells the American president to his face and in front of the worlds press that Britain will no longer kowtow to American wishes but will have an independent view of its own.<br/><br/>Considering that America is the biggest market for movies it was extremely brave of Richard Curtis to write this scene and he deserves a lot of credit for portraying the American president as rather loathsome and putting into context what the `Special Relationship' really is all about.<br/><br/>As Richard Curtis must have known the movie had done okay but not great in the States. However it has cleaned up here in the UK and I'm sure will do very well in the rest of the world too.<br/><br/>So Bravo Richard Curtis for standing up for your principals; you are a hero!"
"claudio_carvalho","9","134","205","29 May 2005"," Delightfull Homage to Love
","In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. <br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time.

"RSTLOUP","1","188","320","18 July 2005"," Crap Actually
","I had expected from this film a relatively undistinguished, harmless little romantic comedy. What instead unfolded was two-plus hours of the most unremitting, insulting, film clichés imaginable.<br/><br/>The film consists of nine simultaneously-running subplots. Each subplot manages to be absurdly implausible, yet predictable at every turn. Among the worst: <br/><br/>One tracked a geeky fellow who was convinced that the way to turn his romantic life around was to impress American girls with his English accent. Each scene of that plot consisted of something like the following: <br/><br/>""I'm going off to the US, where the chicks will think I'm a coolly sophisticated Brit!"" <br/><br/>(His friend): ""You're crazy!""<br/><br/>""California girls here I come!"" <br/><br/>""Stop!"" <br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>And on.<br/><br/>In the ""payoff"" scene, at film's end, he does, in fact, bag three hot American girls in a bar. Why this scene was worth endless repetition along the way is a mystery.<br/><br/>Another similarly repetitive plot involved two people performing together in a porn film. They strike up a conversation and start forming a tentative relationship. The ""joke"" is that these strangers are being sexually intimate, yet are acting like awkward teenagers as they stumble their way to going out on a date. They're porn stars, but they're shy! Isn't that funny? Ho ho ho! This might have an amusing one-five-minute-scene joke, but this film stretches into a film-long subplot, complete with the male rejoicing over getting a good-night kiss from his new love. Barf.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst one involved Colin Firth. Betrayed early in the film, he's heartbroken. He is assigned a non-English-speaking housekeeper, whom it takes exactly two seconds to discern will be his romantic salvation. <br/><br/>This subplot builds to a supposedly climactic scene where he, with a big crowd in tow, descends upon a restaurant where she works, to propose marriage. He awkwardly declares his love, shots of all of the other diners looking confused and expectant, she says yes, then everyone breaks out in applause and there isn't a dry eye to be found. Argh. <br/><br/>This film didn't even bother to construct a buildup to this climactic moment. The two characters have barely a few verbal exchanges prior to this scene. <br/><br/>And the film uses all of the other clichés: her brusque Mediterranean father in the crowd, her sister egging her on, etc. None of these people were actually developed characters. They are just insulting stereotypes thrown in for the final set piece.<br/><br/>In another subplot, Hugh Grant plays a newly elected British Prime Minister. He doesn't bother to act differently from the way he normally does, the same stammering, yet somehow debonair, Hugh Grant character that he always plays.<br/><br/>He walks in off the street to 10 Downing, and is introduced to his staff, one of whom, again, can immediately be identified as his eventual love interest. Power Prime Minister falls for humble servant girl -- how romantic! Who would have thought?<br/><br/>The Prime Minister's scenes seem to have scripted by a 10-year-old. It's hard to depict politics or diplomacy more childishly than most mainstream films do, but this film manages. Grant is shown meeting with his Cabinet, with dialogue along the lines of: <br/><br/>""Mr. Prime Minister, you really need to get tough with those Americans."" <br/><br/>""No, I don't think I will. Like it or not, America is the most powerful country in the world, so I think we'll just have to be nice to them."" <br/><br/>Yes, it's about that sophisticated. <br/><br/>But soon the evil Americans show up, led by Billy Bob Thornton, looking hickish and sinister, another example of the film's relentless caricaturing. There is soon a negotiating scene that goes something like: <br/><br/>(Americans, haughtily): ""We will be continuing the policies of the previous Administration."" <br/><br/>(Brits): ""But they are bad policies!""<br/><br/>But the Americans won't bend, so ""bad"" policies it will be. (Ah, the simple logic of film. Let's have good policies instead of bad ones -- Brilliant!)<br/><br/>Later, when in private discussions with President Billy Bob, Grant steps out and returns to find the Prez nuzzling his housekeeper. So, the Americans are not only unreasonable negotiators but lechers, too! At the next press conference, Hugh's backbone stiffens, he emphatically declares that the Brits aren't going to be pushed around anymore.<br/><br/>Cut to shots of applauding, grateful Brits, wiping tears from their eyes. No kidding.<br/><br/>The writing is adolescent from start to finish. Supposedly about romance, it was about anything but: It was about how many times the writer/director could haul out the same tiresome, insulting, manipulative stereotypes and syrupy music.<br/><br/>The film begins with shots of people embracing at airports. It's a clue. The writer likes the image of love, but isn't terribly interested in what goes into it.<br/><br/>We have a new plague among screenwriters: Richard Curtis. He also gave us Four Weddings and a Funeral, which was similarly, though not quite as spectacularly, awful.<br/><br/>Is it really the case that filmgoers will find such dreck droll and clever if only it is dressed up with a British accent? There seems to be no other explanation for this man continuing to be given financial backing."

","At first I was suckered in by this movie - cool British actors like Emma Thompson, swank shots of London, the British love/hate attitude towards America.<br/><br/>But slowly, steadily, it began to dawn on me - this movie is incredibly bad and misogynistic to boot. By the end of the movie I was writhing with disgust at the waste of good acting talent and two hours of my life.<br/><br/>I just saw it tonight on pay-per-view. Normally I won't pay for a movie unless I have a pretty good idea what it's about and a good sense that I'll like it. I threw caution to the wind and rented this one without all that. HUGE mistake.<br/><br/>It's the perfect movie for evolutionary psychologists. The successful pairings are older powerful men and younger women, or a young guy and 4 women, or young guy and porn star. If you're older, like Laura Linney, you get no sex with a hot hot man because your brother's a violent looney, and your entire life is dedicated to nurturing him, or you're older and married with kids, like Emma Thompson and your husband is screwing his secretary and you just suck it up. Didn't you know you're a piece of crap older woman whose sex life is over? Now go make yourself useful by making a costume for your kid. <br/><br/>I mean, I knew that evolutionary psychology was big in Britian, but had no idea things were that bad.<br/><br/>And incredibly some people claim that this is a movie for middle-aged women. Maybe middle-aged women who hate themselves.<br/><br/>And of course there's the awful awful plots. And the heaping piles of bad music and two stupid horrible scenes one after the other - the little boy on the plane, and the English guy in Portugal, with the stupid ""inspirational"" music pounding you over the head.<br/><br/>Yes, love is all around, unless you're the funny fat sister. Then you get nothing and everybody hates you - and the filmmakers invite everybody to laugh at you.<br/><br/>That's what really makes anybody with taste or sensitivity or humanity hate this movie. Because it keeps smugly patting itself on the back for its sensitivity and LOVE when in fact it's a woman-hating, schmaltz-churning, vomit-producing travesty.<br/><br/>I'm so glad there is a site like this where I can not only get a chance to get some of the feelings of loathing and sickness induced by this movie out of my system, but I can see that there are other sane, discerning people in this world who also get why this movie is so deeply, fundamentally, soul-destroyingly wrong.<br/><br/>And a shout-out to NYTimes critic A.O. Scott for totally nailing this movie and its many and varied evils."

","I cannot believe that anyone who likes movies enough to post or even vote on IMDb would actually like Love Actually. After peeling my mangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone and called every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smelling debacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be a sappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged my girlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn't even notice the misogyny until after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hours of bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had been drug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic) things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rare intervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayal of women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class struggle throughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored women acting like they're at a Beatles concert. If you haven't seen a poorly made movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that it was not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averaged above a 2 on the voting. You want a holiday comedy? Watch Elf. I usually don't comment on IMDb, but after seeing the 7.8 I couldn't help myself."

","So.. is it just me or was anyone else greatly offended, if not outright appalled by everything this movie had to ""offer""? Not only was the acting simply awful with its cheesy lines and its predictable scenarios, but there were also so many different stories it made each one lose any meaning it might have had in the process. On another less general note, I was offended by the fact that Colin Firth only started to really find his Portuguese maid attractive once she stripped down to her underwear, Liam Neeson's kid, right after his own mother's funeral, claimed he wasn't distraught over her at all - it was LOVE that was tormenting him, and the comment made by the father of the Portuguese maid to his other daughter - the ""fat"" one - saying ""oh shutup, dunkin' donut 3000"".... is this supposed to be funny? Because if it is, i think i may have lost hope in humanity forever. What would possess anyone to nominate this movie for not one, but TWO golden globes? There is far more to be said about this pathetic attempt at redeeming love and people in general, however it might cause me to feel ill so i will discontinue. My overall vote? If i could give it less than a 1, i would. I am ashamed of anyone I know who has even remotely enjoyed watching ""Love, Actually."""

","This film is simply terrible. It tries to be romantic, and fails miserably. It tries to be funny - ditto. There are a number of key failures - One: do we really need this many characters, of which only one moved me to any degree, that being the American women with the mentally disturbed brother? Two: the cliche-o-meter almost hits the roof. Say no more. Three - maybe its because I'm a bloke, but i just didn't care less what happened to anyone - there was zero character development. And finally, there was no reason whatsoever why the characters they all need to be somehow interrelated, as it adds nothing at all to the film like, for example, Pulp Fiction succeeds in doing.

Although a higher percentage of them might be able to spell the word ""p...a...n...d...e...r"".<br/><br/>But who were they trying to pander to? It really ticks me off to market a film as a ""women's movie"" when every female character over 30 ends up sad, alone, or dead.<br/><br/>Where to begin: Well, the Liam Niessen story was unseemly. An eleven year old boy's mother has just died, and he's left alone with his step dad, and the boy's biggest concern is ""falling in love"" with a classmate? I know life goes on and all that, but honestly, life doesn't go on in this way, and I don't find the practice of projecting adult thoughts into eleven year old bodies humorous or poignant.<br/><br/>And the bereaved husband, who is so torn up about losing his perfect wife that he can't complete her eulogy, ends the movie by falling in love with Claudia Schiffer. Perhaps this is realistic, if your wife dies, you should expect to end up with a Claudia Schiffer supermodel or her look-alike. But I don't find it charming. I find it smarmy.<br/><br/>And Colin Firth (40 something) is going to meet and fall in love with a beautiful Portugese cleaning woman (20 something) with whom he's never had a conversation, but first, the filmmakers have to get rid of his wife, while turning Firth into a ""sympathetic"" victim. <br/><br/>How will the filmmakers get rid of his wife so he can fall in love with a much younger woman without the audience realizing he's really just a cad? They accomplish this by having Colin Firth's British wife sleep around on him for no apparent reason in a really callous way. Then she leaves him and he's so so depressed, for about a week. He wonders why all the women he marries betray him. Perhaps, I thought to myself, it's because he falls in love with women who don't speak English and marries them?<br/><br/>I confess I found the actress who plays the cleaning woman to be the most charismatic in the movie. And if the rest of the movie wasn't so godawful, I might have let this storyline pass, but then, the filmmakers have to stick in cheap shots at her oh so comically peasant-like father and her horrible fat sister. Incredibly, the fat girl's own father seems to hate her, and the filmmaker seems to expect the audience to sympathize with him while he is nasty to her. Wonderful chick flick, huh?. Clearly, Love is All Around. <br/><br/>And Keira Knightley is so beautiful and she's all of 19 or something and she's going to marry a black man who is perfect and handsome and rich and completely incidental to the storyline. In fact, the perfect black man isn't important at all, except to signify that Keira Knightley is funky and liberal and has something to her besides her looks. Because we neither know nor care about anything else about her. She's young, she's beautiful, she has an overbite, she's going to be married. She might as well be Elizabeth Taylor in Father of the Bride.<br/><br/>Laura Linney's story is actually touching. And she acts it well. She's got to care for her brother, who's mentally ill. But he lives in a HOME! Why should this prevent her from having a relationship? Probably, because she's over 30. Again, if this were the only story about a 30 something woman ending up alone, through her own fault, I'd buy it. But it's the confluence of all these anti-women story lines that I just can't take.<br/><br/>Poor Emma Thomson and Alan Rickman work to save this movie. It's not unrealistic to think of an older bossman bonking the young female help. I don't mind this storyline, but...again...it's a little hard to see the witty and wise Emma ending up in a compromise of a marriage, while Liam Niesan's character ends up with Claudia Schiffer. <br/><br/>Bill Nighy does best with his role as a star performer who puts out a cheesy single, promotes it shamelessly, and has the grace to prove his loyalty to his manager, rather than going out to a fashionable party. Good thing his manager was a fat 40 something man instead of a slim 30 something female, or he'd have been left alone in the cold too.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Four Weddings and a Funeral despite the fact that Andie MacDowell couldn't keep up with the British cast, but with this new effort I am officially giving up on light British ""romantic"" comedies. I prefer the boys in the American Pie series to the cads in this movie, and the caddish screenwriters and producers who dared to market this film as a feel good fantasy for women."

","After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on Richard Curtis. I'm not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is the vilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It is appalling. The nadir of Curtis's output, it is a toe-curling abomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism of the enterprise, evident in everything from the music to the manipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmas setting. It's a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just a series of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stale comic line (eg 'Now I can only get into dresses that belonged to Pavarotti') and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through those would take way, way too long. And what's with the use of bad language in the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducing turkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you're a man because it may well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic, eh Mr Curtis?"

"johnginn","1","143","263","10 June 2004"," Actually, it's not good
","Just caught this one on DVD. It's one of the most self-indulgent, overdone movies I've ever seen. A huge, nearly formless, undisciplined mess. <br/><br/>There are scenes in here that, if viewed as short clips, are kind of funny and work fairly well, only to have every shred of their credibility leeched away by director Richard Curtis with some unbelievable and patently false follow-up moment.<br/><br/>The result is that characters move from the realm of real, identifiable people to soulless plot monkeys in the flicker of a few frames and a music cue. This is not the fault of the actors, who struggle valiantly to connect to their characters, but they are all eventually undone by Curtis' desperate preciousness.<br/><br/>How can Curtis be praised for his humanistic touches when he absolutely refuses to allow his characters to exist as real people?<br/><br/>Horrible plot thread example No. 1: Within a five-week period, a writer, (Colin Firth) is betrayed by his girlfriend and brother, goes to France to write a book and falls in love with his Portuguese house keeper with whom he's had only the barest of conversations due to a language barrier; he finishes the book, learns enough Portuguese to ask her to marry him - all while never once seeming to be in any sort of anguish or psychic pain due to the betrayal...<br/><br/>Wrong! False! LIE! This relationship is DOOMED! It's fraught with delusion and warning signs; and yet Curtis insists that its all cute and evidence of the wondrous mystery of love.<br/><br/>Horrible plot thread example No. 2: Within the same five-weeks, Liam Neeson buries his wife, is told to `move on' by a friend, and apparently seems to have done exactly that in meeting a Claudia Schiffer look-alike (played by Claudia Schiffer, how precious) at his son's Christmas pageant. So any of you out there mourning the death of a wife or husband, the message here is that if you haven't paired up again within a few scant weeks, just get over it and move on. It's been a whole month already and you are boring us all with your `grief,' which Curtis would seem to define here as self-indulgent blah-blah-blah. And for you others out there, if a friend or relative is dealing with the death of a partner, you are, by Curtis' logic, probably entitled to start mocking them within a few weeks:<br/><br/>`How's it going, Joe?'<br/><br/>`Not so good. My wife died a few weeks ago. The house seems so empty.'<br/><br/>Then you come back in that high-pitched mimic voice. `The house seems so empty. The house seems so empty! Well cry me a freakin' river!'<br/><br/>I could outline more plot threads just as horrible, but why bother? Suffice it to say that it is a sorry state of movies when I can recognize deeper and truer levels of humanity in Ron Perlman's Hellboy character than I can in any of the people here (barring the Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson story thread; they survive relatively well).<br/><br/>The more I think about `Love Actually,` the angrier I get. It lies and lies and lies about human nature. The fact that it is rated as high as it is on this site depresses me as deeply as the movie itself did."

Smug middle class trash and one of the most manipulative films it's been my misfortune to sit through. The opening 9/11 reference was unbelievably crass and offensive and it was downhill from there. The saving grace was Laura Linney but her character just seemed to be discarded when Richard Curtis couldn't seem to contrive a way to get her back into the plot. Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson have both shown how multiple storylines can be handled to amazing effect - evoking a genuine emotional response from the audience. Richard Curtis just strings together a few popular scenes from his other scripts, desperately trying to squeeze a laugh or tear from the audience. Depressingly this is one of the most successful UK films ever - despite having little or no resemblance to any London that actually exists. I think the audience's reaction will be different in hindsight when, on a second viewing, they realise they've been had."

I don't know what has happened to Richard Curtis. Once upon a time he was one half of the writing team that brought us the brilliant, the very clever and imaginative BlackAdder series. And now he appears only able to produce harmless, clichéd, politically correct humdrum stuff, vaguely funny if you've been hiding in a hole for the last 80 years.<br/><br/>This is the man who has brought us such not-funny turkeys as Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. And now he's gone a step further backwards and written and directed something that is so sentimental, so nice and cuddly that it's downright offensive! It insults it's audience, especially when they are forced to watch it in a metal tube 20,000 feet in the air.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy plays a mature rock star who uses expletives a lot. That's an example of the highly intellectual comedic content. That's funny? Then there's the nonsense. Stuff that has no roots in the real world, no link with an intelligent audience. For instance there's a pre-teen kid, who's supposedly in love. We're supposed to believe in him? We're supposed to care about the deluded little tyke?

","As a fan of Richard Curtis's previous material, in particular Blackadder, Four Weddings, Bridget Jones etc. I was sorry to miss Love Actually at the cinema, and finally got around to watching it on DVD months later. However, the film was so appallingly bad it's taken me some time to find the words to review it. I admit that I was immediately biased against it after the opening scene with the incredibly tasteless remark about September 11, however I was prepared to overlook this as an unfortunate lack of judgement and have faith that the rest of the film would make up for it. Sadly things just got steadily worse.<br/><br/>So many story lines, so little substance, and so much complete tripe: the honourable British PM falling in love with his Eliza Doolittle clone of a tea lady, while standing up to the oafish American president (a dig at Blair and Bush that didn't work at all); Martine McCutcheon, in the role of said tea lady drove me to distraction (OK we get it  tough girls from South London say ""f*ck"" a lot  it really ain't that funny); the storyline with Liam Neeson and that scarily annoying kid was teeth-grindingly horrid; the porn stars smiling away and having a wonderful time at work was just plain offensive; and by the time the dorky guy brought back the stereotypically hot chicks from the US, I just wanted to yell at the screen in frustration. And in response to those who defend the film on the basis of ""it's fantasy, it's not meant to be realistic, you're missing the point etc."" - I beg to say it is you who is missing the point - some of the most brilliant films in the history of cinema have been unrealistic, however the problem with the contrived crap in Love Actually was the fact that it was unfunny and most of the plot lines totally pointless.<br/><br/>Frustratingly, the few stories that had potential here were cut short: Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's characters' marriage problems could have been expanded upon, giving the viewer more of a chance to identify and sympathise with them; it may have been interesting to have some explanation of Laura Linney's character's relationship with her mentally ill brother and the rest of her family; some background on Colin Firth's character and the Portuguese girl may have helped to explain how they came to be so attracted to each other - as it was their relationship didn't seem believable in the least. The only mild saving grace was Bill Nighy's ageing rocker doing his Christmas No. 1  however it was nowhere near enough to redeem the film from the rest of the drivel."

","Two romantic comedy / Hugh Grant fans were disappointed last night. After we saw Love Actually, my wife and I both thought it was a waste of money but more importantly we thought it was a waste of our minds and an insult to our humanity.<br/><br/>The movie, although acted well, takes the premise that love is erotic sentimentalism. Everyone has an animalistic sexual urge that they can't control. And that superficial, physical attraction is lifted up and sold to us as the best kind of Love. Very little about commitment or making good choices or putting family first. Of course we rarely find that in Hollywood, but what we also don't often find is such over-the-top, blatant distortion of loving relationships. Every storyline in the movie glorifies a dysfunctional relationship: sleeping with your brother's wife, adultery in the office a couple of times, a couple who gets together because they do nude scenes in the movies, getting together with your housekeeper, best-man in the wedding falls for the bride, etc.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie that keeps me wondering why I continue to send money to Hollywood is the obvious anti-Americanism and liberal agenda that comes through. A small role by the American president (played by Billy Bob Thornton) portrays a sexual doof who bullies the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). One of the supposedly most rousing scenes in the movie is when the Prime Minister stands next to the American president and shames him for not being nice to England.<br/><br/>Also, subtley, several of the characters work at an organization called Fair Trade, and the poster backdrops in the office herald the plight of the 3rd World and how we should ""help shoulder their burden"". Liberals always seem to love globalist organizations like these that decry our capitalist system as exploitative when it is this very system that gives them the economic freedom to make movies such as this. Why do we often have these political ideas injected into movies that should just be good romantic comedy?<br/><br/>All in all a very disappointing movie. The gratuitous nudity, ubiquitous foul language, and lack of any sense of real love instead of the erotic urges that is passed to us as Love, keeps me from recommending this movie to anyone, actually."

Hugh Grant as prime minister?<br/><br/>The flaws are too many to count, but I'll just go over some of my biggest problems with this piece of junk ...<br/><br/>1. There is not one single character that is even moderately developed. We are flooded with all these situations in which these humanoids are supposedly falling in love, or already in love, with each other yet we have absolutely no idea why, nor in most cases do the characters seem to know either. <br/><br/><ul><li>Writer falls in love with maid. Let's not bother with the fact they've never spoken a single word to each other (they don't speak a common tongue) and don't know each other at all. She looks good in a bathing suit. Apparently that's all that's necessary for a guy to ask a girl to marry him (and for her to say yes). Superficial garbage relationship #1.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Prime minister falls in love with his secretary. Do any of us know why, other than the fact she likes to swear in inappropriate places? No, of course not. That would require writing and actual ... you know ... story. Superficial garbage relationship #2.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Office-worker lady is in love with a co-worker. Do we know why? Do we get to know either of these characters at all? Of course not. That would once again involve actually developing a story. All we know is the guy looks like an abercrombie and fitch model. If there's any other reason to love the guy, we sure don't know about it. Superficial garbage relationship #3.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dude is in love with his best friend's wife. Sure, she's Keira Knightley and therefore hot as hell. Do we have any other idea why this guy is in love with her, and willing to hit on his friend's wife behind his back? No, of course not. Once again, apparently all we need to know to is that she's hot ... the end. Superficial garbage relationship #4.</li></ul><br/><br/>2. Bizarre misogyny. Almost all the relationships in this movie involve some extreme power differential b/w the male and female. The guys want the hot chicks because they're hot, the hot chicks want the old fart guys because ... because ... I'm not sure. Because they have good jobs I guess. There's also an inordinate amount of time where one of the hot chicks is bagged on repeatedly for being ""fat"". Note this is a girl that could only be considered ""fat"" in the movie-make-believe world. Even in that world it still doesn't make any sense. The term ""fat"" is one of the last that would come to mind when describing her and I spent more than a couple minutes scratching my head trying to figure out why characters were making fun of her physical appearance. On any other universe she's a solid ""9"". If this girl is lucky to have a relationship because she's ""fat"", all I can say to the rest of you women out there is you might as well shoot yourselves, cause she's hotter than 98% of you. <br/><br/>3. You know how in a good romance movie there is often that one point where the characters finally have their big connection which fulfills the build-up of the movie over the first couple acts? This movie just skips all the stuff involved in actually telling the story of relationships and just has the sappy payoff ... in every scene of the movie ... over and over again. While watching this wreck I couldn't help but feeling that the writer just took the payoff scene in his top 50 favorite romance movies and just wrote them all into one movie. Too bad he left out all the stuff leading up to the payoffs (character, plot, theme, etc) that made them work in the first place.<br/><br/>Pure junk. One of the worst movies I've seen."

Of this type of movies (I don't think it's big enough to be called a genre), the one I like best is Playing By Heart (1998) which, by comparison, has a little bit more to offer in stories, characters and coherence, as well as a brilliant coup in the end that ties everything together neatly. Love Actually is nevertheless an enjoyable movie, particularly in the holiday season. Also, a movie with British accents is always a refreshing experience, even though it is not a Shakespeare, Shaw or Wilde adaptation.<br/><br/>
For me, the movie starts with a powerful vampire (I just saw Underworld a week ago). Bill Nighy, considered by many as the best of the lot in this movie, is however not the whole show. What I would like to do is to rank the stories/relationships in the movie by purely personal preference.<br/><br/>1.  The love story in which language barrier is demolished<br/><br/>The relationship between Jamie (Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) is one of beauty in simplicity. The play with the language barrier is quite clever. Firth, who played a marvellous Jack in The Importance of Being Ernest, is all sincerity and gentleness here. Don't know how they discovered Moniz, but her exquisite charm is quite irresistible. Together, they make the most beautiful pair (visually and romantically) in this movie, and get my gold.<br/><br/>2.  Friendship is love, and love is friendship   <br/><br/>The silver I award to a pair of business partners who, unknowingly until the sparkle of Christmas magic, has become life-long, loyal friends. The ambitious title of the movie simply cannot be fulfilled without a couple of old guys having a few beers on Christmas eve in front of a TV set watching.whatever (the movie says porno, but an NFL or European Cup game will do just as well). Must not forget to mention the outstanding performance of Bill Nighy.  	<br/><br/>3.  The `self-preservation' silent, unspoken love<br/><br/>This is a bit of a dark horse choice for bronze, but I do find Mark's (Andrew Lincoln) silent devotion to Juliet (Keira Knightley) rather affecting. Maybe it is because of the scene at Christmas Eve, his one and only attempt, in a somewhat clumsy but at the same time cute way, to express his love to lovely Juliet. <br/><br/>4.  Father and stepson<br/><br/>Had this been father and son, this would have much less impact. Unrelated by blood and probably starting as total strangers, Daniel (Liam Neeson) and Sam (Thomas Sangster) develop a bond and relationship that grew initially out of a mutual love they shared, and then a mutual love they lost. Funny rather than tear-jerking, warm rather than sympathy-courting, the relationship between this pair is nevertheless touching in many ways. Acting is great: Neeson, yes; but the boy!!<br/><br/>5.  Middle life crisis<br/><br/>The story of Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson) is probably played out every single minute around the world, through a couple of centuries. What makes it stand out here is superb acting, sensitive treatment and a forgiving spirit befitting the Yuletide season.<br/><br/>6.  Prime minister's fling<br/><br/>`Youth must have its fling' is favourite G&S lyrics, used in both The Mikado and The Pirates of Penzance. The Prime Minister in Love Actually, however, despite Hugh Grant's youthful look, does not exactly fit the description of `youth'. Fling he must have, anyway, with housemaid Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Besides being way overdone since Pretty Woman, the reason why this Cinderella story doesn't sell me is that McCutcheon I do not find particularly appealing. Given a very similar situation, I would prefer Jennifer Lopez in Maid in Manhattan any day.  <br/><br/>7.  The inexplicable obstacle<br/><br/>The story of shy Sarah (Laura Linney) and almost-as-shy Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) would have ranked much, much higher, especially after that magical dance that many of us will relate to, with treasured personal references. It's as if the scriptwriters can't bear the idea of having all the stories end happily, even when Christmas is all around. Otherwise, how on earth can it be explained that a sister's devotion to an emotionally handicapped brother can come between such a beautiful love affair. It's an insult to the two characters, as well as to the audience.<br/><br/>8.  The love god in the wild, wild west <br/><br/>Colin (Kris Marshall) the love god's is a farce that this movie can do with or without. In Christmas spirit, I'd say we keep it.<br/><br/>Finally, I would just like to mention that there is a great deal of references in this movie, particular to the music of the 60's and 70's, from the unabashed used of `Both Sides Now' to the subtle mention of `Alone Again, Naturally'. It's a pity that they don't actually play this ballad by Gilbert O'Sullivan, one of the most beautiful songs ever written."

","I've always known I'm out of step with most of the people I meet, but can I be the only person who not only detests this film with an intensity bordering on the psychotic, but who finds it utterly offensive, on every level, from first frame to last? Never have I experienced such strong emotions about a film, and it leaves me almost speechless with anger just to hear its title. To hear someone actually praise the thing causes me to weep with frustration and I often have to bite my tongue to prevent myself from delivering a tirade of erudite criticism to complete strangers. Why should this be? Could it be the well documented, revolting (and believe it or not, largely unnoticed, among UK cinema goers I have asked at least!)reference to 9/11? The illogical behaviour of characters for the sake of a cheap laugh? The gratuitous use of pornography, in a stomach-churningly smug 'hey, porn is just harmless fun' middle class liberal unthinking kind of a way? The casual anti-Americanism, the embarrassing dialogue given to 'salt of the earth' working class stereotypes, the utter, utter complete nonsense of the plot in every single one of the 'stories'? Don't get me started. I thought Notting Hill was bad enough, with its brave cripple and her eternally patient husband. Here we had Emma Thomson looking balefully noble as she endured not only her husband's infidelity, but the sound of Joni Mitchell cruelly betraying one of her own children. And as for the brat with Liam Neeson? Why wasn't he shot by airport security, as he would have been in reality or any halfway decent film, and which he, and Richard Curtis, so richly deserved. Otherwise, it was okay."

","""Love Actually"" was praised by critics and friends alike, and so I rented it.<br/><br/>Did anybody else in the world felt like they weren't watching a movie, but a horrible soap opera gone wrong? Stretched too thin among story lines, this movie scratches the already skimpy surface of cliché love plots. Shallow, shallow, shallow movie. I'm amazed I even finished it.<br/><br/>I'm not an anti-romantic; some of my favorite films are Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, and Julio Medem films in general. <br/><br/>This movie makes me feel absolutely insane; am I the only one who thought it was the most horrible movie ever? I've read some negative reviews here, but none seem to tap into the sheer horror of it all."
"Gem038","2","17","28","1 January 2004"," Severely disappointed
","I went to see this movie on a rainy day in an attempt to cheer myself up. Judging by the trailers and reviews, I was expecting a great, feel-good film. What I got was a different story.<br/><br/>I got a mangled plot, abandoned storylines, unnecessary sex jokes and swearing, boring one-dimensional characters... And only two people managed to make me laugh- UK TV presenters Ant and Dec. I cared nothing for any of the characters or storylines, save Hugh Grant, but he is wonderful at romantic comedy (pah! this film was not so much romcom as boringblurb) and I enjoy watching him. What of the porn-stars, who had plenty of time spent on them at the beginning, only to be abandoned for what must have been at least an hour? Kris Marshall, who is brilliant in the UK series ""My Family"", was given a plot and dialogue so ridiculous I had to shut my eyes and pretend it wasn't happening. Keira Knightley was wooden, as usual, but add that to a messy story and it was bordering on painful. Even the usually wonderful Alan Rickman was dull. <br/><br/>This story seemed to be entirely about sex jokes, swearing and being unfaithful. After nearly 2 hours, I couldn't bear it any more and left the cinema.<br/><br/>Love Actually would've been much better off with half the stories- in fact, no, it would've been better if this diabolical mess had never been made. Atrocious and outstandingly disappointing.<br/><br/>2/10 (just for Hugh Grant's ""Jump"" sequence and Ant + Dec)"
"apiispanen","10","27","48","9 March 2006"," positive message
","I really liked this film. The opening scene at the Heathrow airport was excellent. Such a positive message about love. I very much agreed with it - although the news is usually full of bad and negative stuff and you can easily get depressed about it - in every day life there is a lot of love around us that is not news worthy, although maybe it should be. Also I had this feeling of realizing some deep truth or message when the narrator said that when the twin towers were attacked nobody in their final moments sent messages of hate - but all messages sent were messages of love. Obvious, but still..This is a film that you should see if your are feeling a bit gloomy and need something to cheer you up."

","*Spoiler Alert - Spoiler Info Contained in Review*<br/><br/>Why did I hate this well-meaning movie so? Why? Why? It wants to convince us that love, indeed, is everywhere...but all I felt as I watched it was a growing sense of ire.<br/><br/>I couldn't possibly go into All the elements that proved to be so trite and/or offensive to me. That would take too long. Let me just list a few:<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's stepson springs to mind right off the bat. This kid is waaaay beyond precocious...and it's not funny. I felt absolutely zip empathy for this kid as, throughout the movie, he strives to meet his ladylove...a singer-girl he has a crush on. Yawn. I guess they just Had to include this, regrettably.<br/><br/>The reference to Hugh Grant's crush in the film as ""fat"". Yes, this was very annoying...and stupid. She was curvaceous. That's C-U-R-V-A-C-E-O-U-S.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie has alot of fat bias going on. There's jokes a-plenty when Colin Firth meets his house-keeper's sister, who's large. The father asks Firth if he wants to marry her. No, not the fat one!!! The other one!!! This movie can't get in enough laughs at how funny... fat people are.<br/><br/>Yes, apparently love Is all around...except if you're big. Very uplifting message, that. Thanks for driving it home, for sharing in the fat-bashing that, most certainly, is all around us.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's lots more that annoyed me. But even to have to recall it for this review is an exercise in painful masochism. This review is purely presented as an example of one of the lone voices of extreme dislike for this ""crowd-pleaser"".<br/><br/>I suppose the achingly artificial and distressingly lavish Christmas pageant at the end (where many of the characters meet up) is the true topper for this movie...about as contrived as can be.<br/><br/>I really detested all of the characters of this movie - and simply did not care At All how it turned out for any of them. A bigger bunch of dimwits in one moive I've never seen...thank goodness!!<br/><br/>It's really a crime, how so much worthwhile British talent was drafted in the name of this kind of schlock. I'm just grateful Sir Laurence Olivier has passed on...at least I didn't have to see Him running about like a giddy loon having various, nauseatingly predictable love mis-adventures that all turn out ""right"" in the end."
"ElizabethCoral","Null","20","34","12 April 2004"," All dressed up...
","Oh dear, oh dear...I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But...I'm afraid I thought it was dire. A bad, bad movie...despite the fact that Colin Firth is in it. I should really have learned by now...don't go to see the movie just because you fancy the star!<br/><br/>For me, this film falls into the ""All dressed up, and nowhere to go"" category. It's very brightly packaged, even the poster of the film had a bright red bow on it. But it's all packaging, and no substance. It's lazy, manipulative film-making. The situations are, for the most part, completely unbelievable. Prime Minister falls for tea-lady? Nope, no can do. Beautiful young woman fancies Alan Rickman? Please. Then you have some nerdy guy who decides to go to Wisconsin believing that his ""British accent"" will make him irresistible to women. And guess what happens? Yeah, you're right...he ends up having what looks like group sex with three (or is it four) hot babes. Sigh.<br/><br/>There were plenty of other things that annoyed me as well. The Colin Firth storyline was promising, but not nearly enough time was spent on it. And the storyline with Laura Linney and her mentally ill brother was very interesting but was left hanging in mid-air, with no resolution. And there was also a precocious kid, who was ""in love""(?) with another precocious kid (who must have been about 12 but was absolutely caked in make-up). Liam Neeson is a great actor but he was totally wasted in this. So much of the film was just incredibly cheesy.<br/><br/>The only storyline which brought a smile to my lips was the Bill Nighy-Gregor Fisher one. But then again...there wasn't nearly enough of it! Just when I was getting interested, off it would go to another daft storyline.<br/><br/>The trouble is, Richard Curtis & co can put out stuff like this and the public will eat it up with a spoon. He doesn't have to try hard at all...this is a movie for the easily satisfied. It's like junk food...put enough artificial colouring and flavouring in it to disguise the fact that it's not really all that good.<br/><br/>Must do better, actually."

","I went expecting a mindless bit of fun and found myself cringing for more than two hours. All these nice actors must be appalled to see themselves implicated in this disaster. The script is simply incoherent, with holes you could drive a truck through.

","Love was everywhere except my living room where I viewed this piece of crap.<br/><br/>I haven't seen an ensemble cast movie this bad since 'America's Sweethearts' -- and this had better actors.<br/><br/>There was no character development, no plot line other than the fact all of this junk happens around xmas. The 'jokes' are forced as are the emotions. There is no visible conclusion to the scenario with Rickman's character's marriage and with all the talk about deleted scenes I hope there was some sort of close, but I would rather have my eyeballs sucked out than sit through any of the 80 minutes of director's cut. <br/><br/>When it comes to the anti-American stuff  who cares? We're portrayed as a country of lust filled vixens and an over sexed president, that's not so bad, but I would hope to think someone as nasty as Billy Bob never gets elected. <br/><br/>For the reviewer who wrote 'For romantics only'  get over it. If you think this is romantic then you probably still live with your parents and attend junior high. Yes, we go to the movies for the escape, but not for lobotomies. As for the person who wrote the kid running through the airport was lucky he wasn't shot, my husband and I were rooting for the security guards (and hoped they were packing AK47s).<br/><br/>The people who enjoy this schmaltz and give tripe like this high ratings should be drowned actually."

This is a real heartwarming movie. Tons of humor and beauty for the whole family (well, if they are aloud to see it). All leading up to a great climax.

","There are directors who can hold together a film containing several narratives (Robert Altman, Woody Allen, Ron Howard, to name but three) but Richard Curtis fails miserably. There's a good film in there somewhere struggling to get out but Richard Curtis the director has employed Richard Curtis as writer and his partner Emma Freud as script editor, so there's no one to tell him that actually so many strands don't work. The Hugh Grant/Martine McCutcheon story is charming if implausible, but didn't Rob Reiner do it so much better in The American President? And Curtis seems convinced that swearing itself is funny. The Colin Firth story works much better and provides the film's best laughs. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the wife discovering her husband is at least contemplating an affair, but Alan Rickman isn't convincing. Surely such an intelligent man wouldn't really be interested in an affair with the cheap as chips office girl. Keira Knightley is beautiful and charming in the touching segment involving a nicely understated performance from Andrew Lincoln as the doting unspoken admirer. Bill Nighy camps it up in fine style as the ageing rocker, but the comedy is laid on with a trowel. The worst strands of the film involve the bereaved Liam Neeson and his stepson - the airport scene is particularly emetic, the out-of-place simulated sex scenes featuring Martin Freeman and the ludicrous section that implies that any English nerd would be viewed as a sex god in America."

","This is one of my all time favorite movies, definitely in my Top 10. Richard Curtis has done a wonderful job of writing and directing a very large cast and yet you connect with each character. Their lives, hopes and dreams of finding or keeping the love that so eludes many of us.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. I can't single out one out of them all because they are just all terrific. The way that Mr. Curtis has used music is great. The music selection plays a major role for each character and is perfect. From ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell to Kelly Clarkson's ""The Trouble With Love Is"" is both moving and haunting and I don't think I'll ever associate these songs with anything else except this movie. They belong here rightfully. Thank you Mr. Curtis, for giving us this wonderful love story that gives me the hope and courage to go out and find my one true love."

","(This comment has been written by a Swedish guy suffering from a serious hangover. So I hope you will excuse the poor English...) Firstly, for me as a common guy the genre ""romantic comedies"" doesn't rank high. Fairer to say, I try avoid them as much as is humanly possible. However, when my girlfriend brought home Love Actually and threatened with a sex-free relationship the coming weeks if I didn't watch the film with her left me without much of a choice.<br/><br/>So I sat down with her and muttered something about ""pathetic chick-flicks"", but almost as soon as the film started I found myself mesmerized by it. And believe me, no one was more surprised by this than me! It was really that kind of film you don't want to end and which you find yourself to think about long after you have picked out the DVD from the DVD-player (the opposite to mindless, branded Hollywood action-movies). The film is really funny, highly romantic (in the best sense of the world), has a great soundtrack and very well-acted by the many famous British actors.<br/><br/>The film portrays the many various aspects of love and how it affect people's life and destinies. The story follows a bunch of people living in London the weeks before Christmas whose life's are intertwined in different ways, with the common nominator being love, and a Christmas play at the end of the film...<br/><br/>The film has many peaks but I would like to especially mention the scene where Keira Knightly's character discovers her husbands best friends feelings towards her. The expression on her face together with the guys inability to stay in the same room as her as he leaves his apartment to the tones of Dido is really heart-breaking. At this point of the film I was having serious problems not the let my girlfriend see how much the film was affecting me... And even though Keira Knightley has a face to die for (I can't imagine a guy who wouldn't describe her as extremely gorgeous in this film) the strength of this scene is that the feeling of unrequited love is something most people can relate to.<br/><br/>Finally, this is a film I can highly recommend, both to guys and girls. However, if your notion of great film-making is the latest Van Diesel-movie you might get disappointed. But on the other hand, then you either have passed the point of no return when it comes to good taste in movies or you're 15 years old...."

","Well this movie is actually...excellent. It includes lots of characters who are all in love in their own special way and the whole story is set in London five weeks before Christmas. We meet Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), old singer who tries to get back on top with help of his loyal manager Joe (Gregor Fisher); David (Hugh Grant) has just become the new Prime Minister and he instantly falls in love with his new personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); Karen (Emma Thompson) and Harry (Alan Rickman) are married couple with their own problems; Sarah (Laura Linney) is women torn between a man she loves and her sick brother; Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) are fresh married, but Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with Juliet; John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) met on shooting of porn movie; Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) moves to France after he found out that his girl is cheating him with his brother and there he meets Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), young Portuguese woman; Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) hopes that he'll find 'normal' girl(s) in America; and finally there is Sam (Thomas Sangster), who is young boy and also in love, which makes a problem to his stepfather Daniel (Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>So many characters and so many actors that are beautifully composed in this movie. All that is achieved Richard Curtis in his directorial debut. His story is for everyone. I think that lots of people could find themselves in this characters that are full of life and very real. Maybe the only characters that are little stretched are the ones of John and Judy. It's hard to believe that porn actors are so shy like they are both presented. But here Curtis makes fun with everything. That's why I love Britons so much. They smile to others equally as they smile to themselves. ""Love Actually"" rises above many romantic movies because it has great story, capable direction, top class actors and magnificent soundtrack mixed with some old and some new songs. I really can't talk about all the actors in this movies cause it would last for days; instead I'll mention only two: Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy brings breath of fresh air to his character while he's making fun with his manager, his own hit song and Britney Spears. Emma Thompson, ah Emma Thompson. She makes acting so easy, makes you feel that anyone could act. She's so natural and believable, such extraordinary actress. There is also lots of cameo roles (Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory...) and one hilarious appearance of Rowan Atkinson as jewelery salesman (he's like Christmas ghost, you know when he helps young Sam).<br/><br/>Well, I almost forgot to say what is this movie about (at least how I understand it). It gives us a message; that we must search and struggle for love, we must make sacrifice, just like Jamie and Sam for example did, while Sarah choose the other way (her brother) and she gave up. Actually everything is said in the beginning; there is enough love on this world (great idea with airport arrivals). Actually, I advice you to watch this movie. Actually, I gave 10 to it, cause it's so much better then any other romantic movie I've ever watched. Or I could just say, love actually."

The title gives the impression that this is a chick flick. It is. What the title does not tell you is that this is a fantastic film. Not just for women (or overly emotional men), but for everyone. If you've ever been in love, if you ever hope to be, if you never think it will happen to you, this film is for you.<br/><br/>The relationships that are portrayed are so real. This film made me want to yell at the TV (yes, I watched it first after it came out on DVD). I wanted to root for some characters, yell at others, and cry for the rest.<br/><br/>It has been a long time (maybe ever) since I cried during a movie.

","This wasn't just bad, it was despicable. The most sexist movie I've ever seen. Even in the heyday of sexism, movies seemed to at least like women, these movie makers don't. Women are derided for looking like women (they're FAT!)and depicted as pathetic if they are over 30 or have careers or are not bimbos. The only successful pairings are between men and subservient younger women (sluts or servants) Anti-American in the most obnoxious way, no discussion of meaningful issues, just American women are sluts and our president is an overtly sinister sleaze who gropes the help (why Americans are posting positive reviews is beyond me. A super slimy Billy Bob Thornton as the president!) I haven't seen this movie in two years, I'm actually just remembering how much I hated this from reading these user comments. I'm shocked at the good ones. It wasn't at all funny, the story lines would have been trite for an old American sitcom like Love, American Style or The Love Boat. Scenes the movie makers apparently thought were funny: juxtaposing a funeral with pornography; having a very young boy whose mother has just died spout four letter words; denigrating the religious traditions of Christmas. Corny, lame, predictable, unfunny, insulting, and calculated in the most stupid, base way. This movie has it all. Why do I have to give it a 1, why no 0 score or negative numbers? I'd give this a -10. I felt sorry for some of the cast, like Laura Linney, going topless for this dreck and Hugh Grant who announced his semi-retirement, I think, around then. I don't blame him."

","I am going to be honest. For a movie that is supposed to be about love, I felt sick the whole way through. The character development was superficial and shallow and the mash-up of numerous haphazard story- lines was sporadic and distracting. I was given no real reason to care about any of the characters, no real reason to believe that the characters actually felt some form of love that extended beyond their bluntly scripted ego-motives, and I was given no real indication that any of the relationships actually had real substance. We were shown a wacky and contrived selection of insecure puppets blundering through life and 'love' like they were on some kind of...movie set. And the blasting pop music really didn't help with the 'ambiance'. Great music, sure, but not while I'm trying to make sense of this desperately driven dialog. <br/><br/>And yet...even with the movie-'magic' set-ups and the ever manipulative 'twists' of plot, some people commend the movie for being 'realistic', and for showing the 'bad with the good'. OK, first of all, it is far from realistic; secondly, the purpose of art is not to show you reality. Scientific reports are the only things that can even get close to representing reality. Art, however, tells a creative story that generates some sort of effect on its audience. Disgust is not my preferred way of being 'inspired', and I am still doubting whether the time it takes to write this review is worth it. So regardless of what the movie-makers were aspiring to, all I see this movie doing is encouraging the ill notion that love is some kind of messy sh*t-show that is impossible to understand or enjoy, but we're all suckers for it anyway. It hurts to say this, but I think the movie-makers were going for 'relatable'. Gosh, aren't we all a bunch of desperate suckers? Yeah, great feeling hey?

","This film is as bad as cinema gets, I left the screen in utter disbelief at just how terrible it was.<br/><br/>This is a film made for people who don't go to the cinema. People who don't want to be surprised by a movie, people who want it to be EXACTLY as it lays it out in the trailer. It's the most contrived product of the British film industry that I can remember. Every character is derivative of the actors' previous roles and actually damages them as a result. Watch the trailer - there's very little more in the finished film.<br/><br/>Might the film be too mushy? Heck let's throw in some of the usual Dickie Curtis toffee English swearing stuff to give it a bit of credibility. The use of the intertwined stories is pathetic as they are barely tied together by anything solid. Taken alone each individual strand is worthless - recognise the geeky guy off My Family? In his story he can't get a girlfriend in England so goes to America where chicks love the accent, he pulls there - end of story (although the word story barely counts.) The British/American integration perhaps represents the most contrived aspect especially the oh so very convincing World Leaders.<br/><br/>Hey Hugh Grant does a funny dance!! Fantastic stuff!! Honest!! This is with a doubt the worst cinema going experience I've ever had. It took me six months before I could face going back.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Four Weddings and was fond of Notting Hill and there's no denying the acting talent trying to make something, anything of this awful unfunny mess but it just feels like you're watching a first draft script of a really pointless idea. The attempts at the cultural context of 9/11 are so toe curlingly embarrassing it hurts. Curtis is a bad director by any standard. This is TV on the big screen, a film made for people to stick on at Christmas in the ""background"" - it was made to be bland and meaningless.<br/><br/>The worst thing though is that Richard Curtis knows that this is a bad film. He chooses Bill Nighy's ageing rock star as his ""vehicle"" - the character is releasing a cover of ""Love is All Around"" which is a rehash of Curtis' Four Weddings soundtrack song (much as this film is a rehash) At one point Nighy's character admits that the song is awful - but who cares it Christmas? It is obvious that this directly represents Curtis' own view on the film... It's rubbish but hey it's Christmas.<br/><br/>Curtis is laughing all the way to the bank, laughing at everyone buying into his ""rubbish"" product."
"Shoshobe","3","9","14","5 November 2010"," Two Hours of Nothing
","I didn't absolutely hate this movie, but it had some real problems. It's a mish-mash of vignettes that lead nowhere with absolutely no development of the characters or their relationships.<br/><br/>To begin, there is the dorky British bloke who flies to America looking for sex, and literally just after he arrives, has a group of beautiful women ripping his clothes off...ha ha, end of story. There is also the grieving widower, who happens to meet the lust of his life, a look-alike Claudia Schiffer...ha ha, end of story. There's also the shy porn actor who musters up the courage to ask out his co-star who he just shagged...ha ha, end of story. While these are cute little ""what if"" stories, this is where they start and end, each taking about 3.4 minutes of screen time, or actually wasting 3.4 minutes of my life.<br/><br/>Other story lines are disturbing, and do not work well in a rom-com. There's Laura Linney who uses her emotionally imbalanced brother as an excuse for not having a life of her own. Then there's the little boy who, instead of grieving over his recently departed mother, only cares about being noticed by the popular girl at school who he's never even spoken to. There's also the story of the guy stalking newlywed Kiera Knightley by going to her home (with her husband in the next room) and declaring his undying love for her by flashing a picture of a decomposing mummy. And what rom-com would be complete without the exhibitionist, drug-addicted, washed-up rockstar who emotionally abuses his manager one minute and declares his gay love for him the next? Instead, the movie should have focused on the stronger story lines involving Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant - none of which were properly developed."

","""Love Actually"" is fresh, exciting, and utterly brilliant. It could be considered a Christmas movie, as it takes place during the Christmas holidays, however I find it to be a refreshing movie to watch at any time. What's so great about this movie is the complexity of the story, and yet the simplicity of the overall message of the film- which is given right up front for all of those who miss it- ""Love actually IS everywhere"". I personally think the filmmakers did an excellent job in making the story come to life, and the actors a superb job at giving each character life. Favorite actors in this film, for me, were Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and most especially Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman. I must also sing praises for the production company this comes out of- Working Title has come out with some of the best films in the past few years, and they continue to seem light-years ahead of the major studios, perhaps because they are willing to take more chances. The only recent movie that ranks near ""Love Actually"" in my book is ""Last Holiday"", starring Queen Latifah. I think that romantic comedies like these two are what we need as a society- an escape from the everyday into something that seems sweet & more innocent. As time goes by, I think ""love actually"" will tunnel it way up from the recesses of film and become one of the most outstanding films of the decade."

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","13","22","23 February 2008"," Among the very best of its kind, a beautiful tribute to love of all sorts
","Richard Curtis is a terrific writer. I'm not convinced he can write anything properly dramatic or serious, but he has proved again and again that he has a wonderful knack for comedy, where his television work on the likes of ""Blackadder"" and ""The Vicar of Dibley"" has occasionally outshone his fantastic work on films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""The Girl in the Cafe"". Curtis is also a good fantasy writer. No, not fantasy in the Lord of the Rings sense, fantasy as done in Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"". ""Love Actually"" is a beautiful, touching, and genuinely affecting romantic fantasy in which the bits of humor work extremely well.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" works so well as a narrative for several reasons, one of them being that it's fairly unique. The easiest way to describe it would be 'interlocking', but that would sadly put it in the company of trash like Paul Haggis' abortion of a movie ""Crash"" and Inarritu's similarly unsuccessful ""Babel"". ""Love Actually"" is best described as a series of vignettes about various varieties of love.<br/><br/>The star-studded cast don't exactly have to act their hearts out but they work perfectly together, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy being the most affecting actors in the film. The film is not especially remarkable visually, but it is satisfyingly well-shot. Curtis' script is nothing short of brilliant, at least until the final scenes. If ""Love Actually"" has flaws, they come in those final scenes. They are certainly contrived, but the rest of the movie does such a good job drawing you in that you barely notice it at the end. This is a remarkable film, one that is hard to forget.<br/><br/>9/10"
"slr_image","3","13","22","13 June 2004"," Offensive...Actually
","I could go on about all the things I disliked about this movie, but other extremely eloquent reviewers have done that for me. However, there is one aspect of this film that has not been commented on that I wish to: Richard Curtis' alarming<br/><br/>obsession with weight. I work with young women, helping them to build healthy self-images, and not to buy into the unrealistic ideals that the media portray. So along comes Mr. Curtis and writes a script that continually reinforces those<br/><br/>negative images. The Martine McCutcheon character, who is a lovely, sexy,<br/><br/>healthy looking woman is referred to several times as fat. The Emma Thompson character, looking like an average, well-cared for middle-aged woman, painfully opines about the size of her bottom. I find this kind of psychological abuse intolerable and offensive, and certainly does not demonstrate any love toward women."

","My sister brought the DVD of Love Actually home for Christmas, claiming she had seen it somewhere and that it was fantastic. I checked it out and it seemed just...well, you know...like the average romantic comedy chick flick hooey-looey horse crap that Hollywood has piled on us for the last eighteen millenniums. Shrugging it off, I didn't pay much attention. Well, this New Year's Eve 2006 on the eve of 2007, we had lots of people over and we all sat down and watched it. Now before I continue, anybody who knows me well enough knows that I am an absolute complete SUCKER for romantic comedies. It's just that, well, I haven't found a good one in a long time! Well, let's just leave it at the fact that I found it, and I hit the jackpot to be honest. Mix the movie ""Crash"" with ""The Breakup"" with ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" with ""The Terminal"" with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with ""The Family Stone"" and you get LOVE ACTUALLY, the ultimate romantic comedy as the DVD cover boasts. A multi-plot storyline simply about a group of unique individuals trying to find love in foggy Londontown at Christmas time, Love Actually features a stellar all-star cast that includes many, many well-known actors and actresses. In the movie, you get to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view: love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the most popular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary, an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one other unlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming, and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romantic comedy suckers like me."

I seem to watch it every year and enjoy it, always finding one of the stories more significant than the others depending on what's going on in my life at the time.

"Jared_Andrews","2","10","16","3 September 2017"," It's not Love Actually; It's a Cheesy Love Fantasy
","Love Actually is a lot like actual love---it's wonderful until it isn't. Then everything blows up, leaving you to pick up the pieces of your devastated reality.<br/><br/>Relax. I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.<br/><br/>Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the ""hooray"" emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.<br/><br/>The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.<br/><br/>Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.<br/><br/>The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.<br/><br/>So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.<br/><br/>Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.<br/><br/>To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.<br/><br/>That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually."

"mrcaw1","1","26","50","6 June 2004"," Hate actually........
","This movie is such tripe that I now understand why a movie that was supposed to be so good did so poorly at the box office. Because the general public knows an over-hyped, shallow, vulgar, piece of crap masking as 'romantic comedy' when it sees it. <br/><br/>I should have known that something was up when the credits were barely over & Hugh Grant is narrating about love and how there really is so much love in the world and that we just don't notice it and then he remarks on how the victims of the World Trade Center when they were making their last phone calls to family had nothing but love in their hearts not hatred which is probably true but seemed a very strange choice to use in the beginning of a romantic comedy. Apparently it was a portent of things to come.<br/><br/>The movie shoves characters and story lines into our faces without any story development and then expects us to care as every clichéd trick in the book is used to squeeze an emotion out of us. My primary emotion throughout the movie was disgust. <br/><br/>On top of this was coarse language totally out of place in a quote un quote light romantic comedy.<br/><br/>So many story lines throwing so much out at us and we're supposed to be amused and engaged by all of this. <br/><br/>As usual with ""multi"" story lines, after the first story is presented, the rest only serve to interrupt and distract or force the audience no matter how unwillingly to choose which storyline they prefer.<br/><br/>It's a shame about the movie. There are some good story lines, some fine performances, Laura Linney in particular but again, the movie just jumps in without warming up it's audience so that by the time starts reaching it's dramatic peaks, you're too p***ed to care.<br/><br/>And now we get to really bad part of the movie. Hugh Grant practically doing a parody of his on screen self is absolutely, atrociously bad as none other than the Prime Minster of England.He's totally unbelievable in the role.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thorton as President of the United States in a cameo role gives another great performance as a sleazy Clinton-esqe type.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film also includes a rather silly scene where Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister at a press conference with Billy Bob's President makes a rather dumb statement to the press about how the UK is although a small country, a great one and the US has been a big bully so the UK is going to be tough too. Seriously. <br/><br/>This is presented as a serious political ""moment"" in the film. Besides the fact that the political statement is totally out of place in the film and besides the fact that UK's Prime Minister is standing strong and tall as an ally of the US despite criticism in his own country, besides all this, it's just another incredibly stupid moment in the film. <br/><br/>This is one very strange movie."
"afterthoughts","1","18","33","22 August 2005"," like dental work....
","Since the film came and went faster than Mike Tyson's fortunes, I'm not revealing anything that will ruin it for you, because only the opening credits will fail to disappoint you.<br/><br/>When one bills a film as a comedy, the crowd brings a certain expectation into the theater, and that expectation was not met by this clinker. Stephen King novels have more laughs than this film.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the first big guffaw, the death of Liam Neeson's wife. Neeson is painfully incapable of finishing the eulogy then spends the next ten minutes trying to explain the inexplicable to his son. At that point I asked my date if this was a comedy or a modern remake of Hamlet with the loss of a wife inserted for the loss of his father? I was hissed into silence by someone wearing a black duster and an air of importance.<br/><br/>Laura Linney was next in the docket. Her special agony was an institutionalized brother for whom she was responsible, whose constant calls and cries for attention kept her from ever having a relationship. The echoes down the emotional hall were so insistent that she couldn't even get a leg up after a boozy holiday party. She ached from disappointment, and we ached for her. I nodded to the know it all in the duster, because I just knew that Neelson' eulogy was not the funny part and Laura Linney's personal hell was not the funny part, the funny part was on the way.<br/><br/>You know the English... their humor is subdued. I was being set up for a Monty Python second act. Or so I thought...<br/><br/>It was Emma Thompson's turn take her fair share of holiday abuse. Blessed with this wonderful woman and beautiful children and a terrific job, her husband ignores all that and decides to chuck it all for an office trollop. He goes shopping and brings home a piece of jewelry that Emma discovers in his coat pocket, assumes it's for her, but there's no joy on Xmas eve... the jewelry is not under the tree, it's destined for another and Emma's heart ends up in the punch bowl. Her agony outstrips Laura Linney's. I could go on, but let's just say that the laughs never started.<br/><br/>The writer/director lurches into his third act by calling a perfectly fine young lady a ""cow"" because she was not pencil thin - something my date bristled at - then tried to redeem himself by having Hugh Grant - as the PM - go door to door in a working class neighborhood looking for her. He accompanies the family to a Xmas play where he steals a kiss behind the curtains and gets caught in mid-smooch when the curtains open. What a device. What a surprise. I was more surprised the eighth time I saw ""Our Town"" at the middle school down the street.<br/><br/>Did you forget about Liam Neeson's family? The writer almost did, then he realized that he'd needed to tidy up. He had Liam's son develop a thing for an American teenager in London, and of course he has a case of lock jaw when he's around her. Somehow the kid recovers his will and races through Heathrow to catch up to her and reveals his heart before the Xmas bells stop pealing. Bet you never saw that coming...<br/><br/>To sum up, there was very little romance and even less comedy. For a romantic comedy, that's a problem.<br/><br/>Four Weddings and a Funeral was a good film. With all due respect given to the writer's considerable and previously demonstrated talents, this was as poorly conceived and poorly written as any film I've ever seen."
"howie73","1","18","33","24 March 2005"," Terrible
","This is one of the worst British films ever made and I'm staggered it has such a good rating here - no accounting for taste I guess. Why is it so bad? It's cloyingly sentimental to the point of being vomit-inducing: the characters are all middle-class and boring, wrapped up in their own self-obsessed tedium. London is re-imagined as a heavenly place which it isn't. Hugh Grant plays himself yet again - ah the tedium. The jokes are unfunny. The direction is patronizing and condescending. It's also too ambitious for its own good. Director Richard Curtis has attempted (attempted being the operative word) a romantic comedy that apes the multi-narrative structure of Altman's Short Cuts. It fails miserably to weave the stories together as Altman did; instead some stories such as the Laura Linney one remain unresolved as if they don't matter to the overall naffness of this terrifyingly awful film. The musical segments are also cringe-inducingly bad. I wish Curtis would have shown some restraint."

It's a conundrum to me why this movie was such a success (no, actually it isn't: it's because of all the big name actors in it - no other reason. Well, except for the fact that most people have no taste); in my opinion it has all the hallmarks of a disaster. It is pretentious and over-sentimental, and in many scenes can't decide if it wants you to take them seriously or not. There are good bits here and there, but they are swallowed up by the tastelessness of the whole. I feel sorry for the frequently excellent Colin Firth that he's primarily getting known for horrendous comedy crap like this and that Bridget Jones tripe.<br/><br/>3 out of 10.<br/><br/>(Having said that, I must remark that the song towards the end by that kid, Olivia Olson, was fantastic.

","I am sure ""love"" actually isn't awful, but this film is. It is full of those cringing moments in which you hope to high heaven that some alien life form is not, at that moment, monitoring the people watching the film, in which case it would include you as one of the mind numbed masses. People will try to tell you that it is ""entertaining"" or ""lovey-dovey"" and even if it does have some valid points at its heart, the film remains awful. Hugh Grant, playing a good looking PM, prancing around only to be, shock of all horrors, caught by a maid is one of the lowest form of cinema I have personally seen since  Matthew MCconaughey's hand was ""accidentally"" glued to a statue's ""willy"" (see wedding planner....or don't see wedding planner..please..) The dialogue was often ""full blown groan"" worthy...see ""it has all the dark corners""...and ""it's all for you""....and almost everything said between the writer and the Portuguese girl...whether it was in Portuguese or English.<br/><br/>This film is bad. Very bad. If someone were to start up an world competition for bad films...and my say meant anything.....it would be up there with...the aforementioned Wedding Planner, American Wedding, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Legally Blonde 2 et al.

"seemeesm","1","10","17","19 February 2010"," one of the worst movies I've ever seen
","This was one movie I watched with lots of expectations thinking that a British romcom might be much better than a Hollywood one and had to sit through endless hours of watching every cliché unroll in the most excruciating manner. <br/><br/>Thinking back, what annoys me about the movie are several things. 1)what stupid plot lines! The Brit P.M, for instance has only three household staff to meet, doesn't seem to care anything about diplomacy in handling international relations and seems to have more time on his hands than even a Minister has and should have.To top it all, the speech he gave on the merits of Britain boasting of Shakespeare to Harry Potter was so stupid that at first i thought he was having a dream.The little boy's love story was so annoying i don't even want to go into it. And don't get me started on the Brit who went to America and got all the American girls with his cute Brit accent. when that story started,stupid me, i thought ""oh this jerk is going to come back and fall in love with one of the Brit girls he so despises"". That would have been predictable, but not this stupid n pointless. The emma thompson- rickman plot had some promise, but such a waste of good actors. Adultery gets the""oh, just get on with it!"" treatment that the death of the wife in the other plot gets.<br/><br/>2) why do when lovers meet, u need the whole world as the audience? when the p.m kisses the maid (conveniently on the stage), he has an audience to watch. so does Colin Firth's character when he proposes with the whole town watching anxiously and needing the ""Yes"" to be translated as well. How romantic! And the little boy has to confess his love in a crowded airport. How cute! Grrr!<br/><br/>3)What was the need of even attempting to bring these stories together? There was no meeting point. Emma Thompson conveniently turns out to be Grant's sister, one about whom he doesn't seem to bother that much, going by the movie. In fact, in the last scene when Firth comes back with his girlfriend, and Keira Knightley, Thompson n all meet him, i was thinking, ""Do they know each other?"" and only then did the very convenient wedding scene (which could have done with a lot of editing) come to my mind.I know I am repeating the word convenient many times, but that was what it was, everything was so convenient and so clichéd. <br/><br/>After watching the movie, i thought Curtis had unconsciously, in a sort of postmodern twist, given away the way the movie was going to be, thru that ""crappy"" Christmas song where the word ""love"" is replaced with ""Christmas"". Here was a movie, trying to talk about love at Christmas and turned out to be neither here nor there and was as the lines went, replacing the word ""care"" suggested by something so beautiful and varied as love by one stupid ""show"" of love."

","If you've seen any other films written by Richard Curtis -- Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, etc., then you'll know what to expect of this.<br/><br/>
Except it's nothing like as good; Curtis knows how to write stories that tug at your heartstrings, but his direction lacks the necessary discipline -- there's no real unifying plot other than that implied by the film's title, and the overriding impression is that it's a flabby, lazy effort.<br/><br/>
Most of the admittedly stellar cast cruise along on autopilot, rehearsing roles they are already well known for or even typecast in.  The few exceptions include Bill Nighy, who puts in a creditable performance, and Martine McCutcheon, who is awkward and unconvincing.<br/><br/>If you do decide to go and see this, remember to check your critical faculties in at the entrance to the auditorium.<br/><br/>2 out of 10"

","Oh dear. This is a horrible film. It follows a number of couples through their struggles with love. Cue cliché after cliché of English romantic views of love that are about 30 years out of date. I thought horrible sentimental crud like this went out of fashion in the 80's. The only thing to make it worse would be having Bon Jovi on the soundtrack! The dialogue seems to be written by College students. On the plus side, the performances are good - the actors should have been given more to work with than a few minutes each at a time which was disappointing. Hugh Grant plays the one role he can do well the same as he did in all his other films. The story lines are just embarrassing and not heartwarming at all unless you're an old widow. The story about Bill Nighy seemingly leaving his mate out is the worst but the one with Martin Freeman is one of the worst ideas I have ever come across. Its not funny and even that gets stretched over the course of the film. The Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman one is the only interesting one but that follows a tired old formula too, as if the writer has no personal experience of love - just what he/she has read/seen. This film, is aimed at weeping housewives with nothing better to do than curl up on the sofa with a box of choccies. Best leave them to it."

","Love Actually is a collage of stories centering around people living their intertwining lives in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's also something of a Who's Who of British acting at the time of its release. Almost every single British actor worth note is in this pile of droppings. Power of Christmas, I suppose, for I see no other reason for them to debase themselves like this.<br/><br/>So what exactly is wrong with this film? <br/><br/>Well, the few upsides first. It is a nice looking film. The locations are nice, the stories are varied, some even interesting, and it has that Yuletide feel to it. And the actors are talented. There are some truly nice scenes and good character moments. But that's because the actors are so good, not because the script is worth anything.<br/><br/>And the stories are terrible. Some are merely bland, like the one containing Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher. Some are just wrong, but in a funny way, like the one with Kris Marshall. But the vast majority of them are more than a bit cringe-worthy. We have over-sexualized prepubescents, a best man wooing after the bride, an adulterer, an import bride and far far too many dudes lusting after women based solely on their looks. And this is supposed to be a Christmas movie about the concept of love. Give me a break!<br/><br/>The only decent story, where I actually bought the chemistry and thought it kind of sweet, was the one containing Martin Freeman and Joanna Page. And their characters are porn stunt doubles. That should tell you something about this film."

","A lot has been said on this site about the misogyny, the stereotyping etc etc - so I won't add to it - just agree with it.<br/><br/>My point is this.....The film is ""actually"" the opposite of what it proclaims to be and I have very little doubt that the writer has any idea about romance or understands about relationships. There is much evidence of this in the film and many have been commented in the reviews here. <br/><br/>However, one scene that particularly made me angry was the notion that being in love with your best friends wife is romantic! We're supposed to find the ""Bob Dylan"" cue card scene cute and endearing. Really, this is the writers idea of romance? Glad I'm not his friend!<br/><br/>The premise of this film is basically this:<br/><br/>1. If you're grieving or have been rejected then:<br/><br/>a) if you're a middle aged man, then ""love is all around"" in the form of 20 something subservient girls or supermodels b) if you're a middle aged woman then give up and find a hobby like costume design<br/><br/>2. Its OK to ""stalk"" your best friends wife, as this is romantic and not at all creepy or disloyal<br/><br/>3. American politicians are sleazy, sex obsessed bully's and American girls are tarts!<br/><br/>4.

","This is a terrific film which follows the lives of several people in Great Britain. It uses a witty script and fantastic acting to keep the viewer enthralled in the film. Its easy to get lost in the characters. You love some of them so much while hating others to the same amount. Its a very pleasing film, but it does stay true to its name as well as a movie could anyway, it is more like Love Actually. The question is who will be lucky enough to find it this time around. Some couples of course will find their dreams, while others may have to settle for a different kind of love. It opens with a brilliant line delivered by Hugh Grant that sets the stage for the film. Enjoy watching this great Brit Flick."
"jim_ramsden","2","18","35","24 November 2003"," 9 stories, 2 worth telling
","***NOT-MUCH-TO-SPOILERS*** Okay, one story at a time in order of ascending badness. The story of an american woman (the wonderful Laura Linney) living in London whose love for a collegue is thwarted by her being constantly on-call for her mentally handicapped brother is by far the most successful thing about this film. Linney is superb, and the scenes in the mental institution are pitch perfect. This story neither tries to depress or elevate, just show. 8/10.<br/><br/>The story of a man (Liam Neeson) whose wife has recently died and whose son is in love with an american girl at school is very cheesy, not helped by the fact that the kid is scripted with adult dialogue, but is almost saved by the sheer joy of watching Neeson float through it. This would have been a good story for the kids, but unfortunately the rest of the film is filled with gratuitous swearing and nudity, so who this film is aimed at is lost on me. 5/10.<br/><br/>Juliet has married Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) whose best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) doesn't seem to like her. At first it seems he is in love with Peter, but it transpires his unrequited love with Juliet is the cause of his aloofness. This whole story seems to be building up to one scene where he does something romantic and she kisses him. Great scene, but there's nothing else going for it. 5/10.<br/><br/>Jamie (Colin Firth) is a cuckolded writer who moves to the French countryside to work on a new book. He falls in love with his Portugese (not Russian as someone from Holland says above) cleaner (this sounds like the Hugh Grant story) despite them not speaking the same language. Good idea, great comic potential, but Curtis makes nothing of it other than a tedius love story and ENDLESS, ENDLESS non-gags where one of them says something then the other 'accidentally' says something in reply. This was due a lot of jokes and has been let down. Highlights: Firth's usual charisma and a scene where his cleaner's whole village follow him through the streets on his way to propose. 4/10.<br/><br/>John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are body doubles who spend their days simulating sex scenes with each other, but when it comes to dealing with their mutual attraction they're too shy, except they do get together in the end. Good idea for a comedy? I thought so. Not a single joke in the whole story. As with the Firth story above, this is another example of 'comedy genius' Curtis failing to develop a promising idea into a funny story. 3/10.<br/><br/>Karen (Emma Thompson) discovers her husband (Alan Rickman) is on the verge of commencing an affair with an employee. And that's it. What should have been the dark side of this film has nothing in it that isn't in the premise of a hundred other films. The whole story just seemed to get dropped. Where was this idea going? And why didn't it get there? 3/10.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant as prime minister. Nuff said. Why did Thornton do this? It doesn't accuse the american government; it just insults them. And who thought Martine McCutcheon could act? This is just dire! The highlight is Grant and some bloke singing a christmas carol! And that's in the trailer!!! 2/10.<br/><br/>Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is an aged heroin-addicted rock star trying to make a comeback with a soppy Xmas rendition of Love Is All Around (geddit?). The funny thing is, he's really honest about what he thinks of it and this drives his manager (Gregor Fisher) mad. But they love each other really. The even funnier thing is that this isn't funny, or even competently written or acted. It's just a waste of time. The only decent line is the Britney Spears one - and again that's in the trailer. 1/10.<br/><br/>Annoying lad (Kris Marshall) can't pull. Convinced that his Englishness will do well for him in the US, he goes there to pull. He pulls. Four women. At once. That's it. No, it's not funny. Yes, it is retarded. 0/10.<br/><br/>Which gives this film an average of 3.4, rounded down to 3 and minus 1 for these stories not being hung together properly (some of them seem to end around the middle of the film's running time). Total: 2!<br/><br/>Nine stories, none of which are funny, and only four of which are in any way romantic. A waste of time and talent. Linney should get her kit off for projects far worthier than this in future."

"ElMaruecan82","6","8","13","17 April 2012"," Love is not like that ... and certainly not ""like that"" ...
","Remember what Diana Ross said: ""Can't hurry love, you just have to wait  Love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take""<br/><br/>Well, according to ""Love Actually"", love can come easily and quickly, count five weeks till December 25th... and you'll get it.<br/><br/>I remember the first viewing was with my best friend precisely at the end of December 2010, we wanted to watch a gangster film but, after filling our stomachs with some cans of beers, we decided to loosen up a bit and give a chance to the most improbably enjoyable film: a Brit Rom Com  and after more cans of beers, we were ecstatic. For me, it was the most feel-good and warmest romantic comedy my heart ever experienced, I almost wanted to hug my buddy and open my heart to him. The feeling lasted.<br/><br/>I saw it again, two weeks ago. I was left perplexed. I didn't even want to finish it. The magic disappeared. And I was almost ashamed of my initial reaction. Guess what was the only parameter that changed between the two viewings (besides being sober)? This time I was married. <br/><br/>And this time I saw the film with my newlywed wife, and what my heart 'experienced' the first time, was 'endured' the second. <br/><br/>In one year, I believe I learned one thing or two about love, and more than anything, about commitment. I know ""Love Actually"" is meant to be a kaleidoscope of all the love-induced situations that ever graced the silver screen for pure dramatization's sake, but this leads to underdeveloped stories canalized by a succession of painful clichés. ""I love you"" might be one of the simplest and most touching words ever said in a lifetime, it's also the most intimate and I'm not sure everyone would make a declaration of love in a crowded place.<br/><br/>And I can go on and on with all the situations that rang false in my book. Mourning a wife's death is a devastating experience that can't be swept off just because Junior is in love with the most popular girl in school, no matter how creepily smart he sounds. Being betrayed by his wife and brother is the kind of humiliations that would severely knock out any grown-up man, and I'm not sure all it took for Colin Firth's character was a non-English speaking Portuguese housekeeper. I'm not sure it takes a girl taking off her clothes in slow motion to create a love at first sight, when lust would be the most appropriate reaction.<br/><br/>Love is not just like that, and love is not ""just like that"" (snapping fingers). <br/><br/>And ""Love Actually"" consists on a successions of wannabe witty romances that would have made Woody Allen roll over his grave, if he was dead. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the whole thing is packaged in a dazzling celebration of post-9/11 post-modernistic political correctness which is a real insult to reality. A young man is in love with his best friend's wife, and we should just ""oooow"" about this because Keira Knightley is just so irresistible. The betrayed friend happens to be black like many other secondary characters that embodies the so cinematically convenient idea of differences that 'make no difference'. I never care about racial minorities' depictions in films, but since the film was obviously desperate to prove its open-mindedness, then why not featuring Indians, Pakistani, Arabs or Muslim characters for that matter? Oh yes, of course, they don't celebrate Christmas.<br/><br/>The racial thing is just the tip of the iceberg, that -in fact- betrays an extreme shallowness in the script.<br/><br/>One of the Prime Minster's assistant is black, and can easily be regarded as beautiful or ugly, following the tastes. At one point, she referred to the PM's secretary as fat, when she was just voluptuous and quite frankly had more sex appeal than her. But we're supposed to see Natalie as the ugly duckling while she's really attractive. Natalie is ugly by cinematic standards, just like her foul-mouthed language proves that she comes from the 'worst part of London'. Enough to make her unlikely romance with the PM (Hugh Grant, ladies) happen  Well, this was one of the most blatant cases of useless manipulation since the romance between a head of state and a secretary was already good material.<br/><br/>I can't believe I missed these details the first time. But at least, it makes sense considering the way the stories are handled, some end happily, some very happily, and 'foursome' lucky dorks, the Christmas miracle happened.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" betrays more what it tries to be, than what it actually is. Not any movie can have the wit of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and the warmth of ""Annie Hall"" so the film can only exploit the magic of Christmas and a penetrating music to beg us to feel good for archetypes, you know those formulaic ""You'll laugh! You'll cry!"" slogans.<br/><br/>And they're all here, the workaholic architect, the lonely writer, the office's slut, the wife (Emma Thomson) who endures the infidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman) with dignity, the climactic race to the airport for a simple declaration of love, all the multiple story lines tying up at the end in the most artificial ways (did the stories all need to be connected?). The movie tries to satisfy everyone, with interracial love, kids' crush, international love, class loves, infidelity followed by divorce, infidelity followed by reconciliation.<br/><br/>Yet, the film is so politically correct that it didn't even have the guts to ruin the 'Family' feeling by having a gay couple in the storyline, so we have a Rock star who prefers to spend Christmas with his manager, two body doubles pretending to have sex is one thing, but is a gay couple for Christmas asking too much?"

Richard Curtis has written and directed an awful movie. Don't waste your money! The best parts of the movie are shown in the commercial; everything else is rubbish. I expected more and was quite disappointed. Looks like Richard forgot to love this movie. It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's too long and it's misogynistic. They make fun of women especially those who are slightly overweight and older. Easy target. Why not make fun of bald or balding men? There seems to be an abundance of them on both coasts.

I've seen it about half a dozen times since!<br/><br/>Love Actually has 9 plots that go back and forth about love in London at Christmastime. Usually I would sit down and summarize each one, but instead I will suggest Googling Daily Dot's ranking of the plots and immediately discuss what I enjoy about the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Romantic comedies are hit or slight miss for me. Religious convictions aside, I think it's stupid for sex to advance the romances in these movies.<br/><br/>People fall in love because of who they are, their character, their beauty-inner and outer, likes, interests, etc. and NOT BECAUSE THEY BANG EACH OTHER AFTER BARELY KNOWING EACH OTHER!<br/><br/>Love Actually does have some sex in it(Hence it's R rating), but there are all kinds of love in the movie. For example, a stepfather named Daniel gives his stepson advice about how to get to know his love, showing a father-son bond. Daniel also asks if the crush is a boy, hinting that he loves his son no matter his sexual orientation.<br/><br/>One woman has a boyfriend AND a mentally unstable brother, and she sacrificed her dating life for her brother. She could have done the cognitive and gave up her brother, but she knew family came first and her brother mattered more.<br/><br/>There is also some homosexual love, pointing out that romantic love comes in multiple forms as well.<br/><br/>Aside from the love aspect, other things make Love Actually fantastic. The movie's no Citizen Kane, but every moment is so entertaining and well written.<br/><br/>Ignoring a pointless plot with sex scene stand ins, there's not a thing I'd change about the movie. (I don't love that plot but I've been less annoyed by that overtime.) To me, Love Actually is perfect. (You'll get that later.)<br/><br/>By definition, Love Actualy isn't a masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece to me. It's so fun and endearing, no words can satisfy my admiration for it. When it comes to it's subject matter, this is love....actually!"

","I watched this film recently, mainly as my partner absolutely loves it. But I must say it is one of the worst films I have watched, for many reasons. One of the story-lines involves a man (Peter) getting married to his fiancée (Juliet). This guy has a best friend (Mark) who is in love with Juliet. She eventually finds out when she sees the footage of the wedding Mark took which features her. And just her. Instead of being creeped out, she is flattered. Later on there is this romantic scene where he confesses his love (because ""It's Christmas""). How is this romantic? On the other hands another story-line features a WOMAN wanting to get it on with her (married) boss. Yet, it seems when a man does it it's romantic. But when it's a woman, then she is treated by the film as just a relationship-ruining, walking, talking vag**a. I'm not saying the secretary was in the right in any way. It's just the double-standard that gets to me here. Plus you have Colin Firth's character falling in love with a Portuguese woman. Despite neither of them being able to communicate because of the language barrier. Yeah, yeah, it's all romantic because they went and then learnt each others languages, but still, by the time they meet up again, both dual-linguistic, so Colin Firth can ask her for marriage, they still haven't actually spoken to each other yet. Then you have Colin. A guy who can't seem to get himself with any lady for some reason. I dunno, you'd think calling a woman you don't know your ""Future Wife"" would have her throw herself into your arms. He decides he'd have more luck in the US. Turns out he was unbelievably right, it a scene so completely over-the-top ridiculous and just utterly dumb, I was (and am) still convinced it was just Colin having some sleazy dream, because even in a fictional movie, it was just that ridiculous. And I haven't even got to the fat-shaming, the poor writing, the general sexism, the stupid airport scene (where the film went from completely cheesy to vomit inducing), the concept that the woman who worked at that office lost her chance at love because she has to care for her mentally ill brother, Emma Thompson's character telling a guy grieving over the death of his wife to get over it, Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman's story-arc...i could go on.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this to any one.

","London, England, and it's the run up to Christmas, and we are in the company of a number of couples dealing with the joys and problems that love can bring.<br/><br/>We open with a narration from Hugh Grant who tells us that when he is troubled by the hate in the world, he thinks of the arrivals area of Heathrow airport. A place where loved ones greet returning loved ones, a place that indeed showcases a strand of love in its joyous form. He further ventures that when the aeroplanes hit the twin towers on 9/11, as far as he knows, all those phone calls from those sadly involved were messages of love, not hate. Pertinent musings that although somewhat sombre for an opening, sets it up nicely for what Richard Curtis (writer and director) wants to say.<br/><br/>A roll call of fine British and Irish actors, and American Laura Linney, lend their considerable talents to Curtis' ensemble piece. The structure is surprisingly simple considering the number of stories being woven together, the result being that there is sure to be a story in there to either love, or, yes, even hate. Is it sentimental? Of course. Is it as stuffed as a turkey on Xmas day? Naturally. Does it stretch credibility in some strands? For sure. But only the coldest of hearts could truly decry that Love Actually is all around. Very often it's funny too. Curtis, following on from writing credits such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, continues to show himself to be a very fine writer of comedy. None more so than with Bill Nighy's past his sell by date pop star, Billy Mack. There's something for everyone in here, indeed there's likely to be something that many can associate with.<br/><br/>It's a lovely affecting film that should hopefully perk up those that get blue around the holiday season. With perceptive writing, some excellent acting (Nighy, Emma Thomson, Colin Firth et al) and a soundtrack of some worth, Love Actually is a winner. 8/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","6","9","7 December 2008"," Romantic comedy with something for everyone
","I like the thinking behind Richard Curtis' concept for ""Love Actually."" Why tell one Christmas love story when you can tell eight? Everyone loves Christmas, everyone loves love, and if you can tell eight stories that are all related but about something different, you're bound to have everyone who sees the film relate to at least one of the story lines. It sounds sort of gimmicky when put in those terms, but with good writing and some great actors, ""Love Actually"" works and is surprisingly enjoyable despite a high cheese factor.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is sort of the ultimate British-American romantic comedy. When you put Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thorton (and then some) all in the same billing, it's ridiculously impressive. You almost can't fail. I mean, at one point there is a scene featuring a sort of negotiation between Grant, the prime minister of the U.K. and Thorton, the president of the U.S. If the demographic for this film isn't overstated with Christmas and romance already, that certainly ices the cake.<br/><br/>The story lines are for the most part all good, but with eight of them, they all don't have to be. You pick the ones that you like and you stomach the ones you don't as much because you know they won't last long enough to bore or annoy you. Some people will like the more comedic ones like Bill Nighy as a recording artist trying to re-ignite his career with a hit Christmas single and some will like the more straight up romance like when Firth, an author, tries to communicate his feelings for a Portuguese woman who doesn't speak English. Fortunately, it's not disjointed either, so you don't feel you're watching several different films. Christmas time helps set that tone, but in general the mood the film is consistent in all the story lines.<br/><br/>Like most romantic comedies, there's always a cheese factor, but the better ones make you forgive the cheese. For the most part, ""Love Actually""'s cheese is very forgivable. Towards the end it gets a little out of hand, but you are so immersed in the story lines that you let it go. The humor of the film is also so strong that it also earns your appreciation regardless of how much you like romance.<br/><br/>As far as film concepts that seem like romantic comedy sell-outs are concerned, ""Love Actually"" is probably one of the best. It's diverse but cohesive and funny to all senses of humor. It has a killer cast and of course good heart and strong themes. So as much as you might think you're watching just another romantic comedy about Christmas, ""Love Actually"" at least convinces you that for the time you're wrong."
"tracytucciarone","1","7","11","29 December 2016"," Bad, and Not in the Michael Jackson Sense
","What a cast, and what a waste of their talents and our time. Every single relationship in this movie -- but for one -- was not only shallow and outright inappropriate, but didn't ring true at all.<br/><br/>A man who just lost the love of his life, his very wife, just days ago, suddenly falls in love with someone else. And his 7-year old son -- who, of course, acts like a world-weary 30 year old -- doesn't grieve the loss of his mother because he's too hung up on some chick he's never spoken to. The father and son's little recreation of the bowsprit scene from ""Titanic"" is so bad, so stupid and contrived, that I actually laughed out loud. ""How'd that bit come about?"", I asked myself. ""Now, son, you stand in front of me and hold out your arms. I'll stand behind you and hold out my arms. When Winslett and di Caprio do the same in the movie we're watching, we'll feel like we're flying!"" Chyeah. Pure goofery -- as was the father's saying to the kid, upon hearing that the boy is in love, ""Who is she? Or he?"" Shouldn't he have covered *all* the angles? It's almost 2017, man! What if the kid is a pedophile, zoophile, cougar-chaser, furry, or necrophile? And what about that oh-so-bigoted use of classical pronouns? Pops should've asked his boy, ""So, who is she, or he, or zhe, or zhim, or the mature woman, or the critter -- alive or stuffed -- or the corpse, or whatever is the object of your affections? Tell me all about zhem, son (you mind if I call you son? Is there another word you'd prefer?)!"" Our world is Brave and New, and the statistically rare must be treated as the norm these days or someone might feel left out and start carrying a sign! They might even cry! <br/><br/>Eh, if they do a remake, they'll likely handle that already ridiculous scene that way. And the critics will thumbs-up it all, as they did with this piece of crap.<br/><br/>The little kid's affair results in the standard ""chase her down at the airport before she boards that plane"" trope, too, with the kid flying by security and setting himself up for a serious smack-down by whatever TSA types are called in England. His Dad smiles. What a good Dad.<br/><br/>Anyway, then there's the guy falling in love with a woman he was completely unable to speak a single word to because they don't share a common language. He didn't just develop a crush; he proposed to her -- without having exchanged a single sentence! That's some good thinking right there! Now, I'm very far from the type to throw the word ""misogyny"" around, but sometimes the word fits, and this movie is full of it. Women are nothing but bodies in this flick -- and a perfectly lovely woman is treated like some obese freak of nature just because she isn't a size 2. She's probably a size 8, but even that is just too much flesh for a woman to carry around and get away with. The same name-calling happens to another female character as well.<br/><br/>Then there are social and power differentials in this flick's relationships that make them legally questionable and morally iffy. Bosses going after their secretaries, men going after their maids, etc., and worst of all, marital status means absolutely nothing -- not even when it comes to a woman who's been married less than a month! Seriously, this movie is nasty. All the men ended up happy and better off in the end, but any women who'd already celebrated her 30th birthday is S.O.L. One was strangely written off romantically because she has a brother who needs psychiatric care. Another was written off because her husband fell in love with someone younger, and it was his adulterous union that got the script's ""awwww, ain't that sweeeeet?""treatment. Never mind the forsaken wife. She'll manage, I guess. Lesson Learned: ""Cheating pays! (if you have testicles)."" <br/><br/>The only relationship that wasn't nauseating was the one involving the rock star and his manager, and, thank God, it wasn't a romantic one. Love Actually Part II would likely change that.<br/><br/>For realz, if you have a sense of decency and a low tolerance for totally unrealistic schmaltz, skip this load o' tripe unless you're in the mood to hate-watch something. And even then, please don't pay to see it. Don't support stuff like this and maybe they'll start making better movies someday."
"secondtake","9","7","11","27 December 2011"," Brilliant, non-stop, dazzling network of relationships, very British, very fun
","Love Actually (2003)<br/><br/>This huge network of feel good stories could have been sloppy and sappy. Oh, heck, it is sloppy and sappy, and that's why it's so lovable. And great, in its own way. A whole slew of top notch actors give really sincerely spot on performances--all of them rather brief in terms of screen time because there are so many stories here, but still satisfying.<br/><br/>What is there not to like about a movie where almost everyone succeeds in overcoming something, mostly loneliness? The point of love actually is actually just love, and falling in love, and making what love they already have meaningful. There are relationships that makes sense, like Laura Linney's heartbreaking nurturing of her mentally challenged brother to the detriment of her own love life. There is the painfully realistic and mature marriage between two sophisticated educated professionals, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, with their varying levels of sincerity. And there is the Prime Minister of Britain himself, played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love, and resists falling in love, with his secretary. Throw in a more drab if pretty-ish Keira Knightley, a wonderfully love-sick Andrew Lincoln, and the oddly adult relationship between Liam Neeson and his cute cute stepson and it gets more and more layered up and fun.<br/><br/>While certainly the film is well known here in the U.S., it is practically a national treasure, from what I gather, amongst rank and file Brits. This is a thoroughly British movie, to be sure, and more lovable for it. For one thing, they have removed all the pomp and security machinations around the Prime Minister, so he seems just like a regular lonely guy who goes to work and gets coffee. Then there is the key scene where this Hugh Grant P.M. stands up to the visiting American President, and it's a great rah-rah moment.<br/><br/>While not all the actors are British, most are, and some very much so, such as Bill Nighy who plays so dazzlingly well the aging rock star on the comeback. The terrific British comedian Rowan Atkinson has a couple of key roles that are brilliant. And so on. Of course the President is Billy Bob Thornton (Arkansas) and Linney is a good old New Yorker (bless her) and there is Claudia Schiffer who is international somehow, but born in Germany.<br/><br/>All of these people are interconnected in ways that really don't strain the plot. (A wonderfully excessive chart of all these, with French text, oddly, is clickable on the Love Actually wikipedia page.) The writing and directing are both the work of one man, Richard Curtis, who has directed only one other film but has written a slew of them (and who is only British by means of the Empire--he's from New Zealand). But if the direction is solid, the writing is sublime. Yes, it doesn't strive for Shakespeare level profundity, and it doesn't reach it, either, but it's really smart, snappy, believable, funny stuff. That will also get you in the gut if you let it."
"blawson2010","7","7","11","4 February 2010"," A romantic comedy that does not suck
","Love Actually is a British move about eight couples and their struggles with love.<br/><br/>Like Valentine's Day, Love Actually features an a-list celebrity cast; Hugh Grant, Liam Neesan and Kiera Knightly to name a few. <br/><br/>The plot of Love Actually is more real and down to earth than your typical American romantic comedy. Most of the character's stories are simple and you can see them in everyday life. The common issues some of these people are dealing with makes the characters more likable and makes the movie feel more personal.<br/><br/>Grant plays the prime minister of England and falls in love with a member of his maid staff. Neesan is helping his ten-year-old stepson tell the love of his young life how he feels. Colin Firth just found out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his younger brother and moves to the country where he falls for a woman who does not speak a lick of English.<br/><br/>At times the movie does feel a little rushed because of all the completely separate plots going on. At times it can get confusing and a lot of times viewers will be wondering why they haven't seen much of a certain characters in what feels like a long time.<br/><br/>All the actors in this movie did a good job for how little screen time they had. Only a really talented group of actors could draw an audience into the characters and story as quick as that group did.<br/><br/>Love Actually may not be completely realistic but it does what it aims for. It is a solid feel-good movie that does not make you cringe the entire film. This is not an artistically crafted love story, it's a simple movie meant to convey one simple idea; ""love actually is all around."""

","Love, Christmas, London, England <br/><br/>Richard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.<br/><br/>First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.<br/><br/>This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place."

","How do you have a stellar cast: Rickman, Nighy, Firth, Thompson, Neeson, Knightly, Grant, Linney, etc. And have such a terribly depressing, dull, boring movie???!<br/><br/>I really looked forward to this mostly because of the cast. It was actually embarrassing watching them play out a script that was surely pounded out by a group of attention deficit apes. Whoever wrote this movie had absolutely no concept on what romance apparently is. It's more a depressing demonstration on the effects of keeping your mouth shut, staying together out of habit or for the children, and carnal lust over someone with the depth of a parking lot puddle. <br/><br/>There was absolutely nothing redeeming, funny, or romantic about any of the stories or people involved in them, and the one couple (Rickman & Thompson) who you remotely find interesting spend the movie building up a semi acceptable story that completely falls flat without any passion or resolution. Rickman contemplates cheating, or does actually cheat (you never know) she finds out and confronts him on it, and that's it, nothing more, you never find out what happens. There's just some lame robotic like kiss at the airport. I was actually insulted. <br/><br/>It doesn't help that any of the couples except for Thompson & Rickman lack any chemistry together whatsoever, and even then Thomapson & Rickman are dull as dishwater. <br/><br/>Whomever wrote the part for Linney did a poor job. She started off good, but fell flat on her face as were forced to accept her role as an apparent forever enslaved spinster. <br/><br/>The tragedy is that most of these actors have either won or at least been nominated for Oscars and have actually proved their guts in romances Thompson (Sense & Sensibility), Grant (Four Weddings & A Funeral), Rickman (Truly, Madly, Deeply), Firth (Bridget Jones), Linney (The House of Mirth) need I go on?<br/><br/>I'll never recapture the time I spent watching this, and i'm getting upset thinking about it, but hopefully my review will help you in not wasting your time with this one. A horrible waste of a group of very talented passionate actors."

"tub_master_flex","9","7","11","26 December 2006"," An Instant Romantic Classic: Without the Cheese
","Whenever I see previews for a romantic-comedy involving Hugh Grant, usually I automatically make a mental note to not see that film. But this movie just felt different than the usual sappy smooch flick. That, combined with a high IMDb rating, provoked me to see this one.<br/><br/>Love Actually is a romantic comedy that thoughtfully shows different people (of different race, age, etc.) that are all involved in some predicament with love during the time around Christmas (unofficially Valentine's Day's long, lost brother). Love throws so many twists and curve balls at every individual in this movie. Yet each character attempts to rebound and step up to get what they can.<br/><br/>For one, it was fortunate to be blessed with a great cast with great direction. Even Hugh Grant (to an extent) is believable. There's some great character development which is brilliantly pulled off, considering the amount of characters. They all wonderfully demonstrate so many natural emotions that are a result of love- whether they are successful or not. There's bound to be at least one character that you'll find yourself relating to by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The writing is great. It lacks all that sappy cheesiness usually found in these movies. It's very sincere and true. Even clever, at times. It all seems to mesh perfectly with the acting- the mark of a good film.<br/><br/>Music adds so much to a movie- and this movie got a huge help from the great audio selections. Everything from a in-movie cover of ""All You Need is Love"" to occasional Beach Boys tracks. These feel-good songs really put a lot of emphasis on how great love can really can be.<br/><br/>This movie is a true gem and a must-see. I wish there could be more movies like this one; a movie that really finds a solid, pleasant subject-matter (in this case, love) and sticks to it. It never deviates from it. I usually stray away from most romantic-comedies because I'm single and get irritated at how much most movies from that genre rub romance in your face. But this movie does it in a way which leaves you hopeful and satisfied. You feel good about yourself. And therefore, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"janjenny1234","2","7","11","30 April 2006"," a clichéd romantic comedy
","Much better movies with the multiple story structure have been made in the recent past; Pulp Fiction and Magnolia come to mind. Love Actually actually owes its framework most to Mexican novellas which tell multiple dramatic stories with one cliché after the next. The eight stories in this film are so cliché ridden it's hard not to grimace, and are only accusingly saved by a clever turn of dialogue. The shy prime minster, the lovelorn writer, the sister with the troubled brother, it all adds up to tripe. Too bad a cast and a writer who have been known to do some good work, came together to make this. For the die-hard romantic comedy fan, Love Actually might suffice, but it's far from an addition to the genre."

Like very much actors, we have many famous names (hugh grant, bill nighly, colin firth, laura linney) as well as new leading actresses (keira knightley, martine mcchucteon) and not very known people (lucia moniz, rodrigo santoro, abraham lincoln) presenting us that love can be in life always, in many ways, and that you dont need neccesarily to have a boyfriend or girlfriend to be happy.

","This is a great movie to see. I think that it couldn't arrive in a better moment, just when we need that exact amount of laugh, love and relax. The message of this movie, behind all those great stories, is one of the best messages a movie can send. Love is all around, even in this violent and ""modern"" world. The stories are all great, they are funny, touching, emotional, but above all real...perhaps they don't all end happily, but thats life, and in a way, they do end happy if you see behind them. The performances are great, everybody shines in their way, you will laugh with all of them because stories are treated equally and none outcasts the others.<br/><br/>Sometimes I think its unbelievable that such a simple movie can show the best of humanity, which is love in every way, not only couples, but friends, parents, children, partners, brothers. This is the kind of movie I really enjoy because apart from the fact that is really really  well done, and makes you laugh a lot, it leaves you a brilliant sensation and, as I said, its message its so simple, but yet so true and so necessary these days.<br/><br/>Please, go see it!!

","Okay, I'm resisting the temptation to say ""crap, actually"" but that's exactly what it is. And I loved Notting Hill so it's nothing against Richard Curtis, or romantic comedies : whatever. It's just a really really bad film. You want gags? There's very few here, except for the odd Hugh Grant scene. You want romance? All you get is a snap-shot of about 10 different couples, and with only one exception you couldn't care less about any of them. This is a simply awful screenplay, and although there isn't anything wrong with the direction, I suspect now that the only reason Richard Curtis directed it himself is because no-one else would have touched it. And yes, it is anti-american, which a lot of people may not care about, and bizarrely enough anti-airport security as well, which most people probably would. However ... Colin Firth's scenes with the Portuguese lady were okay, actually (sorry) : as these were also predominantly set outside London / the UK it makes me wonder whether the writer might hit the mark again if he dared to write next time about something / somewhere a bit different to the imaginary London yuppy sapville he seems to rely on so strongly."
"Buddy-51","Null","12","22","19 September 2004"," flawed but entertaining romantic comedy
","The half dozen or so love stories that comprise 'Love Actually' are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be. This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few. They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval. Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love. The best thing about 'Love Actually' is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters. The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead. The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale 'only in the movies' moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there's a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters. It didn't). The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her. The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt. There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton's portrayal of the President of the United States, a rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light. It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.<br/><br/>'Love Actually' suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas; some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others. That is simply the nature of the beast. I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie. And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall. Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that 'Love Actually' succeeds more often than it fails. This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny. The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen. <br/><br/>'Love Actually' is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits. But that, perhaps, is as it should be. Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well."

","I don't usually comment on films, but this one was so bad that I need to say something. 1. Hugh Grant as English Prime Minister - He tells off the US President because he is sexist. I don't expect films to be completely realistic, but somehow grounded in reality. This prime minister is going to put US-English relations in jeopardy because the President hits on Hugh Grant's love interest, please. I know the film is trying to make a political statement, but this is just idiotic. 2. Keira Knightly and her husband's best friend love interest just doesn't make any sense. She marries a man and then immediately has some sort of interest in a guy who never would talk to her. The plot line just doesn't ring true. 3. They take the little kids love interest a little too seriously. 4. Are English people capable of ""sealing the deal."" or are they all too shy to actually go in for the ""kill."" The movie is frustrating in this respect. 5. Emma Thompson is dressed in a gray sweatsuit. Then in the end she wears make-up to show us that it really is partly her fault that her husband nearly cheated on her. Please don't treat me like a moron. Is this movie really worth the 2+ hours that it takes to get through - No. It is very corny and cliché throughout, at times making you want to gag in cute revulsion.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Not sure how to begin this really. I've wanted to see ""Love Actually"" for quite some time. I don't know why, I just know that I remember it being released at the cinema and being sorry for not going then. I guess a combination of Richard Curtis, the fact it was British, an all-star lineup and the occasional funny joke in trailers convinced me. Anyway, I took my time, but finally I got a chance to watch it. Quite liked it too.<br/><br/>In ""Love Actually"" we're presented with what sounds like a ridiculously complicated plot. It's not really though. Anyway, the basic premise is that there are all these different people in different situations who find love. Simple enough, until the details are filled in and then it gets confusing. I'm not going to bother going into any extreme detail though.<br/><br/>I guess I can see why people disliked this film. Other than the fact that London is not like the film portrays, and the random coincidences linking the main actors are coincidental, there's a distinct feeling of sickness at times from how sweet it is. The thing is though, you can't take the film that seriously. I admit in the past I've done it myself. When I watched Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" I almost kicked the television in I was that frustrated by it's plot. The thing is though that ""Love Actually"" doesn't want to be taken seriously (whilst at times ""The Patriot"" felt like it did). Richard Curtis has directed a film with an allstar cast, but you get the impression none of them took it too seriously and ultimately just had a laugh. Emma Thompson in particular was superb as the betrayed wife, and I can finally see why she got so much praise. Liam Neeson is also amazing as the grieving father forced to help his son deal with first love. Ultimately though, it's Neeson's son Sam in the film, little Thomas Sangster, who deserves the most praise. Sangster is excellent as the kid, putting in a decent performance. Keep an eye out, he's got a bright future.<br/><br/>I suppose the film does have a few big problems with it. Kris Marshall is infuriating in it, overplaying the goofy aspect and unlike most of his work, he bugs me in this. Billy Bob Thornton is a bit rubbish too, displaying a slimeyness which I wonder if was his character or his natural self. Other than those two, there were one or two moments when the film did get a bit extreme in it's cheeseyness, especially Hugh Grant's Prime Minister standing up against Thornton's President.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, this film is just a good laugh. It's not meant to be taken seriously, and anyone who does, obviously needs to lighten up a bit. Sit down, put your feet up, grab a beer, and relax. Just for infuriating obvious pun sake, it's quite a good film ACTUALLY."

","I have no problem enjoying a film that's obviously been made for 'entertainment purposes only'. There's a lot of great films that have been made under this banner. Nor do I consider myself to be one of those 'serious reviewers'. But even pure entertainment needs to have basic standards, i.e. a story line, a plot, characters that you can relate to. The makers of LOVE ACTUALLY have basically thrown huge wads of cash at - and appealed to the more base instincts of greed of - some of Britain's finest acting talent: Grant, Firth, Atkinson, Nighy, etc. They have then commissioned a 2nd rate writer to concoct a collection of short stories, all of them so full of anomalies and inconsistencies that it almost beggars belief. However, it's the characters themselves that are the greatest failing in this veritable pile of junk. You can almost FEEL Mr Rickman and Mr Firth cringing as they deliver some of their lines - the terribleness of it all softened by the prospect of a very large cheque heading their way in the near future. But at last they didn't have to actually listen to the dreadful 'insult to elevator music' music that accompanied virtually every scene!"

There's something great about getting to know two people and watch how their relationship unfolds through the inevitable highs and lows of dating, particularly when the stories are grounded in real-life in a way we can all relate to.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Love Actually is not one of those films.<br/><br/>I can only imagine the writers sat down one day and decided that it would be a great if they didn't have to worry about story lines, or character development, or emotional depth, and instead could simply cram as many different ""happy endings"" into a single film. <br/><br/>20 minutes later, Love Actually was born, hoorah!"

Every aspect of the script is cloying, from the strained marriage between two middle-aged parents (Thompson and Rickman) to the stomach ache-inducing romance between Firth and his Italian housekeeper, to (finally) the entirely unbelievable storyline of the prime minister (Grant) and an aide. This movie doesn't just employ every cliché known to the romantic comedy genre, it revels in them.<br/><br/>Worse, the acting is strained by the actors' knowing they've committed to a sub-par project. They try desperately to evoke something gracefully; only Nighy treats this job with the derision it deserves--slurring all of his lines in what might be an attempt to get them over with faster rather rather than a character cue."

","This movie, put together by the team who produced ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", had the potential to be a winner. It fails because it tries to be too cute for its own good, too whimsical beyond belief, and too raunchy to be considered a holiday flick. The result is a contrived script that is destined to the rental bin under the category of ""saccharine sweet"".<br/><br/>Save for the wasted, picture stealing performance of Bill Nighy .<br/><br/>This film had all the earmarks of a stinker and I am annoyed at myself for not heeding the obvious warning signs:<br/><br/>Warning 1 - Any movie that touts all the stars head shots in the lobby poster (think Airport 1975, Poseidon Adventure, etc.) is a stinker.<br/><br/>Warning 2 - The ridiculous promos that show Sarah (Laura Linney) jumping up and down on a staircase, flapping her hands in delight because the man of her dreams agrees to come up to her apartment on their first date is a scene right out of Gilmore Girls. One should have known, with that kind of cuteness, the rest of the movie would not be much better.<br/><br/>Warning 3 - Anyone who thinks the sight of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister of Britain, dancing and prancing all over 10 Downing Street to the beat of the Pointer Sisters is entertainment originality, never saw ""Risky Business"". And how about the inevitable appearance by a staffer who stands unnoticed in the background while Grant continues his dance, oblivious to her presence until he turns and is embarrassed? Done so many times on sitcoms too numerous to mention.<br/><br/>Speaking of Mr.Grant, does he have any other emotion besides ""befuddlement""?<br/><br/>And what's with all the sex and nudity? Serving only to distract the viewer from the plot lines, gratuitously bare breasted women abound throughout the film. Was it really necessary to show so many long scenes of breasts, when a fleeting glimpse or a well placed bed sheet, would have been more intriguing and less distracting.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy's portrayal of an over the hill rock star who finds love was perhaps,the most original characterization in a movie this year. Too bad it's lost in this picture of unoriginality."
"JokerSwan","5","7","12","22 November 2003"," Fragmented, unfunny movie
","<ul><li>Spoilers, in case anyone really cares-</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie is best characterized by the last scene: 100 tiny pictures of ppl hugging each other. That's just about what it was all along. A bunch of couples falling in and out of love, some of the stories very loosely related. Fragmented, difficult to follow, and none of the storylines were carried out properly. I suppose this happens when they have too many famous actors and actresses that all need a role in there somewhere. Rowan Atkinson, for example, got only one funny scene, although he's on the promo posters. They could have done so much more with him.<br/><br/>Somehow the film doesn't fit the genre. It's not really funny, and a romantic comedy should have ""happy endings"" for everyone. What happened with Keira Knightley and her husband's best friend? Did they fall in love now? So she'll leave her husband, well merry Christmas to you too. And Emma Thompson cheated on and Laura Linney stuck with an insane brother and losing the guy - not my idea of a feel-good movie.<br/><br/>As for the humor, it was really almost nonexistent. There were a few ""cute"" scenes, and I laughed heartily at Bill Nighy once or twice, but it seems the writers didn't even really try to make it funny. The jokes were predictable, forced and sometimes just plain weird (like the little girls wanting to hear Christmas carols - huh?) There was only one big laugh in the theatre during the whole movie. Didn't feel like watching a comedy. Bill Nighy as the aging rock star and Colin Firth with his Portuguese girl were funny at first, but both stories were watered down by the end. The ""fat sister"" thing was so predictable. They even hinted at it in the beginning of the movie!<br/><br/>
Speaking of which, what's with all the fat jokes?  They're ok in Bridget Jones, but here we have a normal weight girl being called ""plump"", and Emma Thompson comparing herself to Pavarotti?! Way to promote a healthy body image. Not to mention the characters who actually were fat. I wonder if the writers have weight issues?<br/><br/>Hugh Grant was, as usual, charming, but his storyline wasn't as central as I had hoped. Also, they shouldn't have brought in the politics between USA and GB. I get the Monica Lewinsky joke (""plump"" girl kissed by US president), but it just didn't fit the movie.<br/><br/>And the appalling storyline about the little boy who falls in love? 11-year-old boys do NOT fall in love. And he just lost his mother but is much sadder about a girl not noticing him? Maybe if he were 15, and the mother had died a year ago, or something. I couldn't believe the airport scene. It's even older than ""fat sister"" or ""friends are more important than success"". Too many clichés for one movie.<br/><br/>I mostly went to see this movie for Hugh Grant, so I didn't expect too much, but I was still disappointed. This movie was just too shoddily done to really touch me in any way. 5 out of 10 points (3 for Hugh Grant&Emma Thompson, 2 for the content)."
"tjcclarke","6","12","24","5 January 2004"," Curtis directorial debut fails to deliver
","Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth - Few first-time directors can ever have assembled such a formidable British cast. But Richard Curtis is no ordinary first-time director, and Love Actually is no ordinary debut. The writer and producer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill has given himself the job of helming his most ambitious project yet - A multi-stranded love story following the lives of nine Londoners in the run-up to Christmas.<br/><br/>Grant is the newly-elected post-Blair Prime Minister who develops a crush on his Downing Street maid; Rickman's marriage to Thompson is on the rocks after his head is turned by a younger woman; Neeson is a widower coming to grips with his loss by helping his step-son woo his classroom sweetheart; and Firth plays a writer who falls in love with his Portuguese cleaning lady (Lucia Moniz).<br/><br/>Some of the plot-threads lend themselves well to this kind of sugar-coated vignette: Martin Freeman (from TV's The Office) and Joanna Page play stand-ins in a pornographic film - the gag being that they are very tentatively trying to ask each other out while simulating sex acts - but others lack gravitas as a result. Emma Thompson gives a typically emotive performance as a wronged wife who keeps up appearances for the sake of her children, but the power of her scenes are diluted by the frivolity and silliness going on elsewhere<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem: The key to Curtis' previous successes has been his ability to engage audience affection for his characters. Here there is simply not enough time for this to happen. The action shifts clumsily from scene to scene. Further sub-plots are introduced with yet more hapless, lovelorn characters. It is almost as if Curtis has emptied out his 'Ideas Book' and lumped everything together under the flimsy premise that: a) they are all based in London; b) it's nearly Christmas; and c) er. that's it.<br/><br/>Well, almost. What really links all the stories (as the Prime Minister solemnly states in a voice-over at the beginning) is that 'Love Actually IS All Around'. Indeed, the soundtrack to the movie is dominated by a bastardised version of the Trogg's 'Love is all Around' with the word 'Love' replaced by 'Christmas' which a washed-up, has-been rock star (Bill Nighy) is promoting to try and get to the coveted Christmas Number One slot - a nod to Wet Wet Wet's cover of the same song which topped the charts for an eternity thanks to the popularity of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There is no disputing the fact that Curtis is a true romantic - his pursuit of lump-in-the-throat cinematic moments is as relentless as ever and there is plenty here to melt even the coldest of hearts. What irks is his tendency to pigeon-hole his characters into white middle-class dreamers. Not content with making Notting Hill look like a suburb of Henley-on-Thames, here he proceeds to do the same with the rest of London - no wonder they elected Hugh Grant Prime Minister. Love may very well be all around, but men who don't have floppy hair, perfect teeth and Etonian accents, and women who don't look like Kiera Knightley need not apply.<br/><br/>When he strays from his well-trodden path of frothy romantic comedy, you get a glimpse of something deeper. Laura Linney's character is in love with a co-worker but she is stricken with guilt about her mentally ill brother who is emotionally dependent on her. Her scenes are nicely handled, understated and genuinely moving but it is hard to take them seriously in the context of the rest of the movie. They are also so infrequent as to be rendered meaningless - you can almost hear Curtis saying: 'Cut. Wow, that was a bit intense - quick, let's play an up-beat pop song and show some footage of Hugh Grant dancing'.<br/><br/>And in fairness, he's probably right to do so. It is almost impossible to imagine any Curtis vehicle NOT featuring Grant stuttering, grinning bashfully and generally larking about. It is, let's face it, a winning formula. In this case, it really shouldn't work - after all, he is competing for screen-time with eight other stories - and yet he somehow pulls it off. There are some patchy moments: In one preposterous scene he lambastes the US President (a nice, sleazy cameo by Billy-Bob Thornton) in front of a packed press conference after catching him frisking McCutcheon the night before. One wonders what George Bush would have to do to Cherie Blair before Tony jeopardised their 'Special Relationship'. No matter. It is this story that carries the essence of the wider message - love will beat all the odds and win the day. The chemistry between Grant and McCutcheon in surprisingly strong, but it is the chemistry between Grant and Curtis that carries the movie - so much so that the other stories really only serve as padding, which is a shame because there are some nice moments scattered amongst the cloying sentimentality.<br/><br/>Love Actually is a hit largely thanks the reputations of it's director and cast (as well as the main players, there are cameos from the likes of Denise Richards, Claudia Schiffer, Ant and Dec and the ubiquitous Rowan Atkinson), but whether it will match the long-term success of Curtis' previous efforts remains to be seen. Personally, I think the film would have benefited from a stronger central plot and fewer story-lines. Romantic comedy does not lend itself well to the subtleties and complexities of inter-connected plot-threads. This style is better suited to more off-beat (and generally less commercial) movies such as Paul Thomas Anderson's excellent Magnolia.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Love Actually is an English movie about  people in  relationships.The previews make it look like a cute and funny film that you might see with family or friends. However, it is nothing but a corny, unoriginal waste of time that makes Bridget Jones' Diary look like a masterpiece.  Everything about this complete mess of a romantic comedy has scenes that have been done many times before. For an example, there are too many movies to name where there have been foreign love affairs and relationships involving older married men with young women. As a matter of fact, the movie does a bad job of indicating whether the two even had an affair. Another thing about this movie is that it is trying  too hard for laughs. So there were a few funny bits but other than that I was laughing at the stupidity. I saw this with my family and we all agreed that Love Actually shows you how you can make an absurd movie with a  good cast. I was disappointed that Keira Knightly did not have a better or a more interesting role considering she is very talented. However I am giving this movie 2 out of 10 because Bill Nighy saved the movie for his unique character as an older rock star. One of the first lines is ""Love actually is everywhere"" which is true.<br/><br/> However on a different note my quote is ""Love actually sucks."""

The only reason I enjoyed this is that it is soo over the top and unbelievable, and such a dream like scenario (who wouldn't want three lovely ladies on there arm?) that it is actually quite funny -- but still completely pointless.<br/><br/>In short: Only worth watching if you enjoy watching s**t films and then commenting on how BAD they are.<br/><br/>Crap."

Even as a cheesy Christmas love flick it's truly terrible. <br/><br/>Two hours of hackneyed clichés of British life interspersed with wholly unrealistic situations. Such as the writer who falls in love with a Portuguese woman he can't speak to or the misogynist Brit who goes to America to find easy girls, or worst of all Andrew Lincoln playing a guy who is borderline stalking his friend's WIFE Keira Knightley, and she's flattered by it. <br/><br/>The film winds up being some sort of horrid self parody, making out that love is the true meaning of Christmas and mocking the Christmas cheese hits while commercialising the holiday period itself. <br/><br/>There's so much talent involved that you start wondering what on earth went so wrong. Two hours of your life that you'll never get back."

","Love Actually is a romantic comedy that features an ensemble cast that includes Hugh Grant,Liam Neeson,Colin Firth,Laura Linney,Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman,Keira Knightley,Martine McCutcheon,Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson.The screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as their tales progress. It was written and directed by Richard Curtis. <br/><br/>The story involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet and Peter brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark, who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel, trying to help his lonely stepson Sam express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry, who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah not-so- secretly pines for a man just a few desks away, who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places.<br/><br/>Despite of the many characters involved,this is a actually a terrific film.There is plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy considering that it has created a joyful date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody.A highly recommended romantic comedy."
"sddavis63","8","5","8","30 December 2011"," A Tremendously Pleasant And Enjoyable Movie About Love
","There really aren't a lot of movies about love. There are a lot of romances, but the focus is always on the star-crossed lovers. There are star-crossed lovers in this, but the focus here is less on the characters than it is simply on the power of love as it sometimes appears in unexpected places, and as it sometimes rekindles itself after lying dormant. Sometimes we're recovering from love, sometimes love is from afar and unrequited; sometimes it's just a true and sincere friendship. But it's there. As Hugh Grant says in the opening narration: ""love, actually, is all around us.""<br/><br/>I have to confess that I'm generally not a fan of these movies that feature separate story lines that eventually intertwine. I like my movies to have a little more focus, and these movies often seem blurry instead, as you wait (often impatiently) for what you know is the inevitable moment when the various stories will intersect, and everything will be revealed. This movie, however, I enjoyed. There were, in fact, several story lines: an old rocker trying to make a comeback; a recent widower dealing with grief and his young stepson who's head over heels for a classmate; the newly elected and single British Prime Minister who's smitten with a member of the household staff; two porn actors who fall for each other on the set; a recent divorcée who falls for his maid with whom he can't even communicate with because she speaks Portuguese; a newly married couple - and the man who secretly adores the new bride; an older man being pursued by a co-worker who wonders whether to pursue her or stick with his marriage. There might have been others. Usually I would say that's way too much to include, but somehow it all worked here; the stories blended together well and complemented each other. It's a very diverse group of people, all connected by being essentially from the same town. No one relationship really dominated in the story, although the three that really stood out for me were Hugh Grant's role as the Prime Minister (the slightly confused by love character being perfect for him), Liam Neeson as the recent widower dealing with grief and helping his stepson with love and Bill Nighy as rocker Billy Mack, who adds the most comedy to the movie as he releases a Christmas album that he knows is terrible - which he tells everyone, much to the chagrin of his manager. Other lovers in this included Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Alan Rickman. There are also small (and non- romantic) parts for Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson.<br/><br/>The characters are basically all likable and pleasant, and you really find yourself hoping that love works out for all of them. It's not really a tug at your heartstrings type of movie, and while it's about love it's not what I would call a ""chick flick"" - there are too many situations faced by the respective male characters that I could relate to for it to be that. I suppose it's a bit too sappy at times, but that's in keeping with the subject matter. It's a pleasant movie - and at times it's very funny as we watch the various relationships work themselves out.

","There are some romantic comedies that could be used as a blueprint. Or maybe some directors should just watch them, before they bring out their bog standard version of ""man loves woman"" and vice versa. This episodic tale of ... well ""Love actually"", has great actors in it (Bill Nighy, Keira Nightly and so forth), that make the most of even small stories and screen time.<br/><br/>While this set around Christmas time, this is also a hint, that you shouldn't take the movie too seriously. The romantic factor in the stories works and every kind of love gets a stab at. It is a feel-good movie, a movie that speaks to the heart and actually achieves to send this message (again, too many shallow rom-coms, not here/this one though!)! I'm cynical too, but sometimes it's nice to have movie, that shows you what different meanings love can have and how love is perceived by different individuals!"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","5","8","13 May 2009"," Unshamedly sentimental, but a very well-done film!
","Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film. I was annoyed a bit by Rowan Atkinson, but I really like this. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"kitano0","9","5","8","24 December 2008"," Open Hearts, Merry Christmas
","This movie is incredible, with a heart as big as Cinemascope. All the characters are constantly opening themselves up (sometimes in spite of themselves) to the possibilities and heartbreak of actual love. In doing so, they also open up those around them for better and sometimes for worse, to show compassion and passion for those around them. It is a wonderful fable, with great music, acting, comedy and pathos. Great cameos, also, from surprising folks like Claudia Schiffer (a Christmas angel if there ever was one) and Rowan Atkinson. The last act of this movie always leaves me a puddle on the floor, and when the Beach Boys start singing, well, it's almost too much. This movie is more than about romantic love, in fact the movie itself is a tremendous gesture of generosity. The first time I watched this movie, on first release I really liked it, then the more I saw it the deeper it got for me. Now, one of my favorite movies, obviously."

","Sappy, though at times, brilliant comedy. I wanted to like it more, but the muddled, maudlin overblown resolutions didn't ring true. Wonderful performances by Laura Linney, Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy can't save this manipulative soaper. I wish Curtis had been brave enough to simply let the stories play out--some happy, some sad, some devastating. Instead, it's all tied up with a big, shiny, unrealistic bow...not what I'd expect from him. My favorite subplots were Linney's, Kiera Knightly's and Collin Firths...until Firth's morphed into a Broadway musical act-ender. Ridiculous. Liam Neeson's tale started interestingly enough, but soon suffered the fate of Firth's. If you want a film with interwoven characters behaving as human's truly behave... rent Altman's ""Nashville"". It's strange, moving, funny, and totally true. Unlike this pre-packaged heart-warmer that should be a bit of a heart=breaker, too."

","This is exactly the type of movie that gives all men the shudders when the phrase ""romantic comedy"" is uttered. Although made in England, this drivel exhibits all the worst aspects of the contrived nonsense that the Ephron sisters, and indeed many others in Hollywood, have become so adept at providing. After being forced to sit through it by my (no longer) girlfriend, I wanted to punch something in order to release the stress built up by the 90 continuous minutes of intelligence-insulting twaddle that this film presents. The worst aspect of the experience was seeing many of the best actors on the planet wasting their talent along with my time. The only mildly amusing character is Bill Nighy's rebelliously aging rock star, whilst the rest of the cast merely struggle bravely through this unfunny cliché-ridden disaster."
"wallplanner","Null","8","15","14 January 2004"," turn off your brain and enjoy the show.
","Usually, as a feminist film student with severe arthouse tendencies, I tend to avoid 'romantic comedies'' like the plague. BUT this isn't just a romance movie and that is what saves it. Yes its sacharine sweet, and overwhelmingly white  (the few black characters barely get a word in, let alone their own storyline).  And heterosexual - which I was a little confused about- they managed to get in friendship and sibling type love between the same sexes but stopped short at romantic love? Surely society's come further than that in the last little while? And refuses to discuss England's heavy class segregation (although that's kinda become a trademark of Richard Curtis's created universe I guess). Having said all that I actually enjoyed this movie, it's cute, it's a little subversive (an 11 year old kid doing the run through the airport at the last minute thing is pretty funny) and its surprisingly bitter sweet. And really it's the stories where love doesn't conquer all that place this movie a little above the rest of the rom coms, that and the superb acting from the superstar cast (especially Laura Linney and Emma Thompson). Curtis manages to blend all the stories together without being too confusing, which is quite an art considering there's more than 8 stories to fit into one movie. So basically, if you turn off your brain and relax about it you'll get a good ride. And you get to see Hugh Grant shake his booty- what's cooler than that?"
"thumb246","3","3","4","5 March 2006"," Missed the mark...badly
","This was one of the most disjointed movies I can ever remember watching. The acting was fine, even outstanding in some cases, particularly Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson. But the stories had no real meaning. There did not really seem to be a point to any of them other than the one with Neeson and his step-son. Each of the other tales by themselves could have made for an interesting movie, but jammed together as they were, they lost whatever punch they might have provided in different circumstances. It was like watching a visual rough draft of a novel-you could see scenes with potential while others made no sense. The naked couple scenes seemed to be thrown in just so they could have some nudity and had no connection to anything else. If they had concentrated on one or two stories this would have been a much stronger movie."
"intheaudience","3","3","4","29 January 2006"," Actually, a lot of it better not be called ""love.""
","I give some credit to this movie. The visual editing was creative, especially at the end. The acting my Emma Thompson was, as usual, excellent. The rest of the acting wasn't bad, either. And the movie tried hard to justify or find a rationale for an innately unconvincing argument, and goes halfway toward succeeding with me, until some of it just became so forced as to become preposterous. Thus the premise lost all credibility, and the movie became ridiculous in its shallowness and condescension.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that impulsive lust is actually love. Most people will protest that such a premise is false, and that love is something more noble and deeper than just a stirring in the loins. And I am of that mind.<br/><br/>But it seems to me this movie is arguing that such a stirring, based on nothing but something as superficial as laying one's eyes on a low-cut shirt, is actually ""love"" that one feels and therefore justifies, no, demands one to abandon one's home and family and break other societal rules or laws to satisfy that stirring. As though that stirring would last. As though that stirring were love.<br/><br/>But love, the real thing, that is, does not evaporate when one lays eyes on another ""love"" object, which in this movie could be just a cleverly designed piece of revealing clothing or a glimpse of cleavage or flesh, or some other thing equally trivial and superficial. If this were love, then it flits from one object to another. That is not love. To call that love really defiles the word."
"mwardf","3","3","4","29 December 2004"," Drivel
","It's drivel - It's a seriously good idea but it's sloppy, the links between the characters are poorly done and not exploited at all. <br/><br/>There are too many plots for us to understand the characters - so we cannot identify with them and we don't care what happens to them. <br/><br/>Too many good actors are going through the motions and fail to convince us that they are worth caring about. Only one or two strong scenes, not enough humour, all in all - drivel.<br/><br/>If many people saw this and liked it, as apparently they did, it explains why so much mainstream cinema is lightweight and worthless.<br/><br/>I suspect Richard Curtis is too busy - he should devote more time to the script and make sure that he is in the editing room so that he does not end up with a reputation which is surely much diminished by this film."

","If you are sucker for far-fetched romantic comedies, by all means go out and rent this movie - I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If not, I'd advise you to stay away as this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The acting was decent and it was filmed well but, apart from that, it was terrible.<br/><br/>The film is made up of several 'story lines' that somewhat come together at the end. Most of these stories are tired, old clichés and completely unbelievable. They have about as much connection with reality as Alien vs. Predator. A couple of scenes were fairly humorous which at least made about 2 minutes of this movie somewhat entertaining (though they certainly don't make up for the remaining 133). <br/><br/>I've got nothing against love stories as long as they are believable and meaningful. The stories that make-up this movie are neither. They are trite, unrealistic and trivialize love instead of respecting it."

","Another example of how a great cast does not equal a great film. There was a lot wrong with this film, and I think the flaws were overlooked by the (apparent) majority that praised it. This may have to do with the ""spirit of the season"" in which many people saw this mess. I saw it after Christmas, and I was ready to enjoy, if not love, this film based on the gushing reviews I'd heard and read, but was bewildered and confused by the end. Had everyone else seen a different movie? Was I heartless? Has Liam Neeson done ANYthing worthwhile in the last 5 years? Emma Thompson is excellent, of course, and the rest of the cast is passable to good, but there's never any real connection between any of the characters (I felt). Bottom line: like many Christmas movies before it, Love Actually doesn't stand up without the joy of the season in the air."

","No matter how many times I watch this film, with all it's little cameos and stories converging into a final mixed situation airport scene, I can't stop thinking that this was a lost opportunity. With the line up of top ""box office"" stars, this film falls down on some ridiculous stories and bad language. By adding the bad language it suggests that this is an adult movie, but the theme is based upon love and Christmas family togetherness, which is both confusing and annoying. Confusing because this film abandons it's aim to be a seasonal family favourite for sensationalism and the usual British idea that to make a good film that will appeal to Americans, you have to add shock tactics, that a good script and top actors are not enough. Annoying because with the bad language it doesn't qualify for the seasonal Christmas Day family film, sitting around the telly after dinner. Annoying because the story plots are so poor, with only one exception. That exception is the story with Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. They act everyone else off the film. The lost opportunity is that the film makers didn't abandon everything else and just concentrate on their story. This is one of Emma Thompson's finest moments. Such a shame that it is buried beneath such ordinariness. I would have gladly given 10 out of 10 if the film had been centred entirely around her's and Alan Rickman's characters."
"mstep-4","4","4","6","7 May 2009"," Very Kitsch
","Please be indulgent with my English. My first comment here.<br/><br/>First time I saw this movie, I was enthused. This idea to show the exit at the airport arrival and show the love behind all these people and at the end the same picture of people cuddling and kissing themselves is really moving: love is everywhere! A nice message! So I understood the enthusiastic reviews out here on IMDb.com quite well.<br/><br/>But now I watched this film for a second time, it is part of my DVD collection, and I was really shocked. Some films win, watching them more times. Some lose. ""Love Actually"" is one of the biggest Hollywood crap and pretentious kitsch I have in my collection.<br/><br/>Some reasons: the music is just terrible. It is like ketchup in every dish. The light is producing artificial studio atmosphere. To the figures of the film: Hugh Grant is charming, but always the same Hugh Grant in every film. This time as a English Prime Minister, and sorry, such a character with his mannerism in this position is only ridiculous. And these jokes about Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon) elephant thighs are very cheap and even not true. But the most terrible in this film is this sort of little adult in the body of a 13? years old boy. He is sitting there on papa's sofa, mother just died and he has nothing better to do, than to wine about a beautiful comrade in school, to whom he does not dare to declare his ""love"". He is speaking with the words of a Hollywood film scenarist, and father desperately wants to enter his children room, but does not venture it, because there is written with chalk ""keep out!"" on a slate. Is it like that, filmmakers are raising their children in Hollywood? Poor children! Poor America! And when the girlfriend - sixteen years old? - is singing in the school ""Christmas!""-celebration, imitating eroticism from show biz in television she grew up with, it is the summit of embarrassment in this film.<br/><br/>OK, there are really good actors: first of all Emma Thompson. Great artist, great personality! I liked also the couple of writer and the housekeeper lady from Portugal. The English-Portuguese Dialogs are witty. Lúcia Moniz (playing Aurelia) would merit a carrier, but looking on IMDb.com she is not doing well. What a pity! Also the old Rocker was a great pleasure to watch. I love films in mosaic technique. My answer to this film would be the films of Cédric Klapisch, which use mostly this technique. Watch out for ""Paris"", 2008 and ""L'Auberge espagnole"", 2002. And one of my favorite films in this technique is from Danièle Thompson: ""Fauteuils d'orchestre"", 2007."

Pathetic. Anyone who works with movies who gives this film a thumbs up ought to be drummed out of the industry. And any male giving it a 6 or higher might as well cut off his testicles. This movie is for functional eunuchs only.<br/><br/>There isn't a remotely realistic plot line or honest dialog in the 45 minutes I tolerated. The only honest sentiment comes from a down-and-out singer who acknowledges his current song is a craven, purely-commercial, Christmas ""turd."" One can only hope that this is a wink from the producers telling us they understand exactly what kind of movie they have made.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not just harmless fun.

But unfortunately none of the other performances are in the same league.<br/><br/>The film awkwardly straddles the divide between drama and comedy, and many of the scenes are painfully predictable. It's a rehash of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diary, with a bit of Friends cut in. There are some funny scenes, but overall the movie didn't satisfy me.

","I really didn't enjoy this film, for all its moments of comedy and several good performances. The brazen tackiness of it all raised my hackles. It wants SO MUCH for you to like it, from the title to the sound track, that it falls over itself. Further more, it isn't really about love at all. What we see time and again is desire, plain and simple. Real love (self-sacrifice, constancy, selflessness etc) barely enters the equation. In fact, you could say the parading of this imposter does it, if anything, a great disservice.

","Right off the bat, I will say that I have never been a Richard Curtis fan. 'Blackadder' I could take or leave, 'Four Weddings' made me chuckle, 'Notting Hill' had no merit whatsoever and 'Bridget Jones' almost had me at hello but then the movie started. The guy just doesn't write good stories. The only reason I get roped into seeing these films is because my girlfriends like them. I went to see 'Love Actually' because I like Christmas movies and my girlfriend at the time thought it would be a good date movie. Besides, with a cast like that how could it not at least sort-of deliver the goods? The best part of 'Love Actually:' the credits. Why? Because the credits mean that the film is over and you can leave. After walking out of the theater I never wanted to see another Christmas movie again, my girlfriend (who also hated the film) and I broke up a few weeks later (yeah, it was THAT bad), and every actor in the film is now on my ""well-they-used-to-be-good-until-they-acted-in-'Love-Actually'"" list.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Plot lines: the film had way too many. Laura Linney's story would have been the first to go had I been the one in the editing room. Her acting was no good and her phony affection toward her office worker was contrived and lame. The story of John and Just Judy also needed to be introduced to the cutting room floor. It was neither cute nor ironic the way they portrayed that you can find love on the set of a porno movie. Not that it doesn't happen, but the movie's approach just to get some nudity on screen was weak.<br/><br/>Could this film have had any more clichés? Awww . . . the desirable bachelor/Prime Minister falls in love with his fat, foul-mouthed secretary from the wrong part of town; the divorced struggling writer has the hots for his housekeeper who doesn't speak English; the triangle of the drifting husband, the shattered wife, the assistant who just wants to get in her boss's pants; the kid who learns to play the drums to get the attention of the most popular girl in school . . . where does it end? In attempting to cover every demographic the film presents itself as an insufferable mirage of one ridiculous circumstance after another. The guy who goes on the American-orgy rampage: 'nuff said.<br/><br/>At least we had Bill Nighy to add some comedic lines (his radio and TV interviews were hysterical). It's a shame that IMDb only has a scoring range from 1 to 10 as I have never in my life so badly wanted to give a film a negative score."

Somehow Emma Thompson managed to insert some power into the film with her few minutes. Those moments still haunt me a few days after seeing the movie. However, all the cute little scenes don't hang together. Most of the time I felt cheated by the movie even if I snickered at many of the scenes. Seeing Hugh Grant as Prime Minister was a hoot.

","I have never felt it necessary to write a review before. However I feel compelled to do so having watched this film last night. My wife and I looked on utterly flabbergasted as sexist stereotypes and 'awkward English' clichés spewed forth before our eyes. It's the sort of film I will be actively encouraging everyone I ever meet for the rest of my life to never watch, even for 'a bit of fun' - it really is that bad. Why? Several reasons, not least of which is the despicable misrepresentation of women throughout the film. For some reason all women are in a subservient role, for example secretaries, cleaners, housewives etc. while all men are powerful: writers, creative directors, photographers, Prime Ministers(!) etc. We witness many men lustfully pursuing women and manipulating them to their own end. Lessons to be learned here are for example that being a man and not being able to form a relationship in your own country is not a problem because you can go to another and women will throw themselves at you; a dad advises his son to take up drums because Ringo Starr has a beautiful girlfriend he's a drummer in a band; also, we are to look out for attractive 'femme-fatale' secretaries who will try to lead us astray from our middle- class English family unit. This movie is not a 'bit of fun' - it is a dangerous mix of off-the-shelf, ill-considered, misogynist fantasy which confuses love with sex, all from a disturbingly predatory male- centric viewpoint. When I give it 1 star, I mean it - it is utterly awful. Free-thinkers - avoid this movie and encourage others to follow."

","I wanted to be able to write a review on how utterly bad this movie was and especially considering the impressive cast.<br/><br/>Love actually is all around us is what the film opens with. Then proceeds to try and pull the wool over our eyes by showing stories mostly consisting of lust, immaturity, misogyny, and stupid self-indulgence.<br/><br/>A maid who doesn't speak his language takes her clothes off and has a tramp stamp – all that is needed for true love for writer whose wife cheated on him. Spends 3 seconds at his family's house at Christmas but leaves to be with the maid and propose marriage when they haven't even had a real conversation.<br/><br/>Prime Minister who disses American President because he kisses girl that works in the office from the wrong side of the tracks.; they call her chubby, which she clearly isn't; then he ""redistributes her"" from the office. But he dances around like Tom Cruise so isn't he cute and relatablenot. Gets a Christmas card and goes to find her door to door (100 of them); because the Prime Minister clearly has no one who could get her address in 3 seconds flat.<br/><br/>Wife who just got married has an affair with photographer friend of her husband. But don't worry about her, she remarks how pretty she looks in the video.<br/><br/>Boring wife and husband with young coworker woman sexually attracted to him. She figures out he is cheating with chick 20 years younger.<br/><br/>Hideous plot line about a widower who just buried his wife and is worried about his son's behavior. The kid's terrible problem is that he is in love – his is like 8 yrs old and this is his focus. No sadness at Christmas missing his dead mom, just playing drums to get the attention of a girl; staring at her creepily. Encourage your 8 yr old to ignore security and run around alone in the airport - what an awesome dad. I found the kid to be an evil troll after this movie without any crying for his mother. He will grow up to be an uncaring vapid adult.<br/><br/>Old weird has-been singer trying to make a comeback.whatever. Bored.<br/><br/>Weirdo 2 – going to America to get laid. Gets lucky his first night in America with 4 hot chicks who take a stranger home and have an orgy.see true love. ""Love"" is actually all around us y'all. Remember the beginning of the movie told us.<br/><br/>Naked movie stand-in couple – just for the nudity obviously.<br/><br/>The only story I cared about was Laura Linney who had feelings for her coworker and everyone knew it. She had a special needs brother that needed attention. She was absent from the ending – what a waste.<br/><br/>Ending – everyone hugging at the airport – because you know, when I think of the airport, the first thing I associate with it is hugging happy people."

(you have to excuse me here I am finding it very hard to control my anger - I know, I sound like a nut case but this is the effect that this movie had on me) ... so this young man flies to America to meet chicks, checks out of the airport into a cab and goes to the first bar that hits them, walks in and before he is settled in he is chatted up by this gorgeous chick who is waiting for her gorgeous friend who then are joined by their third gorgeous chick friend who tells him that he can stay with them if he wants but he has to bare with them because they are too poor to afford more than one bed - and get this - they are too poor to afford pajamas so they will all have to cuddle up naked together ... I think I'm going to throw up ... really ... throw up ... so is this satire ? (wink wink if you read this - you know who you are) what is this and what bearing does it have on anything??? This movie is so bad it has brought out the worst in me!!! can you believe that? a movie that has actually made me feel like killing someone ...At least I see that some intelligent people felt the same way about it as I do ... and you know what?

Not even Alan Rickman (my hero) was able to save the blasted film. Everything about it was a very played out tired cliché and the ending did not add up. Particularly the relationship between the cleaning lady and the writer, they barely new each other, never had a REAL conversation, hardly even saw one another, how the hell did they end up getting hitched??? Another ridiculous problem with the script was that hideous dork that decided to go to America to get laid! Three or four really gorgeous girls in a dingy dive of a bar just happen to stroll in, and take him home for sex? I thought they were going to rob his naive tourist looking scrawny a** but it turns out that the writer actually thinks the audience is that naive because he did get laid on his first night in the states! Honey, if the ladies in London won't lay him than the girls in America won't touch him with a ten foot cattle prod. That's 120 minutes of my life that I'll never get back;("

All the women but one appeared brainless, attraction between all was based on shallow physical attributes that were really nothing more than infatuation, and women were demeaned to the point of nausea. That said, the format and non-linear story line were clever, with paths crossing here and there and some coming together in the end.

It's one thing to put up with filthy mouths in a movie with a good story, like ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", and another to get a ear full of it in some corny, not funny and utterly overrated movie such as ""Love Actually"". My only regret is that this was the very first movie I ever saw with Colin Firth, and though at that time I had no idea who he was, his storyline in this movie was the most tolerable of them all.

The acting was OK for what it was, but I found that I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew virtually nothing about any of them. If you like this movie it must be because you like the idea of love, any love, and don't much care for any plot to explain why you would care. Ugh. Really awful. What I can't really understand was why such good talent, like Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson would be in something with so weak a plot.

In fact, the drawn out ending is a blessing because it tells you that you don't have to spend any more time with these horrible cardboard people.

","After a silly intro about terrorism, the rest of the movie features what, if we're being honest, everyone wants to see: people meeting and falling in love. Its the best part of every love story: so instead of dealing with all the unpleasantness that follows (a la Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), let's just have excerpts from twelve characters who experience only those good bits.<br/><br/>I'm not doing it justice by saying its only the good bits - its more like the most vibrant bits. Two or three stories have a more sombre, sour quality. But vibrant highs and lows are not unique to Love Actually - they're a staple of any melodrama: they are the definition of melodrama! In this context, though, as happy ending as was possible considering the premise of each short story, was affixed.<br/><br/>I think he's cottoned onto a good idea with this - take the best (or most interesting) bits from many short stories and stitch them together into one movie. I thought the connecting material was sometimes weak, and i often felt we were just bouncing back and forth from story to story, progressing like a cement-mixer across the narrative. A bit to mechanised, not fluid enough, in other words. Also, i never felt like i got to know these characters. There's no time to really delve into any of these stories - which leaves us with something that's fairly superficial. But not as superficial as you might think.<br/><br/>This is indubitably popcorn entertainment, and a fitting choice for a couple looking for a romantic night at home, but you didn't need me to tell you that.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Highlights: I was glad i saw this for Bill Nighy, who plays the aging has-been pop star. He's hysterical. There is one strikingly beautiful scene of the movie, where Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now is put to good use."

","This film would have been a lot better had the number of stories been cut and each plot allowed to develop a little further. Often this film was cringing, the PM dancing to 'Jump' (sadly not Van Halen either) and the school boy who has fallen in love. There were some redeeming features, particularly involving Alan Rickman's relationship with his PA(?), Andrew Lincoln's with Keira Knightley and the story of Colin Firth's relationship, but apart from the latter, these stories were not allowed to develop. As with all Richard Curtis films the characters are so bloody British and upper middle-class that frankly it gets rather tiring and the formula of sticking Hugh Grant as a main character and having Rowan Atkinson in a small role is wearing rather thin."

This film tragically reinforces the message to more impressionable viewers that there are two basic classes of people - the thin, attractive ones and the fat ugly ones. I found the film divisive, shallow and empty as a result. It's a sad fact that if the negative references were about race or height, there would have been an outcry, and the film would never have made it to the big screen.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film will be forgotten, not least of all because it is incoherent.

"tedg","Null","7","14","27 November 2003"," Structured Simultaneity
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for date movies: I laugh and cry - especially cry - along with the rest. And then feel violated afterwards by the asymmetry of reward: they get my money time and a piece of my soul and I get useless platitudes.<br/><br/>This case is no different so far as formulaic and trivial romance. That's the nature of film love. But I did get something different here that made this worthwhile: competent writing for once.<br/><br/>And yes, much of the writing - the structure I mean - is formulaic, but it was so well done. The matter is ordinary, but the manner of the machinery was novel.<br/><br/>This film follows several recent experiments in presenting several stories that annotate one idea. The principle is that film abstracts and reduces, so if you want to get depth, you have to combine several reductions. `13 Conversations About One Thing,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' `Ten Tiny Love Stories' and several others follow this route.<br/><br/>The idea is that there is one prototypical woman, or couple. What you see as narrative are different dimensions of that. The problem for the writer is one of folded structure. Each individual story has to engage and have a dramatic arc, because that's where the viewers' attention will be. <br/><br/>But the whole composition has to be woven into one experience, and that needs traditional cinematic shape as well.<br/><br/>To help with this, the writer Curtis has pulled a number of tricks:<br/><br/>-this is a piece of film writing, so some of his characters are in film (the sex body doubles) or writers (Firth) or in publishing (Rickman and his company including Linney). The Nighy character is a performer as well, often on TeeVee and provides the structural link to...<br/><br/>-the tremendously effective integration of song and narrative. Song interfaces with the story in as many ways as there are stories: as traditional background, as a plot point: Joanna and Billy Mack, as a plot action (the kids, Grant's two adventures), as both in the Joni Mitchell bit.. And on and on in so many ways this could be as varied with song narrative as `Citizen Kane' meets `Singing Detective.'<br/><br/>-The art of `bracketing.' That's where you set outposts that are intended to be different and unsuccessful so that the middle is raised. For instance, the `love' is bracketed on one side by the absurdly fantastic Wisconsin sequence and the heavily U.N. Date- movieish Linney problem with her brother. These were supposed to stand out, be different in tone and outside the main machinery.<br/><br/>Other bracketing is obvious: the easy sex/love (Liam meets Claudia) and the seemingly impossible in the rock star's. This latter is emphasized in his sexy vixen video. And again between the love without sex (the love for the best friend's wife) and the sex without love (the body doubles).<br/><br/>Yes, this is all known and taught. But it is good to see it all pulled off.<br/><br/>The director Curtis pulls a great strategy:<br/><br/>-write something extremely tight<br/><br/>-get the most talented and independent actors possible<br/><br/>-get out of their way<br/><br/>One can see that the acting styles here are incoherent. They clearly do not spring from one mind, rather reflect whatever philosophy that actor has. This would be a flaw in another film, but here, the whole idea is to have different dimensions as part of the whole.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Plenty of foul-mouthed characters who are superficial on every level (unloveable and a cliché). It's very soap opera-ish and not really a comedy.

I think it is a dreadful movie, the little boy striking me as particularly trite. I think Richard Curtis just said, ""Let's have a really sweet little boy who finds the love of his life and makes everyone go 'aaah'."" ""But will it have any jokes Richard?"" ""No! People will think it's funny because I co-wrote Blackadder. Oh alright, I'll recycle some humour from Notting Hill, no-one hated that film!"" For more touching, charming and funny films I would recommend the following: Se7en, Carrie, Braveheart, The Dirty Dozen, The Silence of the Lambs. <br/><br/>I think deep-frying my own skin would be a more effective source of joy than this dismal piece of garbage. The only tears I cried were for Alan Rickman's dignity, and his magnificent descent from Die Hard. When did people decide that comedies should be more about plot and characters than about being funny (When Harry Met Sally... proved both are possible- in my opinion unquestionably the greatest rom-com of all time). Which is more enjoyable: Love Actually or Police Academy? I think the latter, because it is simply trying to make people laugh, unlike this steaming crapola, which was trying to do god knows what.

","This movie truly is pretty damned awful. It's a shame, with all the talent in it, and high production values (it's often very pretty to look at, at least). Goodness knows, I'm just as susceptible as any romantic sap, to a good--even sappy or corny--romantic comedy. But this was mostly just annoying. It's like the film's makers had a big manual, filled with standard romantic comedy clichés and situations, along with a few new twists that are not improvements on the tried (sometime tired) and true. Then they stuffed the movie with 'way too many characters, and began assigning the various clichés to them, like assigning numbers in a crowded shop.<br/><br/>The movie makers seemed intent on achieving heart-tugging moments, cutesy moments and other such moments, at prescribed intervals throughout the film. Unfortunately, they're just as fake as can be--no truth or genuine emotion in sight, other than glimmers some of the actors can evoke, which is only more annoying, given that the context those actors are in don't support or deserve those glimmers. Think little diamond chips sprinkled on dog poo. Yuck. Won't even go into all the misogyny, the needless swearing, crassness, ageism, lookism (let's all laugh at the heavy Portuguese woman, and cheer her father for being mean to her!)--oy, what a mess! Have these film makers never heard of the concept of ""character development?"" At moments like Colin Firth's march to the restaurant, and awkward marriage proposal, I really thought this might be a spoof, it was so bad and ham-fisted. Doing that with an actor of his caliber should be illegal.<br/><br/>It all culminates in a ridiculous, over-the-top (and not in a good way) final sequence that puts all these characters (with possible exception of Laura Linney's--not sure. Was she not available for that particular shooting schedule?) in one place, supposedly tying up their various stories into ""happy ending"" cinematic Christmas packages. GAG! <br/><br/>The main, big, unforgivable problem with LOVE, ACTUALLY is that none of these emotional moments is earned at all. They're just stuck on to the surface of the movie, like a big, pointless, ineffective mosaic. The finished product of this chaos is an annoying, cloying, self-indulgent, hackneyed MESS.

","Because I found myself gagging at this cavalcade of middle class self-satisfied dross and needed the sick bag when I saw Emma Thompson on the screen. Add to this a cameo role for Rowan Atkinson and we're in business.<br/><br/>Yes, it's the return of Richard Curtis. You remember him, surely? He was the one who made us all laugh with his film about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Then there was his follow-up film about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Not forgetting the one about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Well, he's back, still not presenting us with anything approaching a genuine human emotion and yes, posh people do indeed say ""f***"" a lot. Well, to be fair, only a bit this time around.<br/><br/>Because Curtis has at least branched out, making this the most watchable of his luvvied-up monstrosities by presenting us with a series of vignettes. Naturally, we get Hugh Grant and his ""I'm posh, whoops, I've said f***, and here's a dead pan take to a blatantly obvious social juxtaposition"" shenanigans. To be honest, I do quite like Hugh despite myself, so he doesn't produce the biggest allergic reaction. Neither does Thompson, who gets the most depth, and the story that doesn't have a happy ending. Probably the biggest non-starter is the sweet rendition of All You Need Is Love which then unfolds into a full brass band playing in the church. Well, imagine that! A full brass band! In a church of all places! How I laughed.<br/><br/>Some have actually criticised Curtis for not splicing his vignettes together successfully enough, like they're watching Robert Altman or even Kurosawa. For God's sake, it's just some tatty comedy for posh people who don't get out much, it's not supposed to be art. Yet while I give the writer/director some slack there, it must be said that not all of his pieces actually go anywhere. Particularly of note is the one with the talented Kris Marshall, who dreams of going to America where he believes all US girls will want to sleep with him because of his accent. So he goes there and... four US girls sleep with him because of his accent. And the punchline is...?<br/><br/>Despite coming out of the noxious All You Need Is Love scene, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln do come off better than most, Lincoln because he gets to, like Thompson, show something beneath the self-amused surface, and Knightley, well, just because I would. Big time. Other highlights include two pairs of bare breasts, Bill Nighy in parts, two pairs of bare breasts, some gratuitous cameos, two pairs of bare breasts, an okayish yarn for Colin Firth and two pairs of bare breasts.<br/><br/>But this is the wacky, zany world of Richard Curtis, a land where everyone is a great British eccentric, and even the sole working class character (Martine McCutcheon) and her family are just offbeat and loveable. It opens by allying itself with the events of September 11th, an event nicely re-alluded to at the end by a so-so scene that shows lax airport security. This is a world where everyone talks, hugs and can find true love... just as long as they're straight, able-bodied, middle class and good-looking. <br/><br/>
You do have to question in what reality the Prime Minister's nephews and nieces would go to the same school as the kids from the roughest end of town, though thankfully with Nighy's ""Christmas Is All Around"" life didn't imitate non-art. On the one hand fairly amusing, on the other a smug self-reflexive reference to his own Four Weddings and a Funeral, the real record-buying public saw the film's No.1 Christmas single barely trouble the top thirty. It's a small phyrric victory in a war of bland."

","I had seen the ending of ""Love Actually"" on cable television and never was inspired to rent or borrow the movie. I suppose it was the idea that Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister was just such a ridiculous idea that I felt the entire movie was a bunch of hog wash. Illogical actions like the Prime Minister dragging members of his security out on Christmas Eve to hunt up and down a street for a girl was a bit stupid since as the head of England government couldn't have her address within seconds of requesting it.<br/><br/>However, as I have recently had a fixation on the career of Colin Firth and found out he was in it, I fought with myself for several weeks before renting the film  and brother! I just couldn't believe the disgusting crap that was in almost every scene and the over powering anti-American attitude.<br/><br/>From the fact that our American president was portrayed as a womanizer (which I am assuming they meant Clinton except the actor looked like Bush) and a bully and a plain old-fashioned jerk to the fact that ALL American women are represented as loose, into kinky sex and available at the drop of an English accent was predominant.<br/><br/>What do you think really bugs the English about America and our people? Could it be the fact that so far, their European influence and amoral attitude hasn't completely destroyed our Christian stability in this country? Or could it be that whenever they get into a disagreement with another country like Germany or Italy, we have to bail their fannies out of it by sending American troops to die on the battlefields? Or are they still hung up that over two hundred years ago, our Country and soldiers made up of a bunch of back woodsmen freed itself from their tyranny? The entire picture was full of foul language, kinky sex and NO ONE really understood the meaning of the word LOVE  except, of course, our hero's character, Colin Firth. That character was perhaps the ONLY one who fell in love without sexually experiencing his heroine beforehand.<br/><br/>As usual, he was fantastic in the role, but his only three shots in the movie do not make up for all the disgusting sexual perversions and language in the rest of the movie  even by the young boy, Sam, as depicted by Thomas Sangster. And even Colin Firth and his heroine had to say the ""F"" word at least once in an unnecessary situation. This must have been a requirement to each scene because that word came out in the most needless circumstances.<br/><br/>The truly heartbreaking thing is that Colin Firth is perhaps one of the best actors to the modern-day film making industry; however, he plays in the most stupid and ugly crud and trash that is out there. No wonder he can't shake the ""Mr. Darcy"" image. That was the best thing he ever played in!"

"bob the moo","Null","7","15","18 April 2004"," Could have been so much better and is flawed in so many ways but it just about works as a sweet `date' movie but no more than that
","It's a matter of weeks until Christmas in London and despite the claims by Billy Mack's song that `Christmas is all around' really it is love that seems to be everywhere.  Some of it is flirting, some of it is infatuation, some of it is lust, some of it is loss, some of it is dedication, some of it is failing, some of it is adulterous, some of it is longing and some of it is unrequited.  In a thinly connected collection of lives, we see men and women involved in all the various types of love as the festive season approaches.<br/><br/>Despite the hype and critical fawning over this film, I didn't bother going to the cinema to see this film as love, actually, pretty much sucked at that moment in my life!  Things hadn't really changed when I got round to seeing it on DVD but I didn't feel that I could allow myself to miss the `best British film ever' for any more time.  The film starts with one of the most morally abhorrent openings I have seen in quite some time - I put it right up there with Doberman for having the opening that made me think about stopping the film a matter of seconds into the movie.  Curtis is a successful writer, but using the memory of the murdered families of 9/11 and cashing in on their dying sentiments is tasteless in the extreme and I was shocked that he had done it.  Despite this, I stuck with the film (hell - I'd paid for it!) and was glad to find that he didn't misfire this badly again.  However the film is not as good as the hype would suggest it to be although it is amusing enough to watch once and to keep you involved.<br/><br/>The film does well to just about keep control of so many different strands and special mention should probably go to the editors for keeping it together.  However, this does not meant that the plot is any good - just that it hangs together well despite the difficulties it presented.  It is not that good; the majority of the strands are underdeveloped and very superficial.  The `love' and relationships here do not engage and never really seem real - only the marriage damaged by flirting struck me as being a good shot at reality for many people.  The rest of the relationship are the ones you get in film - where it doesn't matter if they are based on physical attraction (like Jamie's cleaner), or on flirting or the thinnest of reasons because all that matters is that they are sweet and romantic for the duration of the film.  In this regard it manages to be just about amusing enough without ever really being funny and enjoyable without ever really being charming.  I doubt that, for me, it would hold up to repeat viewings though - the substance is just too lacking for that.<br/><br/>What surprised me about the film most was just how very focused the characters were in terms of relationships.  With so many different characters I was surprised that each and every relationship was a) straight and b) white.  OK - Juliet's husband was black, but he was not the romantic focus of her strand.  This is not a claim of racism or anything so stupid, I was just surprised that Curtis didn't at least try to write in an `alternative' relationship to what is admittedly the `norm'.  This didn't spoil the film for me but I would have liked to see such an ensemble piece include a spread of relationships (without just making it a token thing).<br/><br/>The cast is stellar and it is just as well as their `familiarity' helps to cover the fact that the script doesn't really help us to get to know any of the characters.  Nighy has a good time in his role and his `love' would actually have been the sweetest and most touching one of the film had it not been handled as a joke.  Firth is charming but his character is paper-thin - we see no emotion from him considering the situation at the start and his `love' is out of nothing.  Grant is OK in the most comic of the relationships but his dance is the worst scene in the film and the `anti-American' bit just seems to come out of nowhere and go nowhere. Neeson is good, but again I never felt his loss as a real thing.  Rickman and Thompson's thread is the strongest of the film and the only problem I had with them was that the film had a scene with Rickman talking about `Karl' and I couldn't stop laughing!  The remainder are mixed - Linney's relationship is interesting but not expanded on, while Freeman's stuff could easily have been lost.  Special mention from me for Sosanya - she has little to do here but she is a very good actress who still does stage work (and also happens to be gorgeous!).  The star cameos are OK - they don't add a great deal but they don't detract either - all seem to be beautiful women so I can't complain for the inclusion of Richards, Cuthbert and Schiffer. However add Wes Butters, Jo Wiley, Atkinson (pointless), Ant & Dec (funny - `Ant or Dec'!), Thornton, Parkinson and so many others and you begin to wonder why the film had to cram in so many.  To be honest with you I truly believe that this film could have been so much more touching, romantic and involving if it had lost half of these stories and just developed the remaining ones to be realer and more involving.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a very good film but it is so damn `busy' that it manages to make you miss the fact that it could have been so much better than it was.  The sheer amount of stuff going on means that very few of the relationship get beyond the superficial level of unrealistic romance, plus the fact that too few of the relationship bare any relation to reality (especially as more and more gorgeous cameos are wheeled out).  It may not be funny or charming but it does just enough so that it leaves you with a sweet feeling.  I quite liked it but found it hard to overlook these weaknesses - why it was so highly regarded by critics is quite beyond me but if you're after a typically romantic comedy that gives you a warm feeling with no sense of reality then this will probably do you."
"Superunknovvn","5","5","10","30 November 2003"," Kitsch actually
","Once a year a man has got to do what a man has got to do and take his girlfriend to the latest chick flick. This year the flick is called ""Love Actually"". I wouldn't go as far as calling it the ""My Big Lame Greek Wedding"" of 2003, but it is long, it's unbearably ""sweet"" and it's consciously unrealistic. Or is it?<br/><br/>The main problem of the movie is that it has too many episodes. It's like watching the ending of ""An Officer And Gentleman"" eight times in a row, when really one time was more than enough. Some plots are quite good, mainly those that are not so ""cute"", but either ratty or tragic. Bill Nighy is the shining light of ""Love Actually"" and Laura Linney's story is kind of moving. Keira Knightley's episode is nice, too. However, it's a thin line between funny and silly, between romantic and kitschy and the movie shamelessly covers the whole palette of these adjectives: Liam Neeson as the understanding lone father and his annoying son made me want to throw up. Hugh Grant in his typical ""charming but confused and clumsy bachelor"" role made me want to punch the screen. He couldn't convince me that he was a politician at all, he doesn't even seem to try, either. And what's with all the bubblegum critizism on Tony Blair and George W. Bush? Couldn't they at least make it a bit more subtle? That part was so sophisticated a kindergarten kid could have written it. The thing I hated the most, though, was the large amount of ""Ally McBeal""-like humour. Scenes like the one in which Hugh Grant is caught doing a funny dance. Haha, I totally didn't see that coming! And the worst part is that people in the cinema went crazy when cheap jokes like that were coming on. Drove me nuts.<br/><br/>As I said above, ""Love Actually"" had its good moments, too, but unfortunately there were far more bad ones and when I left the theatre after all those happy endings I felt like a diabetic that had too many candy bars. God, how I'm looking forward to next year's Christmas chick flick."

","Richard Curtis may well be best remembered for co-creating sitcoms such as 'The Vicar Of Dibley', 'Blackadder' and 'Mr. Bean', as well as penning sketches for 'Spitting Image' and 'Not The Nine O'Clock News', but he has also made a living out of making movies such as 'Notting Hill', 'Four Weddings & A Funeral', 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and this. Curtis' Christmas rom-com 'Love Actually' rocked the world when it first hit the cinema screens in 2003, winning numerous awards to its creator and its stars.<br/><br/>I feel I need not go into great detail about it as its synopsis has been pretty well listed on here and indeed other sites. My review mainly concerns my opinion on the performances of the cast and the quality of the writing.<br/><br/>I didn't see 'Love Actually' until a year after its release when it was repeated on a satellite movie channel. Though it did not strike me as a wonderful film, far from it, I was rather taken with the thoughtful message behind it, the message being that even in a world full of hate, war, greed, intolerance and destruction, in the words of the famous song ( which is sent-up here ), 'love is all around'.<br/><br/>Impressive in their parts are the late Alan Rickman, Martine McCuttcheon, Hugh Grant ( in what I consider to be his only decent acting role ), Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Sienna Guillroy, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Kris Marshall, Billy Bob Thornton and Heike Makatsch.<br/><br/>Not so memorable. in my personal view however, were Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Laura Linney, Rodrigo Santoro and Olivia Olson.<br/><br/>Many of the cast seem to have profited from the success of the film. Emma Thompson later landed the lead role of the kids' comedy film 'Nanny McPhee'. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher both appeared together in the 2010 assassin comedy 'Wild Target', Sienna Guillroy was awarded the role of Jill Valentine in 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' while Billy Bob Thornton gave us 'Bad Santa'.<br/><br/>'Love Actually' is sometimes hard to follow and at times but on the whole I liked it and, whilst not the biggest favourite of mine, there were some fine moments in the film which made it memorable.<br/><br/>This year, a short sequel was made for 'Comic Relief', reuniting its cast, minus Gregor Fisher, his character having been killed off, much to the dismay of many of the film's fans."

","Fortunately my wife doesn't read reviews on the IMDb site, because she loves this movie, and subjects me to it every Christmas season.<br/><br/>This movie is wonderful for all the people who can't get enough of Hugh Grant looking sparkly, complete with glinty smile right out of a Crest commercial, as a newly-minted Kennedyesque British PM, or Keira Knightley beaming and glowing for the cameras as if she were modeling for a spread in a high-end bridal magazine. In perhaps the creepiest story arc of this contrived movie, Knightley plays a newlywed who discovers that her new husband's best friend (and best man at their wedding) has an unrequited crush on her. Instead of shunning him or telling hubby (a perfectly good chap played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), she thinks the man's gestures are sweet.<br/><br/>We also get Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson as a couple whose marriage is on the rocks, Liam Neeson as a man who is struggling with the loss of his wife, the mother of his sensitive 10-year-old stepson (who just happens to be a budding drummer who idolizes Ringo Starr), Colin Furth as a novelist who falls for his sexy young Portuguese housekeeper, and (tying all the plot-lines together) Bill Nighy as a jaded middle-aged rock star who hopes to turn a Christmas-themed cover of The Troggs' 1968 hit ""Love Is All Around"" into a Yuletime pop hit, and who realizes that the deepest emotional connection he has with any human is with his corpulent, long-suffering manager (Gregor Fisher). Given the sappy soft-rock soundtrack calculated to evoke kitschy emotions in the audience, it is the height of hypocrisy and cynicism for the makers of this movie to mock the kitschy bowdlerization of The Troggs' song.<br/><br/>The whole movie is an exercise in manipulation of the most obvious and meretricious sort. The PM enacted by Grant rejects sexier women to fall, of course, for a rather heavy-set, naive, and awkward (but still highly cinegenic) young woman. The Knightley character reacts to the creep not with ""eww"" disgust and dismay but rather with sympathy, especially since he feeds her narcissistic self-image. There are happy endings appended to all the story lines in classic canned sitcom fashion, where no problem can't be resolved in 22 minutes, though this movie takes over 2 hours to reach this conclusion. If you like the smarmy self-satisfaction combined with middlebrow intellectual pretension that characterized the romantic comedies of Delia and the late Nora Ephron (I hate them), chances are you'll love this self-infatuated extravaganza.

After making myself watch about the first half hour, I realized I wasn't going to be able to stand to watch it at normal speed, so I tried fast-forwarding just to the Alan Rickman-Emma Thompson storyline segments, but the spectacle of Alan's character casually betraying Emma's with that Scandinavian gargoyle was too much for my stomach and I just ended up watching the rest of the whole thing at top speed. <br/><br/>Now I'm seeing people yelping with rage over Garry Marshall's newest installment in his Love Actually-clone holiday-themed romcom series.

","I watched this movie for the first time recently and yes, I know the world has changed in 11 years but wow - did this really pass as something terrific then? Of course the acting giants in this film could read you the phone book and it would sound great. After reading what stories should have been cut, I agree that the guy going to the US to get laid and the stand-in porn actors' stories were not worth the paper they were written on; however, taking them out would not have saved this picture. A serious problem is the pervasive sense of the ""love (or lust) at first sight = forever"" mentality. The only female part with any depth to it at all is Emma's. Laura Linney's character quite quickly reveals herself as a terminal co who is only going to have a life once her brother dies. It's hard to not just pity her. Unfortunately all we get from Emma's character at the end is a kind of wan smile accompanying her ""I'm fine, I'm fine!"" to her husband's somewhat thoughtful ""how are you?"". The one relationship that showed some hint of possible potential is only allowed to reach the depth of a birdbath apparently. Too bad the film maker didn't take a cue from the real footage in the airport that ends the film - there suddenly we are smacked up the side of the head with every type of real relationship EXCEPT this shallow Hollywood romance stuff, and you realize, ""ahhhh, THAT's love actually!"""

","The perfect movie is not a huge, earth-swaddling epic. It is a simple thing, a small story, one that fits in a 1 1/2 to 2-hour span. ""Casablanca"" is the greatest, a perfectly polished little gem, the story of two former lovers who bump into each other again in the shadow of World War II. ""The problems of two people doesn't matter a hill of beans..."" But they make amazing movies. More is not better in movies. More is simply more.<br/><br/>In other words, to try to interweave more than a couple of stories together in one movie is idiotic.<br/><br/>Let's see. There's the new Prime Minister who gets a crush on a cute girl who works in 10 Downing Street. There's his sister and her husband, a respectable middle-aged couple with fairly typical behavior- problem kids, and a wicked secretary waiting in the wings to try and destroy it all. There is the writer whose lover jilts him with his brother, who goes to Portugal to write his next novel and becomes enchanted with his housekeeper. There's the cute couple who meet on the job--their stand-ins for a porn movie. There's the man whose wife has died recently and left him with a stepson going through his first crush. There's the aging rock star with the intoxicated leer who is looking for lasting love. There's the lovely young woman with the mentally ill brother. How many is that so far? That's not all the stories.<br/><br/>But not only do they work together in one movie, THEY WORK TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY!<br/><br/>My standing joke is somebody has to have sold his/her soul to the devil. In this case, it's writer/director Richard Curtis, who also gave us ""Mr. Bean"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", to name a few.<br/><br/>If I haven't convinced you, maybe this will: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman (as the male porn movie stand-in!), Laura Linney, and (in a support role!) Keira Knightley. <br/><br/>What more do you need?<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, see it. Prepare to fall in love with love again. All kinds of love."

","This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>There are (maybe) two scenes which made me chuckle a little, but the rest made me want to throw up. Cheezy to the point of being ridiculous, unrealistic but without any of the charm of fantastical realism. <br/><br/>To top it off, I simply cannot stand Hugh Grant. His role as prime minister is absurd. He attempts to play it as a ""cute"" and ""charming"" guy who just wants to do the right thing and can't get his mind off his maid. The speech he gave with the US president was probably the lowest point of this movie. I don't know why I continued watching after that, but it's probably only because my wife wanted to continue watching it.<br/><br/>There are a lot of really great actors in this film, but I don't understand how they accepted to star in it. They must have been paid a hefty sum.<br/><br/>If you really like cheesy feel-good movies and don't care if they're good or bad, then I guess you could watch this. But I'm sure there are other options out there which are not as bad as this garbage."
"mike-wright-1","7","3","5","20 December 2012"," Ambitious? No. Perfect? Yes.
","The film most obviously comparable to Love Actually is Paris Je T'Aime. Although LA never scales the heights of its French counterpart, it never attempts to. In doing what it sets out to, Richard Curtis's montage of love at Christmas is every bit as perfect.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that this is very much a fantasy film. There are elements which are completely unrealistic and there is definitely a need for suspension of disbelief. The film does not branch out too far from middle class London with almost all of the cast living in very trendy, modern homes. Where it really succeeds though is that each of the nine story arcs has its own charm – there are no duds. For comedy value, the strongest are those involving Hugh Grant's Prime Minister and Martin Freeman's body double. For good, old fashioned schmaltz it's hard to look past Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese maid. There's also a strong turn from Laura Linney in the film's most serious arc, as the office girl in love with her colleague for two years but with the burden of a sick brother keeping her from her own life.<br/><br/>Love Actually has quickly become a Christmas classic. One of the those films you can come into half way through and still enjoy every bit as much. It may not be overly ambitious, but it allows you to sit back with a smile on your face and relax for a while."

And some of them are truly dire.<br/><br/>Only Richard Curtis could have made this film - I imagine if anyone else wrote the same it would never pass a read. Its not really a film so much as one huge number of shorts intertwined.<br/><br/>The film begins with the same kind of voice-over that we saw in ""Notting Hill"". ""That again"" or ""them again"" is the main feeling I have with this film. It ends with the old character-in-a-race-to-catch-their-loved-one before they leave/to deliver a message - in not one but several of the stories. A tirade of swears is meant to be comedy. etc etc. Curtis uses all the old ""tricks"" we've already seen.<br/><br/>There was one story thread which I would have liked to see as the whole movie - the writer and the maid.

","The premise, which you must know by now, is the romantic trajectories of 8 couples. Even critics who praise it have remarked that the filmmakers were a tad bit rushed to find satisfactory conclusions to each couple's romantic potential. I disagree! The premise, that 'love is, actually, all around', is a delightful and uplifting tale. Following the characters through from promising beginnings, to uncertain middles, all the way to emotionally resonant ends is a legitimate and worthy enterprise.<br/><br/>There are no spoilers here, although I would say that it does not stretch the imagination too much to anticipate certain types of outcomes in a romantic comedy. All of the story lines, even those with a bit of sadness, feel true- to me, anyway. I was, at all times, able to identify with the scenes on the screen (a TV screen for me, because I had only gotten to watching 'Love Actually' recently, on DVD).<br/><br/>The cast of 'Love Actually', is, duh, an amazing constellation of superb actors. Some 'star vehicles' contain only stars, seemingly not really portraying anything meaningful, but merely being their own famous selves.

","typical conformist British comedy, love actually has no taste, or the taste of a commercial for vodafone or cisco systems... There are a lot of characters and the rhythm is high, so you can't be really bored by love actually. There is a character and a story for each type of viewer: the sexy story for the young cool guy, the ""adultere"" story for the 50 years old woman..., and some anecdotal or ridiculous stories (the prime minister and his waitress...). The movie respects some rules, those which made successful other British comedy's as Bridget Jones. If you liked Bridget, love actually is really pleasant; Some scenes even seems to be part of the sequel of Bridget. but you remain with a question: has the writer-director Richard Curtis ever been in love? his way of thinking is closer to a responsible of advertising agency than a scenarist: before talking about love, a writer could be able to show some love or tenderness for his characters; but Curtis respects sacred rules of actual British comedy: niggardliness toward characters, sociological plot, and morality hidden behind broad jokes... The film is made for TV: what could be the interest to see on a big screen this little characters, described with so much meanness, and without personality? The resemblance with commercials is frightening, more than in major part of Hollywood movies: European films can surpass American ones in putting a maximum of marketing in cinema."

They could have easily dumped the story about the cheating boss and the stand-ins and the guy who loves his his best friend's wifre...seeing as how those stories were only about 10 minutes of the movie anyway--and not very interesting.  Then they could have focused more on the one about the prime minister and also on the writer who falls for his house keeper.  Those could have been movies in their own right.

All the other women are subservient to the men who treat them as objects and they get their men. (I suppose arguably Laura Linney's character doesn't let the new man in her life control her, but actually she allows an existing man in her life do so. I appreciate her love and loyalty to family, but, once again, a woman subservient to a fault.) If you watch this movie with the artificial world view that women are merely objects for men, then it is 10 stars. Watching it with the reality that they are much more valuable than that leaves me giving it 3 stars. I cannot recommend this movie. And it saddens me that people think of this as a Christmas movie.

As it went on I kept waiting for some as-yet-to-be-revealed character to wake up from the ridiculous dream he/she is having and for something even remotely resembling plausibility to present itself. It's like a junior high school girl and a college freshman girl collaborated with a middle aged woman with borderline personality disorder and committed it to film and then had someone throw in a manipulative soundtrack. Let's start with the phone call between Emma Thompson's character, a self-important stay-at-home mother, who takes a tearful phone call from her grieving brother (Liam Neeson) ... whose wife has just died. His wife has died recently enough that the funeral hasn't even taken place yet. But Emma Thompson, in a dismissive tone, tells her brother that she has a much more pressing priority demanding her attention at the moment and says she'll get back to him when she can. Hanging up, she turns her attention to the highly important matter of her grade school child announcing to her that she has just won the role of the second lobster in her school Christmas pageant. I don't blame her husband for almost being stolen from her by his predatory secretary. And I don't feel one bit sorry for her. But then let's not forget that her OTHER brother is the new Prime Minister of Britain, Hugh Grant. Which also makes him the brother of the recently widowed Liam Neeson. But while the new Prime Minister doesn't find time to go to his deceased sister-in-law's funeral he feverishly trots after and tracks down the office step-n-fetch-it hottie at her little brother's Christmas pageant (where, of COURSE he runs into the woe-is-me Emma Thompson). They make the Prime Minister come across as akin to the Mayor of Mayberry. This is dross. A feel good movie doesn't have to be a feel sick movie. This is a treacly mess."

"brownish33","1","4","8","8 October 2010"," Ugh, another poor post-modern view at love. Old fashioned romance movies are officially dead.
","so, a friend rented this movie and since she was a chick, i decided to sit through it. I'm a guy, but secretly i do enjoy those corny love movies, or ""chick flicks"", every once in a while. however i tend to watch the ones that are shown on TCM or any old movie channel because old movies tended to have a sweetness and a kind of innocence to them. you weren't allowed to curse or show nudity or any of that. thats why i like those old fashioned romance movies. today, there is a fine line between romance movie and sex comedy. the only romance movie in recent times that i can think of that was actually good was ""a walk in the clouds"" with keanu reeves. that movie was not ponly beautiful looking, but it had an old fashioned heart and a beauty on the inside that really touched me in a good way.<br/><br/>however, films nowadays, i would even say for the past 30 or so years, romance films have been getting progressively worse. a ""romance"" film these days must include senseless scenes of sex, nudity, swearing and sometimes very crude ""humour"". love actually isn't the worst when it comes to this, but this movie actually showed promise but again fell very short of what it could have been: a nice sweet tale of romance (or romance's). the perfect example of the grossness is the naked couple who are constantly talking while doing some kind of strange nude scenes. personally, i found these parts of the movie pretty distasteful for a ""romantic"" movie. was it supposed to be funny? it was just weird, and odd. but they talk like they just met and they act all nervous and shy while doing these random sex acts? am i supposed to laugh at the paradox? wasn't funny to me, it actually was pretty sick. things like this in movies show just how uninhibited society has become where people can just get naked in front of you and act like its nothing (not saying everyone does but you get my point). pretty disturbing stuff. remember a time when women were so afraid to even show there knees or ankles? boy had the apple fallen far from the tree where you live in a society where prostituting ones self is perfectly normal and acceptable. very sad.<br/><br/>the rest of the relationships offer nothing much that we haven't already seen elsewhere. i also didn't like the amount of swearing in it. it just came off as awkward and unneeded, especially since the film takes place around Christmastime. it could have been sweet. it could have been nice. but what it is is a post-modern strange look at love. the only story lines that were actually not too bad and kinda sweet was the writer falling in love with the house cleaner and the office woman who sacrifices love for her mentally ill brother. i have one question though: was is REALLY necessary for the house cleaner girl to take off all her clothes (in a very slow manner) just to jump in the lake? if she was in such a hurry to get the notes why would you feel the need to take off all your clothes? especially right in front of your employer? there were also some pretty random and pointless scenes of alan rickmans secretary taking off her clothes or walking around in lingeria. just, pointless stuff like this...i don't get it. and this movie is filled with them.<br/><br/>there is one very funny moment with Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean who appears at the jewelry counter. but really, the film could have been so much better. i didn't even like the environments, besides the writers house, all the houses/buildings looked so sterile and white and soulless. i also found liam neesons son's behavior to be so unrealistic. no 7 year old acts like that, or talks like that. and neeson talks to his very young son like hes teenager, mentioning things like ""haveing sex"" and even saying ""who is she, or HE.."" i was like, what? why would you automatically assume your son is gay? just weird. i heard about this film 7 years ago but i could tell what kind of movie it was going to be. lo and behold, i was correct. now i know why i hadn't been in any rush to see it. same with king Kong. heard about, it was popular, but deep down i knew it would suck. and i was right. anyway, sad to see liam neeson in such rubbish, but hey every actor needs work right? cant always be in those deep human drama's or action blockbusters like schindlers list or star wars, unfortunately. but he is still good even in this cold turkey of a ""love"" movie. the days where you could go to a romance movie with a date or family are gone, as by ""romance"" they now mean ""must be 18 years or older to attend this R rated sexual movie"". very very sad. now i know why i don't go to the movies anymore, not only is there a lack of good action adventure films, but also decent romantic films. i think i'll just stick with watching TCM for my romance fix."

","Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England.  However, having said that, I can't say I didn't have a bad time during Love Actually, and I didn't feel compelled to walk out or leave to go to the bathroom for a long stretch of time either.  What works about the movie are two things- the characters Curtis sets up and unfolds, to one degree or another in this definitely movie-movie universe, are believable, and surprisingly there is some interestingly dramatic elements thrown in here and there (particularly with Laura Linney, Liam Neeson- early on, and Emma Thompson).  The other thing is the cast, which includes the known likes of Linney, Neeson, Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and some charming work thrown in by lessor known actors like Kiera Knightly (who got a break during the summer with Curse of the Black Pearl), Martine McCutcheon, Lucia Moniz, Rodrigo Santoro, Thomas Sangster as the boy in love, and nice little cameos for Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Shannon Elizabeth, etc.  <br/><br/>The drawback to some of the performances and stories is that since the story jumps from one place to another, and since we can predict more or less where each character's destiny lies on Christmas Eve, there is maybe a little too much emphasis on the paths instead of a little more depth (outside of the dramatic input of course).  Plus, you can tell the film was not the kind of film released first in America and sold later to Europe.  Yet, like I said, the flaws may be moot to most movie-goers, because Curtis is just out to get the audience into having a good, escapist experience with these people, and the main and supporting players do what they can.  Also, as some other reviewers and commentators have noted, the show stopper is indeed Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, the aging, cynical rock star recording and selling a Christmas single on TV and Radio as the sort of background in the film. Along with being the funniest character of the lot, he ends up garnering some heartedness too by the climax.

It seems to me that love is everywhere.' <br/><br/>With this monologue by the British Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant), that wouldn't have been misplaced in The Great Dictator (I mean that as about the highest honour I can give), Love Actually begins. It's the story of about a dozen people (all somehow linked to each other), who are in relationships of some sort.

Then there are two 'actors' who hit it off, but that's not really that interesting neither, nor is the romance between a woman (Laura Linney) and a co-worker, with a mentally ill brother standing in the way of things.<br/><br/>Other stories work better, with the Prime Minister falling for a servant of his, and a widowed step-dad (Liam Neeson) explaining his 'new' son how to act towards the most popular girl in school.<br/><br/>The two really interesting stories that remain are that of cheating husband Harry, and how his wife is dealing with that and the romance between writer Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese cleaning lady.

The love-stories were too simple, too flat and one-dimensional. Also, the 'red line' between things (no. 1 hit by 'Billy Mack') turned a bit boring near the end. Too bad as I really wanted to love this movie for it's bright and upbeat message.<br/><br/>Final score: 5/10."

","There seemed to be a real theme going on in this film...that one has to be thin to be loved. I noticed 4 examples here:<br/><br/>1) Martine McCutcheon being referred to as chubby on several occasions even though she isn't. 2) The Portuguese housekeeper telling Colin Firth that she doesn't want to end up like her fat sister 3) Alan Rickman taking a fancy to a very slim Heike Makatsch (Mia) instead of his larger wife 4) Keira Knightley (the girl who gets married) was also very slim<br/><br/>I'm just not sure about the relevance of the chubby comments? Still, it didn't put me off eating my ice-cream during the movie. It's also strange that the same director gave us Bridget Jones's Diary, which actually made women feel good about not being a size 0 and they can still get the man."

","Honestly, I don't understand the applause on this movie. It was fine. Maybe I was disappointed because of its amazing critic and user reviews. I expected to be blown away but it was a basic rom-com, only there were 4 or 5 stories going on at once that ended up loosely intertwined and it was over 3 dang hours long. It was actually quite unfortunate because there were only two of the several stories that I was actually interested in. It felt like quite a mess, actually.<br/><br/>It wasn't awful. I suppose, if you have time on your hands, it's worth taking a look to make your own decision. But I don't understand the hype at all. It was a solid hour and a half too long and had waaaaay too much going on."
"harinjani","3","2","3","6 January 2020"," One-Time Watch for People Not About Plots
","A decent movie, with no huge ups and down. The movie basically explores different facets of falling into love or being in love with someone. If you are looking to watch something of consequence, then watch Interstellar which has a similar take-home message of ""Love transcends all"", but a solid plot, beautiful screenplay and an engaging adventure. This is probably an intertwined story which observes the relationship dynamics or love interests of a group of friends.<br/><br/>I, wished to watch the film, because of the enchanting starcast with prolific veterans like Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman and Keira Knightley. But, I would say, the huge starcast actually backfired because the portrayal was not able to create the depth necessary to engage oneself to the grassroot levels as the screentime got divided. There was no profound music which I believe is an important aspect in engaging all your senses.<br/><br/>For me, something which was fun and really amazing to watch were the relations concerning Liam Neeson and his son. There portrayal was pretty decent and it did pull some strings. Nonetheless, I am also a huge fan of Rowan Atkinson and albeit, just for a few minutes, his excerpt was also engaging for me.<br/><br/>For fellow Anime Watchers, if you have tried Tsurezure Children, this is quite similar to that just that this is not about teenagers. But, the depiction in the Anime mentioned, is again much more engaging."

"hellraiser7","10","2","3","13 December 2019"," Love Everywhere
","Driver Stu from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" once said, ""When love comes, you better pull over to the side of the road and open your doors, cause nothing in this life matters more."" The strange and funny thing about love is how it can just happen when we least expect it to, when we feel very little to no control over our lives, when it seems at almost the most inconvenient time it just simply happens. Just like the seasons of nature it is an element vitally needed so not just can the world be nurtured to continue to grow and thrive but our own spirits.<br/><br/>This film is one of my favorite romance films but also an honorable mention in favorite Christmas movies. The film is sort of an anthology by its nature as the stories are focused on multiple individuals whom all somewhat are in the same place and sometimes connect and intersect with each other, but the theme is the same which is about love.<br/><br/>To me this is one of those romance films done right for one thing each of the stories like in any anthology are short which means there's no filler and sub plot nonsense which is what plagues a lot of bad rom coms and make them forget what movie they are.<br/><br/>Most importantly though they each keep their eye on the ball, each of the stories knows who they are and what they want to say and be which is part of why the stories and characters in them to this day are endearing and timeless. Ok, not everyone of them one or two I can leave out but like with all anthologies it's all a matter of your preference.<br/><br/>The cast consists of an all star cast which most of the time isn't always a good mix as it's been known when most films which consist of all-star casts don't always equal good movies. But fortunately, this film is one of those case where it does, personally I feel an all-star cast film can work where you use each of them right and well but also have a good story.<br/><br/>Though believe or not, this film didn't consist of an all star cast as only half of them were major leaguers and most others we're either unknowns or minor league players, this film was sort of a launch point for them. It makes watching the film even more interesting seeing a face or two getting their start, and anyone that has seen it before at the time thinking who knew.<br/><br/>I'll just say a few of the stories I really like as there are a lot of them.<br/><br/>Jamie and Aurelia: Colin Firth is just great as Jamie, I like how in the film he sort of looks like Richard Castle, ok not really but from his haircut and the way he's dressed, even a little of his character is a bit similar to that character.
Here he's a guy a bit on the introverted side, he's a little down on his luck as he has writers block or on a losing streak as he's had one bad book after another.<br/><br/>It's also funny how his a bit of a slob as his desk are always in disarray as we see papers are dis or unorganized but also a bit of a caffeine addict as he has a series of coffee mugs pileing up his desk, this sort of reflects his whole life and even love life is in total disarray.<br/><br/>But of course, his luck is just about to change when Aurelia comes into his life. She is played by a lovely actress, Lucia Moniz whom hasn't really done any other movies outside of her region afterward. Anyway, I really like the chemistry between the two is just beautiful as both are from two different worlds.<br/><br/>The relationship is somewhat ironic as his profession part of what it's about is communicating with everyone around you by putting your ideas out there. We see that Aurelia really is good for him from not just making his house more livable but helping him become more assertive, do what he must do.<br/><br/>One interesting moment is when he visits his family which I'll admit was something that came completely out of the blue. This scene works well in two ways, I really liked that look on his face which is exactly what we're all thinking, and it says, ""Wait a minute what am I doing here."" He realizes he's not where he should be that his place is with Aurelia. But also, it was sort of the broken fourth wall joke as that look is someone that suddenly walked into the wrong Christmas movie, like a scene that was just inserted at the last minute which was the point and joke. What he does at the last minutes are beautiful, I won't say anything else about this except it show both truly are on the same page.<br/><br/>Mark and Juliet: This is another which is a small one, which involves Juliet and Mark played well by one of my favorite actress Kira Knightly and Andrew Lincoln whom weren't stars at the time. This one is simply about unrequited love; we see in one scene where Mark inadvertently fudges up a wedding video for Juliet and her husband Peter played by Chiwetel Ejiofor before he was a star.<br/><br/>We see Mark is a guy that has always harbored feelings for Juliet but never said anything as he was too afraid to. Which is understandable for some people it's really doesn't come easy and it's not so much fear of being shot down but being misunderstood. Or even simply the fact in life you let certain things get in your way which is an easy thing for all of us to do because hey life happens and dilemmas don't solve themselves; but also, simply not believing in oneself enough. It can also be a painful dilemma and cross to harbor as it leaves people wondering what could have happened if they did make a move.<br/><br/>Though we know it might not have made much difference as Juliet doesn't feel the same way about him as she'll always see him as a friend which is also understandable too because that's also part of life as one doesn't always feel the same way or anything more about the other, it's just simply not in the cards.<br/><br/>But the final minutes of the story result in a timeless scene which has been parodied a lot over the years. But this scene was obviously an homage to ""A Hard Day's Night"" which of course is the cue card scene. It's just really sweet because he never says a word and he doesn't need to because in each of the cards he presents he is expressing his feelings for her but also shows how he's begun to become more assertive and find love of his own. This also goes with another quote from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" which is ""If love is true, really true it doesn't need an answer.""<br/><br/>Prime Minister and Natalie: This one of course involves Hugh Grant whom at the time was somewhat the king of romance movies. Here he plays a prime minister of the UK, it's that simple story of the man that has everything except love. And there is his secretary Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon whom I think is cute and hot, it's too bad this actress didn't have a little more afterward as she's a capable one.<br/><br/>The interplay between both Prime Minister and Natalie is just sweet as we see both are struggling to maintain a professional relationship, but we see that cracks are forming. Both already know what they feel for one another but have not just been unassertive about those feelings but have never felt or made time for them, as we see both are too busy maintaining and living a lifestyle but not a life, hence the fact Prime Minister's real name isn't known because he has no life outside of office. This makes both sympathetic as we see it's can be a very lonely and two-dimensional existence, sure you have success but as they say what good is it without happiness, to me that can be a waste of life too.<br/><br/>I really like it when we see the Prime Minister finally being assertive or has been given the push to it when a high ranking political member sexually harasses Natalie and the Prime Minister in a speech defends her which shows he not just shows the strength of his integrity but also how strong his feelings for Natalie really are. When the payoff happens it's just sweet because it shows how the one you love is closer than you think but also putting your feelings out there for the other isn't as hard as it seems.<br/><br/>Love can happen everywhere to anyone, throughout the holidays.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","This romantic comedy-drama film is set in November and December, mostly in London.

One involves a poor simpleton who can't get laid. He goes to Wisconsin, where hot girls throw themselves at him.

"irish23","7","2","3","27 July 2008"," Wild ride of emotions & situations
","How I view this film depends on what mood I'm in when I watch it. The first time I viewed it on DVD was during an extremely lonely holiday break, and I was devastated and drowning in Kleenex before the opening credits were finished. My most recent viewing found my reactions sliding all over the scale as the various story lines unfolded.<br/><br/>Each storyline is a different type of romantic genre -- everything from ""Beavis and Butthead"" humor to painfully exquisite, understated drama (perfected by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman). <br/><br/>One of the strengths of this approach is that, if you don't like one style, another will be coming along presently. This is also a weakness.<br/><br/>Each vignette has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of the threads are strong. All the characters, no matter how outrageous, are likable. Weaving the stories together takes a very deft touch, and this is where the director missteps most often, with forced transitions that are jolting and confusing. <br/><br/>For instance, the story opens with a tight focus on a black man; I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many people of color on screen. But it's not until the end of the picture that the character reappears (after a wild ride of story lines and emotions), and the shocking realization that we've been watching white people almost exclusively for the rest of the picture intrudes on the storyline. The opening and ending shots of Heathrow are extremely compelling because they show love manifesting in *people* -- not just trim, glamorous, white 30-40-somethings. It would've been nice to see that theme carried through the film with more diverse casting. Not just to make a more universal story, but to help ease the plot challenge of interweaving the many characters and story lines.<br/><br/>As others have commented, the nudity in the picture was often a hindrance. While it did work to contrast our notions of ""sordid porn"" with the downright ""aw, shucks"" innocence of the characters playing it, the clash of vulgarity and innocence was often too powerful to be anything but distracting and sometimes offensive. It was certainly gratuitous.<br/><br/>This is not standard ""let's shut off our brains Sunday evening and just veg out to a brainless romantic comedy"" fare. If you've just gone through a break-up, don't watch it. But if you want to contemplate the many manifestations of love, or just have a technical exercise in different forms of romantic genres, enjoy an evening with this."
"leekaiyuen2003","1","2","3","16 April 2008"," Superficial,

Most of the time I found rating in IMDb very reliable, and this one is a rare exception, this film may deserve a 5 or 6, but I really wish to do something to make the rating more ""accurate"". <br/><br/>You have not missed anything if you decide not to see it."

They talk too much and not much acting. Their jokes are so light, a slight grin would be a possibility but not a laugh out loud. This movie is not a 'must-see', but it's a classic ""cult"".

","When I first saw this film I was distinctly unimpressed. I found the number of different story lines made it difficult to relate to any of the characters or to really care about any of their problems. However, recently I gave this film a second chance and I was glad I did.<br/><br/>The film essentially contains eight different romantic comedies. The positive side of this is that there should be something for everyone. If you don't enjoy one story the film will skip to another one in no time.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable storyline for me was also the most unbelievable one in the whole film. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister and his love interest the sweet and fluffy South London maid Martine McCutcheon make an odd couple but if you suspend your disbelief they make a charming pair.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film yet you may or may not warm to it.

","we pulled out all over top guns and then some and yet this fluff is all we could come up with. Like anybody would every believe a person like Kiera Knightley would marry a Black man. Portraying graphic sex in what should have been a family holiday movie? How classy! And those anti-American statements were just too tacky. While I don't know how true it is that an average American girl would have sex with the ugliest of Brits just because of his accent, I just found the Bill Bob Thorton president scene to be a bit much. Yeah, so Americans have stereotyped Brits for years as the villains in their films. That's not actually a stereotype y'know? You do the math. Anways, let's talk about the film if you care for my review. That stuck up Hugh Grant narrates how after 9/11 (yeah they're that tacky to use 9/11 to gain sentiments) people seem to understand that Love actually is all around us. Then the film proceeds to show all sorts of British relationships and how they all have their ups and downs. And they throw in a few Americans in negative roles just for affirmative action I guess. Who knows. The film stars Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Rory MacGregor, Colin Firth, Sienna Guillory, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Lulu Popplewell, Kris Marshall, Heike Makatsch, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Bill Bob Thorton, and Laura Linney just to mention a few. A few wise Brits like Rachel Weisz and Catherine Zeta Jones wisely avoided this canker-worm of a film like a bad rash. They couldn't get Kate Winslet (that wise darling) to come her waste her two cents in it, so they stole a scene from Titanic and put it in the film. Yes, they are that tacky! I could sit here and list everything that's wrong with this pretentious overblown, over praised and overzealous film but y'know what? I'll rather go punch a wall."

I mean, really, just how long would it take you to drop dead from alcohol poisoning after playing the ""Drink Whenever a Comment is Made About a Woman's Weight"" game? 10 minutes? I also thought that the (insert cute animal) known as the ""older man, much younger woman"" romance was officially beaten, buried, and reincarnated into an entirely different thing (I think it became a teapot, but I need to check on that)? I also enjoyed how practically all the female characters tore each other down - the character's comment about her ""fat"" and ""ugly"" sister is but one example. Whee! Self-loathing is neat! <br/><br/>Please. I don't expect romance movies to be oh-my-gosh!-gushy and fake self-actualizing. However, when a movie purports to be about romance but uses such negative depictions of women to portray ""romance,"" I'm disappointed and more than a bit irritated.<br/><br/>If you want a good romantic movie that won't make you totally vomit due to either ""drinking game"" alcohol poisoning or, conversely, saccharine overload, try ""Amelie"", ""Chocolat,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" or (a bit on the groovy-weird side) ""Harold and Maude.""<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype.

If anything, they stayed together because they loved their children, nothing more.<br/><br/>Yeah, I think it could have done without the pair of porn movie stand-ins. And while I thought the guy going to Wisconsin (yeah!) to find women was humorous, the movie could have done fine without it.<br/><br/>While I don't expect everyone to be as enamored with the movie as me, I simply cannot comprehend the loathsome responses I've read here.

"filmbuff20","Null","8","21","7 January 2004"," How Richard could have made a Bucketful...
","This film was 2 hours and 9 minutes long. There were eight (count 'em!) different love stories to follow. In some films, there are four stories to follow, and they all come together rather neatly packaged in the end. See Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Go etc. In a romantic comedy, more than one love story can be an interesting idea, if pulled off correctly. Otherwise it can just be vomit-inducing fluff. There were some great ideas here, great comic set pieces, an underused Rowan Atkinson and a helluvalotta stars from British TV (Teachers, anyone?) and film. The theme of the film is, of course, love is all around. I myself certainly felt like every female I saw after the film was a potential mate. This film will do that to you.<br/><br/>It's a good idea, in the long run, but, as a writer, this is what I would have done: With a Niagara Falls sized stream of ideas flowing out of my head, such as these, I would have made 3, 4 or 5 different films out of this. Curtis could have easily done that and made a packet load out of it. Of course it defeats the idea of mass story lines and mass stars, but for a directorial debut, Curtis seems too eager to please. And why? After Notting Hill, Four Weddings, penning Bridget Jones 1 (and 2!) this would have been a sure thing for him however he played it.<br/><br/>Each story strand is a work of well-crafted fiction, each character more or less three dimensional, even though a few story strands have split ends (in layman's terms, they don't work and they don't end.)<br/><br/>One major problem is that he doesn't stick with certain story lines long enough for them to develop, and some just develop too quickly and are quickly thrown away. Oh well. Still a good film, but I would feel more comfortable watching it on DVD in instalments rather than sitting through 2 hours and 9 minutes of waiting for this to end. So all in all, a good first effort, if a little cheesy. One more thing though; the sombre sad part of a romantic comedy comes in around about the mid to last quarter of the film, where the two leads argue about something or other, making the final payoff a more desperate sight for the viewer. However, with eight couples going through angst, a rather sombre mid section drags into a soggy, bittersweet tear-fest and doesn't churn out many laughs. A shame, but worth watching for the sheer spectacle of the ensemble cast."
"cucumbermoon","6","1","1","28 November 2005"," ""Here's an important message from your uncle Bill.""
","I've read several comments on this movie, and each and every time I have been shocked to find one thing missing from otherwise comprehensive reviews: the pure genius that is Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>As far as romantic comedies go, I'm a tepid supporter; I watch them at parties with the girls, and generally enjoy them, but I never think of them once they're over. This one was different, however, because of the lightning performance by Bill Nighy. His portrayal of Billy Mack, the has-been rock star and ex-heroin addict ""struggling to make a comeback at any price"" is, for lack of a better word, priceless. His character is deeply developed, beautifully intricate, and sorrowfully realistic, not to mention hilarious. I found myself coasting from scene to scene, waiting with baited breath for more appearances of the quirky rocker. His obvious loneliness and attempted cover-ups were touching, and his epiphany at the end was gorgeous.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time Bill Nighy has saved a movie. He did it before in Underworld, and he's done it again here.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy is undeniably one of the greatest actors I've ever seen. I've never known anyone else to be so completely unrecognizable from film to film, not because he actually looks different (in fact, he almost always looks exactly the same) but because he melds with his characters so perfectly, he makes each one breathe with its own life.<br/><br/>If you're not all in to the romantic comedy scene, but want to see an awesome performance by an amazing actor, do what I did: watch all the Billy Mack scenes, and skip the rest.<br/><br/>~Cucumbermoon<br/><br/>P.S. Incidentally, Billy Mack has one of the funniest lines I've heard in a long, long time: ""Hi Kids. Here's an important message from your uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs."" Pause.

","Perhaps the most divisive romcom of all time, this movie doesn't even accept its own premises. In fact it mocks anyone who buys into them. Some plot lines seem to try to promote the selfless, sacrificial nature of love but leave the viewer concluding that those types of relationships are completely devoid of romance, magic, and fun, and the real magical, romantic relationships are all purile, selfish, and ego-driven. The worst offenders in the #MeToo era all probably loved this film."

They were all deeply touched by it and one even shed tears at the end because he was just so happy that so many people had had their lives enriched by that strange emotion called love. (Bless...) 'Love Actually' isn't just yet another romantic comedy which is along the same lines as all the others: two people meet, one is already taken or shortly will be, the other goes through severe emotional turmoil and they finally realise they're made for each other. (Although I must admit, I still love them...) Many different people, all connected in some way either through family or friends, are making their way through life as you do when along it comes: love. It smacks some in the face, it sneaks along beside others, slowly creeping out until it's fully emerged.<br/><br/>I challenge you to name an actor or actress who did not pleasantly surprise us all by delivering a stunning performance in this movie.

I was so ashamed to have my uncle and aunt exposed to such foul language and explicit nudity for no apparent reason, and ONLY 5 miserable minutes into the movie!<br/><br/>Anyway, I forgot all about this movie and went on with my life, until a few weeks ago I was again confronted with it and this time being by myself I decided to give it a go, considering the number of big stars in it, it couldn't be that bad, right? <br/><br/>WRONG! It was that bad! I am glad now that I didn't waste more time of our Christmas eve with such piece of garbage. I can't understand how so many dedicated and serious movie stars would put their names up for such trash. Love Actually has very little to do with love but an awful lot to do with lust, but again, for today's standards there's very little difference between these two.<br/><br/>The plot, if you can call it that, is a mess, it makes no sense. The continuity is non existing and many characters simply vanish. I can only assume they did not know how to end their part in the story and it finishes unresolved. For others, it's simply too stupid, like the Collin Firth character, that after having his heart broken, falls in love with his Portuguese house maid who can't speak English, therefore, they can't even talk about the simplest of subjects. <br/><br/>It goes from bad to worse, from unhappy and cheated house wives to foul mouth and ""has been"" rock stars and young and defiant prime-ministers.<br/><br/>Whatever, this was a complete waste of my precious time, and truly disappointing to see how so many people could get so excited about so bad a movie, I suppose it shows that the bar is really low now and any piece of trash is appreciated. what a pity!"

","Incredibly uneven movie! I really like good romantic comedies. Four Weddings was brilliant, but Curtis seems to need a kill -your-darlings assistant badly these days. About the characters and the stories, I have these comments: It's nice that there is love between races, social classes and nationalities in this film but why 1. are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. Rickman's secretary is the obvious case. Very old-fashioned view of the sexes. 2. Why are there no gay couples? Curtis has used minority groups (also disabled people) in romantic situations before in his films, and to their advantage, so it's a pity he didn't this time when there are so many couples present. 3. Speaking of that, why so many couples? Four would have been sufficient. We don't get to know any of them well enough as it is. About the principal roles: Billy Mack - fun character who interpunctuates the film, and it's nice that Curtis dares satirize himself with the song chosen. Sarah - Laura Linney is a great actress and very touching, but this is a situation that obviously needed more screen time. Harry and Karen - Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are great actors, but Thompson is so good she belongs in another film. Her outburst ""you have made my life ridiculous"" rings so true and is so painful it's weird to see it followed by a lot of haphazard happy conclusions. I want another movie, just about Karen and her world. Hugh Grant's part is fun as usual, he is turning into a modern Cary Grant in the sense that he does one thing to perfection and if you like that he will always deliver. If you don't, it's best to stay away. His love story is sweet, not very credible at all but OK in a romantic comedy sort of way.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is good as always as the widower but the boy who plays his son has stuffy lines and delivers them like an American TV sitcom kid - you know, robot actor kid style with ""timing"". The situation about him learning to play the drums to impress a girl is credible but he is not. Colin Firth's writer falling in love with the Portugese cleaning girl is not a very developed character, so Curtis depends entirely on the fact that Firth, like Grant, works so well in romantic scenes. The scene where he meets her family and is offered the supposedly fat and homely daughter is insulting to her and to the Portugese. ""The rest of Europe"" is here seen as ""charmingly"" old-fashioned (which oddly enough the film itself is, most irritably). Keira Knightley's character has never realized that her husband's best friend (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with her. I can believe that as she is not perceptive at all about other people in the film, just full of herself, what she wants and how she looks. That story goes to prove that displeasant people can also make others fall madly in love, depressing but at least credible. Lincoln is sweet in the part, he makes the segment work although you root for him to quickly find a worthier object of his affections. Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton are good but a bit under-used, but in this film, who isn't. The story about the British guy getting hot US girls is below anyone's dignity. What the ??? was that all about? The story of the porn actors behaving like blushing teenagers even during faked sex is totally strange and forced. Why wold these obviously painfully shy and easily embarrassed people have picked that sort of job at all?"

","*SPOILER* At the end of this 2 hour car crash my wife and I were left mute in sheer psychic horror. I couldn't believe that life in the outside world carried on after such a blight on not only film, but humanity itself. My wife had wanted to turn the film off at about the 60 minute mark but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was transfixed, I was being carried away on this cynical, witless, loveless juggernaut and I had to witness where it would finally stop. Some things should never be seen... I honestly respect other people's opinions but I am staggered by the amount of positive reviews for this film, this film is just.. just vile. What upset me? Everything, but here's some highlights..<br/><br/>The bit where the young chap goes to America. So he instantly meets three gorgeous women in a bar, and they start saying he should sleep with them but they only have one bed and no pyjamas, and they have a sexy friend coming over... I'm thinking what will be the clumsy joke here, they're prostitutes? The friend will turn out to be a transvestite? The English chap won't ""rise"" to the occasion? NO, none of these things. The genius of the writing means that THERE IS NO JOKE, the chap goes off and has sex with 4 girls and comes home with one of them. GENIUS. It's like he said all along, American girls can't resist an English accent. OH WONDERFUL. If I was an American woman I'd really enjoy this playful mockery of me, no, I really would.<br/><br/>The swearing. I am no prude, I swear with the best of them, I combine vile words to make new, impossibly rude phrases. But I don't swear in front of children, like the Liam Neeson character does, apparently for comic effect. And the endless amusement we are meant to enjoy every time someone with an upper class accent says f*ck or bugger. After ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" I was anticipating the first ""posh people swearing"" moment in this film, and at about the 2 minute mark Bill Nighy does it. Excellent!!! Now I could sit back and enjoy the hilarious set-ups that would allow all the other actors to take their turn saying the word ""bugger"" amusingly.<br/><br/>That run in with the US President... part of my soul actually died. And the list of all things wonderfully British that the PM gives, ""The Beatles, Harry Potter, David Beckham..."" Was this a joke at the expense of Tony Blair's ""Cool Britania""? I only retain my sanity by telling myself that this is so, as any other alternative is too uncomfortable to live with.<br/><br/>When that child leapfrogs through airport security... in a film that's started with a monologue referencing 9/11 (I'm not going there, oh nooooo....) .....is beyond... words. Good job he was white with blond hair or there could really have been some ""hilarious consequences"". <br/><br/>The most telling bit, for me, is near the beginning when the Bill Nighy character says ""This is sh*t"" (or words to that effect) and his manager replies ""Solid gold sh*t"". I think the makers of this nightmare know exactly that this film is ""solid gold sh*t"" with its fantastic cast and dire, unfunny, and at times offensive (sizeist, sexist, racist) script, and they gleefully rub it in your face. This is the most cynical film I have ever seen. It's a series of 20 minute adverts for unfunny sitcoms chopped up and mixed together in the hope that if you throw enough some of it might stick. I don't just want my money back, I demand the two hours of my life I threw away watching this insulting rubbish."

Let me tell you, compared to this piece of garbage, those are Shakespeare.<br/><br/>So I rented it, thinking it would be a piece of harmless candy for a Friday night. Wrong. Though my expectations were low, they were, in the end, way too high.<br/><br/>What you've got is an assortment of half-baked story lines so crowded together the director hopes you don't notice how utterly shallow and pointless they are. I didn't give a rat's arse about a single character, including the little boy, because they were all identical.<br/><br/>The worse ""couple"", hands down, was the two porn people. This was just such a mindless excuse to throw in some nudity. They were actually edited out for three-quarters of the movie, until somebody remembered them and brought them back for the big airport finale. Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas.<br/><br/>The second worst was the Prime Minister and the secretary. Right. The Prime Minister knocking on doors in a working class neighbourhood looking for a date. Puh-leese.<br/><br/>And then there's the woman who can't spend even one night with a guy because she has a handicapped brother. That is such a load. And if the jerk really wanted a relationship with her he'd learn to accept her brother as part of the package. What an insult to the mentally handicapped.<br/><br/>I can't be bothered to go through the rest of them. <br/><br/>By the way, scenes with happy natives clapping in slow motion while the music builds to a crescendo and Whitey stands there like the conquering hero to rescue the dusky maiden from a life of working as a domestic for the likes of him SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. God, no more. How do all those idiots in her village know that he isn't a bigamist or a criminal?<br/><br/>The one tiny bright spot was the washed up old rocker who seemed to be laughing at everyone around him while he collected his paycheck. <br/><br/>Anyway, the ultimate message seems to be that if you've fixed your sights on someone, no matter for how short a time, you should do psychotic things in the so-called name of love, and you'll get your way. Don't worry about getting to know the person, just cut to the cheering public declaration of love. <br/><br/>Oh, yeah, in this post 9/11 era, that kid was lucky he wasn't shot running through airport security. Or maybe his blondness saved him.<br/><br/>Rating: zero on ten."

It's an all star cast of recognizable faces and much loved stars, but more than that it's filled with stories that will make you laugh, cry, and long to see that happy ending we all crave. I don't want to give away anything if you've not seen this film before, so I'll just say this; give this film a chance to enchant you and make you smile-but keep a tissue box handy!!

"jwiley-86292","3","3","7","23 July 2016"," Huh?
","This movie feels like it should be better than it is. The production values and soundtrack are pretty, but I kept asking myself why it was lingering on stories that seemed either inconsequential or off-putting. In the first place, there's Colin Firth's character trying to build a relationship despite a serious language barrier (lots of room for abuse,) but the subplot that most repulsed me was the one involving the guys going to America to meet women. They find a number of hot women in a bar who instantly want to have sex. I'm NOT exaggerating! You might call me shallow for complaining about the men in this situation being unmatched in terms of attractiveness with the women, but hear me out. This would be all well and good if the ugly male/hot female pairing weren't so inescapable in pop culture while you're hard pressed to find the reverse. Mostly, when someone uses this trope, they are exploiting the double standard by which men judge women's worth based only on their appearances. Maybe I need to get out more, but I can't imagine any woman acting like the American women in the bar do when they meet those guys. As a woman myself, I should know.<br/><br/>What about the rest of the movie? For whatever reason--I don't know whether it's the fault of the movie or me--I wasn't emotionally invested in most of the characters. I feel that the different story lines are too disparate to coexist within the same movie. Here is another part I couldn't accept: Sam's crush on Joanna is treated as SPESHUL, but we don't find out what Joanna thinks of him! He acts kind of like a stalker in the airport scene. <br/><br/>The random nudity is not only unnecessary, but disturbing, contributing to my suspicion of the movie being exploitative in the wrong ways. Not even the subplot with Alan Rickman's character made me want to watch it ever again; you feel guilty if you identify with Mia (the woman pursuing him) rather than Emma Thompson's character. In this case, the large number of dynamic screen presences is no match for the baffling, ho-hum writing."

","While watching Love Actually, I was struck how closely the formula followed the formula of the ABC network's Love Boat series. Over a restricted space of time, you cut between several stories of love in different phases, allotting each story about 15 minutes apiece. Unfortunately, the writing for this movie is about on a par with the writing for the Love Boat: It relies on clichÃ©s, cheesy dialog and a good helping of Deus Ex Machina to insure a happy ending for one and all. In the IMDb trivia entry, it is noted that some of the dialog was taken from unused scenes from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", which falls nicely in line with the Love Boat's habit of recycling plots over its lengthy run.<br/><br/>To give credit to Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, they threw themselves into this movie and probably gave it more effort than the material deserved. I found myself not being as involved with the characters as I did feeling sorry for the actors.<br/><br/>Still, if The Love Boat is your cup of tea - by all means, pick this up in the video store. You may miss Julie, Gopher and the rest of the gang, and London sure isn't Cabo San Lucas, but you will find the story lines familiarly comforting and Ted McGinley (Your Ship's Photographer) is nowhere to be seen."

With such a great ensemble cast it was always going to be good. There are too many stories on the go plot-wise and a trimming of the length of the movie  would have made it better. It is interesting to note that on the DVD version there are loads of deleted scenes and Richard Curtis says in their introduction that the movie was considerably longer and he had a problem reducing the length to the eventual running time.So there!Love Actually is a good romantic comedy peppered with swear words and some crudity but is nice for  all that.

","I seldom write a poor review of a movie, but I had to comment on this one. I really felt cheated by the writer and director of this film, Richard Curtis, who previously has done such intelligent and splendid work.  This was just ridiculous...and cheap!!  First, the storyline of the Hugh Grant piece was a clear rip off of the American President, a film that was so charmingly and intelligently written and casted several years ago. The plot was just dumbed down and changed to an English prime minister and his tea lady.  I was appalled by the casting of Billy Bob as the American President.<br/><br/>The storyline involving the little boy who lost his mother and is in love with a girl at school was downright creepy.  No sense at all that the boy had lost his mother... and the Claudia Schiffer look a like at the end...pleeeeeease!!  Or maybe it was the real Claudia. I wasn't interested enough to stick around for the credits.<br/><br/>Another creepy storyline...the best man who videotapes his friend's wedding obviously obsessed with the groom's wife. Some best friend. If this is love than the writer has a very disturbed view about what love actually is. I won't tell you what the best friend does after this. <br/><br/>
The fat jokes in the movie.  Again, very thoughtless and cheap and seemed to pervade the movie thus clearly not supporting the tagline ""love actually is all around.""   <br/><br/>I could go on and on but let's not. I guess when you are Richard Curtis you can do what you want without really possessing a cohesive, quality piece of work. <br/><br/>Give me Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman any day. Colin Firth...why do you agree to do such drivel??

We really enjoyed it again.<br/><br/>This is one of the most delightful romantic comedies I have seen in quite a while. It is 4 weeks before Christmas in London, Hugh Grant is the newly-elected and single Prime Minister. There are several couples very loosely connected and this 2-hour movie which follows the development of each attempt at romance. Grant begins the movie with a voice-over, and showing various anonymous people in public showing affection for each other. And the movie ends the same way. I was going to watch only 20 minutes or so to see if I really wanted to see it all later, but could not stop watching. A great ensemble cast and fine British humor in the vein of 'Notting Hill' and 'Four Weddings'. Nudity and blue language make it for the over-21 crowd.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS follow, for my recollection only, please read no further -- One of the 'couples' was Colin Firth, a writer, and his Portugese housekeeper. He spoke no Portugese, she no English. With subtitles, we see that often they are saying the same thing without knowing it. Near the end he looks her up at her waitress job back home, he has learned Portugese, and she has learned a little English. He proposes, she accepts. A scene set up very well.<br/><br/>Another humorous scene was Billy Bob Thornton as the USA President (POTUS) visiting Grant. POTUS has an eye for Natalie, the cute assistant of the Prime Minister, and as soon as he gets her alone, he makes a move for her. Obviously a spoof of a real POTUS, from Arkansas. The assistant gets moved to a different job, but she sends Grant a nice Christmas card, he looks her up, they end up together.<br/><br/>There is a side story of a washed-up musician making a Christmas record, which becomes number one, and leaves a party on Christmas eve to return to his chubby manager, telling him 'you're the one I really loved all these years.' Then the funny story of the Brit who can't ever score with women, decides to go to America to pick up chicks, his friend laughs at him, he goes to Milwaukee, goes into the nearest bar, orders a Budweiser, is soon surrounded by three gorgeous girls, and he eventually brings two sisters back with him to the UK.<br/><br/>Another story is the 10-year-old boy who has a crush on a cute singer at school, and eludes guards at the airport to tell her goodbye before she leaves for the States. Another are the two movie stand-ins who have to do semi-nude scenes for blocking, they eventually end up together."

You can thank me later.<br/><br/>I rarely watch a movie more than once - even ones I consider masterpieces like Inception or The Godfather. But this movie has something about it that makes it a decadent pleasure every year. I've watched it at least 10 times and enjoyed it every time. It's a movie with real heart, positive sentiment throughout, oozing with love stories, laugh out loud humour and so many sub-plots and interesting characters that you're constantly swept along trying to keep up with the action. When these stories all become intertwined as the movie progresses, it's brilliant storytelling. Looking forward to watching it again next year - definitely my favourite Christmas flick."

","Monetarily, Love Actually was a hit. Unfortunately box office numbers do not translate into a good film. <br/><br/>This movie was painful to get through. Love Actually is probably one of the movies I will use as an example of an ensemble cast that is trying to be something great but just doesn't seem to work with the number of characters involved in the production. The story has a weak excuse to have all of the characters connected. Each storyline could be its own movie and as a result each character isn't fully developed. It almost seems like writer and director Richard Curtis had this idea that he had to make a movie with an ensemble cast because that is in vogue at the time and as a result had to write a script as quickly as possible in order to monetize on this movement. There were parts of this movie that seemed like they didn't belong. With the large cast, the movie felt like watching something shot by someone with extreme ADHD or someone who didn't know what he was doing without a storyboard. <br/><br/>Watching this movie, I also got the feeling that Curtis has a sense of humor that didn't quite line up with mine and then I saw Rowan Atkinson pop up on screen and everything came into focus. I immediately had to see if Curtis had his hands on any Mr. Bean episodes and possibly the movie. Turns out he did so much of the humor in this movie made total sense to me. It's not my cup of tea but I do get it now. That said, it wasn't shocking for me to find out that this was Curtis' first film as a director. Love Actually was not good. <br/><br/>There were a few bright spots in this, however. Andrew Lincoln was excellent and I was surprised to see him in this cast as I am a big fan. He was the best part of this movie. Considering the cast around him, that was shocking to me but he was very good. Emma Thompson is always great and she was fantastic here. One or two of the story lines were good but for the most part they felt a little incomplete or rushed.<br/><br/>I hope I don't have to watch this one again as this was already the second time I watched this film and I remember leaving it with the same issues both times. What a shame. On the bright side, Love Actually has made quite a lot of cash so congrats to all those involved!"

","It's a multi-storyline movie about love. It opens on an airport arrival. It's a promising start. At least, it's a rare place to start, and it's a great place for love and reunion. Then it goes on to talk about 9-11. The calls from the people are almost always one of love rather than hate. It's a heighten call to action for a simple rom-com. They want to show that love is most powerful emotion.<br/><br/>I like some of the stories. Mostly I found them formulaic and nothing original. However I am profoundly distracted by Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister. He is still playing the same character as his other movies which makes the Prime Minister too silly. For a movie with such a vast cast, there must be somebody more fitting to be the PM.<br/><br/>The saddest thing about this movie is that it may have inspired more of these multi-storyline love stories. Only they are getting more and more insipid. If a love story is good enough, it should be able to fill a whole movie."

","The Richard Curtis I like is the man behind the big belly-laughs in TV's ""Black Adder"" and ""Vicar Of Dibley"". Quite how he morphed into the purveyor of ludicrous, over-sentimental tosh like this I'll never know, although I think the lure of the mighty dollar might have had something to do with it.<br/><br/>Mixing the supposed ""feel-good"" factor of a latter-day Christmas film to an overblown hymn to love, while meant no doubt to induce a warm feeling inside, instead turned my insides out. Here in a Britain about a million miles detached from reality, Cupid's little arrows strike out at everyone from the prime minister himself to porn actors and even, God bless, the little children. It's all set to a corny soundtrack, a new song on every two minutes or so it seems, usually consisting of poor cover versions of standards.<br/><br/>I don't know which set of cooing couples I thought the least of, but for sheer sickliness, the exchanges between Liam Neeson and his 10 going on 40 year old son take some beating. Worst scene though, in an overcrowded category, has to be Emma Thompson silently over-emoting as she realises her husband is thinking of having an affair. I wish Dorothy Parker hadn't already coined the phrase about running the gamut of acting emotions from A to B, although I'm not sure Miss Thompson even got past A, so toe-curlingly embarrassing is her ""big"" scene.<br/><br/>Honestly, to these eyes and ears, not one actor shines, although as I think I've made clear, I believe the fault is in the writing. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, loads of ham acting and a direction style which tries to lead you by the nose to Christmas nirvana. No, this Christmas turkey can go and get stuffed as far as I'm concerned, its one small saving grace being that it singularly failed to launch former soap star Martine McCutcheon to movie stardom. Well, that would certainly be high up on my Christmas wish-list any old year."

","Over the course of a few weeks leading up until Christmas, various friends and relations fall in and out of love and examine their relationships.<br/><br/>This is what's generally known as a feelgood movie, but it had the opposite effect on me. It's not really about being in love, it's about the happy, giddy feeling of infatuation - it neglects to mention all the deeper emotions and complications which arise when you are in love with someone, and whenever it looks like it might start to get close to that (a grieving widower, a wife who suspects her husband has fallen in love with someone else), it makes sure it moves quickly onto something lighter. It's very badly written - vacuous and predictable, and somehow both unnecessarily vulgar and repellently sickly-sweet at the same time - which is a shame since its writer-director wrote some of the best British TV comedy of the eighties. Visually, it's tedious, and its soundtrack consists entirely of bland love songs. Its only asset is its huge cast, but since none of them have anything interesting to do or say they are mostly wasted. Big stars like Neeson, Rickman and Thornton are just plain slumming, Grant does his insufferable usual charming Lord Snot routine and most everyone else is just a Pretty Person. Only Linney and Thompson come close to drama and only Nighy (as an ageing Rod Stewart-type lothario rocker) says anything funny. If you want to see a real movie about love, made by grownups, watch any of the films of Ingmar Bergman, John Cassavetes or Nicolas Roeg, not this bland, superficial, ingratiating pap."

But, in this case, there was frankly too much rhetoric. Some of the stories were frankly so silly, like the one about the sandwich deliver boy. Some others were better: the one involving Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was actually quite moving, like the one involving the girl with a mentally ill brother; and the one involving Colin Firth was really funny. Also, the story about the character who falls in love with his best friend's wife and tries desperately to hide his feelings was touching.<br/><br/>But the others were frankly ridiculous, in particular the one about Hugh Grant.

","My feelings for this movie are ambiguous, to put it lightly.<br/><br/>The characters couldn't have been more two-dimensional. There was no effort put in to make the characters believable. Instead of trying to expand on different aspects of potentially brilliant characters, several more uninteresting, 'flat' characters are shoved in our faces.<br/><br/>So many story lines were pointless. So two people are body doubles in a porn film. And they fall in 'love'. So what? What is the point of that storyline, other then to have multiple sex scenes shoved down our throats? And what was the point of the 'secret admirer' of Keira Knightley? Admittedly there were a few good scenes in this storyline, but there was no climax. He tells her how he feels. Then what? Did the writers forget this storyline? I would include the Bill Nighy storyline here too, but there were several redeeming scenes. The story was pointless, but somewhat entertaining.<br/><br/>The swearing was overdone. Yes, have swearing if you wish. Swearing can work well to develop characters, add tension to a storyline. When used in the right places it can also add comedy. But the writers don't take any notice of this-they include swearing for the sake of it. After the first scene it just wasn't funny anymore. Martine McCutcheon's swearing seemed very forced-if it seems forced, that indicates that it has no purpose there.<br/><br/>I could go on, but for now I'll just give some credit to the actors. They worked with what they were given, they did their best (overall) to add characterization to the cardboard cutouts they were given to work with. Some were more successful then others.<br/><br/>Five out of ten. But only because of the acting and one storyline. Anyone who watched the movie will know which storyline I mean."
"mageesa","5","0","0","2 January 2006"," self-reflexive romantic comedy
","I'm not a big fan of the chick-flick genre, but this movie is interesting if you watch it as a critique of 'cinematic' love...<br/><br/>As others have complained, the power relationships between the male and female characters were disturbing; (hard to imagine a world uninhabited by simultaneously ambitious and attractive women). But this is a world constructed by the filmmaker, not a picture of reality, and in this world there is no passion for anything but passion. Work, art, intellectual activity... these things are as uninteresting to the men as to the women. The men are in power not because they have a passionate interest in their field (politics, acting, business), but because they have been placed in a position of power by the writer. We have to ask ourselves, what was the filmmaker was driving at: why such a flat, unengaged world?<br/><br/>In this particular world, people fall 'in love' based on nothing, and longer relationships are devalued (the Liam Neeson lack of mourning, the Alan Rickman marriage...). I've seen complaints that the men love the women without speaking to them, only for their looks, but the same could be said of the women, who love the men only for their power... the modern romantic dilemma in a nutshell!<br/><br/>These superficial relationships are intentionally constructed to offer a contrast to the main story line: that of the aging rock star. <br/><br/>This ironic character initially represents the crass commercialism and superficiality of Christmas, but unlike the others, he is self-aware. His public self-mockery draws attention to the pathos of the holiday, and to the emptiness of his life. And he is redeemed, not only in the charts, but through his revelation about the true nature of Christmas, and his discovery of 'True Love'. Unlike the other characters, he acts against his own self-interest (to leave Elton John's party, where there are attractive women in lower positions of power), in order to be with the real 'love of his life'. <br/><br/>(Only the office woman shows similar self-sacrifice, leaving the hunky programmer to care for her brother, but this relationship lacks self-awareness, and therefore offers no redemption in the end.)<br/><br/>I'm not a Christian, but I think it's no accident that this story of contrasts (between the 'real' and the appearance) takes place in a de- Christianized Christmas, with no mention of Christ, or what his message was... the lobsters at the nativity play highlight this disconnect between the 'real' holiday and how it is celebrated today (in portrayal), just as the stories illustrate a disconnect between 'real' love and how it is shown in movies (or how it might be experienced by many people today). I don't think the person who made this film wants us to idealize its vision of romance... on the contrary!<br/><br/>(I am going to assume all this is intentional on the filmmaker's part, because as an artist, I know every decision in a work is made with intention. )<br/><br/>One clue that there's more going on here (in terms of self-reflexiveness) is the romance between the porn stand-ins; that seems a little cue for us to consider the film-making process, and the falseness of portrayal. Also, after the revelation of 'True Love', the rock star suggests they watch porn... another constructed contrast between real love and 'film love'. <br/><br/>But I think I'm running out of space here, and those who will understand what I'm driving at have already gotten my point... re-watch the movie thinking of the rock star as the hero, and you might enjoy it in a different way!"

Basically a silly movie poorly written by silly people way out of touch with the rest of humanity.

","I am not sure if I went into this movie with expectations of a formula movie (such as Curtis's well-known writing efforts: Four Weddings and a Funeral; Bridget<br/><br/>Jones's Diary; Notting Hill), but it disappointed me none the less. Although the cast is packed with thespians that have turned out regularly impressive<br/><br/>performances, none of them is given a chance to explore any depth within their characters.  Instead, the viewer is expected to watch poorly paced vignettes that never ad up to anything more than cute moments inspired by the universal<br/><br/>Christmas emotions of love and goodwill.<br/><br/>The largest problem of the film lies with its inability to settle down and let the beats of a scene unfold naturally.  The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film is so frenetically edited, jumping among the myriad of storylines, that the viewer is exposed to the most rudimentary aspects of each character (each scene relies<br/><br/>heavily on reaction shots, clever narrative jokes, witty dialogue lacking<br/><br/>emotional subtext, and a memorable physical comedy setup involving<br/><br/>pornography stand-ins).  There is a definite interest in getting to know the<br/><br/>characters because they are endearing; but alas, there is no payoff in the end, just a hollowness echoing some jovial laughter.<br/><br/>Much of the problems arise from the oversaturation of characters.  Billy Mack, a middle-aged pop star looking for a comeback, is sn interesting character played quite well by Bill Nighy.  Many of the funniest scenes  (not to mention a nice emotional payoff at the end of the film) involve him and his manager. High<br/><br/>Grant also is charming, but is forced to partake in one of the most superfluous dancing sequences seen in many a year.  I cannot fault the actors, they do well with the little of which they have to work.  But I would have preferred to see some of the roles excised in order to develop the others more fully.  Even<br/><br/>Magnolia (P.T. Anderson's tour de force that relied on the connections between an ensemble of characters) allowed scenes and characters to evolve before<br/><br/>employing its sweeping camera movements and edits.<br/><br/>The intentions behind Love Actually are commendable.  The opening VO set<br/><br/>against a nice montage of newly arrived air travelers leads the viewer to believe the complication of relationships of love might be explored.  Sadly, that is never realized.  The final product is nothing but a collection of cute moments that seem to be selling the idea of love rather than showing the depth of its effects."

Her role in the love affair is simply to be looked at and act grateful when he tells her she's pretty. That's it.<br/><br/>This describes most of the love plots. 2 in particular involve NO conversations between them, and in both cases the man is rewarded for professing his ""love"" to the woman he doesn't actually know at all and has never really talked to, and the woman is really flattered in both cases - even though one of the men behaved in a very stalkerish manner, ruined her wedding photos and betrayed her husband who is supposedly his best friend, and in the other case 2 characters are ""in love"" even though they don't speak the same language and their ""relationship"" mostly involves him staring at her body.<br/><br/>The only female characters actually given the semblance of any personality are the ones that end up with sad endings/rejections.

-There is neither love nor the spirit of Christmas in this movie. Why it was billed as both in 2003 was simply a marketing gimmick to try to extend residuals paid to the producer into perpetuity when unsuspecting people flip it on every Christmas into 2018.
-The story is jammed with 10 sub-plots, which is too many, so they have to toggle through repeatedly, giving little screen time to character and plot development.
-Some writer thought he was clever for writing parallel stories, but forgot to intertwine them, so they became totally unrelated.
-Because the lack of screen time per sub-plot, those stories can't possibly show enough depth of interaction between two actors to get the audience to buy in that there is actually love there.
-The 'love' stories are: two porn stars who film together start to like each other, another porn star flies off to the US to have threesomes, a guy is infatuated with his best friend's wife, a middle aged married man is seduced by his secretary, a woman and man who work together have awkward tension, a writer falls in love and proposes to his housekeeper and neither of them speak the same language, a little boy has a crush on a little girl, the Prime Minister falls in love with his waitstaff, who he has had one or two very brief conversations with regarding where she lives
-Let's not overlook the drawn out sex scenes and nudity (in a ""Christmas"" movie??) between porn stars and this one pair who are about to have a one night stand, until her mentally I'll brother calls twice and you listen to a detailed coversation between them for two minutes, while the guy sits there on the bed feeling as awkward as I did. Said sex scenes don't even change camera angles and are from fifteen feet away, so you feel like a voyeristic creep looking through a peep hole.
-The production is horrible, so you go from quiet scenes, abruptly into ear splittingly loud musical scores.
-Someone out there who thinks I've missed the point of the irony of the title, Love Actually, which is meant to point out that people don't have story book encounters of love in real life vs how they're portrayed in movies, will be disappointed to know I've already thought of that, which is the point of this review. People in real life aren't actually this impossibly weird or awkward. So this isn't ACTUALLY how love goes.

Christmas, rather than ""New Year's Eve"" or ""Valentines Day"" gets the treatment this time with but despite the presence of an excellent British cast (Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightly, Emma Thomson, etc) the result is the same as equivalent American holiday outings. To put it succinctly there's no ""there"" there. The film contains a pastiche of boring little love stories with obvious endings in largely unrealistic scenarios. Particularly Hugh Grant playing a single heterosexual man who ascends to the highest level of office comes across as completely unelectable in real life. Hugh's standard performance as the good-looking absent-minded middle class everyman had grown stale by this go-around and even he seemed bored. The talents of powerhouse actors such as Knightley and Thomson put to no good use seems a shame. If only they had some decent lines to say. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as porn actors who fall in love starts off as clever but quickly becomes repetitive. Everyone else just seems bored. Having said that blaming the folks involved somewhat does them a disservice as this type of quick-cut vignette film can amount to only so much given the necessary shallows it plays in given the number of subplots that the director tries to cram in. In short, ignore the advice of reviewers who talk about this trifle being unfairly underrated - the underraters have it right."

This is not a bad movie actually, but i see that the director just wants us to see different people falling in love and empathize with them. I think he just overdid it and would have done better had he had just shown 3-4 fully developed love stories. The performances are nothing spectacular except Bill Nighy as an aging rock star who really sparkles up the screen whenever he is on it. Rowand Atkinson appears in just two scenes and does what he does best,<br/><br/>I reiterate the point that it is not a bad movie, but just a bit overindulgent .

","While the acting was splendid and the cast consisted of many of my favorite actors, I was quite disappointed in the subtext. I found it quite sexist and insulting. Several of the male cast chose to be with much younger women who were not their equals. The most overt statement was made by one man who said English women were stuck up. No wonder if the men only appreciate subservient women. The Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, chose to fall for a much younger, uneducated and insecure woman who was a low level member of his staff. (I found it incredible that such a person would be on his staff to begin with.) The writer played by Colin Firth, although suffering from an earlier betrayal by his partner, falls for a younger housekeeper who he can't communicate with due to the language barrier. Clearly a substantive relationship. The executive played by Alan Rickman falls for a much younger, blatant tart on his staff when he has the charming and elegant Emma Thompson at home. What does this all say about men's choices? They don't want an equal, they want sexy staff at home. In other aspects, this movie seemed to contain forward thinking.

","Please don't make the mistake I did and check the film out hoping Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson might actually make up for Rowan Atkinson (who's Mr. Bean is at times funny, but his movies...not) and Hugh Grant, whom I have yet to see a film he's been in that I've enjoyed.<br/><br/>I checked it out with the caveat that if it took a turn down the wrong path, I would simply stop watching.<br/><br/>We have only IMDb or online to find out any info on films as the summaries in Czech seldom tell much and far too many, like this film, are not rated by the Czech board of film raters.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes or so were so replete with sexual jokes, references, homosexual jokes, lustful innuendos, a brother fornicating with his brother's wife (or girlfriend), and a 'singer' using like 6 profane words consecutively in one sentence plus an assistant to 'prime minister' Hugh Grant (UGHH!) who of course must proceed to use all kinds of bad language at the prime minister.<br/><br/>It was enough for me. Thanks kindly to IMDb about the warning that the film also contained nudity. The title sounded interesting, the beginning showed promise of people hugging people goodbye at a train station, but it took a radically wrong turn.<br/><br/>I think that the narrator got it wrong. Love was not all around. Even if he was meaning it to be humorous, the only 'love' that was all around in this movie was lust, actually. Which would have made a more fitting title.<br/><br/>Avoid this film and don't buy into it being a family friendly film or romantic. It's like a British HBO movie where sex substitutes for love and lust substitutes for romance."

","London, and its citizens, are in love in Richard Curtis' debut film LOVE ACTUALLY, which tells the intertwining stories of about a dozen characters, all experiencing different forms of love during the course of the Christmas holidays. There is the love between siblings, love that isn't reciprocated, love amongst friends, young teens, lovers, spouses, family members, politicians, co-workers, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>This, of course, is not a bad thing -- Curtis manages to fill his story lines with a large cast of mainly British actors who have all in one form or the other been in successful romantic comedies, but with so many stories, one gets the feeling that at times, either the film should have been longer, more episodic, or made into a two-part miniseries.<br/><br/>But as it is, LOVE ACTUALLY is a pretty good feature film that managed to bring more smiles and tears than anger and frustration. Most of the story lines, if not all, resolve themselves much in the tradition of feel-good films and while sometimes a bit much on the sugary elements, it entertains, especially in one sequence where Liam Neeson's character's son runs through security at the airport in order to get a response from the girl he loves.<br/><br/>Maybe not the definitive romantic comedy of the year as it was touted, but one that tugs the emotions in all the right places, and sets out to do what it's supposed to do: make you cuddle up with your partner, sip some hot tea, and enjoy."

","I have to say that I did not like this movie ... the first time I saw it. I found the plot lackluster and and too simplistic, while at the same time too chaotic. If you have seen this movie one time and agree with me, I suggest you see it again. The second time I saw the movie I'm afraid I have to admit it was for Keira Knightly. The girl's a good actress and has a sweet, yet subtle, smile, and her eyes portray a good amount. One should watch for such things in her movies. So I began the movie again, anticipating seeing the same things I saw the first time. To my utter delight, the movie changed. Like I said, the first time I saw it I thought it was too simplistic, and I realized upon a second look my detrimental and arrogant opinion was wrong:<br/><br/>This movie is for those who want to look a bit deeper to find meaning in a movie. If you're just looking for a good love story without substance, you'll have to continue looking, but for those of you who want to look deeper inside yourself to find your own definition of love, this one's for you. I believe that everyone who sees this film will walk away from it with a totally different opinion than all the others that have seen it. It's a movie to relate to, a movie to relate to in such a way that it can only be seen in a personal way. The concept is hard to grasp, unless of course your concept of love is easy to come to. <br/><br/>Although each person will walk away with a different idea of what this movie is about, I shall nonetheless offer you what my opinion was. Love is not a simple thing to uncover. It's not something that will just happen and it's not something that, once found, will continually stay the same. The movie strings facts together, and since everyone has some concept of what love is we give that value to what each character feels. Love is something that everyone understands, but no one can explain, more so than any other emotion. This movie demonstrates that."

","The kind of movie we need to watch once in a while to feel much better about human kind... <br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is terminally precious. Chirpy ""classic"" pop songs populate every third scene. It has no structure, just a jumble of interconnected stories -- some little dramas, some little comedies -- about love, flirtation, courtship and heartbreak, all of which will pay off just in time for a lovely London Christmas.<br/><br/>It's the kind of pandering, populist movie in which Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister of England, joyously shakes his booty to The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump (For My Love)"" until he suddenly, to his great embarrassment, realizes he's being watched. It offers no real surprises except in how and when it reveals the inevitable six degrees of separation between each anecdotal yarn -- none of which has enough substance to ever stand on its own (nor would you want them to!)."

It has several story lines, going from the love life of the Prime Minister to the relationship between a man and a woman who's job is faking sex scenes for movies. The cast is quite impressive too. Many top actors of the British movie industry are present. To name a few: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth...<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is a feel good movie, but not the over-sentimental one. I truly loved this movie. I loved the different story lines, they were written very well. After seeing this movie I'm absolutely sure Richard Curtis hasn't give up on love and he definitely hopes many people share his opinion. The acting was quite amazing as well. I loved Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln the most. Laura Linney wasn't disappointing either. Bill Nighy was also very funny as the crazy Billy Mack.<br/><br/>I have two scenes which I loved the most. The first was the scene where Keira Knightley watches the video Andrew Lincoln made of her wedding. Her reaction was very real, as well as his. The second scene was the one where Andrew Lincoln come to Keira Knightley's home, you know, the scene with the line ""To me you're perfect"". Brilliant and truly touching.

","Love, marriage, funeral Every real cinema-goer knows that it must be a Richard Curtis film. It seems his films are all the same. Same places, same actors and actresses, same topic. Somehow he always has something new to say.<br/><br/>His latest film, Love Actually was released in December 2003 and all its plot is organised around Christmas. At the beginning, we see the people at the Arrivals' Gate at Heathrow Airport accompanied by the comment of the director. ""Love actually is all around"" he says as the arriving passengers meet their friends and relatives. Later on we have to watch attentively for the usual density of plot and the abundance of characters of a Curtis movie makes it hard to understand. Marriages, proposals, cheats and kisses dominate every moment of the story. Finally, of course everybody finds his/her true love.<br/><br/>Curtis has a natural sense of surprise and humour. The film doesn't have a dull moment and the acting performance is outstanding. Apart from the usual stars of the British film industry (such as Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keira Knightly) we get to know many other talented artists. Few film directors can be proud of such a crew. Grant's brilliant acting as the Prime Minister is something none of those who have seen the film will forget."

I love it when I get an excuse to pop to the airport and like to get there just a little too early so that I can feel all the emotions rolling over me like a love roller coaster. If you are an emotional fridge you need to watch this movie and then get down to your nearest airport. Focus your attention on one person and try to feel everything that person is feeling, try and guess by the look on their face whether they are meeting a business partner, lover, family member or just a friend, and then wait with them until the person they are awaiting arrives.

Touching: He ditches an Elton John holiday party to admit to his long-suffering manager that he is actually the (platonic) love of his life.<br/><br/> Funny: Colin Firth is trailed through the streets by an ever-growing throng of gossipy townspeople on his way to propose to his Portugese beloved, Aurelia. The gossip begins with ""he wants to marry her"" then becomes ""he is going to enslave her"" then ""he is going to murder her.""<br/><br/> Touching: The look on Juliet (Keira Knightley's) face when she realizes that her new husband's best man is in love with her, and he can't let anyone see the wedding video he shot for them because all the frames are full of her.<br/><br/> Funny and touching: Rowan Atkinson's two well-timed appearances.<br/><br/> Funny: When Hugh Grant gamely but tentatively starts to sing a Christmas carol for two little girls, and his bodyguard chimes in with an exquisitely operatic voice.<br/><br/> Funny: The Christmas pageant with children dressed as lobsters, other assorted sea creatures, and Spiderman. Oh, and singing ""Catch a Falling Star,"" which isn't even a Christmas song.<br/><br/> After several wistful comments about the lovely Claudia Schiffer, Liam Neeson's suffering widower meets a young woman named Carol--played by a refreshingly makeup-free Claudia Schiffer."

","This movie me made me smile. That's about all I can say. Let's forget all of this Four Weddings and a Funeral crap because this movie was a better movie. Each individual storyline added something to the film. The almost seamless transitions from scene to scene make it quite easy to follow for a film with such a complex plot. I was unbelievably touched by the interaction between Liam Neeson and his stepson. The development of their relationship could have been a movie in itself. However, blended with the them ""Love actually is all around,"" their interaction strengthens this argument. I think some of the users have read too much into Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant because it fits what Curtis wants to do. he wanted Grant to be eccentric and odd around Natalie because although he was a powerful man he was uncomfortable in the dating setting. Knightly puts forth a stellar performance in her limited roll, and Rown Atkinson and Alan Rickman both are tremendous.<br/><br/>this movie is a careful reminder that we are able to see love in our daily life as long as we look for it. In our troubled world, that idea has been lost. We are reminded to cherish friendship, act on love, and allow others to act on their love for us.<br/><br/>SEE THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE.

","I remember hearing about this movie, and thinking it was a must-see, but upon watching it, I found it incredibly disappointing. The cast is excellent, and the movie wonderfully acted. Many of my favourite actors/actresses graced the cast. The idea was good as well. It was a depiction of all the different ways in which love takes form, including, but not limited to romantic love, platonic love, and unrequited love. <br/><br/>The execution, however, was lacking. Some characters were not fleshed out properly, and others given far too little attention. There were a few characters whose stories I failed to see the point or merit of.<br/><br/>Although there were some fine threads connecting most of the characters, the movie on the whole seemed disjointed and jumped around far too often. Too much was going on, and I felt as though it might have worked better as a series of short films, which incidentally would have also given a unique presentation for a feature film. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Love, Actually"" is not altogether not worth seeing. I'd recommend tuning in if you happen to catch it on cable, but otherwise don't bother."

","This is a pretty good movie considering that the director took a meat axe to his original creation because he had made it 80 minutes too long. Apparently, almost all of the scenes that were to introduce us to the characters were chopped leaving a very disconnected beginning. In addition, the ending was supposed to bring everything neatly together (rather than just having everyone show up at Heathrow) with Rowan Atkinson portraying an angel who brought all of the couples together (didn't it look strange that Atkinson just happened to be in line where Liam Neeson needed him?). Not only was the angel dropped, everything the angel did (which was supposed to make it all make sense) went with it. It is hard to believe that a director could leave himself in the position of having to chop one-third of his film. It is even harder to believe that fans would give the pasted-together two-thirds such high marks. The acting, which was almost uniformly top notch, and the outstanding music made the movie look much better than the director deserved, and perhaps the story he ended up with was better than the one he wanted to make. I guess it truly is better to be lucky than good."

There were a few times where i laughed out loud but one-liners do not make a film.<br/><br/>I managed to stick with it until the end but i was very close to turning off right at the beginning when Hugh Grant did a more that sappy voice over about 9/11. If that isn't the biggest manipulation of the publics' feeling I dont know what is. Maybe some Propaganda posters should be put round the cinemas now? There needs to be a place in this world where there is no politics involved. People go to the cinema to be entertained  and when they need an escape not to be bombarded with political troubles, they may as well watch the news at home.<br/><br/>All in all i think you can tell that i was not too impressed by Love Actually.

"Geshreeyeh","Null","2","5","7 March 2004"," Raises some serious issues...
","... about how much cr*p the film-going public will take. Ask any Londoner about how marvelously this film reflects life in the English capital in the run up to Christmas. I think the answer would be pretty synonymous - it doesn't, not remotely. Richard Curtis has once again delivered a sugar-coated tapestry of fairy-tale lives, as perceived through his blinkered view of London. I love London, but I could hardly declare it a city of love. It is cold, unfriendly and often depressing. Not only that, but for most of its inhabitants Christmas is probably one of the most stressful times of the year. I understand that movies often twist reality to provide enjoyable escapism, but 'loveactually' pushes the boat more than a little too far. Rather than humourously deal with the negative elements of the city, he ignores them completely. Instead, as usual, he focuses on his merry band of rich, happy, middle-class toffs. And selecting some of the actors most associated with 'classical' dramas? Well, it does little to suggest that this is a genuine slice of 'Landan' life. The film itself? Well, the above elements can't help but hinder the enjoyment of anyone below the middle classes. That aside, it's the same characters, the same jokes and the same leading man. Gift wrap it with 'Four Weddings' and 'Notting Hill' and you could sell them as a trilogy. Let's hope this is the last installment in the series. I giggled a few times and I was mildly entertained, but essentially this type of nonsense has to come to an end. Recommended viewing for fans of the afore mentioned two films."
"imitationfeline","Null","2","5","28 February 2004"," I actually hated this film, it actually used the word actually too much actually.
","Love is ACTUALLY all around us. This film is trying to ACTUALLY show many different examples of this love. Such as how Emma Thompson is ACTUALLY still in love with Alan Rickman even though he's ACTUALLY having an affair with some actress that I don't ACTUALLY know.<br/><br/>By this point you're probably getting annoyed with me but at least you know how I felt sitting in the cinema listening to the scriptwriters shove the word ""actually"" into the script as many times as they can without most people actu... really noticing. Perhaps I'm the only one this annoyed, in fact I don't think most people even noticed it, but for me this was already one point against the movie.<br/><br/>This was not the only point against it however. As a whole this film didn't have a storyline or plot, it was a collection of around a dozen stories united only by a common theme of love and some very shaky common relationships between the characters. The point of the film wasn't anything to do with the individual stories but simply an attempt to capture the emotion love and project it onto a screen for a painful 129 minutes.<br/><br/>The movie had way too many stories going on, at least 9. Each story had so little time to develop itself that it was almost a preview for another film. The plots were shallow, poorly realised and couldn't have worked as an individual story without major reworking. The bridging between these stories wasn't any better, don't expect the interweaving storylines of Quentin Tarantino or Lock Stock and 2 Smoking barrels from this film. It would be possible, with a good script and editor, that such a composite storyline could be greater than the sum of its parts however in this case it didn't work out.<br/><br/>To show just how many stories were going on I've described and critiqued each one below. Reading this list will probably give you as much detail as watching the film, it was ACTUALLY that shallow (sorry, couldn't resist one more).<br/><br/>---!!!WARNING  SPOILING AN EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE FILM  WARNING!!!---<br/><br/>Story 1 is about Kris Marshall, a sad and desperate man convinced that he could find sex if only he were in America. He saves up his money, flies to America and his fantasy comes true. I should mention that this is not me simplifying it, it is literally that speed and level of detail in the movie. In short, this subplot was a throwaway joke which had nothing to do with the actual aim of the movie.<br/><br/>Story 2 is about Emma Thompson, a long-suffering housewife whose husband Alan Rickman is having an affair with the office slut. At the beginning of the film she really knows he's having an affair but won't admit it to herself. Over the course of the film she finds out for sure that he is sleeping with his secretary and... does pretty much nothing. Maybe, just maybe, this idea could work as a psychological drama if it were played seriously but it really doesn't fit into the romantic comedy genre the rest of the film is stuck in. This segment was one of the main subplots as well with a good deal of screentime and used to bridge a lot of the other segments.<br/><br/>Story 3 is about Bill Nighy, an old has been rock star who releases a crappy christmas record. By admitting on radio that it's crap, stirring up public controversy and a range of publicity stunts he gets the record to number one. This story has absolutely nothing to do with love except for some hasty and unrelated decleration of affection for his manager which he squeezes into the last minute of the movie. This subplot contributed nothing to the plot side of the movie but managed to bridge a few scenes and gave them a theme song to work with.<br/><br/>Story 4 is about Liam Neeson whose wife has just died, before her death he promised his wife that he would date the real Claudia Schiffer. He meets Carol (played by Claudia Schiffer) a month after his wife's death and is seriously dating her a month after that, guess he moves on quickly.<br/><br/>Story 5 is about Liam Neeson's stepson, Thomas Sangster, a 14 year old in love with the coolest girl in school. He unsuccessfully tries to win her affection by learning to play the drums. He breaches airport security to tell her that he loves her just as she's getting on the plane. She apparently likes him too and gives him a kiss. I suppose who wouldn't like<br/><br/>someone who can learn to play drums to a professional level in under a month? (the song they perform at the very end could only be the product of a skilled band in an audio studio, not a high-school christmas concert).<br/><br/>In story 6, Colin Firth moves to France after his wife has an affair with his brother. He meets a Portugese housekeeper and we are treated the rest of the movie with seeing her subtitles being ""humourous"" mirror images of his dialogue. He gets back to America and learns Portugese so he can go back and propose to her.<br/><br/>Story 7 shows us Hugh Grant as a very unlikely prime minister of Britain who bases his foreign policy decisions on his love for his assistant then reassigns her to another office so he can think clearly. When he gets a romantic christmas card from her he then goes to every door on her street looking for her since he can't remember the address (and apparently never thought to look her up on the office rolls or ask his police escort to check). As chance would have it his secretary lives next door to the office slut having an affair with Hugh Grant's sister's husband. This coincidence has nothing to do with the story and isn't used in anyway other than to get out of hiring an extra and as an attempt to give the movie some semblance of coherency.<br/><br/>Story 8 is about an office girl, Laura Linney, who's (not so) secretly in love with her coworker Rodrigo Santoro. She gives up the hot hunk to look after her insane brother and ends up spending christmas with him in the mental ward.<br/><br/>Story 9 wants us to think that Andrew Lincoln is gay and in love with his friend Chiwetel Ejiofor, however he's really in love with Chiwetel's wife.<br/><br/>Which brings up a damn good point.<br/><br/>Do only straight people fall in love?<br/><br/>Most films I couldn't care less about having token black, female, gay or jewish characters. If your story doesn't need to have that character in there then don't include it and I'll be fine. This film irked me though only because it attempts to present itself as a fairly definitive and extensive view of love and then doesn't include anything about gay couples in love. With all those disjointed plots which barely came together anyway weren't they able to squeeze in a single gay couple anywhere?<br/><br/>Okay, perhaps they didn't fit into the plot, I'll grant the film makers that much. But what about the montage at the very end of the movie? Shots of hundreds of couples embracing at the airport, going by so quickly that you'd be challenged to spot any single picture. Scanning through them I didn't see even a single shot of a gay couple, and that bugs me in a movie trying to demonstrate love for the audience.<br/><br/>Having Liam Neeson saying ""she/he"" about his son's unidentified love-interest and misleading the audience into thinking that Andrew Lincoln is gay just doesn't cut it. In any other movie this cursory nod would be more than enough, but in a movie attempting to cast as wide a scope as this movie did the ommission of homosexuality was inexusible.<br/><br/>but...<br/><br/>If you don't care about a movie making sense, having a plot or exploring characters then this movie might be for you. It was well made, had great actors and some cute dialogue. If you switch your brain off at the door you'll probably come out with a warm buzzing feeling. Definately a movie to take a date along to, at least that way you'll have a distraction from the inane film and maybe get something out of the $10 you wasted on seeing it."

While there are moments to relish (as I say Curtis can write)it is usually down to the watchability of individual actors like Grant while others make you cringe as they fail to ignite (including Keira Knightley)and overall the film does not work - portmanteau stories rarely do - and when filtered through the increasingly boring and tired rose looking spectacle view of middle class Englanders, the result is simply to leave one with a feeling that it would be good not to have to endure another of these Curtis films for a long time."

","I have been desperately the awaiting the release of this movie for the past month and after attending a sneak preview tonight I can officially say that it was everything I'd hoped for and more.  First of all the brilliant cast must be praised-these are real actors- who really make you feel for the characters they portray and are amazingly funny.  Many of the members of this cast have been seen together many times before and that's because they work- whether in drama or comedy.   First off, Hugh Grant who stutters his way through the movie to bring, as always, hilarious fun to a character who would normally be portrayed as a stiff and manages to show that love will always prevail.  Then of course, Collin Firth who manages to make every scene he touches hilarious and yet brilliantly truthful-and shows us how love is greater than even a language barrier. There is Alan Rickman-a brilliant actor who can make you feel for any character no matter how much of silly, and see a bit of depth whether he is supposed to be funny or dramatic-in this movie he manages to pull off both the light and dreadfully dramatic beautifully as always.  He shows us foolish love. Then of course the woman who plays his wife, Emma Thompson- who deserves praise, like many of her costars in this movie, for anything she touches.  She shows us how love should be forgive and yet still makes us want to tell Alan Rickman to sod off-even if we feel for him too.  Yet again hilarious and dramatic and showing us the true nature of love.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson and his young costar who plays his son show us the bond between a father and son and how there development for step-father and son to father and son gives everyone a warm tingly feeling inside.  Both of these actors do a brilliant job of portraying this relationship.<br/><br/>Altogether I could go on forever about the brilliant cast however, many of which I haven't even mentioned, all of which who should be highly praised but the truth is that this film was extraordinarily crafted on all fronts. The writing of these characters was beautiful.<br/><br/> I went in thinking I would see a brilliant romantic comedy and saw a brilliant dramatic comedy about every type of love and the true nature of love.   It was a terrific reminder that love ""is all around"" and will in the end prevail and that even though it seems that only bad things happen now-in the end you're telling people that you love them not that you hate them. This look at all the types of love was an amazing insight in to life in general and what really matters.  Everyone should see this movie especially at a time like this when all one ever sees is tragedy.  Afterall it seems that we always forget that there really is love out there and good because we're so bombarded by the bad."

","So, it's from the team behind 4 Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diary, it includes the very same Hugh Grant and the 'theme song' is a take-off of the one from 4 Weddings. <br/><br/>That said, it's the best of these by far, and the ensemble nature of the film and its intertwined stories make it a joy - Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy and his manager, Colin Firth and his cleaner, Liam Neeson and his stepson, Laura Linney and her brother and many more.<br/><br/>The acting is good and the stories are not so sweet as to be implausible. Not everyone ends up in their preferred romance. But it's the more realistic nature of some of the stories that makes the film more enjoyable and the lack of reality in most Hollywood romantic comedies tends to ruin them. This film is very different. There are some strands that are weak, but most work well and I was particularly impressed with the acting of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson. The cameos are good and used appropriately and the film never feels like it's being stretched. Best of all, we walked out with that genuinely happy feeling (similar to that when I saw Mostly Martha or Bend it Like Beckham). If you have a romantic bone in your body go see it."

"herbqedi","7","2","6","9 May 2004"," Facile and muddled, yet pleasant and amusing enough
","The DVD analysis and out-takes make a few things clear.  The writer-director had a great many ideas, some brilliant, many overblown, but far too many to be contained in a two-hour-and-eight-minute-and-at-that-still-too-long commercially aimed holiday movie.  One of the sad results is that the five out-takes included on the DVD would have been five of the best 8 scenes in the movie.  apparently, nearly three-and-a-half hours were filmed and the editing obviously turned into a ""team effort"" in the absolute worst sense of the term.<br/><br/>One theme, almost a mantra to the people involved with the film, is that these were all conceptually variations on one basic story, with common threads from the global tapestry of love.  This is great stuff for film school, but in direct conflict with what studio executives think there audiences want to see when they come out to see a romantic comedy at holiday time.  And, this time, the execs are probably closer to what's best for the film than the creative geniuses who can no longer see the forest -- but they are hooked totally on commercial viability.<br/><br/>With 20-20 hindsight, the problems are easy to see. Most simply, eight-plus stories are at least two-plus too many.  Unfortunately, the two weakest and most peripheral stories also had the hottest and most marquee-worthy names. Somewhere there may be a brilliant movie waiting to be made with UK Prime Minister Hugh Grant refusing to continue being a lap dog for US President Billy Bob Thornton after the latter puts the make on an office girl that the former had his eye on.  But, it would require much more emphasis on governmental and global issues that did not belong in this movie -- with the result that, really, none of this belonged in the movie.  But, how can you cut out Hugh Grant's character and keep the film commercially viable?  You can't -- but since the format allows for no expansion of the complications of such a romance for a Prime Minister, you are left with a subplot with little to offer beyond the charm of the two principals portraying the actors.   Similarly, the Colin Firth character was supposed to connect somehow to Alan Rickman's character's mistress -- who in turn -- would have supplied some important insights.  Without them, we have the ugly Briton in the South of France trying to write a novel with a Portuguese ""beauty"" who speaks no English and is as shallow as a wading pool. So, we get Colin Firth's considerable panache, a bunch of forgettable slapstick and even more forgettable wistfulness, an enjoyably choreographed --if overblown -- march through a Portuguese village, and a waste of 25-or-so all-too-valuable minutes of the movie's run-time.  There's a bittersweet subplot with a wedding photographer that doesn't quite belong in the pastiche in the manner intended. The subplot with the overdependent brother ruining a love-life via cellphone falls flat quickly as well.   The shame is that stripping these excess threads out would have allowed the film's true gems and interesting vignettes (Liam Neeson & son, Rickman & Thompson's entire family, the sex doubles, the singer-manager duo, and the stud with the American dream and his nay-saying friend) to keep their more memorable scenes and weave more seamlessly into the director's intended tapestry.<br/><br/>Okay, so much for the movie that did not get to be released.  I believe that one that did get released did retain the writer-director's pervasive message of the delightful incongruities of the ""family holiday"" aspects of Christmas contrasted against all the commercial selling of sex concurrently airing during the period whilst adult sex-party games are in full force.  Too bad these messages are not nearly as insightful or revelatory as intended. Worse, including all these smutty references -- irrespective of motivation -- limits its accessibility to an 8-to-14-year-old holiday audience that would have otherwise found much to enjoy.<br/><br/>In summary, Love Actually is full of flaws and misfires.  The closer you get to the movie, the more you'll see them.  But, if your looking for a pleasant enough pastiche of attractive people delivering witty and urbane dialog in a pleasant setting with a great soundtrack -- then put down your critic's pencil, check your brains, grab someone you love, and enjoy Love Actually.<br/><br/>My score: 7/10.  By the way, if you enjoyed Hugh Grant in this film, make certain you see the far-better About A Boy from 2002.  He's terrific in the comedy, and the film is quite a bit of fun for all but the most extremely hypercritical or for avid haters of Mr. Grant."

","'Love, Actually (2003)' is like a slab of aged Stilton on a chocolate-chip cookie ice-cream sandwich: cheesy, saccharine and a tad confused. On-the-nose, sweet-and-savoury metaphors aside, the movie is a mess. It's overly sentimental, relentlessly earnest and hopelessly predictable, conforming to the conventions of its genre a dozen times over. It's no accident that two of its several, somewhat intertwined stories are more fleshed-out than the others; Curtis apparently combined two separate screenplays, one which focused on the prime minister and one which focused on a writer in France. Perhaps these would be good on their own, or even as a two-hander. The problem is that the script is overstuffed and sort of unsure of itself, slipping between subdued, pseudo 'kitchen sink' reality and stylised, 'every man's dream' fantasy. It's the sort of thing in which people propose almost before they've been properly introduced. It all comes together, aside from one story that's left hanging at an oddly downbeat point, in two or three (depending on how you count it) finales, each cheesier than the last. None of it feels like 'real' romance - though, Thompson and Rickman's relationship is rather grounded - and it all seems sort of manipulative. It's not cohesive, clumsily coming together to make for a turbulent time. It's not terrible, however, and there are a couple of laughs - Nighy is a real treat, for example. Still, the end result is sloppy, unrealistic and practically designed to make you go 'aww'. Instead, you kind of just want to go 'yuck'. 5/10"

","Some feel that this perennial favorite film, LOVE ACTUALLY, is a response to the global devastation and fear that the September 11, 2001 created - a deeply felt longing for a return to peace and for acknowledging love.

"snowfre","8","1","2","26 December 2019"," Somewhat messy but still successful in bringing Christmas joy
","In ""Love Actually"", Richard Curtis puts together a British all-star cast consisting of mastodont actors such as Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson, a young - still not zombie slaying - Andrew Lincoln, cameos of Rowan Atkinson, and American Laura Linney. Not to forget, one of the film's biggest highlights, Bill Nighy. How to summarize the plot of ""Love Actually""? It's about a million love stories leading up to Christmas in which they are dotted together through the characters' relationships to each other. On my opinion, no one does the predictable genre of romcoms as interesting and funny as the Brits, and this movie is basically an orgy of every single pastiche. But it also contains originality; when have you seen the love story of two naked doubles finding each other on set (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page)? And when was the last time a Portuguese father called his daughter ""Dunkin' Donuts 2003"" when leading Colin Firth to his much more beautiful daughter. Yes ""Love Actually"" is a tender, but extremely funny film. It is long but deservingly so. There are so much get out of this fantastic cast. These aspects overweights the predictable storylines, thus giving me no other option than rating this over the top Christmas-bonanza a solid plum pudding smelling 8.

","Review:
'Love Actually' is a Christmas-romantic-comedy film directed by Richard Curtis.
This is another film that has been a long time coming, when it comes to my first viewing. When the film first started, I was a bit nervous because it seemed very clustered trying to introduce all the characters in the story, but by the end I was thoroughly entertained.
The plot follows seemingly unrelated people as their lives begin to intertwine while they fall in - and out - of love. Affections languish and develop as Christmas draws near.
Everybody in this movie does a brilliant job. Some were more utilized then others given the amount of story telling this movie has, but my two favorite performances came from Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson. It may be do to the fact that they are fairly type-cast in todays world and being able to see them out of their element before they were stuck in it.
I like movies where characters are all connected in some way and we slowly find out how throughout the film. I think this movie pulls it off nicely and stories don't stop making sense. I do find however; some stories get lost while others are the main focus. Not every story is told equally, and this makes it hard to care about some of the characters.
Overall, aside from some of the characters getting a bit lost, the story about love is beautiful. It's funny, sad and heartfelt at the right times, and just the right amount of holiday cheer.

"eric262003","7","1","2","23 April 2018"," Not Enough Grant But Too Much Elevator Music
","Due to his stature as the icon for British culture, complete with with aristocratic accents, and an immaculate view of upper-class London, writer/director Richard Curtis truly has the substance factor in his favour. However in his holiday season themed film ""Love Actually"", he throws all that posh out the window in resorts to sentimental gush, saccharine music and indecorous humour. This is a far cry from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".<br/><br/>It's great that Curtis called up his partner in crime Hugh Grant to be one of the stars in ""Love Actually"", but he's been rendered down to a small supporting role and is lost in the crowd to the over-stacked ensemble cast. Grant plays the part of David, who's been a newly elected British Prime Minister, his comical moments truly usurps the other who's who in this ultra-British cast that includes Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman. In his witty and subtle demeanour, Grant has become a stapled icon in the romantic comedy genre and can generate a lot of humourous moments with his twitches and in this instant, the shake of his tush.<br/><br/>A character break into dance mode has become common in romantic comedies, but Grant conveys a new and eccentric twist to what is an awkward predicament. When he was dancing to The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump (For My Love)"" we can see how embarrassed he his doing it, but his sportsmanship is something we can applaud to. With all these intertwining subplots, the one that's barely given screen time involves around Prime Minister David as he's mitten over his ravishing assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). The chemistry between the sophisticated Prime Minister and the slightly lower class help is the one that sparked my interest the most. McCutcheon even adds an original twist to her character by breaking the cliche of the cute newly in love assistant by unceremoniously swearing at her superior.<br/><br/>The opening scenes centres around the week before the holiday season as the ever-present variation of a Mod rock song ""Love is All Around"" with a hint of holiday cheer is rubbed into our faces. Yes the British love their pop music and Curtis is not ashamed to exploit that to us. He did a similar thing in ""Four Wedding and Funeral"" with ""Bye Bye Baby"" by the Bay City Rollers. This eye-roller sets the tone of many absurd things to come.<br/><br/>With a myriad of romantic subplots, they could all stretch to half an hour segments before we see them one more time. Sadly, not all of them were not given enough time and could've easily been edited out. One example would be the body doubles John and Judy (Martin Freeman and Johanna Page) who are dating quietly while giving fake orgies on the movie sets. Or the story involving a hopeless romantic named Colin (Kris Marshall) who travels to America to use his British accent to woo hot women, which to me felt like an overlong coke commercial. Still most of the stories work due to the talent pool and the good vibes it brings to the story.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is wonderful as a widowed man named Daniel who's 11 year old stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) seeks his first crush, an American girl named Joanna (Olivia Olson). Sangster conveys a daring and dashing presence of energy in his character, but his drive feels too young and forced for his age. However, his comic skills when he meets his dreamboat for the first time is flawless.<br/><br/>Colin Firth plays a sympathetic note here as Jamie who after feeling betrayed by his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) hides out to his French cottage and gets love-struck by his Portuguese maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) though they can't speak each other's language, the magic comes from the fact that the language of love bears no boundaries. Moniz embodies a keen sense of intelligence and seductiveness to her character. <br/><br/>Both Moniz and McCutcheon are more interesting performers than the more established ones here. Emma Thompson's housewife Karen believes that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is secretly having an affair with his sultry receptionist, Mia (Heike Makatsch). Thompson and Rickman's talents are badly wasted here and their cliched ways proves the point here. The love between each other makes it hard to believe that Harry is a cheater and when Karen who was expecting an expensive necklace from Harry as a Christmas gift only to realize that the gift was not for her (her's was a Joni Mitchell CD) we get the music score running with Mitchell's weary version of ""Both Sides Now"". The song was nice I felt bad for Karen, but it still was drained out.<br/><br/>Laura Linney plays Sarah, who works at Harry's company and is attracted to her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), but the relationship is set back due to her mentally ill brother, Michael (Michael Fitzgerald). Sure Curtis like to include somber pieces to his agenda, but the thing that transpire in this subplot results in strange and jarring moments. <br/><br/>Bill Nighy has equal comical moments as Grant playing a has-been rock star knows his best years are behind him, but still has some optimism that his awful holiday song might be the keys to comeback and promotes this song at a gala event hosted by Sir Elton John. While he and his partner Joe (Gregor Fisher) spend the holidays inebriated and watching porn.<br/><br/>Yes the British strive to get a #1 single has been a tradition since the 1960's which has a community feeling in the UK than it does in America. Sure the cost of oneness is expensive, especially having to deal with saccharine music."

","What a charming movie this is. It's not perfect or anything, and probably gets a little too syrupy towards the end, but it's romantic, funny, and the star-studded cast is outstanding. Weaving through so many story lines could have left the viewer confused and unsatisfied with any of them, but director Richard Curtis pulls the right strings and keeps us entertained from beginning to end. There are just so many wonderful scenes and lines. Andrew Lincoln's card scene with Keira Knightley. Colin Firth watching Lúcia Moniz walk out of his life, and then later both of them learning each other's language. Thomas Sangster, the little boy, talking to Liam Neeson about the ""total agony of being in love"". Hugh Grant the Prime Minister going door to door to find the sweet and sometimes foul- mouthed Martine McCutcheon. And on and on.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with all those little moments we can identify with – secret longings, flirtation, and first kisses – but also those that are bittersweet, and those that disappoint us. The overall theme of the movie, that ""love actually is all around"", even though we often focus on the incidents of hate in the world, is inspiring. The shots in London are gorgeous, and the comic relief provided by the aging rocker Bill Nighy is funny. It is a feel- good movie and bound to be criticized, but it's OK to feel good once in awhile :), and this is certainly one of the better done romantic comedies."
"howard.schumann","9","1","2","4 June 2017"," Heartwarming and endearing
","Not being a huge fan of romantic comedies, I felt somewhat dubious about watching Love Actually, but I was enrolled almost immediately after the film began. With all the hatred going on in the world today, it was gratifying to see a film that is all about love - falling in love, being in love, and falling out of love. Written and directed by Richard Curtis, the film is not only about the ecstasy of young love but about love in all forms, between brothers and sisters, parents and children, and even best friends. Performed by a great ensemble cast that includes Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Marlene McCutcheon, and others, It is often silly and over-the-top but its British laid back humor keeps it from being sappy and the film has a freshness and vitality that makes you think (at least for a moment) about going out and seeking to find or renew the experience one more time.<br/><br/>Of course, Love Actually is primarily a comedy but it has enough moments of genuine heartfelt emotion in which tears are not inappropriate. The story takes place in the weeks before Christmas which is a season where love and peace are supposed to be more than just New Age clichés. While there are a lot of characters to keep track of, several relationships stand out. There's the love between the widowed Daniel (Neeson) and his 11-year-old stepson, Sam (Thomas Sangster) who provides advice to the boy who has ""fallen in love"" with a girl at school who does not even know that Sam is on the planet. We also look in on the life of Britain's new Prime Minister (Grant) who bears a strong resemblance to Tony Blair. Grant plays the PM in the suave sophisticated British manner of another Grant – Cary, as he pursues his secretary Natalie with some significant reservation.<br/><br/>In another, the PMs sister, Karen (Thompson) is afraid her husband Harry (Rickman) will leave her for an attractive coworker, Mia (Heike Makatsch). The office also knows that two of their coworkers, Sarah (Laura Linney) and Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) are in love but are too inhibited to let the other know. One of the best realized segments is about Billy Mack (Nighy), a washed-up rock singer who is trying to save his career by promoting what he acknowledges to be an awful pop-song remodeled for Christmas. Yes, there is more, perhaps too much more, but for me it was so heartwarming and endearing that it could have kept going until it covered all the romances in the world. Can I say that I loved it? Yes - actually."

","According to me this movie is a bit overrated. There are total 8 story lines, which are too many. Many of them seemed unnecessary, especially the Martin Freeman one. Laura Linney one is a bit illogical. The best story line is the Colin Firth one and that's what keeps the movie going. To sum it up , its an enjoyable movie"

","The movie is one of the films that makes you really happy.As the title suggests,the movie deals with lives of different people with different backgrounds who fall in love and shows the effect on their lives.The movie is crafted beautifully combining these lives together providing the viewers a happy time.Moreover this movie makes us smile throughout with the emotions that relates with love hence providing a soothing feeling.The script work is of high standards and the direction should also be appreciated.The movie cherishes and restricts it plot the happy side of love rather than going deep into the characters' lives.Eventually it turns out to be a calm and joyful movie that creates a happy impression to the viewers."

","In some respects, ""Love Actually"" is every bit the gift-wrapped box of sentiment you'd think just looking at the DVD cover. Some of this rings unbelievable, and I tend to be the person who finds that a turnoff. Maybe that's the cynicism talking. But there was a point when all the moving pieces clicked (right around when Colin Firth is bidding adieu to his Portuguese maid, and soon after, the Norah Jones song kicks in) and I really got sucked into the interwoven subplots . And it's not all love and treacle; there a sizable amount of heartache also built in. This is a hell of a cast (with Neeson, Firth, Rickman and Thompson as standouts) and if you're looking for a Christmas movie, short on commercialism and long on warmth, you really could do a lot worse than this.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Love Actually is an amazing romantic-comedy about all of the different aspects of love. It engages with unrequited love, lost love, parental love and family love. It does this through a number of different narratives and characters, which all, for the most part, work very well off each other. Mostly, none of these narratives are under or over- represented. This is partly due to the great ensemble cast consisting of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightly and Rowan Actkinson amongst many others.

"EvelynFilmFan","8","1","2","3 February 2016"," Love Actually is a must see in the Christmas period!
","Love Actually is very romantic, is set in London - one of my favourite cities - and is also very funny. Every character is in some way connected to each other and therefore I call it the British predecessor of the American Valentine's Day and the Dutch Alles is Liefde, but more successful. The film starts three weeks before Christmas and follows multiple characters in their search for love in the English capital London. <br/><br/>The director and writer of the film is Richard Curtis, who we know of other romantic films like About Time, Bridget Jones's Diary and Notting Hill. It won't be a big surprise that also Love Actually is a sappy romantic chick flick, that men probably want to skip. In the lead roles we see Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighly, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Martin Freeman and Chiwetel Ejiofor. A film with an amazing cast that outperform their American colleagues from the mediocre film Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>The characters are at some way all connected to each other and have their own love problems. Hugh Grant plays the most important character: the British Prime Minister, who fancies one of his employees. His sister Karen (Thompson) has problems in her marriage once she finds out her husband Harry (Rickman), has bought a necklace for someone else.. In the meantime she helps Daniel (Neeson), a father who has just lost his wife. His son Sam goes to the same school as Karen's children, and falls in love with an American girl. Colin Firth's character Jamie finds out his wife is cheating on him with his brother on the wedding day of his friends Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley). This leads him to France, where he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper. In the meantime Juliet finds out that her husband's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) has a huge crush on her. I can continue but it's way more fun and more clear when you find out yourself how everyone is connected!<br/><br/>Because of the connection between the different characters, the romantic, dramatic and more comic story lines are woven through the entire film. Therefore the film is not overly romantic nor dramatic. The film is perfectly in balance and there are more than one funny moments. Almost every character gets their happy ending, and therefore Love Actually is the ultimate feel good film. Every character is different, is in an other life phase and his its own problems. It's because of this better to empathize with the characters. Love Actually is also timeless, since Christmas is of all times and a lot of people are celebrating this event. <br/><br/>Like I mentioned before, the film starts three weeks before Christmas with a nice message from Grant's character: Love is all around. During this period the film works towards a moment when all the characters find their love and happiness. But before Christmas the adults still need to go to work, children have their school performances, Christmas parties are organized, presents are being bought, and there is a wedding. In the meantime singer Billy Mack (Bill Nighly) is working on a comeback by making a Christmas song. At the end of the film all seems to be well. However, the older couple has to work on their marriage but even that seems to end well. For variation, the film doesn't only take place in London. After Jamie (Colin Firth) learns about the infidelity of his wife, he leaves for his home in France to write a book. This is the place he falls in love which eventually takes him to Lisbon. Kris Marshalls character Colin goes even further, since he thinks America is the best place to find a woman. Despite of his buddy's doubts Colin leaves and eventually returns with two women!<br/><br/>Love Actually is the perfect film to end the month December and start a new year with lost of self-confidence. It's a very romantic Christmas film, but because of the many characters and story lines, the balance between romance, drama, comedy is perfect. The characters are at some way all connected to each other, but are all very different and in other life phases. This makes the film more interesting and you can emphasize better with characters. Craig Armstrong's score - and in particularly PM's Love Theme - is truly amazing and touches the very soul."

","This is the movie you could watch a thousand times and never get sick of. To follow all the characters on their life journey, in both happy sequences and sad moments, who are yet so realistic and so giving, just make you so interested in this film, that you will NOT for one second pause it, ""continue to watch it later"" or even consider to wander away in your own thoughts. The movie is exciting, funny, sad and every other feeling! Yes, it gives us viewers all of our emotions in a short period of time. Every actor play their characters to the fullest and give them so much meaning and personality, that we, as the viewers never want to stop following their lives. We laugh, we cry, we care, we want everyone to be happy and to succeed with all their missions. And when it's over, we realize that life is short and because of this movie, maybe we dare to take more risks. We should not wait for happiness, right? But is it really possible for a movie to be this powerful? To give us meaning? I can ensure you, it really can."

"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","1 January 2016"," Filled with Whimiscal Characters and Heartwarming Stories,
","Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. <br/><br/>Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bill Nighy"
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","1","2","15 December 2015"," Charming Christmas classic
","Who doesn't love Love Actually? I know I do. It's such a sentimental, goofy, overblown pile of mush and I love it even more for all those reasons. Not to sound sappy, but a lot of the situations and character interactions it entails are blunt, awkward truths made even more hilarious by an even more awkward cast, and encapsulate the true meaning of Christmas. Not all the couples work out, not all of the individual stories end well or in satisfaction for themselves or the audience. But you know what? That's life, and they make the best out of what they have at this special time of year, which is what it's really about. To balance it out, not all of them end like that; some turn out splendidly for the characters, leaving them beaming. Some learn tough lessons that are necessary for growth, some find love in storybook fashion and others are simply there for coming relief. And what comedy we get, tearful drama as well, delivered by an astoundingly massive cast of British legends, speckled by a few familiar Yankee faces as well. Liam Neeson plays a grieving father whose son (Thomas Bodie Sangster) is sick with love. Neeson's sister (Emma Watson, grounded, real, heartbreaking) deals with her irresponsible husband (Alan Rickman, incapable of a false note). The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant in flustered, fumbling glory) is attracted to his cute secretary (Martine Mcutcheon) and aloof writer Colin Firth feels pangs for his Portuguese housekeeper who speaks not a word of English. Laura Linney has a steamy office romance with Rodrigo Santoro whilst dealing with an ill sibling, Bill Nighy is hysterical as a cynical pop star learning what old age means, Keira Knightely, Chiwetel Efjor and Andrew Lincoln are involved in a subtle love triangle, and there's all kinds of interwoven people including Martin Freeman, Desmond Askew, Elisha Cuthbert, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory, Billy Bob Thornton as the sleazy US President and a priceless Rowan Atkinson as the world's weirdest jewelry salesman. It's a big old circus of Christmas spirit with all kinds of different motivations, desires and relationships, which reach a festive fever pitch of a finale as all the stories escalate into giddy yuletide melodrama and cathartic god times that are impossible to not smile at. An annual watch for me."

","Is it the Christmas season or just the lack of good TV program at that time of year that lowers all my criteria, I don't know. Usually I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. I never choose them when I go to cinema. But I saw this film at least three times on TV and it's a perfect film for a hot cacao and a blanket. I like the music in the film. It's nicely integrated to make an important part of the atmosphere. It's several stories interlinked among them with nicely made ties. Human relations, love and care are topics that are always actual and interesting. A since everybody loves and want to be loved, you find a piece of the movie that just touches you."

","This is a sweet exploration of different kinds of love. There are many kinds of cheating, father son love, family love, puppy love, old married love, rejected love etc, and for those who say it is lust I say no, that is just a part of love. We never think of it but the point of the movie is that love is everywhere in many forms. This movie is not a parody or a travesty with the emphasis on superficial relations. It is just a movie pointing out that we love all the time in many different ways and even if we do not see it love is all around us. This movie is brilliantly edited and acted. I don't think such a simple point could have been made in such a complicated movie by anyone else."

","Love Actually (2003): Dir: Richard Curtis / Cast: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley: Supposedly a portrait of love featuring husbands, wives, grandparents, children, and various friends and relatives embracing in love. That is a fine picture except that it regards broken relationships and a false sense of love within infidelity. So it isn't love actually. Yet the film works due to detailed characters and circumstances. Director Richard Curtis barely holds the dozen or so subplots together but they flow with great detail. Ensemble cast includes Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister of Britain who is overpowered with feelings towards his coffee steward. Liam Neeson plays a recent widow helping his son cope with love. Laura Linney plays a secretary trying to attract a co-worker but her cell phone is constantly ringing due to her brother being in an institution. Bill Nighy plays an ageing rock star who knows just how bad he is. Colin Firth plays a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid. Keira Knightley plays a newly wed who discovers that her husband's best man secretly had a crush on her. Great ensemble cast help keep the subplots interesting along with numerous superb locations that present different feeling. It doesn't always work due too delusional views of relationships that are the work of fiction if anything. Score: 8 / 10"

","I am usually not a sappy romantic movie sort of person, I like some Rom-coms but the comedic side has to be strong and the romance has to be realistic, not melodramatic. ""Love actually' fulfilled all the criteria for me, I like the fact that the ""love' portrayed in there covers all aspects of it, not just romantic love, but filial love, stale love, fake love, free love, love of fame, unconditional love, conditional love, unrequited love etc. They are not afraid to portray betrayal of love as well and the pain that comes along with it. <br/><br/>The casting for the movie is excellent and every single scene in there is enjoyable for me, I like the way they edited and piece together the movie in little vignettes form. It helps keep you hooked and focus. And of course, the script and humor in there for me is amazing! A couple of stories in there are over-the-top exaggerated, but thankfully, they have other good stories woven in there to help offset the 'roll your eyes' moments. But all good tongue-in-cheek fun I think. <br/><br/>All in all, a very well scripted, directed and acted movie.

","Now I am not a Rom com fan at all and I thought being made by my mum and younger sister to watch love actually was going to be awful. But to my surprise I came out of it absolutely loving it and thinking it was great. The story starts a month before Christmas and sees 8 different couples go through the journey that is love. Now with all the performers in the film they really share the lead and my goodness is this a legit cast. Big name actors such as Alan Richtman, Colin firth, Hugh Grant, Liam neeson, Bill nighy and Keira knightley are all in this film and they are all great. There isn't one bad performance in this film and that is mainly due to the high calibre of the performers in the film. Now as you can imagine with 8 stories going on the film can be a bit messy and this is true here with just way too many things to focus on and it does hurt the film. However, the majority of the stories are really thought provoking and really teach a lesson about love. The script is fantastic with the dialogue between hilarious and turning this film into mostly a comedy and making it one of the funnier films I have seen. The style is okay but sometimes London can become a bit cliché and overbearing and also this film seemed to have to connect everybody and it did make it a little hard to understand sometimes. I can't believe how good this film is and people who don't think they will like it please see it especially around Xmas time."

","Hip, honest and heartwarming British Christmas comedy about the love-lives of the Prime Minister (Grant), his sister (Thompson), her husband's (Rickman) employees (Linney and Santoro), and other romantic plots to intertwine this ensemble cast. Unfortunately, what starts out as a modestly brilliant dialogue-driven script slowly becomes a little more theatrical than necessary, and if the viewer chooses to be a Grinch and dissect the plot, they'll probably find one or two unnecessary stories—after all, a 136 minute rom-com is indeed pushing the limits. Still, the viewing experience is wonderful during the Holiday season, and the movie has great potential to be a Christmas classic. While Knightley and Lincoln's story is just downright rubbish, Nighy and Fisher's takes the cake! <br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","After watching love actually I have to say it was great. The characters all had their own individual struggles or love interests and it came together beautifully in the end. I would rank this among the best romantic comedies I have watched. The one deleted scene in which the young boy and his father listen to the song Joanna and the boy has the love movies on his wall would have been a good addition to the movie and should not have been deleted in my opinion. This scene not only showed the relationship between the father and son, it also showed the boys love interest and the mutual love for the mom. This movie showed that love can cross the barriers of language and regardless of the circumstances true love can find a way. There were many different stories which allowed the viewer to feel anger, happiness, joy, sadness, etc. Certain characters incorporated comedy into the movie which was a nice touch but the movie is not only about love in a relationship sense. Love is also shown between families and friends. Certain characters are very loyal to the ones they love, while others betray the trust of those which they love. This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and portrays the importance of love in our world as well as what relationships are most important."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","19 November 2014"," Finally conquered the juggernaut of modern day classics
","I can't even fathom the amount of times I've heard people rave about Love Actually. Its one of those movies that people say they watch every year and how much they love it. I even started watching it last Christmas and just didn't make it all the way through for one reason or another. Honestly, you really have to be in the right mood to watch the film because in many ways despite it following a very predictable recipe, it is a very uniquely styled film. Love Actually is very British starring a host of very famous British actors and being set in London with all the quirky dialogue you'd expect from a British film. Its a film with multiple stories all happening at once and intersecting in small ways which some people really like. I actually think the movie maybe overdoes it with the multiple story lines because as good as everyone is and each story has its own merits, some are lost and you're left feeling like some of the characters' issues are unresolved. Still, its a funny, quirky, emotional film with a ton of familiar faces and great characters. Love Actually is unapologetically a seasonal special for adults. Nudity, bad language, sex and mature themes abound in the film which is unusual for a ""Christmas"" movie but why not? Adults deserve a movie for them exclusively. Still a lot of the mature content is perhaps almost unnecessary.<br/><br/>Talking about a cast like this is really hard because it is the definition of an ensemble cast. Its a whose who of British actors with a few Americans thrown in there too. I will list some of the more significant characters and actors. Hugh Grant (watching this made me realize how much I enjoyed him when he was in his prime as a comedic actor), Emma Thompson (always amazing), Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy (small role but absolutely adore his insane character), Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page (though I could have done without their story entirely. Its unnecessarily adult and changes the tone of the movie.) Andrew Lincoln, Kiera Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor star in a sub-plot that I didn't particularly care for either. It could have not been there and made very little difference. Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rodrigo Santoro and Thomas Brodie-Sangster round out the main cast. I think I've really covered the main people that at least have significant screen time. As I pointed out I felt like a few of the stories took up more time than necessary and sort of cut into the stories that you really wanted to see more of like Liam Neeson's storyline with his step-son and Hugh Grant's story. Both of those (for instance) could have made their own film.<br/><br/>Its amazing that this was Richard Curtis' directorial debut and he wrote the film as well. I also have to mention that Curtis (who has only directed two other movies since this one) directed the AMAZING (one of the best films of last year) About Time. He knows a thing or two about evoking emotions and he uses this top notch cast extremely well. I do sort of get why people adore this movie so much. It has a lot of very memorable scenes and while it is based around Christmas, it doesn't shove the idea down your throat that its a ""Christmas"" movie. Its a subtle holiday film that deals with multiple versions of what ""love"" is. For the romantic in all of us, you'll definitely enjoy it. It didn't floor me, in fact considering its reputation I thought it could use a little fine tuning here and there. It felt sloppy at times. Still I enjoyed myself, had some fun, and I totally get why people rave about it. Maybe the expectations were set pretty high. Definitely check it out for something a little different this holiday season. This is technically my first Holiday film for 2014 and I love my Christmas movies!! 7.5/10"

There is also a great British cast list, including: Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister who falls in love with Martine McCutcheon's character who has just started working for him; Liam Neeson who, after losing his wife, helps his stepson to win the girl he loves; Colin Firth who, after finding out that his brother is sleeping with his wife, goes to France to write a book and falls in love with his housekeeper but there's a language barrier as she's from Portugal; Emma Thompson who has to stay strong even though her husband, played by Alan Rickman, is having an affair with one of his workers and Bill Nighy, who has just released a Christmas single based on Wet Wet Wet's song 'Love is All Around' replacing the word 'Love' with 'Christmas', and it's about him promoting his single but in the worst way possible. In my opinion, I loved each story, the actors were all brilliant, there were plenty of laughs throughout and I loved the random cameos from the likes of Ant & Dec and Rowan Atkinson. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that's a fan of romantic comedies and doesn't mind a bit of cheesiness."
"cleary-joshua","7","1","2","2 June 2014"," This is a courageous effort from Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off...
","Anthology films, or movies with a lot of different situations and characters, are very difficult to get right, because it is difficult to cram so much information into a 2 hour movie. You've got to make sure that everyone is given enough time to be a completed, three-dimensional character with no rushing, but also ensure that the film doesn't drag. ""Love Actually"" is a film made up of many different segments and characters, all of whom are interconnected in some ways. Some characters work really well, some don't work at all, and some are middle ground. It's a courageous effort from writer and director Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off.<br/><br/>The film follows 10 different sets of people who are romantically involved, or hoping to be, all in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The ensemble cast is enormous, including so many Great British actors like Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, and work together very well. It also contains Hugh Grant, who I have to confess is far more bearable in this film than anything I've ever seen him in before. Grant's Prime Minister is actually well managed, and his door-to-door search at the end is extremely enjoyable. Because the film does so much, I'll briefly talk about a few of the segments which I did really like.<br/><br/>The story between Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid is really great, giving Firth the opportunity to play his very amusing bumbling British gentleman again. Their chemistry is truly fantastic, and the final scene when he goes to propose to her in her home town is really funny, especially due to the language barrier. The relationship between Liam Neeson and his son, played by Thomas Sangster, is also extremely sweet and endearing.<br/><br/>On the flipside, one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories in the film is between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who begins an affair with his secretary. Thompson's character starts to suspect things, especially when Rickman buys an expensive gift which doesn't turn out to be for her. The gift is bought from Rowan Atkinson, who steals the entire movie with a brief yet hilarious performance. And when Thompson finally realises the gravity of his affair, she goes to her room and just cries, while Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" is playing in the background. The emotion Thompson shows here is so raw and genuine, and it's a credit to the film and to Curtis that so many different emotions can be squeezed into 2 hours.<br/><br/>Not all of the film works, and Kris Marshall and Martin Freeman's respective segments are a bit crude and gratuitous, adding little to the overall humour of the film. Bill Nighy's ageing rock- star is also quite dislikable, and spends far too much time on screen. It's not a work of genius, but it is fun and incredibly sweet, and to be honest I rather enjoyed it. It's also very Christmassy, and the perfect thing to get you in the festive mood (when that eventually rolls around again)."
"BayouGrl","9","1","2","9 May 2014"," One of my favorites
","I watched this once on DVD and later bought my own copy because I liked it so much. I love that there are so many different relationships in the film with so many people interconnected. There are relationships you can relate to, ones you can't understand and others that make you cry. The movie explores all facets of love, physical, emotional, unrequited love, unending love, young love, forbidden love, etc. etc. Set around a background of Christmas, and some might call it a holiday movie, but I find it something to watch any time of year. It does have a R rating because of language and nudity, it does have a massive star filled cast. It is not a romantic movie, nor is it even close to reality. It is a Hollywood, over the top, almost everyone gets their happily-ever-after production. But for a small period of time, I can sit back, watch people blunder around like we do in real life, and then without all the normal life stuff that gets in your way, live happily ever after(mostly.) And since I like the ability to escape every now and then, this fits the bill."
"willcundallreview","8","1","2","24 February 2014"," A Romcom perfected
","Love Actually is just about an excellent Romcom which balances that Romance and Comedy perfectly to be one of the highest rated ever. A great film with some great actors and cameos with a great writer ,director and story which well just goes together perfectly. In my review I'll tell you why overall I found this to be a great piece of cinema and why you should watch it too if you haven't.<br/><br/>The story is intertwined and lot's of things go on at once, this makes for one interesting piece which I am sure you find delightful and heart warming at the same time. It is more romantic than funny but the humour flows at times and you can feel yourself laughing a lot and then feeling sorry for someone because there sad too, it has it's moments. Another thing with the story is that the intertwining doesn't confuse you and the characters always know each other but not too much to bother them in there side of the love mega triangle.<br/><br/>I loved the acting of the various actors on show with such people as Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman among the fantastic people on show. Liam Neeson I think stays with you with an emotionless performance that suddenly becomes emotional because of his son's problems in the story and your heart strings are pulled by the end in part well, you will see or know what I mean with Neeson's sweet little son. A great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as the jewellery store owner is one of the funniest bits of the film and annoys Alan Rickman so well, it great.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis who directs and writes this is just superb and one the best ever with Romantic Comedies. His idea is brilliant and comes to life not just with the great acting but also his great script and I feel he deserves even more acclaim for his work than he already does so. The script is gold and ever so smartly done by Curtis and Curtis is just the mastermind of the entire project as a whole.<br/><br/>The film is not without slight criticisms and I guess it is in the sense that it is not laugh out loud funny and sometimes the laughter can be cut short by an emotional scene which doesn't quite work so well in parts. Although the film hardly suffers from these tiny things and all together it is just Great so not much to write here in a critical sense of the film.<br/><br/>I think people who like RomComs should love this film as it isn't poor in that area although people looking for hilarious jokes are going to bore themselves here. The story is soppy and for those who hate loved up feel good films then please don't watch this or you will hate it, because that is the entire film in a nutshell. All kind of people should like it but some won't, it just what happens with film, not every film can pleasure everyone.<br/><br/>Overall it is great, it is only just there and just about steers clear of just being a very good movie. If you dislike it I would think it would still be an OK film so it worth a watch of course, sit back and if you have a lover then this is perfect for you because if anything it can make you near fall more in love than you were before."
"shaifalihere","8","1","2","5 January 2014"," The movie makes you feel all cosy and cuddly from the inside. Love Actually is one movie you'll actually love!
","With charming cast, beautiful selection of songs, sweet romantic stories of five couples, perfect background scenery, the movie makes you feel like any romantic movie is supposed to make you feel- cosy and cuddly from the inside. It's a story about different kinds of love, and how the lives of ten people move forward because of the spirit of Christmas, for it is the time to be with the people you love. <br/><br/>It is a fun, cute and emotional movie. Love Actually (2003), directed and written by Richard Curtis, has a mix of feelings at places unexpected and all sorts of love explored. Love of companionship of a famous singer for his chubby manager, a craze of American girls for boys with an English accent, unrequited love for one's best friends' wife, agony of innocent love of a six or seven year old for his classmate, love of a caring sister for his unwell brother, the love between two people who do not understand each other's language, the movie is a great watch at Christmas time, or otherwise!<br/><br/>The movie has a lot going on from the moment it begins, but manages to give time to and capture each story without making it seem hurried or cluttered, like New Year's Eve (2011) with a similar plot by Garry Marshall.<br/><br/>Soothing and at the right pace, the background music keeps the romance, tension, urgency, love or fun alive at appropriate moments. Olivia Olson's ""All I want For Christmas is You"", ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys at the very end, and ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell are a few of the many perfectly-suited-to-the-scene songs in the movie. Also, when The Silent Night plays in the background, the movie reaches an epiphany, heartening moment. Another movie with an absolutely amazing playlist selection is Morning Glory. <br/><br/>Any and every scene is no less than a picture-postcard picture. Beautiful scenery, Christmas décor and celebrations and the royal houses, etc would remind you of the picturesque scenes of Serendipity.<br/><br/>One of the airport scenes at almost the end reminds me of the ending of Chalte Chalte, though there are more than a dozen movies with a cliché-d airport ending. But not to spoil it for you, this one is much different, and definitely better and comic, at the very least. <br/><br/>The cast selection is profound. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, the couple who reminds everyone of the most romantic and girly movies of all times, based on Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary raises the expectations from them even higher. Keira Knightley portrays beautifully a character of a girl unaware of her husband's best friend's love for her. Emma Thompson comes across as a very believable character and Rowan Atkinson as Rufus, is remembered despite just his two, but very important to the plot, scenes. Thomas Sangster as a small kid of just 6 or 7 years old plays the character beautifully and stays in our hearts. <br/><br/>This one, in high resolutions, is definitely worth occupying a large chunk of your hard drive."
"marilyncarnahan","9","1","2","31 December 2013"," A Movie With a Big Emotional Heart
","I loved this movie. My favorite couple was Jamie(a writer) and Aurelia (his Portuguese housekeeper). These two are just so darned cute, and it doesn't hurt that I am a HUGE Colin Firth fan. I also loved David (Hugh Grant), England's newly elected Prime Minister, who finds himself attracted to his catering manager. Add the story of married couple Harry and Karen, played by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson (Could these two ever give a bad performance?) <br/><br/>Then there were some story lines I just didn't like. The ""boy with a crush on a girl who doesn't know he exists"" is too cliché, and a horny guy who travels to Wisconsin to meet girls because he is convinced they will fall for his British accent is just silly. The story of Sarah and Karl had potential, but I disagree with her choice not to pursue the romantic love she deserves. While some might see this as a deep, sacrificial love, it left me feeling sad. <br/><br/>Overall, Love Actually is easily one of my favorite films. It was released in 2003, a time when many people, particularly Americans, needed a feel-good movie to make us believe once again in the power of love. Love Actually delivered."
"iamyuno2","8","1","2","28 December 2013"," Delightful Holiday Film - If You Suspend Your Disbelief (And Please Try)
","Touching, moving and yet a movie that leaves you feeling good - even if you shed a tear in the process. Yes, it's imperfect but it's so good in its better aspects that it's easy to sit back and just enjoy this good-time holiday pic. And helping us forget the few corny moments of the film are the many wonderful vignettes put in by a wide variety of fine actors. Also making this an 8-star movie are the touches of real life that ring true on a deeper level and speak to serious issues we all have to deal with - all the while providing comic relief in most cases (not all). I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant but he provides some wonderful comic moments here, as the British Prime Minister - including a somewhat Scrooge-like transformation that warms your heart near the end of this film. Bill Nighy is brilliant - and if you're not aware of his work, you will admire him after seeing this film. But perhaps Emma Thompson is the one who most gives this movie its greatest depth. It is her role that demanded the most acting skills and she rises to the challenge - as she always does. What a great actress - and even in this light comedy she impresses. There are aspects of the ending that are cliché and could have been better but slog through the final concert scene and the airport scene because the final video statement will really get you, summing up all the disparate stories in one neat heart-warming visual commentary. You'll need a handkerchief - even though it's mostly laughs you'll enjoy. Because Love Actually does have its ""aw!"" moments."

"mberker4-382-984374","8","1","2","17 December 2013"," one of the best British rom coms/Christmas movies of the last 15-20 years
","The two best things about the movie is that A) it is set in one of my favourite cities London (which is always a nice city for filming these type of movies) and B) the ensemble cast. When a movie has a large cast of well known actors/actresses it can be a hit or a miss, but in my opinion we have a hit here. i like the opening scene the scene where kiera knightley opens the door and sees her friend declare his love for her in a quite romantic way. Also the scene where Colin Firth goes and gets his Portugese friend and declares his love with a broken Portuguese is also nice. Furthermore one has to mention the great Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr Bean, blackadder) in one of his funniest scenes to date (won't spoil it to people who have not watched the movie) even thought the movie is a decade old it is one of those movies that a person can watch once or twice every winter. Thanks for the movie ."
"Mckenzie_Voice","10","1","2","14 December 2013"," Wonderful film, very British but the comedy is universal.
","First of all this film has to be one of the best feel good movies ever in my opinion. All of the characters are realistic enough to be believable. You will find all of these characters or a double of them in UK. The comedy does not flow all the way through continuously and there are scenes of deep realistic and sad scenes. All of the scenes flow well into one another which is difficult when you are dealing with many characters and in many different locations. They couldn't have put the scenes in a better line-up and all the actors were well chosen for each role. The Christmas Office party, the unrequited love, the office vamp, the infidelity, the love, the childhood crush, many of the things that bring this film together. A true masterpiece, unlike Valentine's Day, which seemed to be an American stab at trying to make a US version of Love Actually that didn't quite hit the mark. That's because you need some British actors to play all the American parts, that way you get the humor and the accent.<br/><br/>It is always hard to mold many pieces of film footage together to get a marvel like this film but the beginning and the end which I believe was filmed in the arrivals lounge in Heathrow epitomizes the act of Love, Love of a lover, love of a husband, a wife, love of a son and daughter, grandparents, friends, love actually live and real and not at all faked.<br/><br/>The film will make your Christmas feel more special, make you feel more love in yourself and the world. We are all of the human race and love is a difficult and sometimes heart wrenching business but we all have the capacity to love and although the film is a comedy with tinges of sadness, I hope people who watch this film realize, ""Love is all around"". I am not usually like this about films with love in them, so I will now retreat to a quiet place and find myself a big bucket. But you guys feel free to love this film!"

This film has made me cry hundreds of times now, and I've only seen it about 2 dozen or so times, and I plan to watch a hundred times more. This is real life love. It's unexpected, hard, innocent... I strongly recommend watching this film when feeling happy, feeling low, feeling desperate and feeling alone, overcrowded, sinking and exhausted, joyous, merry and ... actually, whenever. I like movies that seem so effortless and natural, and this is it.The cast is brilliant and the story is great. I don't think you won't be able to connect to it because it is relatable as hell.

"allison-lillquist","9","1","2","5 December 2013"," Love Actually Film Review
","Love Actually is a romantic comedy that follows the lives of many different couples. Some of the characters are young, some are old, some are falling in love and others are falling out of love. The film is set almost entirely in London, England during the five crazy weeks before Christmas. The characters of the film are played by many prominent actors and actresses, which include Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Martin Freeman, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thorton and Laura Linney. These actors portray the roles of friends, family and strangers who either are falling in love or out of love, mourning a lost loved one, realizing they aren't with the right person or finding just what they were looking for.<br/><br/>The movie starts off 5 weeks before Christmas and introduces all of the characters. We see how each character lives their life in London and what their personalities are like. The main character is the new Prime Minister David who quickly begins to have feelings for his new personal assistant Natalie. David's older sister is Karen who is married to Harry and begins to realize that he smitten by his secretary, Mia, who is always flirting with him. Harry's best editor is Sarah, who has a brother that is mentally ill. She is in love with her co-worker Karl and he feels the same way about her as well. Karen is friends with both Daniel and Jamie. Daniel has just lost his wife and has discovered that his stepson is in love with a young American girl. Jamie has just found out that his girlfriend has been cheating on him with his younger brother and decides to move to France to continue writing his novel. While there he starts falling for Aurelia who is a Portuguese woman who can speak neither English nor French. Juliet has just married Peter, but soon learns that his best friend Mark has been in love with her ever since they first met. John and Judy quickly fall for each other while on set of an erotic film. There is also Colin who figures out that in order to find someone that likes him or have sex with him he needs to go to America, specifically Wisconsin. Lastly you have Billy Mack who is a burned out rock star who is climbing back up the charts with a new Christmas rendition of his old song ""Love is All Around"", which in the end relates the characters all together. The movie follows each person and couple and shows how their lives change by Christmas time.<br/><br/>Two aspects of the film that stood out to me were the editing and background music. The editing was a great part of the movie because you learn about each and every character and are submerged into their love lives. You get to see how people are related or how they know each other. There is so much going on in everyone's lives so you would think that would be hard to film but the way the movie is edited makes it easy to understand what is happening in everyone's life and who they are connected to. In movies we usually see and follow one love story, which can some times get boring, but the film keeps us on our toes and makes us want to keep watching to find out what is going to happen with each person and their situation. <br/><br/>Another aspect is the music of the film. The main song is ""Christmas is all Around"", which is played throughout the film and sets the scene for the movie, making us think of love and Christmas. The song was originally ""Love is all Around"" but was changed for the holiday season. The song is played throughout the entire movie and leads up to Christmas, where we see how their lives and relationships played out. This song is a main theme in the movie saying that not only is Christmas all around but love is as well. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film. Love Actually is one of my favorite films to watch during the holiday season. It is great to see that there are so many great actors and actresses in the film. It's always nice to see a big named cast, who in the end work great together and make a great movie. I think this is a great film for anyone who loves the holidays and Christmas. It makes me excited for the about spending time with friends and family. Also, I think this film is great for anyone who really enjoys romantic comedies. This film shows a lot of romance but not too much and there is just enough comedy to make it a good film to laugh at. The film gives us a message by saying that everyone has someone who cares for them and that it doesn't matter how old or young you are. In the end love is actually all around us, we just need to find it."

My favorite scene is the scene that Sarah is pleased with. I thought that time when Sarah sent Carl of the unrequited love partner to the room was very pretty.

"elspeth-11","Null","1","2","17 August 2011"," Love it but it could have been better
","I first saw this in the theatre, and loved it. Then I watched it at home and watched all the extra features. This is when I started to realize all the places it could have been made better.<br/><br/>There are several story lines that could have been dropped and several expanded with the deleted scenes, but I won't go into that here.<br/><br/>But the particular sequence that I thought could have been better was when Emma Thompson is called to the school because of her son's story about - flatulence! It was very funny, but could have been so much better. Instead of going along with the principal, she should have burst out laughing and pretended to be hugely relieved that she had been called in to admire his work instead of to censure him. Then she should have openly taken him out to lunch to reward him.<br/><br/>Then there is the Colin Firth segment - also very enjoyable. But how much better it might have been if the homely overweight sister had been his housekeeper, with whom he fell in love. And the scene where he meets the wrong sister (now played by the gorgeous actress) would be played exactly the same way - with him recoiling in horror. This would make love really blind, and take the sting out of the fat jokes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's one of my favourite holiday classics."
"neenahhh","9","1","2","12 January 2011"," Love is all around us
","A romance movie that wasn't about a love story, but about the wonderful gift of love itself.<br/><br/>I wanted to download this movie some time when I was planning to watch Black Swan (December 28, 2010). I thought this would be a nice and heartwarming film like When Harry Met Sally, but it wasn't. It reminded me of that 2010 movie, Valentine's Day. In fact, I downloaded VD just to compare what was better.<br/><br/>There were a number of crude scenes that I wasn't really expecting to see. John and Judy's ""sex"" scenes were very.. Mhmm. Turns out they were both actors who did naughty movies or something of the like.<br/><br/>My favorites were Jamie & Aurélia (a writer and his Portuguese maid) and Sam & Joanna (young children).<br/><br/>When it was still in the middle of the movie, I found that I wasn't particularly interested in any of the relationships except for Juliet & Peter (newlyweds) and Mark (Peter's best friend). I was wishing that they'd have included at least ONE homosexual couple in the movie, but ha. As if. I was wishing that Mark would be secretly in love with Peter, but.. Yeah, right. Turns out Mark was in love with Juliet, even though he's never talked to her before. :| Very unrealistic, if you ask me. I must admit that their ending scene (Mark with the cards), was very sweet, though. :D While watching Sam finding Joanna in the airport, I felt all kinds of chills. That was the moment where we see everyone being interconnected. When Daniel (Sam's stepfather) tells Sam to run, we see the mysterious jewelry salesman (who was introduced during Harry's- I couldn't see him as anyone other than Professor Snape, by the way- scene of buying an expensive necklace) kind of ""distract"" the airport employee. It made me smile. Rowan Atkinson (I couldn't see him as anything other than Mr. Bean) reminded me of an angel. After Sam runs through more obstacles (outrunning guards, for example), he stumbles upon another conflict; 3 staff employees guarding the entrance gate. Then Billy Mack (rock singer) comes up and catches everyone's attention. That is when Sam managed to run past, undetected. Very sweet.<br/><br/>My favorite scene, however was Jamie & Aurélia's. We saw Jamie take Portuguese language classes. It was obvious he was trying to learn the language so that he could talk to Aurélia. When he reaches the restaurant where Aurélia works, he makes a big speech in her language, with many errors. In the end, he asks Aurélia to marry him. I was surprised by her answer. ""Yes is being my answer. Easy question."" It hit me. She tried learning his language, too! I felt so heart-warmed by that. :) Probably why they were my favorite couple in the movie.<br/><br/>The last scene- where we see everyone again- was nice. It put closure in everyone's love story. Billy & Joe's friendship was nice. I even thought they'd be the unexpected twist in the end, where Billy was gay for his manager. But, of course that wouldn't happen. Juliet & Peter are happily married, with Mark being the supportive best friend. Jamie & Aurélia are still together. We also see that Aurélia's grammar has improved significantly. Harry comes back and there are no hard feelings between him and Karen. Or are they just being civil? I can't tell. Joanna comes back and Sam's there to greet her, with his stepfather, Daniel- who's there with another single parent he met, Carol- is also there with him. John & Judy are getting engaged. Colin comes back from America with a beautiful girlfriend, who brought her sister for Tony. David comes back from a trip and Natalie greets him with a kiss.<br/><br/>Yes. Too many relationships. I know. I even got confused myself! That's the biggest problem, in my opinion. That's why I gave this movie a low rating. However, I don't think this movie should really be analyzed. People should just look at the big picture- the message that the movie is sending.<br/><br/>""Love is everywhere. Often, it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge. They were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaking feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" That's it. Love is all around. We all know that, but we don't particularly remember it. That's why this movie is here. It's to remind us of that fact that most of us take for granted or hardly even notice. Love is all around us. I did like that song, by the way."
"jhsteel","6","1","2","29 December 2010"," Stand out moments make this worth revisiting
","I like aspects of this film very much. Every Christmas, I watch this because my sister loves it and she wants me to watch it with her. Sometimes I think ""oh no, not again"" but then I remember the brilliant moments in the various sub-plots that make this a memorable film worth seeing again. For my taste, there is too much unnecessary bad language, and sexual references directed at children, which seems inappropriate to me even if it's a mature treatment of the subject. But I can usually forgive these lapses. It's well-acted and the performances that stand out for me are Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. All are doing what they do best, playing English people struggling with their emotions.<br/><br/>It is a very British film and the reason why it may not have done so well in the US may not just be down to the PM's speech (referred to in earlier comments). There are a lot of subtle and not-so subtle jokes, and overall, it's a feel-good movie with some realism thrown in.<br/><br/>I have read the other reviews on this site and it's interesting to see how polarised the opinions are. I'm tending to agree more with the negative comments and I think the problem with the film is that it's very unrealistic, and simplistic, and there are too many stories covered in a superficial way. Romantics might love it, but anyone who has a strong cringe reflex will probably dislike it. My previous comments still stand, but I'm not a big fan of it. I also think it does a dis-service to the image of Britain and the jokes are on the whole not very funny, unfortunately."

","I watched this movie on a Sunday afternoon and I can say it was an enjoyable watch. Not the perfect movie I was told about, but I think it serves for it's main purpose: entertain and leave a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Most stories are meant for lovers but I liked the way some other kind of love is displayed. The step father-son relationship, the ill brother- sister relationship, the manager-artist relationship, and my favorite, the impossible love situation.<br/><br/>There's plenty of humor, excellent settings (the French village was my favorite), nice soundtrack, acting, and a dynamic direction. This is what an all cast film should be made. Dynamic.<br/><br/>The scenes I will always remember about this movie include Keira Knightley's character getting a ""Bob Dylan"" style love declaration, the final airport sequence, the sexy assistant and her sexual offerings to her boss, the whole Portuguese maid situation (loved her!), and the mad rocker's final speech towards his manager.<br/><br/>Some things I didn't like about this movie: The way American girls are displayed. According to the movie, American girls are easy, trampy, stupid, party all the time, and fall easily for English men. Hey, and I'm not American! The way the Director tries to make politics ""fit"" in the plot. Was not necessary to send a political message.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is an enjoyable watch for those who are in love or for those who like these kind of stories."

When I first found out how this film is going to be about 8 different couples I thought it was going to be a long movie, but it only show short segments of each and gets straight to the point on most parts. The ensemble case is mainly British actors and actresses and they all work pretty well. And the lives of the characters are all in good taste although most of it is more feminine ideals of romance, but I guess that is okay because of the flurry of very unrealistic romance movies out there.

"a_flynn78","5","1","2","10 January 2010"," A few too many story lines perhaps?
","Recently I've been watching a lot of movies, happily sitting through them, and then at the end, well i realise that they weren't that good. Maybe the fact i didn't mind watching them is a better reflection on the movie then picking it to pieces but i think the second analysis is still valid. <br/><br/>The first thing i thought was wrong with the movie is that after a 2hour 10minute movie the only characters who i can seriously say i knew anything about were Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, which i will say now was the highlight of the movie, very well executed. However you could probably remove some of the other characters that have so little air time it might as well be given to some other characters. Bill Nighy has to go, i love him as an actor but not only did they almost ruin my perception of him by portraying him as a potty mouth rock star, with no form of disguise to make it seem like it wasn't Bill Nighy, but i didn't feel like i knew him at all. The whole point of his presence in the movie was to make it seem like he was abusing his manager too much, which i thought wasn't very subtle at all and i couldn't grasp much else from his 10 minutes of on screen time. <br/><br/>I thought the porn stars were an interesting couple but weren't given enough airtime, so give them somebody else's. Keira Knightley and her husband had promise but were given little airtime to make me think they were a worthwhile inclusion in the movie. One of the better points of the movie i thought was when the best man was in love with Keira Knightley but chose to back off completely because his best friend was married to her, and then they ruined it by making him inappropriately approach her and make her laugh at all his ridiculously stupid joke palm cards. <br/><br/>Just too many characters, i didn't feel the plight of any of them, some of them should have stayed in the editing room, thats for you to decide. <br/><br/>Im not writing this to encourage you to see the movie because obviously either you've already seen it or I've just completely ruined it for you, but id just like to see whether anybody else felt the same way about the movie as i did."

","In a collection of different love stories in Britain the Prime Minister (Grant) falls in love, a young boy falls in love with a singer and an office worker chooses his colleague over his wife for Christmas.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis' directional debut brings about his familiar agenda of love and lust and everything relating to the emotion and with an array of renowned names and faces from Britain this was a guaranteed smash at the right time in 2003.<br/><br/>Curtis' collection of writing credits has spurned many films and honours in the 20th century with enjoyable romantic comedies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Then after a successful Bridget Jones' Diary adaptation came this, the Christmas extravaganza of 2003, packed with more stars than you can count and whilst the records may say differently, this is a pretty standard flick.<br/><br/>Defining the genre of romance is relatively easy. Guy likes girl, girl likes guy, someone has an affair, a kid complicates life etc the formula is generically familiar and Curtis takes the conventional format and attempts bravely but foolishly to mix all the formats with all the celebrities into one film, and this sends the film in a downward spiral.<br/><br/>One example is the Prime Minister's sister is having trouble with her husband who is contemplating sleeping with his work colleague who ends up telling the Prime Minister where the love of his life is, next door. Everyone at the airport feels too good to be true. All in all, wrapping everything up in a tight package does not give any sense of realism to proceedings, and neither does the gut wrenching scripting.<br/><br/>A perfect example is Colin Firth's story where he speaks perfect English but his assistant only speaks Portuguese and yet when he says one thing and her subtitles are exactly the same. Funny? Not really when you know the inevitable outcome and wish they would just get it over with. This film will test the patience of it's viewer thanks to similar agendas and messages with its multiple stories.<br/><br/>One scene in the airport where Liam Neeson's son Thomas Sangster dives past professional bodyguard's in an attempt to tell a girl he has never spoken to that he loves her. This will either make you laugh at the silliness or turn away and pretend to be somewhere else. I'm all for romantic gestures but this is no ending to 'When Harry met Sally'; this is a completely exaggerated fantastical depiction of love.<br/><br/>There are the odd moments of comedy that work regardless. Kris Marshall's sex generator is amusing and the scene in America is a standout and Bill Nighy is easily the best out of the bunch with a stereotypical rock star.<br/><br/>If its Christmas this is a bit of fun but ultimately the romantic stories are too unrealistic in the sense of being too picture perfect and the sleazy standard multi narrative never lets up with too many characters with too much personal agendas to concentrate on."

","The sheer number of ""best-movie-ever"" and ""total-crap"" comments left me somewhat surprised, as I never imagined this movie to be polarizing. Myself, I find it to be an extremely charming romantic comedy with a fair amount of flaws, which did not destroy my viewing (and, dare i say, re-viewing) experience. I believe the mistake made my most people who hated the movie was thinking it's a movie about Love or Relationships, while it's clearly not. It's about Falling in love, Dreaming of love, Imagining love. And it does a pretty good job at it. I mean, comments like ""he hardly knows her"", ""it won't work"" completely miss the point: it's not about whether it'll work or not, it's just th falling-in-love part - although I could do without the wedding scenes in the end. The sexism criticism is way exaggerated: the movie IS about superficiality, and the powerful man - hot young woman pattern is the most common one, and one based on superficiality. The movie doesn't glorify it, it just uses it (eg. in the Alan Rickman - Emma Thompson story). The Hugh Grant story, however, really bombed. Grant is terribly cast, the Britain-America thing is awfully cheesy, and it goes too far to convince us it's a great thing that a Prime Minister's first priority is falling in love with his assistant. It totally lacks the simplicity and charming everyday-quality the other stories have. Btw, the Claudia schiffer thing: it's a joke, people! It's not insinuated that you should treat grief with dating a supermodel. Geez... Clearly not the best joke in the movie, but relax... And enjoy."

","Love Actually is an out-and-out feel-good movie. It does not try to portray highly believable characters or an intense storyline.....however, it delineates the lives of people from various walks of life searching for love in their own ways, in a sweet, light-hearted and I must say,very enjoyable manner. The opening credits featuring Billy Mack's Christmas song sets the tone for the film.......sweet and funny. And throughout, it never loses that touch.......often producing surprisingly touching moments like the scene where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) expresses his love for Juliet (Keira Knightley) or when Billy Mack acknowledges his feeling for his 'chubby' manager. If you are in a mood for a light-hearted, funny, sweet and romantic musical, in my opinion, not many films can get better. I would not like to speak about the blemishes, because in the end, I believe these kind of movies want you to come out with a good feeling inside you, which this film accomplishes gracefully. Maybe I would never want to watch the entire movie again, but the first time watch was certainly charming and enjoyable."

","After watching love actually I have to say it was great. The characters all had their own individual struggles or love interests and it came together beautifully in the end. I would rank this among the best romantic comedies I have watched. The one deleted scene in which the young boy and his father listen to the song Joanna and the boy has the love movies on his wall would have been a good addition to the movie and should not have been deleted in my opinion. This scene not only showed the relationship between the father and son, it also showed the boys love interest and the mutual love for the mom. This movie showed that love can cross the barriers of language and regardless of the circumstances true love can find a way. There were many different stories which allowed the viewer to feel anger, happiness, joy, sadness, etc. Certain characters incorporated comedy into the movie which was a nice touch but the movie is not only about love in a relationship sense. Love is also shown between families and friends. Certain characters are very loyal to the ones they love, while others betray the trust of those which they love. This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and portrays the importance of love in our world as well as what relationships are most important."

"johnleemk","7","1","2","27 December 2007"," A Dickensian Love Fairy Tale
","Love Actually is one of the most mawkish, treacly, sugary romantic comedies out there - as has been noted, there are a tonne of different plots, so you have basically eight times the amount of upbeat treacle you would normally get. The movie tosses an incredible ensemble cast in your face, flaunting well-known celebrities in almost unremarkable cameos. Yet, incredibly, the movie works - it makes you feel good about yourself and about love.<br/><br/>The critics can say what they will, but Love Actually actually defies all these things working against it, and for inexplicable reasons, tells eight uplifting love stories. It would be difficult for someone not to be touched by at least one of them, seeing as how the movie takes pains to cover almost every type of love imaginable, from romantic to platonic.<br/><br/>The important thing to bear in mind is that you can't take the movie too seriously. Most romantic comedies flirt with the barrier between reality and fantasy, but by the end of Love Actually, it's pretty unquestionable that this is a modern day fairy tale - it's not just implausible, it's impossible.<br/><br/>Love Actually reminds me of something Dickens would write, because it adheres to Dickens' style. The denouement of the movie ties together all the subplots, bringing the characters together at the airport - a definite Dickensian move.<br/><br/>Dickens dealt with mawkish fairy tales, and he has found popular acclaim, both among the masses and among the critics. If the critics would let their guard down and accept Love Actually as a fairy tale, I think they'd find it's a very Dickensian story at heart.<br/><br/>If you loved reading Charles Dickens's improbable stories, and didn't mind the exciting but improbable happy endings he almost inevitably produced, you will like Love Actually."

","There's a good movie in here somewhere. A few story lines, given more screen time and development, could have made for a very entertaining Christmastime romantic comedy. Unfortunately, the glut of story lines and overstuffed cast ultimately hurt the film. No story is given enough time to make us really care too much about any characters, and several feel like they were completely superfluous and unnecessary. The Brit who went to Wisconsin, the porn stand-in couple, Laura Linney and her co-worker, Colin Firth's story... these were all completely pointless. Keira Knightley's storyline probably had the least screen time of all, to the point where when they showed up on screen near the end, both Kathy and I looked at each other and said, ""I'd forgotten about this whole story!"" While Keira's jaw and gritted-teeth smile annoy the hell out of me (and her stick-figure doesn't help), this is one of the stories that had potential, but failed to deliver due to it brevity.<br/><br/>Several of the characters, therefore, were also unnecessary, especially the pointless cameos. Rowan Atkinson, featured on the poster but barely in the film, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, 24's Elisha Cuthbert... and I don't buy Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President for one second. The best actor of the movie was probably the kid who played Liam Neeson's son.<br/><br/>So basically it's disappointment. A great cast list, but by trying to squeeze so many people in, they've actually hurt what the film could have been. It was amusing at times, but nothing more."

Somehow, it manages to overkill with the cutesy humor and the sappy plot lines about relationships.

The story line involving her,Hugh Grant and a Clintonesque US president(whatever his other faults,G.W.Bush couldn't be said to be a ladies man) is absolutely ludicrous,and Grant's speech at the Press Conference is nearly as nauseating as his ""amusing"" best man's speech in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". The use of the music couldn't be more blatantly manipulative and unsubtle.If someone had appeared on the screen with a card marked ""Cry now"" I wouldn't have been surprised.Only Miss Emma Thompson as a betrayed wife is the least bit believable,a vein of gold amongst the dross. Mr Neeson,as the stepfather to a precocious bad-mannered little curly top,looks as though he has remembered a subsequent,rather more important engagement and is just looking for an excuse to slip away. That rather anonymous chap from ""The Office"" is,er,rather anonymous in a particularly silly episode about two porn movie stand-ins finding love whilst pretending to have sex.. Colin Firth was not born to play the author falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper,nor indeed any other comedy part. Rowan Atkinson is almost as bad as he would later be in ""Johnny English"" and he can't really need the money,can he? I will save the blushes of the other actors by drawing a veil over their performances. So - obviously - I didn't think a lot of it.I looked for some sign of wit,originality or even truth (heaven help me) in ""Love actually"" and Miss Thompson excepted,found none.

There was absolutely no charm in any of the story lines with the possible exception of the Colin Firth subplot which actually made me think I did not waste 2+ hours of my life. The worst story lines were the Neeson and Thompson subplots - Was there any reason why Thompson's husband's secretary(?) was in love with him or did I miss something - she looked young enough to be his daughter.

"FilmOtaku","4","1","2","6 November 2004"," Underwritten and overambitious
","'Love Actually', written and directed by Richard Curtis is a romantic dramedy which pretty much runs the gambit in terms of relationship stereotypes. Hunker down, here are the basic story lines: It's a few days until Christmas, and Billy Mack, (Bill Nighy) is a washed up, boozed out former pop idol who has an unlikely hit with a crap Christmas song. With his newly formed fame, he finds his chummy relationship with his slobby, average-Joe manager faltering as he makes the talk show circuit. Sarah (Laura Linney) has had a crush on a co-worker in her office, but she proves to be weighted down by the baggage of having a mentally ill brother who calls her three dozen times a day. Harry (Alan Rickman) is Sarah's boss, who is married to Karen (Emma Thompson), and is seriously considering cheating with his secretary. Hugh Grant is the newly elected Prime Minister of England and Karen's brother, who begins to fall for a member of his staff. Daniel, (Liam Neeson) has just lost his wife to cancer, and his young son reveals that he is in love with a young girl in his class, but doesn't know how to show it. (He's about 10 by the way) Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) is a writer who breaks up with his girlfriend and falls in love with the Portuguese-speaking girl who cleans his house in the country. And finally, Juliet (Keira Knightley), a newlywed, is bothered by the fact that her husband's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) doesn't seem to like her. Throw in cameos by Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton and (I think) you pretty much have the cast.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are a lot of stories going on here, and unfortunately, Curtis put a few too many in. The result is that there was not one story that I truly cared about in 'Love Actually'. The closest I came was feeling for Karen, but I think a lot of it was because Emma Thompson is just so damn good. Situations occurred that made no sense, plots were concluded with unbelievable ease, and by the time we would move on from one scene to another, I had completely forgotten what the situation was with that particular character because I hadn't seen their story for a good twenty minutes or so. It was like Curtis came up with the characters, wrote a paragraph as a treatment for each and then relied on just that paragraph to tell their stories. For example, I felt hardly anything regarding Daniel's loss, the only emotion or feeling in that regard was in the obligatory funeral scene. Basically, a cute film could have been made using just a couple of the characters, and it would have been an okay film. This was simply atrocious and for the most part, sappy. The acting in the film was of course decent, with this cast it had to be, but all of these great actors were wasted with the little bit they were given. And a note to Hugh Grant:<br/><br/>The shrugging, self-deprecating thing has gone from charming to insipid over the course of the last ten years, so drop it. Now.<br/><br/>I suppose that anyone who loves a romantic comedy is going to find this movie good. I found it lame and barely mediocre. Had Curtis not tried to shove the concept of love down our throats with about 20 different characters, it may have been decent, but in this form it turned out to be sub-par. Only for the decent acting jobs and that knock down, drag out Christmas program musical number at the end do I give it a 4/10.<br/><br/>Shelly"

It's all fluff really, and the cramming in of all the stories create one indifferent movie, with no time to really care about most of the characters.<br/><br/>The stories of several couples and their love are told around Christmas time.<br/><br/>For a romantic comedy, there is very little of the latter. Because of the length of 'Love Actually,' next to none of the charm works! It's boring and drives home its only point, that love is all around, so many times that you might as well take the film, throw it in the fridge, let it age and serve it at your next cocktail party with the red wine.

"Lunagoddess","5","1","2","2 June 2004"," Sappy film with too many characters
","This movie is difficult to understand because there are way too many characters and too many things going on: it takes the first 35 minutes of the movie to figure out what is going on. Even after the movie was half over, there were some characters I wasn't sure who were.<br/><br/>Also, there are a lot of things that don't exactly make sense in the movie, or wouldn't logically happen. [If you are looking for logic don't watch this movie.] There are also a lot of things that just suddenly happen at the end of the movie, without any explanation, that leave you thinking, ""????""<br/><br/>The mini-story about the porn stars was in my opinion the best part of the movie: it was truly original and interesting to watch."
"trashpicker","5","1","2","1 June 2004"," Trite, predictable and excessively sappy.
","My wife and I rented this a couple of days ago and we both found the movie to be embarrassingly bad, and actually painful to watch in moments. While I think the cast is excellent and the acting is generally good, the inclusion of tired plot devices and ill-conceived plotlines (such as the PM's public tirade against the President because of jealousy) really destroys any potential it may have had. Richard Curtis' sappy Disney-esque moments don't help lend the movie any credibility, either. <br/><br/>I think one of the most telling things I saw on the DVD was the ""Deleted Scenes"" section where Curtis talks about how difficult it was to cut the movie down from 3+ hours to the 2+ hours it eventually became. Curtis takes almost 5 minutes discussing the import of each scene before the scene is played (some scenes are less than 2 minutes), and he is really excruciating to watch. If you were to believe him, each scene is a gem and should have made it to the final product. I beg to differ. The end result would have been a 3 hour mess as opposed to the 2 hour mess that we have been subjected to.<br/><br/>Best avoided."
"MidniteRambler","2","1","2","25 May 2004"," Potentially great film ruined
","Series of loosely connected love stories centred upon middle-class London. We are offered broken love, unrequited love, true love and impossible longing. The tales are funny and sad, bitter and sweet, and, for the most part, wish-fulfilling a la Notting Hill, another Richard Curtis outing.<br/><br/>The numerous stories involve the Prime Minister, an ageing rock star, a writer, a widower and his stepson and various professionals experiencing diverse but well worn crises. The ensemble acting is peerless from all involved so it is the most endearing of the characters themselves should be singled out. In no particular order there are Laura Linney's American in London held back by her brother's illness; Thomas Sangster's ten-year-old with a crush on a classmate; Bill Nighy's rock-star-of-the-year-1973; Lucia Monez's Portuguese housekeeper; and Hugh Grant's bachelor Prime Minister.<br/><br/>This is a chequered film and has very funny highs and a couple of extreme lows. The most touching tale by far is that of Colin Firth's writer falling for Lucia Monez, despite the fact that neither can speak the other's language; and the most pointless about two actors standing in for porn stars during a film shoot. This latter thread was unnecessary and prevents the film being suitable for young children, which is a shame. But even the porn stars did not find the depths plumbed by Hugh Grant's Prime Minister when he railed at the US President at a press conference. In a film about human emotion, this trendy and crass political interjection was uncommonly lame and totally out of place. With the porn stars, this scene ruined - as in ruined - what could have been a great film. Wiser heads should have ruled and the offending celluloid excised and ceremonially burned. Sadly, it is too late and some brilliant writing and brilliant performing have been tarnished forever by four or five minutes of gormless film which should have been removed at the editing stage. What were they thinking of?<br/><br/>Please keep your politics out of my entertainment.<br/><br/>I have not, to date, rated a film, but this is going to be the exception. Without the Prime Minister's tirade and the porn thread: 10 out of 10. With the porn stars added: two out of 10. With the tirade: zero out of two million."

"Laitue_Gonflable","8","1","2","12 December 2003"," I'm grateful to Richard Curtis
","I would consider myself a lifelong fan of Richard Curtis, from Not the Nine O'clock News and Blackadder to Four Weddings & a Funeral and, of course, without a doubt his greatest work IMO, the 1991 telefeature Bernard & the Genie. So naturally, his next feature is always eagerly anticipated by yours truly, especially when he finally makes the big step from writing to directing. All I can say is, I am extremely grateful for this film.<br/><br/>I'm grateful to him because he has produced another gem. A funny and touching, sentimental film that really puts one in the Christmas mood. The difference between this and his other films is that it contains numerous different stories (I haven't had time to count them all), rather than just the simple love story between two main protagonists with several supporting characters and subplots. They're all intertwined, very loosely it has to be said, but it doesn't really matter, since they're all sweet tales and I loved all of the characters in one way or another. Despite the limited time spent on each one, we get a fair insight into the characters and their lives.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful, and Curtis does wonderful things with them. Neeson, Rickman, Thompson, Grant, and Firth all give very fine and sympathetic performances. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an ageing rock star out to grab publicity for his awful new song. And of course, a special personal mention must go to the short but sweet Martin Freeman/Joanna Page story, since for me it's wonderful to see Martin finally get the girl and be happy after seeing him strike out in love in two series of ""The Office"".<br/><br/>I'm also grateful to Richard Curtis simply because the film is predictable. Like so many other romantic comedies, it just wouldn't work if it weren't. If he tried to stretch the boundaries, cross borders and experiment; If, for example, every story didn't end on a high note with everyone falling in love and hugging and kissing, we'd feel ripped off, surely? It does what it's supposed and what it promises to do, and not only that, but it does that many times over, in the same film.<br/><br/>Plus I'm grateful that he didn't resort to hackneyed ideas; every story has its own journey, and although we know the direction it will eventually take, there is enough winding in the path along the way to keep us interested. There are also no cheap laughs; towards the end of the film there is a scene where a character looks through a glass pane at another character below. I was terrified that Curtis may ruin the film by inserting yet another cheap sendup of the church scene from ""The Graduate"" but he didn't. For that I'm grateful.<br/><br/>So basically, I'm grateful because he's given us yet another brilliant film. One to amuse and one to touch us. If you're a fan of 'warm' then this is definitely a film for you. It may be just like every other romantic comedy, but with one important factor; it's undoubtably one of the best."

"kevino-4","2","1","2","28 November 2003"," Female Romance Fantasy
","It would be too much to ask for geniune emotion and relationships in a Hollywood movie. However Love, Actually goes well over the line toward utter fantasy. You won't be as disappointed if you don't expect much of anything real, since those moments are delivered only when Emma Thompson is on the screen-she's incapable of falsity. It's too bad so much talent is wasted on tripe like this, though."
"mfkickabout","5","1","2","24 November 2003"," Doesn't really work
","I had a very hard time with this film.   See, when a film has it's heart truly in the right place, I often find myself loathed to criticise.   The film does have some very funny moments throughout the first half but then it starts to deaden out.<br/><br/>For me, the problem is that there are too many characters so it becomes hard to feel for those characters when they conclude their stories.   This film needed to be cut down at the script stage because the film is not long enough to do the job properly and is too long to appeal to the correct audience.   While I've enjoyed their previous work (and it would have robbed us of an enjoyable wedding scene), Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln are unnecessary and Laura Linney's character didn't add to the film at all. It's hard to decide what they were setting out to do here.   In amongst this sprawling mess, there is a good film waiting to get out.   Scrap that - there are two good films waiting to get out of this film.   Laura Linney's tale of a woman who puts duty to her family and work before finding happiness intrigued me and could easily have been a feature on its own. The Thompson/Rickman tale of a married man who is tempted by another and the wife who knows and tries not to say for fear of breaking up her family. However, in reading those ideas again, none of these are original and that brings me onto my next point.<br/><br/>What we have is a diluted film, held together by an unoriginal, ""It all ties together"" plot that is not to dissimilar to that of ""Playing By Heart"" and Bill Nighy played a similar, burnt-out rocker in ""Still Crazy"".   On the whole, this film is horribly unoriginal, mildly saved by half-decent comedy writing and laughs.   There's an enjoyable film in there, if only they could filter out what doesn't work."
"Red-125","4","1","2","24 November 2003"," A waste of good acting talent!
","Love, Actually (2003) written and directed by Richard Curtis, is a movie about Christmas that misses the mark.  In fact, it misses more than one mark because it's not a good screwball comedy, it's not a good romance, and it's not a good drama.<br/><br/>The film tries for a light touch, but doesn't achieve it.  It's hard to believe a director could waste the talents of actors like Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, and the incomparable Emma Thompson, but Curtis manages this feat.<br/><br/>There are eight couples--more or less-- in the movie, but the match that should have been the highlight of the film is between Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, and Martine McCutcheon, as Natalie, the employee whose job apparently is to bring him his tea..  This Cinderella story starts out with the first meeting of the Prime Minister and his staff, in which Natalie delivers the unforgettable speech, ""Hello, David.  Oh, sh*t, I can't believe I just did that. Oh and now I've gone and said 'sh*t' twice.""  Not a great marital prospect for a young statesman.<br/><br/>(If you want to see an intelligent movie about a politician's romance, rent ""The American President""(1995) with Annette Bening and Michael Douglas.)  In fact, I suggest that you stay away from this ""feel good"" movie that will probably make you feel bad.  Rent ""The American President,"" and stay home and enjoy it."
"chandlerbing28","Null","1","2","12 November 2003"," mixed bag-revised
","SPOILERS INCLUDED WITHIN:<br/><br/>It reminded me of how you feel during the uncertainty stages of falling in love and also when getting the nerve to speak up and take a chance.  The first five minutes set in the airport were beautiful and already got me crying! I also really liked how it went from comedy to drama so seamlessly. A lot of the comedy to me was WAYYYYYYYYYY too silly, though and pretty annoying.  The drama was very well done and my absolute favorite part was when the friend of the blonde woman confessed his love to her on those cards.  Unbelievable, and boy was he good-looking!!<br/><br/>I also liked how it portrayed different types of love--from a crush, to unrequited/impossible love, love of family, sex (but not!), the usual romantic love, and even platonic love between a straight man and his trusty and loyal manager. Ironically, probably the best relationship seemed to happen between the two ""porn"" stars. That was adorable and of course the irony of how shy and sweet they were, contrasting with what they were doing, was priceless.<br/><br/>Now for the negative side: it was extremely superficial in that that the women were largely model-quality gorgeous and the men ""loved"" them based on looks only. They didn't actually even know some of them (the kid, for example) That is hardly love!   The two women that weren't (at least in this movie) model-quality gorgeous actually got screwed (Emma Thompson and Laura Linney). If the target audience for a romantic comedy is women, that was not a wise move.<br/><br/>None of us women appreciated the fat jokes about Hugh Grant's assistant, Natalie who looked great and was not fat in any way. She was not a stick figure, but looked like a woman is supposed to look! Marilyn Monroe had that body type (actually heavier) and it seemed to work for her! No one called her fat throughout her movies!!  Also ticking off the core audience.<br/><br/>Another extremely annoying and ridiculous feature was that the model-quality women were just handing themselves over to the men and they didn't have to use any effort!  Like Claudia Schiffer to Liam Neeson, after talking to him for one minute:  ""I'll make SURE we see each other again.""  And Alan Rickman's character was not attractive and had no personality.  There is no way his secretary, an attractive young girl would throw herself at him, knowing he was married to boot. And the guy going to the US--that was just so ridiculous, (even worse than typical cheesy US movies and any beer commercial, and even Just Shoot Me, where David Spade only ended up with 1 supermodel). I thought it was a dream that he was having on the plane.  He should have come back empty handed.  Again, ticking off the core audience!!!<br/><br/>
Besides, the effort to win the person's heart is the core action in a romantic comedy. To leave it out and have the woman just hand herself to the guy is the same as having an action hero be asleep for 2 hours, the bad guy walks up to him and then has a heart attack and dies at his feet!  Kind of defeats the purpose of the movie, in addition to being annoying!!<br/><br/>This was clearly written and directed by a man--it was slanted in that direction. I just wasn't prepared for that type of ""Just Shoot Me"" style misogyny in a Hugh Grant romantic comedy.  There was none of that in Notting Hill, Four Weddings, etc., which were ironically written and directed by the same man. Note: women go to romantic comedies to get AWAY from that crap for 2 short hours!!!"
"JustJudy","5","1","2","14 November 2003"," Great performances, but....
","As another reviewer mentioned, the viewer must employ a willing suspension of disbelief in order to fully enjoy this film. It starts out realistically enough, but then rather shakily spirals into several unrealistic love affairs. (For example, even a Yank like me can't swallow **SPOILERS AHEAD** that a newly appointed prime minister would dally with ""the help"" as shown or randomly knock on a neighborhood full of doors on Christmas Eve without the press appearing immediately.) The writers seem greatly conflicted between the realistic (Laura Linney's selfless decision) and the absurd (the Wisconsin bar girls) and have way too many relationships to tidy up within the film's running time.<br/><br/>That said, there are moments of very clever writing and wonderful performances that make this film worth the ticket price. I would watch this movie again just to enjoy the awesomely talented cast (notably Rickman, Thompson, Firth, and Neeson) breeze through this fluff. And Atkinson adds his usual funny moments that are both subtle and hilarious.<br/><br/>

","""Love Actually"" was exactly the kind of product described by the washed up rock star character we first meet as he is butchering his classic oldie by turning it into a money-making holiday song: a golden turd. While the audience I was with got a lot of chuckles out of this story, the whole thing felt really cobbled together and insubstantial. So many simultaneous stories made each one of the fabulous actors felt wasted - kind of heartbreaking, really, since there were many truly magnificent folks getting screen time, but not one got more than 15 minutes (I think). It wasn't awful, but it just felt like ""product,"" with focus group approved emotion-inducers: the ""sexy"" nude scenes, the ""sad"" funeral scene, and the ""heart-warming"" kiddie scenes. Poor Richard Curtis - has he truly lost his ability to create something that feels the least bit fresh? Save it for a rental."

A young boy falls in love after his mother has died during Christmastime. We don't even see Anne Reid and Frances De La Tour at all due to the edits. The film director could have made two movies. Alan Rickman and Thompson played a long term married couple. Laura Linney's character is an American woman living and working in London, England with a mentally ill brother. I wished she had a happier ending in her life. The film is heartwarming tale of life and love in London, England when you wanted to live there. Bill Nighy was great as an aging rock star.

"cherold","6","1","3","8 December 2019"," Infatuation, Actually
","Well, I finally saw Love, Actually. I hadn't planned to. I've read a number of articles on why it's awful - most notably Lindy West's hilariously savage takedown - so I figured I could skip it. But I was with my girlfriend's family and it was on so there you are.<br/><br/>It's hard to be objective after so much anti-anticipation, but I'm inclined to say that, if you accept that this is manipulative and nonsensical, it's a reasonably effective bit of Hollywood Christmas entertainment. Just ignore that romance is reserved for young women without a lot to say and that this movie is not about love at all but instead is about becoming infatuated with people you don't know and may have nothing in common with and it's all fine.<br/><br/>The structure is unusual, in that's it's a series of little intertwined vignettes about a group of interconnected people. A little boy is in love with a girl he hasn't spoken to, a guy falls in love with a woman who doesn't speak English, a Prime Minister has the hots for an attractive woman everyone in the movie inexplicably describes as fat (as though the part was written for a heavier woman and then some producer shouted ""WE CAN'T HAVE A FAT CHICK IN THIS MOVIE!"").<br/><br/>Many of the characters are likable in general, and some of the scenes, taken by themselves, are kind of brilliant. Yes, that guy putting his emotional baggage on a newlywed is screwed up, but IT'S DONE IN SIGNS! No, it makes no sense those two people who couldn't converse and barely interacted fell in love, but the culminating scene is funny and rather touching. There is no movie that requires stand ins for a series of nothing but sex scenes, but those scenes are funny and the low-key relationship that develops is the most likable and believable thing in the movie.<br/><br/>What Love, Actually is, above all else, is *clever.* The exhausting, sometimes annoying structure is clever. There are ingenious scenes and situations and some sharp dialogue. But the cleverness seems to exist for its own sake rather than in the service of saying something about love or lust or the human condition, so the whole thing is kind of empty.<br/><br/>Would I have rated this movie higher if I had no information going in? Probably. I probably would have given it a 7 and said it was dumb but entertaining even though I found jumping from story to story a little annoying. I can't imagine rating it higher than 7, though, and definitely don't see this as a particularly good example of the romantic comedy.<br/><br/>It's not really as bad as I thought it might be. If you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go ahead and take a look."

","Rom com lovers will love this film. I suppose one could consider Love Actually as a holiday motion picture, since there's a heavy does of Christmastime atmosphere. However, the movie isn't so intimately wed to the time of year that it can't exist without it (and viewers who sit down to watch it in the middle of summer won't find themselves longing for December). This is one of those times when a film's goodwill allows critics and viewers alike to overlook its most egregious flaws and enjoy it for what it's trying to be. Love Actually has about a half-dozen happy endings, some of which are more deserved than others. One in particular, featuring an airport chase, is so over-the-top that it feels like an exercise in absurdist fantasy. The problem with Love Actually, as is often the case with large ensembles, is that we don't spend nearly enough time with the interesting characters, but it's a minor issue."

Okay...watching this in my living room with lots of family members walking around the house (teenagers on phones, etc...) and here I am watching a porn scene on my TV. Where's the remote ?? WHERE's THE REMOTE....OMG Dad !!! what are you watching?? Hey everyone !! Dad's watching porn !!! Right in front of everyone.... AHHHH ! I can't believe it !!! The kids start texting their friends...OMG my dad is watching porn right in front of us !! I still finished this, later after everyone had gone to their rooms. Still touching and feel good, but did not expect the graphic nudity and sex. Watch at your own risk !!"

Yes, it is a story of love, but it is also just a good story.<br/><br/>What was most interesting was waiting until now (2016) to see it.

","The thread for St Vincent reminded me I'd seen this on Saturday. So, why should I care about these characters? Most of them aren't well-developed, and even when they were, the film's following a clearly defined formula that nothing has any emotional impact because it feels exactly like a movie. There needs to be something grounded in reality for me to feel something, but there's none of that in here. Being grounded in reality doesn't mean not having magic, or fantasy, or supernatural etc, because any type of genre film could be created with some real sense of emotion. But every emotion the characters feel here are so clearly created for an audience to feel something that the complete contrivance of every moment feels like exactly that, a contrivance. There's absolutely nothing realistic here. Some of the situations that the characters find themselves here are things that could hypothetically happen in someone's life, no matter how cheesy... but the film failing to come across as anything other than a schmaltzy, overly-forced sentimental piece of fiction is really the only reason it fails, and a big enough reason to. Exactly the type of dreck I try to stay away from, and usually do until I'm with friends who won't see anything else like in this case. <br/><br/>However, none of the actors are really at fault. Andrew Lincoln is super adorable and perfect here, and for the cast I can't say it totally fails"

","Boy did I come to this party late. A great holiday surprise. Full of crass humor, mistaken intentions, international jibes and...well love.<br/><br/>Love, this movie will have you believe, is everywhere if you look. If you're a cynical person this film really will not work for you. Especially in the opening scene where it's EXACTLY stated that love is everywhere, if you look.<br/><br/>It's a statement alright. And now it has to prove that love does and will come in many forms. I love the interconnectivity of these seemingly disconnected people. This type of movie is what Garry Marshall wishes he could do with those stupid holiday movies. This one clearly defines the relationship. This guy loves this girl but can't follow through because of this reason. That's it. Simple. Drama. Comedy. It's all here. They want you to love this movie so much that they have a tough ex-rocker (played by Bill Nighy) promise to strip naked and play his hit song, if it goes to number one. The issue being, HE doesn't believe in his Christmas song. Delightful! There's also a heart-wrenching moment, when this old codger realizes the real meaning of love, through a mist of groupies, drugs and alcohol. What prevails is the heart. A wonderful moment for all those with troubled pasts.<br/><br/>Well, you've more than likely have seen this movie by now.

Mom was a little put off by some of the nudity and adult humor though I remember laughing at much of those scenes. Not all funny scenes involved raunchy humor such as the one where Alan Rickman orders a necklace to be gift wrapped and Rowan Atkinson does quite a flourish on that to his consternation. Nice use of music too like ""All You Need is Love"" being performed at a wedding, ""Both Sides Now"" while Emma Thompson is crying, or ""God Only Knows"" at the ending scene. Oh, and a young girl performs a fine rendition of ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" at a pageant scene. All I'll say now is I liked Love Actually and I do recommend it."

","This romantic comedy follows several interconnected couples in the five weeks running up to Christmas; each is very different and not all are romantic love. We have the newly elected prime minister finding love with a member of his staff; his sister whose marriage could be in danger when another woman catches the eye of her husband; a widower whose young son has fallen in love with a girl in his class; a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid despite the fact that they can't understand each other; a single man who believes that if he goes to America women will throw themselves at him; a couple of porn actors; a man who loves his best friend's new wife and a few others besides.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film we move between the characters, dipping in and out of their lives as their relationships develop or don't. Don't expect realism; this is after all a comedy not a study of real relationships or situations. It is however a lot of fun and will probably leave most viewers grinning from ear to ear thanks to the feel-good stories; even if they seem to include every cliché possible! The cast includes a wide array of British acting talent including rom-com regulars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. They all put in fine performances although some inevitably stand out; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were great as a couple whose marriage might be about to go through a rough patch and Bill Nighy was hilarious as the aging rocker who has recorded a Christmas single; he knows it is awful and is happy to tell everybody. There is some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't offend you this is an enjoyable film just the thing to watch on Christmas if you've had enough of 'Die Hard'!"
"kiiroichan-635-638399","2","1","3","24 October 2013"," Why does this movie have a better rating than other chick flicks?
","This movie probably only has a better rating than other movies of the same genre because it *desperately* stuffed, jammed and shoe-horned every celebrity in Britain. <br/><br/>There were moments in this movie that I liked. I guess it was cute to have the Portuguese woman and Colin Firth dude to have that language barrier and fall in love. I really liked the Prime Minister's part of the story, probably the most. The naked couple with John Watson/Bilbo Baggins was cute too. Yes, there were many cute parts. The ending for the Laura Linney character was fine. It's realistic enough and I'm glad the movie gave a face to her situation so that we could understand it.<br/><br/>Movies/shows are allowed to be cheesy, dumb, naive, fantastical and campy in my opinion. They can be all of these things and still be great. But there's such a thing as a movie that is all of these things, and happens to be *POORLY CRAFTED.* <br/><br/>This is a pretty unconventional format -- stuffing tons of different stories into one movie, with some dozen high-profile actors and actresses. This movie did mainly 2 things to make this movie out of reach of being a good one:<br/><br/>1. preaching its theme of ""love"" and taking itself too seriously 2. too many characters, 1 movie's-length of time to care about them<br/><br/>Into the second half of the movie, I really didn't want to care anymore. Sure it was sweet that Colin Firth went all the way to Portuguese lady's place to propose (other than the fact that the Portuguese lady was the only option around), that's okay, but having a huge room full of people right there and applauding? What the hell else is supposed to happen? Was she going to say ""no"" and humiliate him in front of everybody? This movie didn't have to go that far to make the plot for Colin Firth's character a ""point-of-no-return-or-he-will-be-humiliated"" kind of plot.<br/><br/>I didn't care about the dude who went to America when he first sprang the idea that the problem was his geographical location. I didn't care about the dude at all after that.<br/><br/>The pairing I hated the most was the kid actor and the American girl. And Qui-Gon Jinn. I couldn't care less. It wasn't cute to me. It was just super annoying. It's not even about the fact that if I were a parent, I'd tell him ""You just grew your testicles, you don't know a damn thing yet,"" it's the fact that this is an R-rated movie and we're indulging this 11-year-old fictional character. Someone just decided to shove Mickey Mouse Club into the same movie with nude breast-grabbing and nude thrusting. Qui-Gon Jinn was like some sad guest on Elmo's world, trying to help Elmo chase his American love interest through the airport. The kid didn't even appear to have a care in the world about his mother who'd just died. Instead he was all down in a first-world problem 11-YEAR-OLD's ""hell-hole"" that is his shallow crush on some other girl, all just because this movie wanted to ""lovify"" *every* single character in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie has little re-watch value to me. If there was a great piece of cake in your fridge, but 70% of it was moldy, would you eat it? Somehow this piece of moldy cake has a 7.7 on IMDb, while there's plenty of other WHOLE and FRESH tasty cakes of the same genre to relish more and are less realistic, but people have rated them much lower. <br/><br/>Some movies with the same sort of theme (mainly chick flicks), and are pretty cheesy and naive, I'd include:<br/><br/>Father of the Bride, Hitch, Mean Girls, Monster-in-Law, 13 going on 30, Miss Congeniality<br/><br/>Somehow all of these movies are rated lower... but they're all fun to watch 100% through. They're all *well-crafted*. They're consistent in their tone and audience. They don't have moments like in Love Actually where I'd react, ""Wow, you serve me this on a plate and you expect me to eat it?"" <br/><br/>This movie tried too hard to preach, and I could tell the crafting process of this movie was frantic and desperate by the ridiculous amount of casting. Could every part of this movie have been consistent with the objective of this movie? ""Love""?? Love in all forms? Shallow primal infatuation like the kid actor and the guy who comes back with some hot American girls? <br/><br/>Even my favorite story of this movie, the Prime Minister's, was tainted. The American president was shoe-horned in there just to cheesily drive the plot forward. The president's come-on to Natalie and then the Prime Minister's come-back in return was incredibly contrived, and I felt it was very unnecessary, along with the collateral damage of some negative sentiments towards Americans (which of course isn't to be taken seriously). Was there no better way to create a rift between two characters in a plot device to ""tighten their bond""? <br/><br/>A lot of this movie is great. Unfortunately it is thoroughly tainted by the most disruptive, disgusting parts of the movie. <br/><br/>Shows, stories, MOVIES are *allowed* to have tons of different main characters. I'm sure it's possible for those kinds of movies to be great. But for me, the biggest flops in this movie flopped the entire movie miserably."
"reeseslightning","8","1","3","22 March 2012"," The only film that does it right
","I really, really hate large ensemble cast movies with intertwining story lines. The reason for this is because the characters in that kind of movie are usually one dimensional with one dimensional problems - and of course they're all beautiful and things are always alright at the end with the cheesy lines and bad chemistry. I can't bring myself to care about the characters because 1) I hate the actors in it or 2) the plot/story lines/acting/dialogue is god awful that it makes me want to hurl. In fact, romance is just not my area.<br/><br/>Love Actually is the only one of these kinds of movies that does it right. And does it very well. Somehow, the writers for this film found the perfect balance of the most amazing cast ever assembled and the the satirical trait that lurks in the background. Love Actually is light hearted with some heavy moments in it but it never takes itself too seriously. It has people making up, breaking up, coming, going, cheating, loving, and everything else that should utterly confuse the viewer. With other movies, things take too long or are too slow; the writers fixated on couple/actor A because they're more famous than couple/actor B.<br/><br/>Not so with Love Actually. Even if one gets more screen time than another, they make up for it in quality. There's a delicate balance between real situations that couples go through versus events that are just so not (*cough* Natalie and the Prime Minister *cough*). However, that's where the casting comes into play. Each actor portrays their character with just the right amount of sarcasm, mystery, or love that it needs so that even the silly story of Natalie and the Prime Minister seem plausible.<br/><br/>Sure the cast is great looking, but you don't notice really because you're so swept up in the magic of the dialogue, which is charming (then again, Brits did make this so I guess that's to be expected) and lighthearted.<br/><br/>This film separates itself simply because it's better than anything like America's put out in this genre. And yes, I am American.<br/><br/>For some reason, Love Actually struck a chord with audiences that won't go away, nor would we want it to. Almost ten years later and people still love this film. It's the only chick flick/holiday film I look forward to watching each and every time."
"geminiredblue","9","1","3","14 February 2012"," Sprawling Rom-Com
","I admit, even though I'm a die-hard action/ horror/ scifi fan, there's also a little part of me that loves the occasional romantic comedy (or rom-com as it's known in the movie world.) While admittedly most rom-coms are pretty formulaic, every once in a while one will come along that tackles romance in a unique way. Amazingly two of my personal favorites share several things in common: both are set at Christmas time (so they also count as Christmas movies), both feature a good number of British actors, and they portray most (if not all) their characters in a realistic light. The first is THE HOLIDAY, featuring a charming cast that includes Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Eli Wallach, and a very nuanced Jack Black. The second is this film, which quickly becomes a roster featuring all the talented, and uprising, stars in London. Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Andrew Lincoln (THE WALKING DEAD's Rick Grimes) are just some of the noteworthy roles. The whole cast gives 110 percent. The movie covers a multitude of stories also, I believe somewhere around a dozen. And it shows how all of these seemingly random people are connected. All the stories explore certain aspects of relationships: between parents and children, siblings, married couples, friends, co-workers, etc. The most wonderful parts are quiet little poignant moments that appear throughout the film. For instance in most rom-coms, a guy proclaims his love for a woman who's with someone else. As he's walking away, the woman runs after him and kisses him. Followed by a short little pause as the guy is conflicted. Then they kiss a second, longer time before the music swells and the scene fades. In LOVE ACTUALLY, when this same situation arises, the two kiss for one tender moment before the woman walks back inside the apartment. And the guy walks away, happily determined, saying ""Enough."" At another point, Emma Thompson's character excuses herself from her family's Christmas celebration and ducks into her bedroom where she silently cries to Joni Mitchell. A few minutes later, she composes herself and rejoins her family, with a brave smile on her face. Moments like that happen in real life, and that's what is so great about the film. Clearly the makers were interested in capturing real human interaction, feelings and emotion, even in the most awkward situations. With this film, you will laugh and cry and become teary-eyed. And you'll leave the movie feeling a sense of hope and maybe even love as you discover that there are other flawed, hurting, lonely, caring, passionate, and loving people in the world. So enjoy this heartwarming tale!"
"budmassey","10","1","3","17 June 2011"," I love ""Love Actually.""
","""Love Actually"" is a film of exquisitely delicate emotions blended with just the right touches of humor to keep it from becoming maudlin. Everyone in the film appears to be an emotional train wreck waiting to happen. They dangle precariously at the end of their respective ropes over chasms of heartache. But what is so rewardingly beautiful is that each survives through different kinds of strength, inspiring viewers to find within their own strength in facing similar disasters.<br/><br/>The incidental entwining with the Christmas season lends the many disparate stories a sort of framework that supports their almost imperceptible weight. Writer/Director Richard Curtis, true to form, constructs a brilliant and complex work that in the hands of lesser directors might have come off as diffused and ineffective, but in his hands comes together with astonishing elegance and power.<br/><br/>Craig Armstrong's score is so beautifully subtle and yet powerful that it weaves with the delicacy of silk and the strength of steel throughout the film, masterfully setting its tone and unifying the diverse subplots into a seamless whole. The additional music is cunningly selected to provide counterpoint to Armstrong's score while at the same time complementing it perfectly.<br/><br/>The cast is beyond compare, superb to the last detail. I can't even imagine where to begin singling anyone out, so I won't try. Suffice it to say that, in typical British style, the entire ensemble shines as a whole without any one cast member overshadowing another, no mean feat when the credits read like a Who's Who of what I would call ""serious cinema."" There are so many moments to treasure that, once again, I will not even attempt to single any out. You simply must experience them for yourself, which I recommend without reservation. This is yet another of those incidentally Christmas-themed movies that I watch without fail every holiday season. I could continue spewing superlatives, but I think you get the idea. I love ""Love Actually."""

I had to go 'way down in the cast to even find out who she was, but Portugese soap star Lucia Moniz was amazing. I think I'm in love.<br/><br/>All of the intertwining romantic stories had their moments of sweetness. I can't think of a single character in the film that wasn't likable, even with all their faults exposed. We all have our good points and bad, don't we? That's what made it so human.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the film was that these story lines were all centered around the Christmas season. Wow! You can actually say ""Merry Christmas"" in Britain? And you don't have to spell it ""X-mas""? How politically incorrect is that? A very good film worth watching.

","This movie is a wonderful look at love in a light, fun, and heart warming manner. Other reviews which go into more negative aspects forget the purpose of this movie. This is not a story about ""perfect"" people. This is a movie whose characters have faults. They are not perfect. Love is not about being perfect or always ending cleanly. I believe people expect a movie to depict love stories in the same way always but this is new, its different, it is a new classic.<br/><br/>Also, this is a movie for adults. Not that it is crude or anything, rather it is just mature. For example, there are two characters who are body doubles (not porn stars as some people have misinterpreted) and there is nudity in those scenes. However, with that said if you pay attention to the interactions and dialogue between the two characters it is truly an adorable situation.<br/><br/>This is a movie that should be watched when you want to feel warm and happy inside. It is not the deepest movie, but it is fun and one of my personal favorites. I watch it every December before Christmas, but it makes me happy all year round."

","I confess I've always admired Richard Curtis's typically British sense of humour and shoulder to shoulder story lines (""Four weddings and a funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", amongst others) . This film is the ultimate finish line in that direction: firstly, because there is not one trace of soppy dialogue; secondly, because the restraints of political correctness are finally let go of, while the film retains a certain air of mischievous courtesy (the US president's visit to London is quite memorable); finally, because Curtis has always been a mastermind in bringing to the screen collective views on rather diverse themes, by allowing each character to have its own voice and portraying each one with the right dose of wit and affection, and, from this point of view, the film holds in perfect balance nine different story lines (ten including the one which was left on the cutting room floor). Some stories are funny, others sad, others happily resolved and all are, in one way or the other, related, heart-warming and memorable. The cast is solid and it includes some rather high profile actors, amongst others Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Aktinson (watch out for his cameo appearance, it's hilarious). Then of course there is also Hugh Grant, at this point one of Curtis's faithfuls, playing Britain's PM in a more disillusioned and less vacant fashion: his improvised dance inside official quarters, with the beat of Sister Sledge in the background, is outstanding."

The Notebook is just gay all in all, i'm sorry Notebook lovers. Love Actually involves many relationships. Also, many people looking for love. For instance, there is a British guy named Colin who wants to go to America so he can hook up with American women. Because British women aren't his type.Liam Neeson plays a widowed step father who's step son is in love with a girl. So he teaches him about the birds and the bees. This is one of my all time favorite films ever. He's just not that into you was like this movie. It lacked humor. Also, it was way too serious and way to real. Love actually is a serious film also. Not as serious or real though. He's Just not that into you was okay, but Love actually is a fun film to watch. The person that made the movie for me was Bill Nighy. Nighy played Billy Mac, an ex-heroin addict who starts getting famous again by doing a remake of a famous song. Love is all around.

","This film surprised me. I did not know what to expect, I thought it was going to be another cookie cutter romantic comedy, only with a big cast. What I got is my favourite romantic comedy of all time. This film is touching, hilarious and extremely well made considering the amount of characters it had to juggle with.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast is wonderful, from Hugh Grant as the dancing Prime Minister to Liam Neeson's brooding widow father role. My favourite character was Bill Nighy. This was my first introduction to him and I loved every minute he was on screen. He was so funny and has been in every role since then. This was also my introduction to Keira Knightley, who doesn't really get that much to do but looks gorgeous. I final shout out to Martin Freeman as the porn stand in, too funny.<br/><br/>This is a great film to watch to get in the mood for Christmas and ranks in my top 5 to watch during that season. Richard Curtis, in his directorial debut, handles numerous characters and story lines with ease. Not once did I think they were concentrating too much on one or not enough on another.<br/><br/>In one of my favourite scenes, which is heartbreaking and a homage to Bob Dylan, Andrew Lincoln tells Knightley how he 'really' feels about her. This is all done through giant index cards and not a word is spoken between the two. Beautiful, funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.<br/><br/>Give this film a go if you haven't already and since you'll be reading this during the Christmas season, it's the perfect time to throw it on."

","I admit I watched this film mainly because Alan Rickman is in it and being his huge fan, I'd watch anything he's in.<br/><br/>It's a decent film but there are too many characters and not much screen time for each character to have a particular strong impact to me. Some parts are quite silly. I like the soundtrack more than the movie.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman looks real handsome especially when he dances at the party! He's the only character that strikes me. He doesn't have much screen time but he dominates in every scene. Emma Thompson plays his wife and man, I'm real jealous."

He was, of course, simply magnificent.<br/><br/>The real attraction for me was, of course, Hugh Grant. No, I am not gay, but I love that guy in everything he does.

I command you to watch this movie :) At least i can recommend this movie if you either are in a good mood or if you want to end p in a good mood.On a scale of amusement (and in the same category of course) i would place love actually next to films such as Bridget Jones, Lost in translation and further comedy classics which we cannot afford to have not seen.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ccharters","10","1","3","22 December 2008"," Now my favorite Christmas movie!
","I love Christmas movies. I also love British romantic comedies (I'm married to a Brit, so my life IS a British romantic comedy...). Every year, I MUST watch ""White Christmas,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Home Alone"" and ""A Christmas Story"" (thank you, TBS). A few years ago, my husband gave me the ""Love Actually"" DVD - and I hadn't even asked for it. It was several months before I actually watched the movie, and when I did, I just adored it. Realizing that it was really a Christmas movie, I watched it again that Christmas, and then again last year, and again this year. It's a great ""girls' night"" movie, but men seem to like it, too. I just love every character; the dialog is typically, bitingly, hilariously British (a droll sense of humor I've come to love), and the stories are all engaging. All the story lines have happy endings - with the exception of one, in my opinion - and I come to the end of this movie grinning like a fool and crying like a baby. I just cherish this film - it has become my VERY favorite Christmas movie, and I recommend it to everyone!"
"wyldsyd2003","9","1","3","12 December 2008"," Loved it ""Actually""
","****Spoilers ahead**** 5 years after this movie was released, I still LOVE it. Having read lots of the bad reviews, I had to comment. Seems there are many 'critics' on IMDb, some harsh wannabe Eberts out there, imho. 'LA' is a romantic comedy. I'm not sure what those who rated it so poorly, expected? Realism? A documentary? I'm puzzled. Yes, your typical rom-com is going to contain fluff, cheesy story lines & dialogue, but with a rom-com, you have to suspend your common sense & just believe! This is a movie to extract from. It's a myriad of messages about, love. And what this movie shows is, love is 'all around, actually'. I rated it 9/10, not a 10, because, yes, a few of story lines were....er...silly? An very far fetched (the subplot of the so called 'cute Brit who goes to America' in search of 'cool American babes' & actually sleeps with 4, just by being a 'cute Brit'? Not so, sorry, what were they thinking in the casting dept with that guy?? not cute!) Not to mention the stand ins for the porn movie..?? if that story line was really necessary? To omit it & focus some more on Colin Firth's character's subplot would have been a wiser choice. But again, it's not a perfect movie. If you look at the movie & analyze it, you will find that there IS truth to the movie. How? *The love of a brother from a sister (Laura Linney's Sarah is fantastic) you can FEEL her turmoil. Her need for romantic love overcome by her love & responsibility for her brother. And yes to those nay sayers....sometimes we do give up love for familial love. That happens. You're in a fantasy world if you think not. -The unrequited love of being in love with your best friend's partner. Tell me there aren't people out there who haven't fallen in love in that situation?? I'm sure that has broken up a marriage or two, considering the divorce rate... *The comfortable love faced with a mid life crisis that crosses the line into an almost office affair. Oh yeah, that's NEVER happened either. Never has a man fallen for his secretary. Nope never heard of that happening. *Then we have the Cinderella story. Prime Minister falls for 'fat, help'. I suppose love has never sprouted across social class either? Sure some of it's a bit cheesy, the happy ending where the PM & Natalie DO hook up, but, hey it is a rom-com. Hugh Grant is hilarious in his own ""Risky Business"" moment. I personally thought it was comical. *You also get healthy doses of heartbreak. Neeson's character broken hearted over the lose of his 'perfect girl/wife', Emma Thompson's character who's emotional pain is SO palpable. I know, I've been in that situation & ever so clearly, remember a very similar time of shaking my hands trying to hide that intensely crushing moment of revelation at the worst possible second. Oh yes, that's VERY real. And what is ALSO real about that sequence IS THIS..sometimes a marriage does survive a betrayal...and it doesn't fold nicely, as in ever so happily ever after.... *Falling in love across a language wall? Could happen. IN five weeks, doubtful. But,I think the message is, yes, we love, are sometimes betrayed, but we can & do, find love again in the most unusual places. (a family member of mine met his wife in Spain, during the war, married her & brought her home, & SHE DIDN'T SPEAK ANY English, NOR DID HE SPEAK ANY Spanish - they were married 30 something years & had 4 lovely children) -As for the 11 yr old, yes, while us adults KNOW that it's not 'real love' most of us have a 'first love' tucked away in our minds and hearts. And while I will admit 99.9% of us ARE not with our puppy loves, we did have one. *You also find a bit of blended love. Love between a stepfather and stepson. Under horrible circumstances (But when is that blended love not under difficult circumstances?) That story 's ending may be sugary, but it serves its purpose in the film. This movie, while not perfect, comes pretty close. Its underlying theme, the theme that if we look around us, we will see that love is all around. Between friends (just like that of Billy Mack & his manager) between step families, between co-workers, between brother sister, man & woman, new 'strangers' who meet, husbands & wives, etc. And it doesn't always have a scripted perfect ending. THAT is life.. Oh & on the 'fat' comments...I think the meaning is...fat is so often distorted, it is so often not true, & a real dilemma for those girls who think they are, when they're not..so don't knock yourself. Just because you're not as skinny as the overrated Keira Knightley, does NOT mean you're fat. I see no offense by the reference to that in the movie. Nor do I see the insult to America. The president, wonderfully portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton. It is what it is. Obviously a reference to ol Bill. Not unjust in poking fun at that one, considering it was an embarrassing happening that dominated the news for quite some time....If Britain wants to stand up to America for once, so what, big deal. Remember again folks, it's a R O M A N T I C comedy! Fabulous acting by Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, (the young boy who portrays Sam, don't know his name), and Andrew Lincoln. Don't expect heavy character development, there isn't time allowed. But that's not the point. The point is, it's Christmas, pull yourself up by the bootstraps & take a look, all around. Love is, actually all around. Just open your eyes & you won't be disappointed!"
"gbx06","8","1","3","21 July 2008"," All you need is love
","First of all this isn't a simple and silly romantic comedy, and that is its greatest charm. The film itself is an x-ray, an analysis of what is love actually and its beauty lies in the fact that it remains today, you could see it a lot of times and its essence continuous fresh thanks to a series of stories that show us the different faces of love and above all, by a spectacular cast for one single movie, in which none of the players is lost and each make their best effort to give a more real interpretation.<br/><br/>To be honest the biggest hit of the movie is the script and the direction of Richard Curtis that with subtlety builds a beautiful story that can move from comedy to drama without any complication because, at the end of all, is there a suffering or joy more great that love? In addition, photography and art design also contribute to create warm atmospheres, yet despite that the film takes place in winter, where the characters make great performances and show us more intimate sides that help achieve greater identification with some of the stories.<br/><br/>Another detail is that, definitely, if this story will develop elsewhere than London and at another time than Christmas, we would probably face a silly movie about love, but these factors combine to give a more consistent, as a wink toward anything that moves us the heart. But not everything is happiness there are also some details that are bad for the film especially with some stories that have a very open ending, like the case of Sarah and her love for the graphic designer, which makes it unnecessary.<br/><br/>In short, is an excellent film to see if you are in love but also if you don't, perhaps you will find here some love."

It is a good Christmas story and the acting is very good (it is British of course)Liam Neeson is good. Emma Thompson is good. Bill Nighy is hilarious. Alan Rickman reminds me of Professor Snape but is still great. Laura Linney is surprisingly good and so is Keira Knightley.

A very delicate and a masterful depiction of the greatest feeling in this mortal world. A movie every mortal being should watch before becoming immortal..

","...was the only reason I saw this over-rated, over-bloated, treacly piece of crap. Not even Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, or Liam Neeson could save it, though Lord knows they gave their all. I'm still trying to figure out what people see in Colin Firth or Hugh Grant, or in the whole romantic-comedy genre, in general--I'm not a huge rom-com fan to begin with, but this was simply unbearable, unbelievable, and unfunny... except for Nighy, as Billy Mack. His story should have been the whole movie; with maybe a bit of Rowan Atkinson on the side. Nighy's rock star was a much-needed comic relief in this drippingly sappy bit of fluff, with his foul-mouthed, brutally honest cynicism and 'what do I care' attitude. If I could get a copy of the movie with just his parts, then it'd be worth watching."

There are my favorite songs and famous songs, ""All I Want for Christmas is You"", ""The Trouble With Love Is"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", so everyone can enjoy it.

Mark is always cold manner to Juliet, but Juliet don't know why he is cold to her, so she want to become a good friends with Mark.

"native_girl333","10","1","3","26 June 2006"," ""All You Need Is Love""
","""Love Actually"" happens to be one of the best romantic comedies out there! Director/writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral)has made a combination of brilliant humor and heartfelt romance.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is a mosaic story of people who are floating around in the breeze of complicated relationships. In the film there can be found several types of relationships. There is a story of a bachelor prime-minister (surprisingly funny Hugh Grant), a story of traditional love triangle, a story of deceitful love and many more. It's the Christmas season and love is floating freely in everybody's hearts. People discover the true spirit of holiday's magic and realize that Love is all around us.<br/><br/>Curtis has managed to catch a few affront stars of United Kingdom and some of United States also. Great talents such as Alan Rickman. Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and superb Bill Nighy make fantastic performances in this heartwarming comedy. Furthermore there is an amazing supporting cast around the stars backing up them.<br/><br/>A hilarious revelation Curtis had was to include the hit song ""Love Is All Around"" of Wet Wet Wet which was made famous by ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" to ""Love Actually"". By replacing the love-word with ""Christmas"" and performed by the aging old rock star Billy Mack (Nighy) was a really good idea.<br/><br/>The film is a marvelous example of an enjoyable romantic comedy which isn't being ruined by length. A nice two hours covers it all even when there's eight stories to tell. Even if the film consist some of clichÃ© like turns it isn't numbing to watch. Big thanks to the director who realized there isn't always have to have gays or other that kind of things in every movie. Nothing against the minorities but sometimes a stereotypic characters of homosexuality are underestimating people badly.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of movie is filled with holiday-music but includes also some great piece of music what you can listen whenever you want. ""God Only Knows"" by Beach Boys is one of the nicest ending songs there is. If you enjoy the movie you will even listen to the Christmas-songs in the middle of Summer!!! <br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is very enjoyable, incredibly insightful saga of people who discover the different ways of relationships. In result you get happy spirit and a lot of favorite characters whose life you want to see over and over again.<br/><br/>I recommend it from the bottom of my heart!"
"Tashtago","2","1","3","17 September 2005"," too light with no substance
","First of all Hugh Grant just doesn't wash as Prime Minister of England.It is a bit like casting Kramer from Seinfeld (Michael Richards) as the president of the United States. The episodic plot line only dilutes any real chance at some philosophical statement of love. Colin Firth's climatic walk through the streets with the entire village following him was pure pap and must have been hard to pull off as an actor . Then there was the completely inane plot diversion involving the Brit who travels to Wisconsin and becomes the biggest stud in town . I was waiting for the dissolve to him waking up in the plane and realizing it was only a dream. This is the kind of light/cute film that used to only be made in the U.S. but after ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" has become a staple of British films.The soundtrack is omnipresent although halfway through you'd wish it would disappear. A solid 4.5"
"lapuerkita","10","1","3","1 September 2005"," Three thumbs up
","Excellent movie. The script is perfect. The way the love stories are closely related to one another is unbelievable. Emma Thompson's performance is astonishing, she succeeds to show so many emotions in just one grin, she's a terrific actress. Little Thomas, who plays Sammy, (cant remember his surname) Is absolutely cute, and speaks too wisely about love at his early age. Perhaps that is what makes it funny.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend this movie, it IS the ULTIMATE romantic comedy, and it has everything I could have asked for, drama and comedy. Sorry if the English is bad, this is my first review, and I am from Argentina. I hope I keep to the guidelines."

It's sweet, touching, funny, heartbreaking, inspiring, wistful....you name it and the movie has it.

"werchos","8","1","3","13 July 2005"," A classic example of the lengths that people will go for Love!
","Rarely in a movie do we see several story lines interwoven perfectly with the right amount of balance and complexity as we do in Love Actually. In this magnificent portrayal of real life love we see eight love stories unfold over the festive Christmas season. Never before have I fully seen captured people who are willing to go for the all consuming thing we call love.<br/><br/>Viewers experience these great lengths when they see the love story of Collin, actor Kris Marshall, who is willing to fly across the world to find love. Then there is the endearing story of Sam, actor Thomas Sangster. (Who does a superb job). Sam is willing to learn a new hobby in order to obtain his hearts desire. These seem to be real life stories which are not all fluff and happy ending like we see in many movies such as The wedding singer. The type of realism used makes the audiences sympathize with the ups and downs of obtaining, keeping and losing love.<br/><br/>Director Richard Curtis does a great job in bringing attention to several elements that is pivotal to the plots. Often lust accompanies love. Curtis used the element of color to bring attention to a lustful situation. By making use of the color red throughout the movie, he gives a physical color to seduction. A scene which illustrates the use of the bold color is when Harry, actor Alan Richman, and Karen, actress Emma Thompson, are at Harry's work Christmas party. We see a vixen from Harry's office enter the scene wearing a slinky red dress and red devil horns! The clever minx is trying to seduce Harry in front of his own wife! Curtis also uses clever dialog to get his point across that no price to great at the chance of Love. It is never clearer than in the scene with Liam Neaseon as Daniel, a widower trying to raise his stepson, and Sangster as Sam. Daniel conveys to his son that love is indeed worth all the risk which may come from a broken heart. Sam sums it all up when he says "" Okay  lets do it Dad. Let us go get the (crap) kicked out of us for love"".<br/><br/>The combination of an award winning cast, great direction and theatrical elements viewers will not have to go great lengths to actually fall in love with this movie."

My favorite sentences is To me, You are perfect. Thats so sweet<br/><br/>Except many romantic and sweet scene in this movie, the background of London before Christmas make this movie more romantic.

And I am SO glad that I did because it has become one of my all-time favorites. It's sweet and charming and sad and depressing all at the same time. It shows so many different sides of human emotion that no matter who you are or where you are in your life, you will be able to relate somehow. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and find something new that you like about it each time. However, I think my favorite part was the scene with the posters and Kiera Knightly. Not only is she beautiful, but that part of the movie is so hopeful and sorrowful that it pulls you and grabs you into the scene with the actors, and they in turn make it feel believable. I think watching this type of fantasy movie is good sometimes. It sort of puts you in holiday mode and reminds you that there is love in the world, actually."

"tukaima-2","10","1","3","16 May 2005"," My family's favorite
","It's rare to find a movie that our whole family enjoys... with four amateur-avid movie fans of distinctly different age groups and tastes, we mostly end up minding our own business and politely nod to each other's favs. But Love Actually did actually got us all together on it: we loved it. You can never go wrong with love.<br/><br/>I think what I am most impressed about this film is how it can be so diverse, so deep, so complicated and yet still keeps itself together and entertains us all. When you have a story surrounding 1 couple - sure, go nuts with their personalities inside out, go nuts with their soap drama, you got all the time in the world. But eight? eight?? Can the audience even keep up the number? Can they even remember their names?? Yet Love Actually actually still went nuts with their personalities, and their drama, and entertained us all... through an incredibly well-interwoven story and of course, the powerful acting of the great actors. Take all the money you want and try to make this movie; you can't.<br/><br/>Most of all, with all these characters doing their own stuff, the movie's theme is unswayed - that love is everywhere and everywhere. The characters we saw during the 2 hour feature were non but a tiny subset of it all... And with so many different *kinds* of chemistries, so many different contrasting, even conflicting types of affairs, it makes a very rich experience that you cannot find in most other ""single dimensional"" romantic movies. Go get yourself some love today."

"DaytonaBob","Null","1","3","13 January 2005"," Wonderful Actually
","I am beyond mystified by those who attempt to critique this movie as though it was supposed to be on the par of Gone With The Wind or something equally ""important"".<br/><br/>It was a great movie with an upbeat attitude towards finding love whether you had it and didn't realize it, discovered it for the first time or just found the right person, but were a dollar short and a day late.<br/><br/>The characters are not supposed to be DEEP or well fleshed out, they are just characters in a story about LOVE not characters. I have come to the conclusion that those who hated it or took it apart have no souls or are afraid of love. No other reason could exist. That or they think ""JACKASS"" is the height of comedic talent and can't get past egger humor.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy highlights are laugh out loud. Nighy's character as an old rocker getting his second wind was just fabulous and his comment during the TV show about not paying for drugs just made me laugh loudly.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant was just terrific. His character is the PM and just like those further down the ladder of life is looking for love and it comes out of nowhere. I especially found his accommodation of the three little girls to be particularly nice. Too bad you know something like that would never happen in real life. Politicians are too in love with themselves to think of others.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman's character is perhaps my favorite. I do have to agree he should have made a romantic overture of some sort near the end. Would have made it perfect. BUT I can relate.<br/><br/>I wondered about the differing ""class"" schools as well until I saw it for a second (and third and fourth) time and realized there is a quick comment about several schools coming together for the first time to do this show.<br/><br/>The story involving Keira Knightly was so bittersweet as to be heartrending. Finding love but just a little too late.<br/><br/>My second favorite was the little boy Ben and his newly discovered True Love.

","British romantic comedies are virtually indistinguishable from their American counterparts. This is a blessing and a curse. The characters exist in a sort of rarefied air of effortless upper/upper middle class sensibility. However, this is so endemic to films it's not really worth going into. ""Kid in love"" part taken a little too seriously. I had crushes when I was eleven too, but my father wouldn't spend two seconds thinking about my puppy love infatuations, kids need to figure this sort of stuff out on their own. The shy porn stars? Don't think they exist. This goes in with ""unsightly Brit gets laid in Wisconsin"" bit. I know the writer is going for a certain kind of absurdest sensibility in his humor, but it just doesn't play. Americans in general like British accents- it doesn't really work the other way, unfortunately, but I think the Wisconsin Tourist Board was behind this in an attempt to lure British males to the land of Cheeseheads and Lands' End. Hugh Grant was good as the PM, funny in that bit about the SAS. What was that visit by the US President though? Billy Bob Thornton was a sort of Bush-arrogant/Clinton-lewd hybrid? I think those criticisms are probably accurate, but even Clinton would never openly make a pass at a British Government worker at Downing Street on an official state visit. Oh, and the press conference! Please! Brits- you are not some put upon, bullied country! Stop acting like you are! Only one country in the world exceeds America in terms of national chauvinism and arrogance and that's the UK! I lived there, I know. I love your guys, seriously, you have a beautiful country with tons to offer the world culturally and politically. But stop your whining. By the way, it is no longer brave or risqué to be so openly anti-American, it's very trendy and fashionable. And the people that applaud this sort of ""Cool Brittania"" counter attack to American bullying I'll wager know the least about international politics. I wish Billy Bob would've given back in that conference. Something even Jimmy Carter would've done. And Hugh Grant had a picture of Thatcher on the wall. Was he supposed to be a Tory? If so, that press conference was even farther off base than originally assessed."

","I think it might just be my own personality, but this movie has everything I want in a movie. First of all, I knew almost every actor in it. Being American you would not think it, but I have BBC America and follow more British shows / movies than those made in the US. I watched this because of Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, then recognized Keira Knightly for POTC, Thomas Sangster (from Miracle of the Cards, which had Brit Peter Wingfield) and the one who played Colin Frizzle, from My Family. It seemed like everywhere I looked, the actors were familiar.<br/><br/>That was step one. Then, I watched the movie and began to LIKE them all. I can't find one character I did not like. Although not fond of Hugh Grant, I came to LOVE the Prime Minister, and though I had not paid much attention to Emma Thompson or Colin Firth (I am more fond of the younger brother, Jonathan) before, after seeing this I started renting their movies. Yes, Sense and Sensibility was a quick acquisition! My biggest complaint, actually, is that I want to see all of the 3 hour version Curtis talks about when he shows us the deleted scenes. That and I liked the soundtrack and not all the songs in the movie are on it! The movie itself covers every sort of love there could be. Not just male/female love, but love of friends for each other, parents for children, children for other children (in other words, young love - nothing sexual), and, though it is only on those deleted scenes, even homosexual love. There are two cases of hopeless love, but mostly the movie is full of hope, and the acting is just so high quality.<br/><br/>I knew I was going to love the movie when I heard the opening speech, which was given by Grant's Prime Minister, David. In it he said he went to the airport to watch people arrive when he felt blue. Why? Because when people arrive, they show only love to the people meeting them there. You rarely find someone traveling miles to see someone and then start a screaming match as soon as the get there. Usually they hug each other. I had not thought of it that way, but think about it! And then, he says, as far as he knew, no one who called from the 911 airplanes called to give messages of hate. They all called loved ones to say goodbye. Love is everywhere, you just have to look for it."

"pintofsmooth","Null","1","3","19 October 2004"," Overambitious, flawed package
","There's no point resisting it  it comes around once a year and though it doesn't feel like it, you'll enjoy it once it arrives. If you think about it, Christmas and British romantic comedies are so similar, it's surprising they haven't been teamed up before. The latest offering from Richard Curtis is called Love Actually and it does just that, weaving the destinies of a huge array of characters as the on screen countdown closes in on the inevitable Christmas Eve climax. The film is Curtis's first as director, and this is a fact that weighs unbearably on the man and his movie as Love Actually is a mess, uneven in tone throughout and never managing to achieve any sense of depth to it's sketched out characters. While being far from a complete failure, the film's many and varied pleasures are too often overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the project, with too much screen time devoted to stories which frustrate rather than enrich.<br/><br/>In what must surely be the last time that the formula can be wheeled out to any degree of success, all the staples with which we have been so accustomed are present and correct. You want a scene involving repeated profanity for comic effect? Check. A man dancing in his underwear to naff 70s music? Of course. Dido on the soundtrack? Why not. A kid in an octopus suit? We've got plenty of them, and lobsters too. As obvious as all the above may be, these familiar concoction still works and the final half an hour of the film is as always the most interesting. There are too many wasted opportunities along the way though, too many character studies that are merely touched upon rather than investigated. We have no time to invest emotionally in these people and so there is little pleasure in seeing their various love lives get sorted out. The hugely underused Andrew Lincoln gets the film's most fitting line when he pauses to proclaim 'Enough', ironically just when we are dying for more on his particular situation.<br/><br/>Lincoln's is a case in point that for every plot that goes on too long, there is one of which we want to see more. Emma Thompson is excellent in what is essentially the movie's best and most well written role and the scene in which she receives an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband almost steals the entire film. Laura Linney is also superb in an intriguing but frustratingly truncated role as a woman whose retarded brother rules her life. The rest of the cast are happy enough to cruise through their under written parts in first gear, many of them simply reprising their characters from the assorted British television realms from which they are gathered. The central focus is left to Hugh Grant to be Hugh Grant, something which he does of course do very well. Even the most dyed in the wool Grant fan may be disappointed by his predicament, as even he is not allowed the screen time his character (the Prime Minister for goodness sake) deserves.<br/><br/>The scenes in which he does appear are usually enjoyable though, particularly one which features that octopus I mentioned earlier. Indeed, it is perhaps the children who hold the key to why the movie doesn't fall flat on its face, as the school Christmas concert, in both build up and aftermath, is undeniably charming. It is a good job that Love Actually does childhood emotion very well, because when it attempts to address the wider issues it veers dangerously close to bad taste. Grant is the victim of cringe worthy writing on both occasions, both of which involve clumsy attempts to tackle the post 9/11 relationship between Britain and America. Again, this is the same syndrome of over ambition, because Curtis undoubtedly does the simple things very well indeed. It's just a pity that the poignant moments jar too often with those attempts that are less successful.<br/><br/>There is plenty to enjoy here to ensure the crowds flock in and guarantee that the Curtis and Grant double act will be back. There are however, enough cracks and jars appearing in the winning formula to ensure that future efforts will have to progress considerably. You get the feeling that Richard Curtis's ambition has got the better off him in Love Actually, and while his confidence in handling 11 different story threads in his debut directorial outing is to be admired, his inexperience is too often noticeable and to the detriment of his finished article. Our attention is frequently drawn to the soundtrack, on which 'Love is all you need' is a recurring and insistent refrain. John Lennon's lyrics urge a return to the basics and the bare essentials. If only Curtis had taken the advice he is so desperate to communicate to his audience."

","Love Actually is a collection of stories about love, affecting the lives of a group of people, including a divorcee, a widower, a Prime Minister, a lonely American and a bride, each one struck by Cupids arrow and everyone of them feeling the pinch. Directed by Richard Curtis, Love Actually is a nauseating glimpse through the rose tinted glasses of a director who seems to have left reality behind when his pen hit the pad. It all seemed so promising. Richard Curtis, the man who co-penned the legendary Blackadder series, writing and directing a film starring Hugh Grant? This had winner written all over it. The result though is a film that so unmercifully throws the message of love at you, you begin to realise it is a four letter word. So what went wrong? Starting off the film with a voice over speaking of September 11th seems far too much a blatant attempt to commandeer an audience's emotions. Following this with a wedding couple being serenaded with the song All you need is love', it's then that the viewers know that the sickening feeling in their stomachs is not from an over liberal sprinkling of salt on their popcorn, but instead a film whose obsession with love would make Cupid himself consider a career change. Things are not helped on the cringe monitor by Liam Neeson, forced to teach his young son how to woo a girl. The cringe monitor is put to good use later with Colin Firth as a writer falling in love with his maid, and left with nothing else to do other than play lovesick puppy to a buttoned up sex kitten. The main plot, being the Prime Minister (played well by Hugh Grant) falling for his tea lady, is an engaging enough story to dominate over the sub plot stories that fight for equal billing. These include a wife (Emma Thompson) who believes her husband is having an affair, and the husband (Alan Rickman) giving her good reason to think so. However one good story is hampered by at least two entirely useless ones, such as a man (Kris Marshall) going off to America in order to get as much sex as possible (is that love, actually?) and two porn stars falling in love on set. Wishful thinking is evident in many scenes particularly when the Prime Minister (Grant) announces to the President of the United States that he refuses to be bullied. It is then that the viewer is once more thrown into an Alice In Wonderland territory; only this time the story itself feels written by the March hare. While a stab at reality is made by the inclusion of a woman trapped by her obligation to care for her mentally ill brother, the director leaves this unresolved, perhaps stepping away from a situation that compromises it's sunnier aspects. The films saving grace is Bill Nighy who plays an aging rocker out to promote his latest single to death to insure it being a Christmas number one. His scenes are generally funny and hint at the film it might have been had it been freed from the constraints of it's middle class shackles. What the world needs now is love, but not bad films written with good intentions, and Curtis' failing is his over enthusiasm to wear his heart on his sleeve, a sleeve that might be running out of tricks."

Bill Nighy is good in whatever he's in. Keira Knightley is actually acting in this movie and not just being another pretty face (a very pretty face...::wink wink::). She does a pretty good job, although sometimes during her dramatic parts she seems to be trying too hard.<br/><br/>And then there's The Prime Minister.... The Prime Minister is played by Hugh Grant. You really don't know what to think of him at first. But then at the end you find out more about him and what the bloody hell he's doing lusting over his pretty maid/secretary.

In<br/><br/>addition to that, the film itself seems to pander less to the US<br/><br/>market than have Curtis' own previous efforts (and most British<br/><br/>films these days) with references and cameos he cannot imagine<br/><br/>that Stateside audiences will appreciate.<br/><br/>    Curtis' main message, though, requires a LOT of belief-suspension: Love, apparently, really is all around. Every<br/><br/>character in the film falls deeply in love (nothing else in life seems<br/><br/>to matter nearly so much) and  ha!  all they have to do is reveal<br/><br/>their love and they will find that the other person is equally in love<br/><br/>with them! Not all the film's stories' endings are happy, despite<br/><br/>this, but the point is clearly made: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS<br/><br/>UNREQUITED LOVE!! Well, call me a cynic, but (to put it politely)<br/><br/>what a load of old tosh that is! Still, this is a romcom and you're<br/><br/>supposed to step out of reality into an ideal world... If only."

","It must come as a shock to anyone to have hugh grant bring up the events of September 2001 in order to sell a movie at its beginning.  To use that actual event which each of us thinks about every day from now on to sell your light and fluffy comedy is pure manipulation of audience's emotions. Having that as your opening gambit didn't put me in a mood to enjoying this film at all. <br/><br/>It is a clever idea to have a number of stories interconnect in some way and have them all come to the same conclusion. I am sure this would have been a better film if Richard Curtis had taken maybe 3 of the better stories and rejected the others. The stories on offer here ranged from the very funny to the downright dreadful, and this was the most annoying aspect of the whole film. An example of this was the contrast between the story involving the aging rock star, desperate to find a hit single despite admitting it was awful, and a totally pointless story about 2 pornography actors having fake sex. The Bill Nighy story has the lions share of the films best moments and it was a shame the whole film couldn't be about his character. It just makes it more annoying that we see as much of this tale as we see Laura Linney's troubled woman and her disabled brother.<br/><br/> Out of all the stories (I think there were 8) only 2 were substantial enough to maintain any interest throughout he film, the rock star story and the one with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson. The rest of the story lines included the cliched story about a best man falling in love with a married woman, which involved a rendition of all you need is love' in church which made me feel that all I needed was a nail to stick in my eyeball. We also had Hugh Grant being prime minister, which upset me more than any other part of the film, when he gives a cringe making speech about how great Britain is next to the US president  The special relationship has become a bad relationship' is the gist of it. I couldn't believe how crass and xenophobic this was, and in real life I hope a real prime minister would have been laughed out of office for such a speech, but the whole country seems to have loved Hugh Grant for it in the film.<br/><br/> The worst story of the film involved Liam Neeson encouraging his son to break security barriers at heathrow airport just to say goodbye to a girl from his school, something he couldn't manage an hour before apparently.  Oh and he meets Claudia Schiffer at a surprisingly competent school concert to make up for his dead wife.<br/><br/>Wouldn't the really existential thing to do at the end have been for a hijacked plane to crash into the airport terminal at the end when they are all having their lovey moments at once? To have Hugh Grant's voice over like at the start saying I told you love was all around but you didn't listen so we had to kill all the characters' This is not to say this is a totally bad film. There are enough laughs in the stories that work to make up for the ones that don't, but it still doesn't excuse the fact that half the film shouldn't have been made."

","What an incredibly dumb and stupid movie this is!  Hugh Grant was OK - there is a nice moment when he, as the British Prime Minister, basically tells the American President to go to hell - but the movie's concept is so idiotic that nothing can save it.<br/><br/>Apparently the screenwriter had noticed how pleasant the scene is at London's Heathrow Airport, when long-separated people see each other again, and hug and kiss.  That's OK, for a 15-second movie.  Then introduce lots of first and second-rate British actors, many of them gorgeous but vapid, and link all these people we don't care about with many, many, various inane love stories, and have ""I Love You"" romantic moments, over and over and over again, like an endless Heathrow Airport receiving line gone haywire, or a Paul McCartney inspired ""All You Need Is Love"" computer virus (or its sister virus ""Silly Love Songs"") replicating itself in a Darwinian frenzy across the Internet, for 2 1/2 excruciating hours.

Hugh Grant is his usual self, Martine McCutcheon is enjoyable, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are more laid back, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln are both good young stars whilst the film belongs to Bill Nighy as a foul mouthed rock star. Other performances also hit home from the likes of Martin Freeman, Kris Marshall, Colin Firth (more enjoyable than most of the time) and Laura Linney. Plus there are fun cameos from Ant and Dec, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, Michael Parkinson and Claudia Schiffer. The film is very funny and very sweet in equal measures. It focuses more on the romance than the comedy but the film is never lame or over the top. The film's main problem is the fact that there are too many stories so many of them don't get a lot of attention (especially Keira Knightley, Kris Marshall and Martin Freeman). But this more shows the director Curtis is getting across the point that there many different types of love to be told about but that love is a simple thing. Liam Neeson is the love of his son, Bill Nighy's shows the pleutonic love of his and his manager and then Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon show a love in odd places as does Martin Freeman in a strange way.This is a sweet and funny story that should warm the most cynical of hearts.9/10"

"davrosc","Null","1","3","23 November 2003"," The for and against debate
","****************** SPOILERS AHEAD ************************<br/><br/>Love Actually appears to be a movie that fiercely divides people: Cosmo in the UK Sunday Times called it ""smaltschy' (although that's probably spelt wrong). IMDB users differ from fantastic to likes & dislikes to simply nauseous (or even `nautious' in some cases!!). I'd like to address some of these opinions and add my own.<br/><br/>Firstly to those like Cosmo that thought the film was over sentimental, that it wrapped up too neatly, and other such comments. My answer: yes and no. While it's true to say that Love Actually is a manipulative film, I think it should rather be viewed more as a fairytale. Critics are a hard bunch. Their main problem is they would have been sitting there almost in tears and yet annoyed that a movie should affect them so. Why can't they just sit back and relax? Admittedly some of the stories were silly and implausible, such as Colin's [Kris Marshall] trip to the girl haven of America. But can't we put these niggles aside?<br/><br/>Furthermore the story is not wrapped up. This is NOT a traditional love story or necessary a happy ending. The point is rather that love can be found, lost, misplaced, re appropriated. Of the storylines only a few are optimistic in finale. Daniel [Liam Neeson] has lost his one love by her death. Daniel's son expresses his feelings to Joanna, yet the story offers no real pointers to which way this could swing: she revisits London at the end of the movie but is this just for a week, a month? Who knows? Karen [Emma Thompson] is faced with the dilemma of not knowing whether to stick or split. Her husband Harry [Alan Rickman] has succumbed to his secretary and bought her a necklace. We do not see if there was sex involved or how far the relationship went however. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Mark [Andrew Lincoln] is in love with his best friend's wife [Keira Knightley]. Sarah and Carl [Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro] also fizzle as she decides that she is going to put her disturbed brother before any office relationship. The stories that do end on an upbeat are those of Natalie and the PM [Martine McCutcheon and Hugh Grant], and Jamie [Colin Firth]. Not exactly then a film that wraps up neatly and optimistically all round. <br/><br/>The skill of Love Actually is in its true to life stories: not everything does turn out all right in the end. For those who say the film has followed in the steps of mainstream American cinema with the glitz and the glamour, it hasn't. You cannot divorce it from it's British flavour, not merely because of the scenes of the Thames, Selfridges, and other landmarks.<br/><br/>
And to those who said there was too much nudity: only two stories contain any nudity as far as I recall. Laura Linney, which could be construed as unnecessary, and Judy and John, the movie stand-ins [Joanna Page and Martin Freeman]. Here the nudity seems appropriate, as it is one of the most touching storylines. They come to work, know each other's bodies in detail, and yet talk about traffic and small talk. It's unusual that to people that have seen each other naked and simulated sex together before even going out, it is a kiss that they are both hesitant about and which means everything.<br/><br/>
The cast is literally superb. The storylines may not interlink as much as people would like. Some of it is silly and sometimes, as much as cameos are quite cool, they can get a little overwhelming  Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer, Ant & Dec, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, etc etc. Working Title and Curtis have obviously though hard about the marketing of the film, the stories, the pitches, to set it 4 weeks before Christmas and then release it 4 weeks before Christmas. But what they've formed is a top-notch film. It begins and ends with the Heathrow arrivals scene, with real people meeting their loved ones. This is a film about love, about people and their connections, however much it is showered with big name stars and cameos. It is a film that neither tells us what love should be or dictate to us.<br/><br/>If I've at times been ineloquent, I've tried to misplace some of the complaints mentioned against this film. Some are just malicious gibbering against British films in general, others about how it doesn't live up to other films. I think this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Far superior to the bad films recently and a nice alternative to badly made action films; here I'm thinking of Charlie's Angles 2, Matrix Revolutions, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen among others. All films have errors and problems, and this is no exception, but it is a great movie. And that can't be said of every film out there."

","What a sweet feel good movie! I liked Love Actually very much actually! The movie's central theme is-what else-love. And how love can be found anywhere. You just have to look for it. OK-call the movie sappy, call it corny etc-but also call it good, very good. In a time when there are so many movies where the central themes are violence and indeed at a time when there is so much violence all around us-not just the movies-isn't it NICE to have a sweet little fairytale of a movie once in awhile? <br/><br/>Now some people have said there were to many stories in the movie and although I could understand that I enjoyed all of them. Some stories got more time then others and I did feel that some should have got more time that didn't. Still thats a minor criticism. GO SEE THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T! It'll leave you feeling good. And some scenes will make you laugh hysterically, there is a lot of humor in this movie too.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: My only problem with the movie was with Laura Linny(Sarah's) storyline. It was not wound up neatly-to the contrary it seems like the writers forgot about her completely. I know that not everything can end happy in real life. Still-if the movie was going for sappy and uplifting it should have gone all the way. To just leave one of the best story lines hanging like that-it took away a little something. Even if Sarah and Carl did NOT wind up together there should have been a final scene between them. Also the whole theme of the movie is you should speak out and proclaim how you feel. So why didn't Sarah speak out to Carl and just TELL him about her brother? I think, though, the writers were trying to say that love comes in many ways and her story was about her love for her brother rather then her love for a boyfriend. Still I'm a sucker for happy endings so I didn't like that!<br/><br/>All in all though I still felt Love Actually was a nine of 10. And the BEST scenes by far was the opening and closing(people hugging in the airport etc). When life feels particularly bitter, a movie like this is heaven. Definitely one of the must see movies of the year!"

There were plenty of laughs and some enjoyable characters in this uneven pastiche, but the coarse and silly kiddie romance--- replete with a most unfunny breech of airport security at the end--- left me feeling as though everyone involved in creating this film is not only childless, but also clueless about the events of 9/11."

These stories are all intertwined, but they don't come together as well as I would like. By far the best involved Hugh Grant as a newly elected Prime Minister moving into 10 Downing Street. Also wonderfully done was a storyline dealing with a newly widowed Liam Neeson and his  stepson. Equally moving was a look at a marriage on the rocks with Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>There were five or six other storylines. I couldn't really tell you what they were about because they bored me. There was a very odd situation involving an annnoying Englishman going to Wisconsin to find easy American girls. I have no clue why that didn't end up on the cutting room floor ... although I saw an early preview of this so maybe they did wise up and cut it out.<br/><br/>I think this movie could've been great if they had cut down on some of the stories and focused on just a few of the really good ones.

Best watched during the Christmas fever  and guess what, so was the case with me albeit 2008 (5-years late, but he ho!).<br/><br/>A very-very British movie, unique concept and fantastic handling. Seriously a must watch.<br/><br/>PS:: London looks beautiful in the Christmas lights!!"
"christieasmetana","9","1","4","13 October 2008"," great movie!
","I really enjoyed this movie and the various story lines. I think the time line (all of this happening in 5 weeks) is unrealistic but I think that the actions, reactions and thoughts of some of the characters are very realistic and amusing (like Laura Linney covering her face after she almost literally runs into the guy she's in love w/)! I did find the scene where the British young man goes to American and meets the women in a bar somewhat confusing (at least from the perspective of an American). I'm not sure if this was supposed to poke fun at the stereotype of Americans loving guys w/ British accents or if the British actually believe that the average American woman will meet and sleep w/ a British guy just b/c he's British (or b/c he's there).<br/><br/>Also, I think the American president role was intended to be based on the actions/personality of Clinton given the way the character seemed to attempt to seduce the woman in the Prime Minister's office.<br/><br/>All in all though, a great movie if only b/c it shows that love is never free from struggles and problems but that makes it all the better when it's obtained."
"yellowdiamond","10","1","4","2 December 2006"," One of my favorite Fantasy Movies
","I have seen this movie about 10 times and I will probably watch it another 50. The Brits are renowned for keeping their emotions bottled up. They agonize about embarrassing moments. They cringe at the thought of expressing their deepest hopes and dreams. Yet, one day a year, even the Brits will risk it all -- spilling out the truth - on Christmas. It's magic. Love Actually is about a proudly repressed culture that allows itself to erupt with passion, poke fun at itself, and for one day only - wear its emotions on its nation's sleeve. The story gently makes fun of America and Americans putting us on an equal plane so we can laugh at ourselves too -- and well we should. So many great scenes too. What can I say except that I carry this movie with me in my own DVD player -- my heart -- every day of the year -- especially at Christmas."

","It's hard to believe it's been three years since this came out. When I went to see this I had no idea how wonderful it was going to be. Also I'm really glad we got see this one in the movies. The way the whole thing comes together in the last few minutes (in the airport w/ the Beach Boys song) was one of the best ""movie moments"" I've experienced in years. I recently watched it on DVD and although it's still great fun...seeing this on the big screen was a real treat. The scene with Emma Thompson breaking down to Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now is also a highlight of the film. So many great actors in one film and so many great songs it's hard to believe it works but it does. Sure it's corny in spots but it's also filled with really great actors actually acting for a change with dialog that is rich and genuinely funny. My hat is off to the cast and Richard Curtis for giving us what I believe is a new Holiday classic."

Since Christmas is only a few weeks away I saw it for the fifth time the other day, no disappointment this time either. Hugh Grant is great in this one and what can you say about Bill Nighy? He's absolutely fantastic and his role here is quite different from the one in Pirates 2... Actually no one falls out of the line here, Liam Neeson does a great job, Alan Rickman is good as always.

"PhilippaS","10","1","4","19 April 2005"," One of my favorite movies
","I have watched this movie at least ten times and each time I notice nuances that I missed before. The story is a little confusing at the beginning but all the strands come together as the characters' lives intertwine. It is very romantic. One of the most moving love scenes occurs between the Colin Firth character and his Portugese cleaner. They talk to each other without being able to understand the other's language. They don't even touch but the passion is lying just beneath the surface. The movie covers most aspects of love, from unrequited love, selfless love and betrayed love to first love, optimistic love and shy love. The movie is funny but at the same time sad. It's serious but contains moments of farce. The pacing of the action works well, keeping the viewer interested. The musical score adds to the enjoyment. This is a ""must see"" movie"
"Kiski","10","1","4","13 February 2005"," A great movie, even if you don't usually like the genre.
","Why I love this movie is that it makes you feel a lot. It is a typical romantic comedy / drama and a very funny and unique movie in the same package. It shows the different sides of love and how love isn't something simple, ever. Every bit of this movie is amazing. <br/><br/>The cast is one of the best being that there is so many characters all together. Even the smaller roles are set with good actors. The beginning might be a little confusing with all the flashes about different people in different settings but as the movie goes on the pieces and connections between people begin to come together. Of course this is something that has been used a lot in the last few years, knitting short episodes together in to a full story, but this movie does it in a way that doesn't seem ""old"" as in some other films lately. <br/><br/>I must say that I haven't been a fan of Hugh Grant, the second best male actor with only two slightly different expressions, (the best still being Steven Seagal...) but he really does it in this role. In the same time he is everything he has been since Four weddings and a funeral but also something more. Much less serious, less annoying and much more fun than before. Then there are the amazing other actors like Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney and many more. Even Rowan Atkinson in a small but hilarious role. <br/><br/>The music is in the same time genius and a bit too obvious. Of course this is something I would use myself if I ever was in charge of choosing songs to any movie so I like it. I would definitely choose songs where the lyrics meet the movie like in this one. The songs are well-known and that might annoy some people but to me they are just right in this movie. Also the music that is conducted for the movie is great, if you're interested in the musical part of the whole thing, just check the bonus materials from the DVD. <br/><br/>There is a lot to talk about and so many great things in this movie that I'd better stop now before I go overboard with it. If you would like to see a movie that makes you laugh, makes you cry (specially if you're a girl), has a talented cast, good music and clever dialog, see this. Even if you're not a fan of the genre."

The greatest living actors in all of England got together (with a couple of Americans) to create a Christmas card.  A few of the many stories made me teary-eyed, and the story of the has-been rock star was hilarious.  The way the stories link up in various ways makes the movie into a giant jigsaw puzzle.  It's one of the great Christmas movies, up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Christmas Story.""

"highwaytourist","6","1","5","29 April 2011"," ""Love American Style"" knockoff is notable for its cast, not its content
","When I heard about this film's box office success and ""who's who"" of British talent, I expected something that was sharp, funny, and romantic. What I got was a string of celebrity vignettes in ordinary situation comedy skits. It's easy to take and has enough laughs and romance for its running time, but fell short of my expectations. Take away the A-list cast and some of the sexual content and there is nothing that you haven't seen before. It could have easily been called ""Love British Style."" Liam Neeson's role as a recently widowed man was the most moving, but because it happened to him in real life, not because of anything that happens in this film. Laura Linney is given a reasonably compelling role, but the story hits a dead end, as if the writers didn't know what to do with her character. Hugh Grant is cast as the Prime Minister, but the role is written to suit his on-screen persona so his performance here seems generic and his pursuit of a member of his staff member seems far-fetched. Emma Thompson does well, but her role is pure soap opera. One can easily sit through this film and even enjoy it at times, as I did, but don't expect anything more than an decent time filler."

","This film is hilarious. I apologise if English film humour has moved on since Carry On, Benny Hill and Are you Being Served but there you go. Tout passe. Perhaps it would help if American producers didn't force English directors to do so much safety shooting for the American version, dumbing it down before release in the States.<br/><br/>It's funny.<br/><br/>It's far from perfect. It is more like a box of candy than an oil painting, but it's all beautifully wrapped, if you follow me. It does show more than a few sharp edges, having been edited down from 3 hours to two. You can smooth them out again with the deleted scenes on the DVD. The additional stuff between Liam Neeson and Thomas Sangster is excellent and should have been kept in place of The Bay City Rollers funeral scene, ripped off from The Big Chill.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that it's supposed to be funny. In fact Bill Nighy's performance is making me laugh again just typing a comment about it.<br/><br/>If you don't find it funny, you should try and look for the humour.<br/><br/>If you do and still can't see it, then you're probably best letting it pass harmlessly over your head - as nature intended.<br/><br/>And anyway, just how gorgeous is Lúcia Moniz?"

"toriti","Null","1","5","5 May 2004"," Fantastic! (actually)
","I first saw this film when it came out on the big screen and since then it has reappeared at home numerous times. I love this film! It's a brilliantly structured collage of different relationships that could prove to be subjects of effective films on their own. Richard Curtis should probably have been directing his scripts all along, because he certainly knows how to put together an enjoyable film (not to say that his previous works haven't been great as well). The top notch cast helps to deliver a film that's not only very funny, but also incredibly moving (particularly the relationship between the characters of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman). Golden Globe nominee Bill Nighy was a stand out as Billy Mack - a has-been rock star 'trying to make a comeback'."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","5","6 February 2004"," Six Degrees of Separation and Excellence.
","There has long been a thought that we were all separated by six degrees. In other words, we are only a few people away from knowing more people and then more people and ultimately the entire world is connected as one perfect whole. ""Love Actually"" is a wonderful, witty, whimsy, funny, dramatic, smart, intelligent, heartbreaking, heartwarming and life-affirming tale by first time director Richard Curtis (who also wrote) that is easily the finest film of its type ever made. In present-day England a seemingly endless cast of characters are all connected in one way or another in a wild and frantic ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Traffic"" style that is truly remarkable. New British Prime Minister Hugh Grant (who could best be described as the anti-Tony Blair) immediately falls in love with curvy secretary Martine McCutcheon. McCutcheon happens to be neighbors with the super-sexy Heike Makatsch, a temp at a company business who is trying to seduce her new boss (the always good Alan Rickman). He may actually take the bait, but the big problem is that he is married to wife Emma Thompson (who is also Grant's little sister). Thompson has not been paying attention to Rickman's change because she has been consoling friend Liam Neeson after his wife passes away of a long illness. Their relationship is strictly platonic, but still loving. Neeson's young stepson (the priceless Thomas Sangster) has his first taste of puppy love with a girl his age (newcomer Olivia Olson) from America who could best be described as a 10-year-old reincarnation of Beyonce Knowles. Still more connections follow as seductress Makatsch is actually dating artist Andrew Lincoln. Lincoln though has no feelings for Makatsch and vice versa as he has shyly fallen in love with Keira Knightley (who has had a breakthrough year if ever there was one). The love is quiet and from afar though as Lincoln just happens to be best friends with Knightley's new husband (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Thus Lincoln acts like he does not like Knightley when she is around to curb his true feelings towards her. One of Knightley's friends (Colin Firth, another constant stand-out) attends her wedding, but is shocked to find his live-in girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) having sex with his brother (Dan Fredenburgh) when he returns home. Firth, a writer, is heartbroken and feels that he must get away for a while. He goes to a French villa that he owns and immediately falls in love with Portuguese house-keeper Lucia Moniz. The only problem is: they have no clue of what the other is saying. Thus Firth has fallen in love with her and she with him, but they do not know the other's true feelings through their words. When Moniz has to return to her homeland, will Firth be able to forget about her and vice versa? Of course we all hope not. And still more goes on. Two adult film stars (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page) have no trouble simulating sex, but have a real issue with intimacy. They both slowly find they have more in common than their jobs and discover a love that is hard for each to express. Freeman also happens to be friends with Ejiofor and thus another connection is created. American Laura Linney, who works for Rickman, has fallen in love with oblivious co-worker Rodrigo Santoro. It actually seems that the duo may find love with one another, but Linney constantly gets phone calls from her mentally unstable brother (the committed Michael Fitzgerald) and feels an obligation to take care of him and let her own wants take a backseat. The fact that their parents have passed away has left Linney lonely and driven Fitzgerald crazy. An under-sexed young adult Kris Marshall (who worked at Knightley's wedding) comes to the conclusion that he is an erotic love machine (even though he has had no luck with women). He gets it in his mind that the problem is not him, but British women. Thus he decides to go to America, to Wisconsin of all places (!?), to find beautiful girls. He surprisingly finds lots of them (Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert and Ivana Milicevic), but it is unclear what their motives with him really are. Everything gets a break with scene-stealer Bill Nighy (in an unforgettably excellent part) as a seemingly washed-up rock musician who has struggled with drug abuse in the past. He gets on the radio and in front of the camera and says anything that is on his wild mind. His thoughts are simply hilarious as well. Nighy about worries long-time manager Gregor Fisher to death with his unrehearsed antics. There is also department store worker Rowan Atkinson (of ""Mr. Bean"" fame) who continues to quietly play a key role in the happenings. Oh and let's not forget uncomplimentary U.S. presidential caricature Billy Bob Thornton (just imagine the worst things about Bill Clinton and George W. Bush mixed together to form the worst world leader you have ever seen) and his short appearance with prime minister Grant and secretary McCutcheon. Whew. ""Love Actually"" pushes the envelope on being the smartest screenplay I have ever encountered. Richard Curtis (best known for writing the ""Mr. Bean"" series and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") is able to go beyond his musings. The reason? Curtis is an amazingly gifted director (I really did not think he would be as successful in this regard). The movie is a lot deeper than it appears on the surface. References to 9-11 early on and the Grant/Thornton characters show Curtis' disgust with British and American affairs today. The film preaches love and not war and ends up being an angry commentary to involvement in Iraq. This movie quietly becomes an anti-war film on par with monumental pictures like ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". It is no secret that I have been disappointed all year with motion pictures, but ""Love Actually"" is superior enough to raise the level of 2003 as a whole. This is truly beyond excellence. I love this picture and it touched my heart, mind and soul. There are not many films in a lifetime that will do that to you. 5 stars out of 5."

"MartinHafer","8","1","6","21 December 2008"," This is a great film to watch with a box of Kleenex
","This film is an odd one in my household. Although my wife is a rather famous romance writer, for once I actually liked a romantic film more than her. I think the reason for our divergent views is that in most romance novels, all the nice people get the love of their lives by the end of the film. However, in LOVE ACTUALLY, some do but others do not. So, if you need to have a romance where everything works out perfectly, this is NOT the film for you. However, if you are like me and don't mind a bit of ambiguity about the characters, then you are sure to love this film.<br/><br/>This story is a complicated film where there are many different stories occurring at the same time just before Christmas. What ties this all together is that the various stories all relate to each other somehow. In other words, this film is about people and their friends also have separate stories that diverge. I rarely have seen this type of film work so well.<br/><br/>I could spend a lot of time talking about all the plots but I won't bother. Part of this is because there isn't enough space here to adequately do it and part of it is because there are tons and tons of very thorough reviews already on IMDb for this film, so I don't want to plow familiar ground. Read these longer reviews if you are interested in a play-by-play analysis.<br/><br/>Instead, understand that some of the romances work out perfectly, others are uncertain and others are heart-breakers--just like in real life. In fact, that's the beauty of this film. While you really can't believe all the plots (some are very, very far-fetched and silly), all the people talk like real people. And the romances are just so adorable and sweet you can't watch this film and keep a dry eye. Plus, in the cases where the romance fails, I liked them as well because they all had wonderful object lessons for us all.<br/><br/>Amazingly acted, directed and written--this is one case where a popular film actually deserves all the hoopla. In the UK it's sold like a bazillion DVDs and I can see why.<br/><br/>By the way, there were only two things about the film I did not particularly like. First, the Prime Minister's love interest (Natalie) was a lovely woman but repeatedly throughout the film they made fat jokes about her. This made no sense, as she was gorgeous and the comments tended to reinforce the stereotype that a beautiful woman must be stick-thin--like Keira Knightley. Even if she was overweight, which she wasn't, this is gross to say and the film made it seem cute or funny to do so (not just with her but with a Portuguese lady as well). She was curvy and even if these gross comments were true, women are supposed to have curves and not be anorexic!! Second, the scene where the little boy runs through security really, really annoyed me. In reality, the kid would have either been shot or arrested and the airport would have been shut down--yet the movie shows no consequences for this insanely stupid and selfish behavior. Neither problem ruined the film but they did detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant movie."

","""Love Actually"" is a fun, witty, and clever film that hits its target more than it misses, and as a comedy, that is enough to make it exceptional.<br/><br/>The film starts with the extraordinary statement by Hugh Grant that cell phone calls from the 9/11 planes show how much love is in the world.<br/><br/>Well, citing terrified calls from people being murdered as an example of the fullness of love, certainly shows the European perspective is a sunny one.<br/><br/>Throughout the film though, it is the love-lorn Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) that repeatedly tests our suspension of disbelief, such as when he fixates on a lowly poddy-mouthed secretary, and conducts a personal door to door search for her on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>The film is generally upbeat, although we eventually discover that ""love actually"" peters out in middle age to be replaced by deception and dejection. This is quickly swept under the carpet though since all of the young people end up happy.<br/><br/>The ""stand up and cheer"" moment in the film comes fairly early on, when the Prime Minister confronts the slimy-American President (is that superfluous?) in a press conference.<br/><br/>The happy moment for all Europeans is not dimmed by the fact that the P.M. was incapable of any disagreement with the President until the latter moved in on his biscuit-and-tea Bimbo. Still, if you feel politically impotent I guess you take your licks where you can get them.<br/><br/>American's can take heart from the fact that their women (particularly ones with comic-book accents) are apparently useful as sex-toys for starved British men, which certainly redefines the ""special relationship"".<br/><br/>In summary, the film is funny, moves quickly, and lets you hate America if you're in the mood."

With a carousel of  characters from a young boy to a couple of softcore actors to a rock star to the Prime Minister and more, this panorama of people passes round and round before our eyes as they gravitate towards one another more or less awkwardly falling in love until the culmination when the music swells and the couples come rapturously together. Sassy, silly, sarcastic, and sentimental, this fun flick features an excellent cast, good production value, great music, and a solid pedigree. On the downside, it's schmaltzy, unabashedly contrived, corny, commercial and  conglomerated. For romantics only, ""Love Actually"" requires a certain amount of just going with it.

","I'm probably the only person in the world who didn't want to immediately return to the movie theaters and watch Love Actually again and again when it came out. With a huge cast, a Christmas setting, and tiny romantic vignettes that are unrealistically optimistic and allow for very little character development, it's a cinch that this movie would be beloved by all. There are so many storylines, you're bound to find someone you like, and there's probably someone in the cast that drew you to the movie theaters in the first place. And since it's Christmas, everyone likes movies with happy endings. I'll stick with my Hallmark marathon, but if you love this movie, you're in good company with millions of others.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy plays a burnt out pop singer turning his hit song into a Christmas song, which we're treated to about a dozen times throughout the movie. He's alone during the holidays, but he does have a steadfast friend in his manager, Gregor Fisher. Liam Neeson is a widower whose extremely young son believes he's fallen in love with a classmate who's moving. Rather than sitting the infant down and explaining that he'll experience exactly the same feeling with another classmate the next term, Liam tells his son that love is the most important thing in the world, and he has to declare his feelings before the girl leaves town. I know it's supposed to be heartwarming, but Thomas Sangster is in middle school! It left my eyes dry. Hugh Grant is the British Prime Minister, and while he's bored to tears dealing with the American president, Billy Bob Thornton, his wandering eye catches a lowly maid, Martine McCutcheon. This vignette is intended to inspire a belief that true love conquers any social, economic, and class boundary. First of all, that's not the case, and second of all, if it didn't work for me in Cinderella, Love Actually isn't going to change my mind.<br/><br/>Next up is Alan Rickman, a hardworking businessman with very little happiness in his life. Sparks fly with his secretary Heike Makatsch, but since her hair and makeup reek of ""fun fling"" and his wife Emma Thompson is given a tearjerker scene to get the audience on her side, you can bet your bottom dollar he's spending Christmas at home. I was rooting for Heike to make Alan happy, so without giving definitive spoilers, let's go to the next vignette. Colin Firth takes a vacation for Christmas after getting dumped, and completely on the rebound, he falls in love with Lucia Moniz. He speaks no Portuguese, and she speaks no English. Again, this is supposed to be charming and sweet.<br/><br/>Laura Linney gives American audiences someone without an accent to root for, and as she has a crush on the hunk at the office, Rodrigo Santoro, her romantic life has always taken a backseat to her on-call care for her mentally-off brother. Do you think the office Christmas party might give her a break? Once again, we have another plot point that doesn't think any further than the morning after. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page are given what's probably supposed to be the funniest segment. They're body doubles who spend their days on a film set acting in sex scenes, but they're both incredibly polite and shy. Rowan Atkinson has a small but important role in other people's vignettes, but isn't given a romance.<br/><br/>And finally, we have the most famous segment: Andrew Lincoln holding up signs outside Keira Knightley's house telling her he loves her. Why is this romantic when her husband is his best friend, Chiwetel Ejiofor? Why is this teaching people good things, that ""at Christmas, we tell the truth"" when on an earlier sign, he told Keira to lie to her husband and pretend Christmas carolers had rung the doorbell? And what will happen the day after Christmas? Why are we supposed to root for this vein of infidelity when we were supposed to root against Alan Rickman's office affair?<br/><br/>As you can guess, I didn't add this movie to my Christmas collection. If you've never seen it, and my arguments make sense to you, you might want to skip it. If you've seen it and love it, you probably haven't made it this far in my review."

","I enjoy ensembles. I like the theme of how everyone has a life, everyone has problems, each individual lives their own life main plot, and how everyone turns out to be related. I liked this film because it succeeds in showing that. However, working with a story composed of many equally important plots is no easy task, since there's limited screen time available. And I think that's what ends up affecting Love Actually. I feel some of the plots were rushed, like the one of the Portuguese girl, the one of the guy in love with his friend's wife, and even the Alan Rickman's one . Others even felt unnecessary and that added nothing to the plot, like the ginger guy traveling to America. I liked how the revelations of how each character is related with each other escalate, but it was tough for me to process how at the end everyone knows each other. Overall, the story is good and complies with the basics, but I think it misses in going a step beyond that."

The film itself was mostly over sentimentalised and predictable claptrap but it didn't take itself seriously and it easily passed both the 6 and 10 laugh test, although I did often laugh at how ridiculous it all was. I hated the Bill Nighy song but maybe I'm just being overly grumpy. The ending was so sickly that I felt I needed to purify myself with a Ken Loach drama.

"msisidora","9","0","1","26 April 2018"," Love Actually Is All Around
","Love Actually is one of the few ensemble cast, multiple storyline films that seems to have pervaded popular culture in recent years that actually--pardon the pun--works. Unlike Valentine's Day or New Years Eve (just to name a few), Love Actually manages to create a cohesive film with an all-star cast and just enough story lines for watchers to be invested in each characters hardships and happiness. Perhaps the greatest success that Love Actually can boast is the expert use of the multiple storyline structure to bring more than one kind of relationship to the forefront of this romantic comedy. Liam Neeson portrays a recently widowed stepdad, coming to terms with the loss of his wife while learning to care for his love-lorn stepson; Laura Linney plays a lonely ex-pat, unable to invest in her own romantic life because her responsibilities to her mentally ill brother; Bill Nighy demonstrates the love a washed up rockstar has for his manager and his constant and only companion throughout his career; Andrew Lincoln, who plays Mark, shows us the bittersweet side of an unrequited love with his best friend's wife. All these relationships--father to son, sister to brother, friend to friend, and lover to almost lover--come together to create a beautiful collage of varying human relationships. Of course more typical love interested are also included with Colin Firth's cross-cultural relationship with his portuguese employee or Prime Minister Hugh Grant's love for a member of his household staff. However, the inclusion of these varying types of love all echo the very opening lines of this movie, that ""love actually is all around"" in the form of ""fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends and old friends"". Love Actually is truly a tribute to the human experience, as it honors all the different forms that love comes in. 
It's easy to categorize Love Actually as an overdone, overly sugary and cliched film, but this would ignore all the complications that the movie tackles. The heartbreak, sadness, unrequitedness, and grief that inevitably come with loving--with being so invested in another human--are not only included, but heavily considered through out this film. Emma Thompson, a dedicated friend and devoted mother and wife, discover that her husband, Alan Rickman, has gifted another woman jewelry for Christmas. The scene that ensues is impossible to forget as she stands in the bedroom she shares with said husband, her children and husband just on the other side of the wall. The scene is so touching and so evocative because her dilemma is so clear; she's been betrayed but as she stands in the home that she's built with her husband, with the family they share together, she cannot let go of their life together. She still loves and it's because she loves that she was able to be so broken. Laura Linney's character, mentioned above, is perhaps an even sadder tale. She sacrifices her love for her coworker Carl, for the love and wellbeing of her mentally ill brother. Love Actually is full of moments, like Laura's stuggle between her own interest and her brothers, or Emma Thompson disillusionment with her marriage, that grapple with real problems, real emotions and real struggles. Death, infidelity, mental illness, sexual harassment in the workplace and unrequited love are all serious issues dealt with in Love Actually that one would not typically associate with a movie that markets itself as ""the ultimate romantic comedy"". However, despite these darker issues, a talented cast manages to create comedic moments even in the face of more serious issues. Of course, there also moments purely created for comedic effect, seemlessly woven in as a result of the multiple storyline structure. Rowan Atkinson's cameo as a store clerk allows for a lighthearted break from heavier material while the sex-driven Colin's search for love in America also provides comedic moments. 
So many ensemble cast films fall flat in their execution despite being littered with classic tropes and ample star power. Love Actually avoids this failing by making use of a talented cast, evocative emotional scenes, comedic relief and the mulitple story line structure that highlights all the kinds of love that exist."

","So I watched this at the theatres when it first came out, with my sister and our children (ages 7 to 11) and in the third row from the front. Obviously last minute pick. At that time, I enjoyed it, found it entertaining. Didn't care for the Martin Freeman (naked stand-ins) story line - then mostly due to the fact that we had our children with us! So now watching it at home, 15 years later, I'm floored by how relevant this movie is--I still don't like the MF story line though. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, the writing is good, the direction is on-point. Re-watching it, what surprised me is the story line with Hugh Grant. When I first watched this, I thought the character of the American President seemed over-the-top and unrealistic, but as I watched it tonight, I could not believe it! Billy Bob Thornton as the American President was playing Donald Trump. Wow!<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie captured the ""agony of love"", all its pitfalls, its joys, its mundaneness and its reality.

I understand that it is about several lives, which mostly intersect throughout the course of the film, but challenging in getting used to one story-line; some I like more than others.<br/><br/>Deciding to give this film a go again recently, I like it a great deal. Colin Firth is always charming; my favorite character here, but his segments feel really short. Hugh Grant is always entertaining. Laura Linney is good here also. The scenes between her and her brother that take place where he is in a mental care facility are some of my favorites. This film certainly can hit some emotional highs. I like Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, especially the scene in the department store with Rowan Atkinson as a salesman. <br/><br/>It can be a pretty sexy film sometimes. There's quite a bit of eye candy to be sure such as seeing Martin Freeman and well, there are some other blokes.

","Richard Curtis, one of Britain's most successful screenwriters, turns his hand to directing and virtually every successful British A list actor falls in love in Love Actually, a rom com of epic proportions. 10 stories unfold across the film in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with a one month later epilogue. Love Actually starts off superbly but then fails to sustain itself across its full 2 hour runtime. The cast charms throughout, with Liam Neeson giving a touching and likable performance far away from his recent action typecast role and Bill Nighy stealing the show as an aging rock star. The film is sweeter than a box of Lindt chocolate and often feels like an extended sugar rush. It's sentimental, but its' difficult not to be genuinely charmed by it. Richard Curtis, with his razor sharp humour and wonderfully British writing, gives us laughs galore, and for the first hour the film is more often than not hysterical. Although the movie devolves as it goes along, it remains funny throughout, and Curtis proves himself a good director as well.<br/><br/>The problem with Curtis is that his films are feel good, but they don't offer enough conflict and can just feel like syrupy fantasies. Without actors like Hugh Grant, these romances might not work at all. The stories in LA don't have enough conflict and at times I found myself wondering where it was headed, as the film's only real message, love is all around, is one we've all heard hundreds of times before. It's quite sweet and there is one effective sad scene in the second half of the movie, but overall the emotional grip slackens as it all just gets a bit too much in terms of the sentimentality. Since it's all fantasy, it doesn't always feel that romantic. With good direction, an irresistible sense of charm, strong acting and Richard Curtis' sharp humour complete with his typical fine use of profanity, LA is an entertaining and likable rom com with admirable ambition, but on the storytelling side there are definite shortcomings. The Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth and Kris Marshall story lines should perhaps have made up the film with the other story lines (Which either don't go anywhere or are just a bit weaker) dropped.<br/><br/>7/10"
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","3","23 January 2015"," Too Much Plot by Half
","Sentimental Christmas-themed movies are something we normally associate with America, but in 2003 the British cinema decided to have a go at producing one of its own. ""Love Actually"" was written and directed by Richard Curtis, the great doyen of the British romantic comedy, who had earlier been responsible for ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"". Unlike those two films which only dealt with a single love story, this one is an example of ""hyperlink cinema"", with numerous interlinked plot lines involving a wide variety of individuals.<br/><br/>Almost all of the story lines, which take place in the weeks before and after one Christmas, mostly in London, involve different aspects of love. That does not mean that they are all ""boy-meets-girl"" love stories, although there are indeed several of those. David, the newly elected bachelor Prime Minister, finds true love with his pretty young tea lady Natalie. Jamie, a novelist, breaks up with his girlfriend after discovering she has been cheating on him with his brother and retreats to his holiday home in Provence, where he begins a romance with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia, despite the fact that neither can speak a word of the other's language. Some of the stories, however, look at the idea of ""love"" from a different angle. A recurring storyline involves Billy, an ageing rock star hoping for a comeback with a cover version of ""Love Is All Around"". There is no romantic interest in Billy's life; he claims that his great ""love"" is his manager Joe, but as both men are firmly heterosexual he is using ""love"" in the sense of platonic friendship. (There are, in fact, no gay or lesbian love stories featured).<br/><br/>Daniel, a widower, helps his young stepson Sam who has a crush on a girl in his class. This story is really more about father-son relationships than about romantic love, although it never really rang true. I felt that in reality Sam would have been too distraught over the death of his mother to worry that one of his classmates was moving back to America and that Daniel too distraught over the death of his wife to be thinking about starting a new romance so soon. <br/><br/>I described the film as ""hyperlink cinema"", but in fact it differs from most hyperlink films in two ways. It is a light comedy, unlike the likes of ""Syriana"", ""Babel"", ""Crash"" and ""The Hours"", all of which deal with serious themes. And secondly, with nine separate stories it has more plot lines than most of them. (""Babel"" and ""The Hours"" only had three). It is, in fact, this multiplicity of plot lines which is the film's main weakness, as there is insufficient space to deal with them all satisfactorily. The four mentioned above are all dealt with fairly fully, but others are very perfunctory and leave the viewer guessing. Is, for example Harry (the husband of David's sister Karen) actually having an affair with his secretary, or does he merely fancy her? What eventually happens to John and Judy, those politely diffident middle- class porn stars? The two most potentially serious stories, that of Mark and his unrequited love for his best friend's wife and that of Sarah and Karl, whose romance is blighted by her need to care for a mentally disturbed brother, are both told very sketchily, as though Curtis were shying away from their implications.<br/><br/>In ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" Curtis seemed to be courting the American market; in both films the heroine is an American and played by a big-name Hollywood star. (Andie McDowell and Julia Roberts). Here he seems to be trying to alienate that market. The American President, a bully in his foreign policy and a seedy predator in his relationships with women, combines the most unattractive qualities of George Bush with those of Bill Clinton. When David, infuriated by the President's unwanted advances towards Natalie, makes a tactlessly undiplomatic anti- American speech he becomes a national hero; Curtis obviously wanted to align himself with those in Britain who resented Tony Blair's support for Bush's Iraq policy. The only American involved in the main stories is the hapless Sarah, the sort of woman who infuriates her boyfriend by insisting on answering the telephone while they are making love. One character, Colin, visits Milwaukee to test his theory that all American girls are nymphomaniacs who are driven wild by a British accent- and finds it is perfectly true!<br/><br/>The film stars some of the biggest names of the British cinema, but because of the many separate strands to the plot some of them have surprisingly little to do. I doubt, for example, if even the Keira Knightley Fan Club will ever rank ""Love Actually"" among their heroine's greatest films, and the same could be said for Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman. There are, however, some decent performances from the likes of Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, all practised hands at romantic comedy, and a particularly good one from Bill Nighy as Billy, whose refreshingly honest cynicism about the pop business and his part in it makes the long-suffering Joe despair. Nighy displays great comic timing in delivering Billy's one-liners; I particularly liked his crack about Britney Spears, unfortunately too bawdy (and libellous) to repeat here. There is also a nice cameo from Rowan Atkinson as that smarmily obsequious shop assistant. These are enough to save the film from a lower mark, but I felt that it would have been better if Curtis had reduced the number of plot lines to, say, four or five. Too much plot by half. 6/10"

","What a giant piece of crap. I knew it was going to be really cheesy and shallow, but I thought I might get a little entertainment out of it. I thought wrong. There are 10 stories all happening at once, which is absolutely absurd. You will completely forget about all of them at one point or another. Why did the director include so many? There should have 3 or 4 tops. Any more than that makes your film cluttered and overly crowded. Because there are so many stories, each one gets very little screen time, which means you do not build a single emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. Since there is no attachment, you do not care about what is happening, which makes you want to go to sleep. On top of this, the film insists on beating you over the head with the message of ""love is everywhere in many different ways and you should act on your feelings on Christmas"". It is possibly the least subtle message in a movie ever. Nothing of value here. Stay away."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","3","12 September 2014"," ""Love Actually"" is the single most overrated rom-com.
","Pretty much every British actor is in the most overrated and highly praised romantic comedy in the last decade. ""Love Actually"" has its heart in the right place but never executes a funny or heartwarming scene. This film lacks everything in terms of comedy and originality. This film goes the easy route and follows a bunch of different couples in London that never really interact or crash into each other near Christmas. There's unrequited love, loneliness, child love, adultery, and more in this love packed disaster. Liam Neeson plays Daniel, a lonely dad who has to take care of his son Sam after his wife death. Sam is in love with a girl at school. Bill Nighy plays Billy Mack, a singer who sings about love songs and is intimate with women. Jamie (Colin Firth) is a stressed writer who travels to France and falls in love with someone who doesn't even speak English. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a married couple who have one of them cheating in the marriage, while the irritating Keira Knightly plays a recently married woman who's husbands best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with her. There are few more stories, one involving Laura Linney as a single woman in love with her employee and the other with Hugh Grant as a businessman with love troubles. Every story is more sappy or irritating than the next. Not one story ends in a realistic ways or is even inspiring. They all end ridiculously and predictably. This is also one of the most sexual films of all time. The sex is a little uncomfortable and doesn't fit right with the failed tender-hardheartedness that was attempted. This lovey mess could have been sweet, but it never ends and gets more useless and vulgar as it goes on. One of the worst romantic comedies you'll ever see and an absolute unbalanced mess."

","""Love Actually"" was recommended to me by many friends as a singular example that there are still good romantic movies out there: Movies that do not seem to repeat the usual Hollywood pattern to this type of genre but provide a new way of telling a sweet story that will make you feel good in the end. To come straight to the point, Love Actually tries his hardest to do so and succeeds some of the time while at other times it continues to stumble into the deepest pitfalls of kitsch and cliché that you have seen since Titanic. <br/><br/>The first surprising thing about this movie is the sheer number of well- known actors that star in it: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman and Keira Knightley, to name only a few. There are in total ten different story lines, all of which circle around the topic of love. These lines, while overlapping at several times, are still kept rather separate from each other, meaning that there isn't much interaction between the actors. The prime minister and his employee, the writer and his maid, the step-dad and his son, the married couple and the best man, they are all connected somehow but basically never cross paths, instead telling their own separate stories. <br/><br/>This of course means that the movie's 135 minutes have to be split up into ten parts, leaving on average only about twelve minutes for each story line. Furthermore, Director Richard Curtis insists on squeezing as many sweet, heart-warming moments into these twelve minutes as possible while serving virtually every romantic-comedy cliché you have ever seen: He chasing her across the airport to proclaim his love, the dramatic proposal in front of a crowd of people, the sweet kid who falls in love way too soon and basically a lot of him-finally-telling-her-how-he- really-feels-in-a-dramatic-gesture. <br/><br/>This along with the above mentioned lack of intersection leads to the fact that the plot of each story line could be summarized in only one or two sentences. What remains is a strong effort to make you love or cry, mostly achieved by turning up the music volume to a maximum. And while Craig Armstrong has created a great soundtrack for this purpose with a lot of piano-and-violin pieces, the conveyed emotion remains mostly artificial: The characters and therefore the scenes simply lack depth because of their little on-screen time. This is above all disappointing since the cast contains so many actors who we know to be capable of amazing performances.<br/><br/>The general feeling of artificiality in these scenes is further enhanced by the fact that most of them are done without any trace of realism: A prime minister like this would never exist in real life, a marriage proposal should be neither made nor accepted if you have never had a conversation in a common language before and no kid can learn to play the drums that good in a couple of weeks. Things just aren't that simple in real life.<br/><br/>Another disappointing aspect is the movie's lack of diversity: In ten different couples whose love story is told, the script apparently did not have room for one homosexual or even a bad-looking couple. What's most aggravating about this is the fact that the movie approaches the topic here and there, but immediately dismisses it later on, for example: <br/><br/><ul><li>After being told that his stepson is in love, he asks him what her or his name is, whereupon the kid instantly replies that HER name is Joana. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The singer leaves an award party after realizing that the love of his life is his ""fat old manager"" yet their love is only depicted as a strong male friendship without physical contact. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the writer flies to Portugal to propose to his former maid, he arrives at her parents' house and asks to see the daughter. The father then calls upon his other, obese daughter and the writer tells him that he is there to see his other daughter who of course looks ""normal"". </li></ul><br/><br/>To be fair, there is also an interracial marriage and the portrayal of a love between siblings, one of whom is mentally handicapped, yet all in all the relationships are mostly between attractive, heterosexual white people. <br/><br/>To summarize, ""Love Actually"" does not tell a typical movie love story – it tells ten of them. While this is somewhat unprecedented, it does not immediately validate the movie. The actors are not given enough possibility to show their abilities and the script lacks ingenuity. If you want to be swept off your feet and drowned in emotion, this is the wrong movie. If you want to just turn off your sense of reality and be served a large number of clichés, however, then lights off and hit play."
"rjsf96","6","0","3","30 June 2014"," Like Actually
","It's a darned shame that Love Actually is only just okay, I like it; but the film's title is misleading for the most part. It definitely has likability, which when it comes to Romantic Comedies is somewhat of a miracle. Yet I have no capacity to love it, which the film wants me to, so frequently throughout the runtime that it can be a little unnerving. At certain moments it feels like the director is nudging the audience to chuckle, which when you are aiming for laughs in a film that has a high concept as much as this, is a little odd. The laughs for scenes with particular couples feel forced and unnatural; when I did laugh felt sorry for the film trying to hint that the certain scene or gag is in fact amusing.<br/><br/>The film involves about eight couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas at London. It follows their antics and what they do in the countdown to Christmas, whether it is trying to get the Prime Minister's attention or one of the school teachers to like you. The characters themselves range from porn doubles to one guy who has fallen very deeply for his best friend's fiancée; so I cannot fault the film for its ambition or scale which is no mean feat upon Richard Curtis's part in particular, him being the director and the writer I am sure that most of the film was under careful consideration. Other parts I feel are not; it is really annoying that the flaws sometimes overlook the positive elements of the film.<br/><br/>It is however, an exceedingly charming film that has infrequent laughs which can sometimes make the whole affair seem a bit dull, especially when it comes to the segments that have little humour, charm or even an actual point for that matter. In particular a scene with one of the characters trying to get girls to like him and repeatedly have sex. Fortunately the best moment comes from Bill Nighy as a singer who does not realise how bad his record is. Nighy can always make a film that is middle of the road, much better than it has any right to be and this is the case with Love Actually.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the ending is fulfilling, much more so than some of the other elements that just feel there to add to the already unwieldy length. I cannot help but feel disappointed what with the amount of potential it had and most of which is wasted or lost amid all the different sub plots. It can be hard to get your head around a film like this, and it is certainly much more complex than it needed to be.<br/><br/>A more appropriate title would be Like Actually. There are key elements that light up the whole affair and others that just crave the attention they feel, but in no way do they actually deserve. With many gaping flaws through the film; some that run fairly deeply, I cannot see why people adore Love Actually as much as they do."
"crazyfiary","5","0","1","20 June 2014"," Don't expect too much
","We all know why we came around to watching this film. We were blinded by the all-star cast and the foggy summary of the story and decided ""Why not?"". It's a weird thing because there really isn't much to be said any further than ""follows the lives of eight different couples"" - you see bits and pieces of those very different relationships but in the end you aren't fully satisfied with any of them. All the time I felt like a writer was given a list with the actors that should be included and was made to write a bearable script for them. And the result was a movie that feels incomplete in not one, but eight ways (well, maybe 7 1/2). There are some good sides to it, though. The actors do their job well, the stories are simple but enjoyable and it's enough to keep you entertained without making you feel like you have been robbed of two hours of your time. Love Actually isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one. If you catch it on TV and there is nothing else to watch it's a good option, but otherwise I'd say skip it."

I do not know, maybe because stupid happy ending love stories sell better. <br/><br/>If I was the director I would not film the last 30-40 minutes and finished it the way it was started; like it is in the real world. Most of the times love stories do not have a happy ending for one reason or another. It could be the story of people who fall in love and cannot do anything about it. It could show the pain of love and carrying a broken heart."

","Love Actually is a film that thinks that it is trying to defy conventions and other generic plot points to tell a poignant and comically rich storyline with memorable characters and various other elements that will make it a Christmas classic. That is a very audacious attempt for a romantic comedy. Regardless, director Richard Curtis is talented, but everything he touches doesn't turn to gold... or silver. The question is: can this film succeed? There are parts when it does and there are parts when it doesn't. It does not mean it does it poorly, but it dwells into the clichés of its genre. Curtis tries to be an overachiever and sets up too many story lines and characters thinking that they will eventually (and cleverly) cross over and meet up at the very end. Like I said, his strategy is very hit and miss. However there are parts where I felt he did things perfectly: the beginning and the ending. These were the parts where it was original, especially the last three minutes of the movie. In my opinion, that was probably one of the best endings Curtis could have thought of given the circumstances. The performances are even better. Richard Curtis has assembled the best character actors in England to make this film. There was really no performance I could complain about, it was done practically. The main payoff for me is that, at the end, Curtis prioritizes. He picks the stories that actually mean something to us and develops them to the best of his ability. Instead of developing something that we dislike and want to turn off if we hear any more about it."

Early in the movie, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page play nude stand-ins for a couple of movie stars who are about to film a sex scene. One can see why it wasn't cut out to get a lower censorship classification; it is funny in a film that is rather hit or miss.<br/><br/>Set in the weeks leading up to and after Christmas, ""Love Actually"" is not exactly a Christmas turkey, but it does serve up generous slices of Christmas ham. Created by Richard Curtis, the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" and the screenplay for ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Love Actually"" falls short of the clever insights and the originality of those previous works, however the film's hectic structure doesn't give you time to dwell on such misgivings.<br/><br/>The film features nine stories and a score of characters. Some of the stories are linked, but the theme of love in all its variations weaves its way through them all.<br/><br/>In a role that predates the real tragedy that befell Liam Neeson, his character, Daniel, attempts to adjust to life after his wife dies. He is left with an eleven-year-old stepson, Sam, played by Thomas Sangster who has a crush on a girl at school. Trying to get the girl interested in Sam brings the two together. Another story features Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. They play a couple dealing with the pressures that getting older has placed on their marriage – and from the pretty young secretary in Rickman's office.<br/><br/>The two protagonists from ""Bridget Jones Diary"", Colin Firth and Hugh Grant star in separate tales in this film. Firth is a writer who heads to the South of France to escape a broken relationship only to find a more meaningful, and unexpected one. Hugh Grant offers another variation of his self-deprecating charm as the new Prime Minister of England. He becomes infatuated with Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, a caterer at Downing Street. The cheekiness of this scenario is one of the surprises of the script.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy gets the best lines in the film as aging, burnt-out rocker, Billy Mack who is cutting a Christmas album from one of his old hits. His long-time manager and friend, Joe, helps him through the trials of a comeback. The saddest tale has Laura Lindley playing a woman who is torn between her needs and of those of her mentally ill brother.<br/><br/>Andrew Lincoln as Mark loses the love of his life, Juliet, played by Keira Knightly, when she marries his best friend. Unfortunately, the resolution of this sequence is the least believable of all the stories.<br/><br/>Kris Marshall is Colin Frissell, a gauche young guy who thinks his English manner and accent will work magic for him with American women – he's right.<br/><br/>Like the story, the soundtrack is a mixed bag and features Nora Jones, Dido, and The Beach Boys. While Craig Armstrong's towering anthems supercharge the emotions, they wouldn't be out of place in a movie about final victory in World War Two.<br/><br/>Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue just about sums up ""Love Actually"" – not as memorable as some of Curtis' other rom coms but enjoyable enough while it plays."

Rather, it provides an insightful look into today's often misunderstood world. In a world where hate and violence are all too common, this movie shows that in reality the world is a place full of love. The simple premise of the movie is clearly stated in the opening lines by the Prime Minister that ""If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" The rest of the movie sets out to prove that point. Through the normal relationships of people's lives, such as husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, friend and friend, father and son, and others, we see that the world is still a beautiful place and that love is one of the most important experiences that this world has to offer.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie. Although it was slightly unbelievable at parts, this movie provided a breath of fresh air from the cliché type ""chick flicks"". Overall I gave this movie a 7/10 for its enjoyability, good acting, and moving storyline."

","Love Actually is a 2003 British romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>This movie was really boring at first (first hour). In the middle, it got a little more interesting and the ending was actually nice. I wouldn't recommend this movie because in the end, I wasn't really satisfied. It was also quite long which was not what I was into. The best part for me was when the kid ran through the airport just to find his true love. Yes, this is a fantasy ( A BIG one) but aren't all romantic movies that way? There were a lot of stories but it's easy to understand although the different stories do come together in the end."

","London, England during five frantic weeks before Christmas follows a web-like pattern of inter-related, loosely related and unrelated stories of a dozen or more various individuals with their love lives, or lack of them.<br/><br/>The central character is the new bachelor prime minister David who cannot express his growing feelings for his new personal assistant Natalie.<br/><br/>The prime minister's older sister Karen slowly grows aware of her husband Harry's flirtation with an office worker named Mia. Karen's friend Daniel is a recently widowed writer whose 11-year-old son asks for love advice about a girl he has a crush on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jamie is another writer who leaves his girlfriend after catching her cheating on him and travels to France to write a novel where he pursues a possible romance with his non-English speaking Portuguese maid Aurelia.<br/><br/>Other secondary characters involve a photographer who pursues his best friend's new wife Juliet; a pair of movie stand-ins, named John and Judy, who grow closer after their simulated love scenes; a libidinous chum who wants to travel to Wisconsin, USA to score with women; and a burned-out former rock star named Billy Mack who is the main connection between all stories involved...<br/><br/>It's a Christmas film directed by the man who made Hugh Grant a star, so what would you expect? To be honest, it's the most sickly sweet romantic movie you will ever wish to see, but the performances make this movie a must see, and not one story in this layered narrative is a weak point.<br/><br/>The opening is a little off putting, when Grant explains about phone calls during 9/11, but overlook this and you get such a rich character development, you cannot help but love the film.<br/><br/>There is no real plot to the film, and the connections with the characters really need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but the film is consistently funny and sad, it's really one of those films that is really hard to dislike.<br/><br/>An essential Christmas movie."
"tequila101","10","0","3","16 December 2011"," Definitely Good Film for the Christmas Season
","There have been mixed reviews about Love Actually and I have to say that it's not the case that it shouldn't be mixed. This film doesn't flaw nor does it bail on anything it makes itself out to be. The actors all are really believable in their roles, the story involving Christmas was a really good idea. Blending in romance and having the use of comedic and emotional scenes to top it off were all a blast in this film. The cast are excellent, again.<br/><br/>I do remember watching this as a kid but I only remembered a few small parts of it. Because the film was set on Christmas, setting it off, I decided to try it out again, now being older also, wanting to watch it near Christmas time. It also used to premiere on channel 10 a bit.<br/><br/>The film sets during the Christmas season where there are mix up's of all these couples trying to get together and enjoy this joyful time of the year for what it is. The film stars some of these actors: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley. There are many more but the list would go on if I mentioned all. What I will say is that ""Mr. Bean"", Elishia Cuthbert and Billy Bob Thornton make small cameo appearances.<br/><br/>I love nearly every character. They just pull of their roles really well and the casting of them was an excellent mix. I mean who could have thought that Liam Neeson would mix with Hugh Grant? I didn't know that all these actors coming together would make this film so special.<br/><br/>I also love many of the scenes. Either emotional or comedic but either way, I found it to be enjoyable, EITHER WAY.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is a film which deserves to be highly rated and those who don't like it too much must have cheesy films glued to their brain. This is a comedic masterpiece. Everything is put together so well, and when I was getting into it, like ""About a boy"" when the title credits ended, I was already into it, loving the characters, loving the scenes and praising the story for what it was.<br/><br/>If you watch this film, you must watch it near or during the Christmas break. That's what I did and I'm so glad I did. This film goes for just over two hours and amazing thing is that if you're hooked to this, it won't feel like two hours.<br/><br/>This film is an easy 9.5/10"

","Love Actually is an ultimate feel good movie with an all star and all age cast, including Hugh Grant who has become a Rom-com phenomenon. Bill Nighy is particularly good as the drugs, sex and rock and roll radio DJ. The film on the whole is of course about love, with intertwining stories all coming together in its feel good Christmas cheer finale. A sure tear jerker and as funny as ever, this film won't hesitate to please, even for those who think twice before seeing a Rom-com. <br/><br/>The film delves deep into the idea of love and relationships, and deals with the good parts and the bad.

","At last watched this one and believe me I carried a smile across my face throughout the movie. The moment it starts and the music starts playing am pretty sure everyone of you will want to remember the one you love. The music is simply awesome and not just in beginning but entirely including the background score and its just too romantic. Now talking of the script, its quite well written with the interwoven lives of the cast and it exactly manages to depict life and how its affected by love. Everyone in the cast has done a good job. Movie carries on a tint of humor throughout with all the cheesy bits. Its quite beautiful and contains a lots of hooting moments for audience especially the story of the kid which is really cute.  It has those touchy moments as well. Although some negativities are shown but its perfect as love is not always ideal. But I guess that you won't find yourself noticing that as the movie will just make you fall in love. Perfect to watch with your partners and get cozy. I want to watch it over again and just can't let go of the music from my mind. Its not perfect I will say as some parts are exaggerated and loosely screen-played but still its a much watch. Loved it."

","What a great film! I was especially fond of the scenes with Jamie and Aurelia as well as Mark and Juliet. In fact I would love to see a sequel showing those two couples together. Granted, a divorce or something would need to occur first before Juliet was available, but the expressions of love that Mark expressed truly touches your heart.<br/><br/>Jamie & Aurelia was my favorite. For each of them to learn the other's language, not knowing for sure of the other's feelings was so sweet! The whole concept of this movie which surrounds the love and affection that is so visible at airports and then following these relationships of a month's time was very cool.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who is romantic or who would might need reason to smile."
"kespridliz","Null","0","2","9 August 2011"," Fantastic Movie
","This is one of my favorite movies. <br/><br/>It is about different relationships, new people getting together, in different ways, you have the ones who have known each other for a while, you have the ones that have just met, you have the ones that have known each other for a short time. It is a movie about getting together whether you be older, middle aged or quite young. Richard Curtis has written and directed a brilliant movie that gives the common man a realization of what is possible in a true love relationship and a movie that shows what can happen in that relationship. <br/><br/>One thing I must stipulate is that some reviewers have queried if the UK is so taken with the Christmas Chart Number One, yes we are. The Number One at Christmas IS a big deal in the UK as it is shown in this movie - don't knock it till you've tried it, is all I can say. <br/><br/>I have said it before I love this movie - it and it's sound track is fantastic - if you like a movie that gives and keeps on giving no matter how many times you watch it, this is the movie for you, I can not tell you how many times I have watched this movie, as I have forgotten, but it is many and every time I add a new facet to this movie.

"j_stromoski","10","0","2","4 March 2011"," Wonderful, Charming, Funny, and Genius
","First of all, I have to say that the entire casting for this movie was perfect. Bill Nighy as the aged, old school rocker, Colin Firth as the hopeless romantic who gets his heart broken, Emma Thompson as the betrayed wife and Alan Rickman the husband. Yet, out of all the stories told in this masterpiece, I found Liam Neeson's to be the most touching. The step-father who raises his step-son after the loss of his wife, and ultimately teaches him about the love his step-son feels for a girl at school.<br/><br/>Every single story that pieced together this movie was brilliant, simply because it was relatable on some level. I would watch Hugh Grant stumble to make idle chit-chat with his assistant Natalie and would faintly remember my high school days where I would try and fail to talk to the quiet, pretty girl who sat next to me in nearly every class. It was funny when it needed to be funny, romantic when your heart was aching, and just sad enough for you to see how real it all is.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, then do. I was instantly a huge fan of it. Partly because I like British humor, and partly because I love romantic comedies...when they're as good as this. The only problem I can see is that this movie should have been just a tad longer, and given each story more time for you to appreciate them that much more. Also, John Cleese was missing. All in all, I would strongly suggest seeing it and develop your own opinion."

Granted that it is taking place starting a few weeks leading up to and including Christmas.<br/><br/>Several small stories are interwoven into a beautiful romantic love story that will make even the hardened heart soften up. I have watched this movie with many different people and they all agree that it is simply a great romance that will someday become one of the ""Classics"" to watch every year. Except for the nudity this movie would have been a TV annual event, but since the nudity is involved within one of the smaller love stories within the film, yes it is needed. It is sweet between those two young people.<br/><br/>My favorite story is the romance between Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz. They cannot speak the others language, but fall in love with each other. The end of the movie is the highlight for this romance as it flashes back and forth between a couple of the ongoing story lines.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant does not hurt this movie one bit, but playing the British Prime Minister with real life faults, it was refreshing to see life through his eyes also. Nice touch.<br/><br/>Take the time to watch this movie with your special loved one, and remember why the two of you got together in the first place. I do love this movie, actually!"
"fankha02","9","0","2","18 September 2010"," ""Love Actually"" is a film about love. It is a romantic comedy that expresses that ""love is all around.""
","With the help of many elements, ""Love Actually"" is successful as a cinematic film. Each storyline has a unified plot. At each point of the film, the characters, although may not be in similar situations, are connected by similar points within the plot structures. All of the story lines move in unison, as they move through the stages of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. The theme is what holds the film together because each story lines plot is focused on the major theme. Richard Curtis also uses irony of situation to support the theme of love. In the scenes between the storyline of John and Judy, the process of getting to know one another happens, not over dinner or coffee, but during work, as they fill-in as doubles in a sex scenes. John and Judy are shy yet they are completely naked in front of 30 people. Their attraction, which is more emotional than physical, toward one another is instant but their relationship takes time to develop. This ironic situation shows that genuine love is all around, even in the most unlikely of places; just as it is ironic that two shy people are in the sex double business. Lighting, set design and cinematic point of view also helped to perpetuate the film's theme. In the many scenes between Jamie and his new housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz), who also turns into his new love interest, the lighting is bright and fresh. The setting oozes romance with the French country home in the background and the cool colored flowers surrounding the grounds. The lighting and set design help to show Jamie's new, fresh start to life after learning about his wife's infidelity. The surroundings seem to capture Jamie and Aurelia, holding them hostage with the fondness that they have developed for one another. Cinematic point of view also proved successful for theme relevance. The feelings between characters are felt by viewers because of the use of indirect-subjective point of view. In all story lines, the characters are faced with either heart-stopping shock or heart-thumping excitement. The audience is brought into each scene with this point of view, making it clear that what the characters are feeling is real, and that we have felt it too. This film has a lot going on throughout its 129 minutes but the many things occurring on screen are all very important in carrying the theme through to the end of the film. And each storyline (all 10 of them) represent the theme in its entirety, ""Love, actually, is all around."""
"greena21780","8","0","1","16 September 2010"," Love is all around
","The theme of the movie is love. According to the plot summary on IMDb website, ""The characters are falling in love, falling out of love, some are with right people, some are with the wrong people, some are looking to have an affair, some are in the period of mourning; a capsule summary of reality. Love begins and love ends."" The film has many characters which are important to the film. The first couple are Keira Knightley who plays Juliet, and Andrew Lincoln who plays Mark. The next couple of characters being focused on are Hugh Grant who plays the Prime Minister, and Joanna Page who plays Judy. The next couple whose life is intertwined with the others are Colin Firth who plays Jamie, and Lúcia Moniz who plays Aurelia. As we begin the movie we see the first spark of the love theme with the marriage of Peter and Juliet with Mark as his best man. The song being sung starts with the theme of love, or all you need is love! You can see from the look in Mark's face that he is in love with his best friends wife. The next theme of love goes into the funeral of Daniels wife and Sam's mother. The missing of a loved one is eminent through the pain of Daniel as he stands and gives his last good bye. The movie continues through many different aspects of the theme of love. Love between a boss and his secretary, a father and son. The theme continues to the scene where Juliet tries to persuade Mark that she isn't that bad of a person and doesn't know that Mark is really in love with her, she thinks he just dislikes her. She watches the taping of Mark did at her wedding and realizes he is in love with her as she watches the video of only her on her wedding day with nothing of the husband/best friend there at all. We continue to see the theme of love throughout the movie through many different scenes till the end when Mark shows up with cards and tells Juliet how he really feels. Love, Actually can also be closely related to the movie Wedding Crashers. The theme of love is also throughout that movie as well with a little twist of comedy and friendship along the way. I feel the directors motif behind the film is to show people that love comes and goes in many different ways in our everyday lives that many of us may not be aware of. I think another aspect of the film is the irony of all the different individual stories. Most of the time when you hear about stories with love as a theme you think of people falling in love. This film has some people falling in love, some people getting hurt with love, some people finding love in the most unusual places, and others finding love for their children. We all perceive love differently and find it differently. We see throughout the movie that there are endless possibilities that people have in their lives that does make the saying true, ""Love is all around us!"""

Now you may call me a Fool, but this film actually does feel like a warm and fuzzy teddy bear you can hug and keep close to your heart...<br/><br/>The plot is intricate to say the least: it evolves around the lives of about 10 or more people which are interwoven somehow. I know this sounds familiar, cliché, 'been there seen that'. But these stories contains so much heart and are filled with so much joy and hilarious moments you really don't mind anymore. It involves all kinds of people of society from the Prime Minister, a rock star to a writer and even a few stand in porn actors. It's about people living their lives around Christmas with the sort of British humor propably not even surpassed by Monthy Python. <br/><br/>Because yes people, this movie is hilarious and extremely funny.

","This movie isn't quite as good as Notting Hill, but it's very good fun. <br/><br/>Hugh Grant is the star, as the PM who succeeds Tony Blair at No. 10. His romance with No.10's teagirl is lovely, but even better is his performance as PM doing things we all wanted Tony Blair to do but he didn't! For me Hugh Grant is a class above everyone else in this movie, but if he isn't for you there are plenty of other characters to like as it's an ensemble movie. I don't usually like ensemble movies and I wasn't very keen on Four Weddings but this one works well as all the characters are entertaining.<br/><br/>I first saw Colin Firth, so far as I remember, in Pride & Prejudice and it was rumoured that he wasn't keen on the part. Yet he acted it splendidly and received many accolades. I wondered why he'd not be keen on the part - until I saw him in some of his later movies which I think showed Darcy wasn't the kind of part he usually acted. In this movie he suits the part in this movie and his character's romance is really charming - he can't speak her language, she can't speak his....... and so neither has any idea how the other feels. <br/><br/>The other story lines include ...<br/><br/>A man who stupidly buys a very expensive Christmas prezzie for his predatory secretary even though he really isn't after her at all, and his wife finds out and is devastated. A young boy who's fallen in love with a teenage girl and doesn't know how to tell her. Kids who are acting in The Nativity as all kinds of strange animals (it's a lovely sequence, the actual performance, with an unexpected ending!) A Best Man who's in love with the bride. A young man who goes off to Australia and comes back with a girl for himself and his friend as well. A couple of actors who seem to be making suggestive adverts in which they wear less on each occasion, and their totally detached conversation throughout is hilarious. But the best of all next to Hugh Grant is Alan Rickman (I think it was him anyway) as a very faded popstar who's made a Christmas CD. You mayn't expect how his romance works out but really is Love, Actually.<br/><br/>Final comment - would that we had Hugh Grant as our PM!!"
"gevalero","8","0","2","18 June 2009"," Lust Actually
","There's plenty to love about LOVE ACTUALLY. It's just that I found a couple of the stories downright perverse. It may be convenient for the film never to show us where Keira Knightley's new romance will lead but nothing changes the fact that is not a love story but one of betrayal in which not much good will come out at the end; at least the Alan Rickman / Emma Thompson part is honest about its subject and what the consequences to his actions will eventually be for both of them. Further, what can you say about a story in which a girl is unfaithful to his boyfriend with his own brother ? The funny thing is that the filmmakers want to make us believe these are just different facets of love and for some reason, they time them at Christmas time, as if they would actually have anything to do with the real meaning of Christmas. Still, any movie in which Hugh Grant makes a convincing British Prime Minister can't be all bad. The truer love story in LOVE ACTUALLY ?: Laura Linney giving up on her dream for the sake of her brother, that part might just be enough to justify the title."

","I watched this movie alone, it was cold outside, almost Christmas, I have no money for presents, spent money on a card that I shouldn't have.<br/><br/>Definitely an emotional state, and I watch Love Actually.<br/><br/>Some parts were sentimental, but this thing should have had me gushing, yet it didn't. Some bits were just too obvious.<br/><br/>Basically it was the stories' structure. Some stories were good, but others fell apart and it seems they shouldn't have. And overlapping moments were forced.<br/><br/>The two standout overlaps were the PM knocking on the door and Alan Rickman's secretary opens and tells the PM that Natalie lives next door.<br/><br/>The other one was Atkinson at the airport. Now what both of these moments say is England is very small.<br/><br/>The PM is looking at his brother-in-law's secretary. Surely she knew that her boss's brother-in-law was the PM. It was just too close.<br/><br/>And Atkinson again at the airport. He is holding up Neeson, who had Thompson at his wife's funeral and her husband attempted to purchase the necklace from Atkinson.<br/><br/>There were other characters who could have been in either one of these positions.<br/><br/>Karl would have sufficed in either position and would have successfully looped that storyline within the movie.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie was the three cornerstones, Grant, Thompson and Neeson (Rickman a very close fourth) shouldn't have been in contact with one another.<br/><br/>Grant and Thompson should have never been siblings and Thompson didn't need to be an associate of Neeson's.<br/><br/>Neeson could have held up his entire storyline just fine all on his own (when he motions for Sam to look behind him and see Joanna at the airport).<br/><br/>Linney was a major loose thread. If nothing else, she could have been seen at the airport, returning to America, since she wasn't going to be with anyone (yea, and run out on that brother, sure. She'll send for him later) Perhaps it was the movie's working that made the weak ends so difficult.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Neeson all had strong stories.<br/><br/>Two movies that sprang to my mind that did this were Pearl, about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and Carwash.<br/><br/>Carwash did it very well, but then that was a very confined neighborhood.<br/><br/>Pearl was good, but a handful of characters were military and they simply were brought together as military figures and met that way.<br/><br/>Lesley Anne Warren was the furthest out of the loop, involvement pretty much only with Robert Wagner, but then she has encounters with the Japanese woman (only major Asian figure in the movie).<br/><br/>Any of the incredibly minor figures (Tony, the porn actors-stand ins, whatever they were) could have had the Atkinson position at the airport or something. It would have threaded the movie together much better.<br/><br/>Perhaps I will watch it a year or so from now and get better sentiment from it.<br/><br/>Probably.<br/><br/>And what a shame Miss Dunkin Donut 2003 couldn't have been paired up with Billy Mack's manager or something.<br/><br/>And why was Mack's unseen ex-girlfriend named Daisy, the same as Thompson's daughter?"

The most butt clenching story involves the cute kid who is in love. WTF were the actors thinking of when they signed up to this? The scripts for Trumpton are more sophisticated than the writing here. They're funnier too. With far more sympathetic characters and better plot development. This film is shown every Xmas and now I have a love/hate relationship with it now because watching it makes me feel blessed that I still have a modicum of taste and judgement despite being very old. This film was also my first introduction to actress Kiera Knightly. Her narcissism is infuriating enough to make me want to join Al Qeada. It says something about a British film when the least butt-clenching scene involves having to watch Hugh Grant dance."
"tojofriends","7","0","2","26 September 2008"," Too much love... but still works
","Score:- 7/10<br/><br/>Well I'm not actually a romantic movie lover but I watched this one. Main cause :- Laura Linney was in it. I must say I got more than I bargained for, Linney had very brief part but what I got is 7-8 parallel good stories with a less short of convincing acting by a few. The movie starts off with a common but effective and forgotten adage that despite of all the killing, hate, anguish there is still love somewhere. Maybe I sound too much of an optimistic but lately I have been watching or re-watching a lot of crime movies so this movie was a real satisfaction. <br/><br/>Bottom-line if it is Christmas an if you have a true heart you will get what you want (or mostly you do). But this stupid quixotic idea was quite beautifully screen-played and it makes you believe for a few moments that you live in a perfect world (at least it made me almost believe for a moment). <br/><br/>One main thing  you will see a lot of familiar faces around here. Severus Snape(forgot his real name, but his accent is awesome), Laura Linney, Kiera Knightly, Jedi Master QuiGon or Raaz A Gul(whatever you prefer) and of course Denise Richard and Hugh Grant(not convincing though as prime minister of England).<br/><br/>These 6-7 parallel stories are merely related and while watching sometimes you forget who was with whom but again you don't have put strain to watch this movie. What actually amazes me most that how come a jerk got so many girls when he went to America. Jesus I always wanted to go to America but I think now I will go to London first, pick up a fake but charming accent and then go for girls in America. Christ that's so bullshit but it's Christmas who gives a damn, believe whatever you want to believe. But I never thought that prime minister of England will actually fall for a girl in that manner, that's really silly of the story writer but it's Christmas again.<br/><br/>Overall LOVE ACTUALLY is a movie with poor acting performances braced and hushed by a good screenplay and directing with some help of Santa. If you are looking for a change and want to watch a movie just because you have nothing else to do I suggest you ACTUALLY watch it."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","0","2","14 September 2008"," Good little film
","The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.<br/><br/>Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does? No. But it is a film whose well-written and acted characters and charm will stick in your mind long after their counterparts from lesser, schmaltzier films in its genre have faded."

","Just a very nice movie with so many different characters who finally crash into each other. I loved each little love story until the last end<br/><br/>Well, it's a funny movie, let's say, no really difficult roles, but still a must-see-movie for every romantic fan. The actors do a good job and the varying music represents the character's feelings. I loved Rowan Atkinson as the jeweler because he was so extremely funny I had to wipe my tears away. Keira Knightley was as cute and pretty as she always is (except King Athur and Domino) that's why I fell in love with her and her love story. Honestly, I have never even imagined meeting my lover at a film location for naked scenes.<br/><br/>They did a good job by making this movie.

"DavidSim240183","7","0","1","5 March 2008"," The biggest love story(s) ever told
","After the success of multi-narrative films like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia, I wondered how long it would be before Hollywood tried the same thing with rom-coms. And so we have Love Actually, Richard Curtis's directorial debut, the man who's worked behind the scenes of many a Brit rom-com.<br/><br/>I must admit I'm a man who doesn't exactly rush out to buy romantic comedies under Richard Curtis's banner. But I must say the premise for Love Actually rather intrigued me. An interweaving tapestry of romantic encounters with a who's who of British talent. What more could anyone ask?<br/><br/>Being produced by Universal has sadly blunted the bite of some of the British humour I was hoping for. There are times when it seems a bit too Americanized. One kid even says ""duh!"" And where Harry Potter made the wise choice of leaving the Americans out of it, Love Actually can't resist squeezing in a few. The film even makes a somewhat needless sidetrip to America.<br/><br/>But you can't deny that Love Actually has a quite phenomenal cast. There are some really wonderful actors present. At the head of the line is Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy. A film that had any one of these actors present would be worth watching, let alone a film that has all three under the same roof.<br/><br/>Love Actually doesn't tell one story about a couple, it instead tells several, all at the same time. Where films like Pulp Fiction tell a self-contained story one at a time, Love Actually more daringly tells these stories simultaneously. They flow in and out of each other. Granted it does tend to sketch the characters a bit thinly, some stories are more interesting than others, and some could have been edited out altogether. But for the most part Love Actually is a film that hangs together surprisingly well.<br/><br/>I won't go into intricate detail about every single tale. Otherwise we'd be here all day, and the IMDb would really need to lift the 1000 word limit to accomplish that near impossible task. The film's major flaw is Richard Curtis tries to do too much. The plot is very busy. Always on the move. And because of this desire to cram everything into the cooking pot, it deprives the characters of some much needed development.<br/><br/>The most engaging story was the one with Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman as a married couple, who face trouble in paradise when Rickman's wandering eye sets upon the lusty secretary that works for him. I get the impression Curtis was equally entranced with this story, because he gives it the most development. It follows their typical married lives. Gently, affectionately sniping at each other. But then Rickman's Harry gets distracted by his secretary, and Thompson's Karen slightly picks up on it. There's a particularly devastating scene when Karen unwraps a Christmas present she assumes is a necklace she found in his coat pocket. Instead its a CD. The necklace was for somebody else.<br/><br/>Its very well directed by Curtis. You feel just as crushed as Karen. The ever delightful Emma Thompson really shines, and she makes a very believable couple with Alan Rickman. Even the scene when she confronts him about it feels real and natural. I wouldn't have minded if the whole film had been about them.<br/><br/>There are some other nice stories too. A sweet one involves the tale of Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz. Firth is a heartbroken writer mired in depression after his wife had an affair with his brother. But a cure for the lovesick Firth arrives in the form of a comely Portugeuse maid, and even though they don't speak the same language, they are obviously quite taken with one another. Curtis occasionally mismanages the story by allowing it to topple over into slapstick farce. There's a really awful scene when the pages of Firth's latest novel ends up in the lake thanks to a careless mistake. The two lovebirds wind up in the lake desperately thrashing about. Its a scene that aims for laughs, but never really takes flight. Their relationship is more effective in its quieter moments, like watching them try to express their feelings while overcoming the language barrier.<br/><br/>The best laughs come from the story of Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher as a washed up rocker and his long suffering manager. Their tale charts a wonderfully funny course as in the run up to Christmas, Billy boy patents a blatant ripoff of a once popular song (which has to be heard to be believed) in his quest to hit No 1 in the charts. Great chemistry between the two, acidic one-liners and cuss-words galore make they're story enough of a reason to watch Love Actually at all.<br/><br/>There are some nice performances from the rest of the cast, in particular Liam Neeson's equally sweet story of a widower trying to sort out his step-son's lovelife, but they feel like filler material. The rather ludicrous notion of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister seems added only to poke some potent barbs at the Bush/Blair administration (and Bill Clinton's too!). And because he's always in a Richard Curtis production. Other stories could have been left on the cutting room floor like a hopeless Kris Marshall hopping planes to America to chat up the local gals. A story that falls curiously flat.<br/><br/>I think, in the end, Love Actually is what might be oddly described as a flawed masterpiece. Richard Curtis does an admirable job keeping so many stories in motion, but did it really need so many? To see great actors like Laura Linney, Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radiant Keira Knightly saddled with fairly anonymous parts to play is surely evidence the film is not all it should have been. When Love Actually is good, its very good. But its still not quite the lyrical symphony of love it likes to think it is."

","I thought that the world was spinning on its axis because of the big bang billions of years ago, but after watching this film I've come to the conclusion that it's love that makes the world go round.. And what a busy little film it is with so many characters burdened down with so many difficult relationships. At first I was somewhat confused as a multitude of characters were introduced ,but slowly I was able to sort out the couples and their particular problems.<br/><br/>It's a happy film set a few weeks before Christmas with the street illuminations decorating many of the scenes. The dialogue is suitably punctuated with songs many of which were familiar to me. I actually found myself tapping my feet in some scenes. This is unusual for me.<br/><br/>The large cast had a nice variety of characters, too many to comment on all. I liked Hugh Grant as the English Prime Minister and some of the impossible situations he found himself in. Some of the scriptwriting was surprisingly frank relating to the President of the United States. Love has no boundaries it seems when a young boy makes a determined effort to meet the girl of his dreams by breaking all security rules at the airport. And what a devilish invention the telephone is when it rings at the most inappropriate moments.<br/><br/>As Shakespeare said "" The course of true love never did run smooth'. No, it never did and it never will. But that's love actually."
"FlorianSchirner","8","0","1","5 February 2008"," A movie as great, unbelievable and corny as love, actually!
","Well, first to all who find this movie unrealistic...it is! It is as unrealistic as two grown humans (knowing the statistical rate of failed marriages, the average divorce costs, the trouble coming with living together...) falling in love with each other.<br/><br/>That said, I may continue. This movie shows us that love is all around us. And this message it delivers loud and clear. I will not analyze each of the many plot lines, I will just say, that each contains one or several aspects of love. Though some may be corny and exaggerating, you have to admit that each contains a bit of truth. I for myself can give you examples for each and every scene from around my circle of friends. One plot line in particular is the one concerning Karen (Emma Thompspn) and Harry (Alan Rickman). Many find that this episode only shows the effects of getting your love broken, but it shows too: the love of a friend (Karen to Daniel after his wife's funeral), the love of a mother (the deleted scene with the ""Horrible Bernard""), the love of a sister (to the Prime Minister). <br/><br/>A great movie with great acting, though as a German viewer, I didn't know many actors before this movie.The actors really carry the movie, and I believe that they all had a great time on the set.<br/><br/>This movie is a real uplifting experience, which should be shared by all. Watch it in company of your friends, watch it with your beloved, watch it alone ....but watch it!"
"oneloveall","6","0","1","3 February 2008"," Fluffy and good-hearted
","A calculatedly cutesy affair from across the pond, Love Actually benefits greatly from this impressive ensemble cast featuring some of England's most popular brand names. A first length feature directorial debut from the extremely popular British writer Richard Curtis finds ease in delivering heartfelt and accessible warmth in spades throughout the two + hours of multiple character acts, though fails to tie all these inter-connected and pleasant enough relationship threads into a more emotionally cohesive whole.<br/><br/>Feeling wildly uneven at times, Curtis lets a few of his characters breathe, while restricting others as mere wallpaper. All in all though Love Actually remains the lighthearted romantic holiday epic that it sets out to be by appeasing as many sappy-hearted Brits and Americans as possible and by cutting out the middleman known as subtlety."
"dominich4","7","0","1","30 December 2007"," A highly amusing film with only minor disappointments, thankfully overshadowed by the huge number of good points
","In the evening after everyone but the spices had left, we sat around, looked at Grandad Arthur and Grandma Eileen's old photo albums and newspaper cuttings, particularly Dad's baby photos, and at nine o'clock we watched the film version of the history boys, by which I was suitably impressed. When everyone else went up to bed, me Katie and Jez stayed downstairs to watch Love Actually, which was also well done, its humour and fragmentary plot, not to mention the skillful interrelation of the characters, skilfully concealing and nullifying the few predictable elements of the plot. Despite my enjoyment of the film I was nevertheless disappointed that all the main characters who found love were 'beautiful people' and that all the ugly people were portrayed as basically being rubbish, all the shy people being portrayed as devoid of any merit entirely even beneath their exterior. The one shy character in the story, whom I was able to identify with on some levels, was basically ruined for me by the fact that he was a) a beautiful person and b) his character gave false hope to stalkers that rather than running away screaming and telling their friends what a weirdo you are, the stalkee is more likely to think it's sweet and be really quite sorry she's already seeing someone else.<br/><br/>As for the casting, Kris Marshall was astounding as always, especially since (for instance with his role in Dr Zhivago) he has proved to me that although he is often typecast as a happy-go-lucky innocent chappy following his performance in MY Family, it is not the be-all and end-all of his acting talents.Bill Nighy was also spectacular. The casting of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister and inclusion of a token 'chirpy cockney' were unfortunately disappointing, as although Grant's talent in RomComs is legendary, it does require one to forget that the delightfully confused, hurt, or let-down expression just shown by that close-up is the exact same one as in every other film he's ever been in. In contrast to Marshall, Grant has never shown me any kind of flexibility, and his inclusion as a stock character instantly recognisable not as his character but as 'oh there's Hugh Grant again in another RomCom' destroys the illusion for all but the most committed viewer. Perhaps a small change such as a beard or the removal of his apparently plastic hair, or some similarly superficial change, might alter this? Probably not. Granty, get into some film where you are neither the chirpy British love interest nor the evil British villain, or I will never watch one of your films again! Hands on the table, I also do not like Kiera Knightley in this role (although a big thumbs up on Atonement, eh?) but Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and many others were extremely well cast."
"Dingataca","Null","0","1","29 December 2007"," Starts off weak but grows on you after a while...
","With one of the biggest star casts I have ever seen, and 8, yes 8, different story lines, I was expecting a rom-com that I would adore. I didn't exactly ADORE Love Actually, but I do admit that it is a very cute movie which I enjoyed a lot.<br/><br/>As I said, there are 8 whole different stories. Each one is completely different and I think that some are better than others.<br/><br/>Couple #1 - Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson) have been married for many years. Now with 2 growing children and lots of tension from work, Harry is going through a lot of stress, and gets involved with the seductive Mia, his secretary from work. Christmas approaches and Harry buys her an expensive gold necklace, when Karen finds out, she instantly realises he is having an affair. Can their relationship survive?<br/><br/>Couple #2- Jamie's (the charming Colin Firth) girlfriend is found to be having an affair with his brother. Heartbroken and upset, he goes to relax in his French cottage to forget it all. Jamie becomes dissolved in his writing, and can think of nothing else, until he meets the sweet Aurélia, a nice Portuguese woman who becomes his housekeeper. Slowly an indescribable bond forms between the both of them. What happens from there?<br/><br/>Juliet (played by Kiera Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are a young pair in love. On their wedding day, Peter's best man and best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) videotapes the pretty ceremony. When Juliet sees the professional video of her wedding day she is shocked, as it is disastrous and the colours have gone wrong. Wanting a videotape of her special day, she sweetly asks Mark for his copy, even though she knows he is always cold and angry towards her. When Juliet sees the video Mark had took, she is stunned. They are all close-ups of her, smiling and laughing, and Juliet finds out Mark is secretly in love with her. How will she deal with this is the story of Couple #3.<br/><br/>Couple #4 - Sarah (Laura Linney) has been in love for Karl (the cute Rodrigo Santoro), ever since she joined her office, -which we learn is Harry's design company-, which was over 2 years ago, a fact that everyone seems to know. Sarah unfortunately has a brother with a mental illness and she has to regularly mess up her life to support him, as she feels it is her responsibility. Karl and Sarah get together and she is incredibly happy, until her brother seems to ruin her relationship with Karl forever. This is the story of a brother/sister love as well as relationships and one of the best in the film.<br/><br/>Judy and John (Joanna Page and Martin Freeman) romance blossoms over the set of an erotic movie, as they are the body doubles. The pair are very comfortable with each other, even though they are working together and there is constant nudity and sexual actions. Their relationship gets stronger over time and they are Couple #5.<br/><br/>Couple #6 - Daniel is a widower and is now a single parent, raising his stepson Sam. Sam is miserable over the days and Daniel, trying hard to take over his newly-found responsibility, tries to find out what it is. He finds out Sam is ""in love"" with a pretty young girl singer from school, who is co-incidentally named Joanna, which was the name of his late wife. Daniel, still getting over the loss of his love, forgets it for the sake of his stepson and encourages Sam to tell Joanna how he feels towards her. Their lovely journey of a father and son, and also their love lives, is #Couple 6.<br/><br/>The newly elected Prime Minister, David (the dashing Hugh Grant), has a soft spot for one of the members of his catering staff, called Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). They pursue a silent relationship, not much apart from some flirting. After a situation with Natalie and the President of USA, David redistributes her, as he is beginning to think his feelings for her are affecting his job. After a Christmas Card fiasco, he realises his love for her and sets out to find her. Together they make up the cute #7th Couple.<br/><br/>Lastly, Colin (Kris Marshall) is a wannabe playboy. Failing with almost every girl he meets, he sets off to America to find love, to the amusement of his best friend Tony. He finds 3 sexy girls who let him stay with him...He is #8.<br/><br/>It is difficult to choose a favourite storyline because each one is different but very lovable, and for example, David and Aurélia are the funniest couple (with Aurélia being hilarious in her Portuguese dialect), but Mark and Juliet's awkward bond being the most understandable and difficult. Each actor gives a great performance and many scenes will leave you moved. Love Actually is not just a romance, it is a comedy, (though the romance factor takes over the comedy). The humour is very British, so people from other parts of the world may find it weird to understand, but all in all, it is a great movie with lots of fun, that will help you understand love. The ending is particularly moving and the most interesting feature of Love Actually is definitely the way the director has entwined all the stories.<br/><br/>A charming Brit movie."
"french-michaelfrench","7","0","1","26 December 2007"," I don't get it either way
","I don't get either the venom or the adulation for this movie. I like it; it is mostly undemanding, the vignette structure lets me dip in and out of it without much thought. Of course it is unrealistic, but then romance in movies is and when you see something billed as a romantic comedy you have to expect to leave your disbelief hanging. In general there is more to enjoy than to deplore. But two specific comments which may help.<br/><br/>1. Alan Rickman DOES NOT get his end away with the office tease. He never does. He buys her the bauble (despite Rowan Atkinson's camouflaged attempt to stop him) and she ends up grinning away because she knows she has him over a barrel. Emma Thompson has to cry not because Alan doesn't love her but because now she cannot trust him.<br/><br/>2. Sorry it comes over as sexist. Romantic comedies are, aren't they? I mean, that is the central point of romantic comedies, either vive la difference or can't-live-with-them-can't-live-without-them style of thing. But to complain about it is a bit like grumbling because Christmas pudding has sugar and fruit in it."

","At Christmas, even an out-and-out hardcore horror freak like me occasionally puts the blood 'n' guts goes on hold for something a little lighter and more heart warming. And they don't come much more fluffy and saccharine sweet than Love Actually (which I'm squeezing in between a Dario Argento giallo and a trashy Pete Walker slasher).<br/><br/>Director Richard Curtis delivers a series of cleverly written tales about the trials and tribulations of love, covering the many facets of the subject: unrequited love, platonic love, adulterous love, young love, spontaneous love, dangerous love. Always chuckle-some, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but never boring, Curtis's sparkling script brings us a collection of likable characters who are brilliantly brought to life by an amazing ensemble cast, which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, and Billy Bob Thornton, plus brief cameos from, amongst others, Michael Parkinson, Ant and Dec, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards.<br/><br/>Nighy, in particular, shines as a has-been rocker vying for the Xmas No.1 spot, giving a bittersweet take on the whole romance schtick, as does Laura Linney who plays Sarah, a woman whose love for her brother costs her the chance of scoring with her dream man. On the more traditionally 'sappy' side of things, Grant's Prime Minister falling for working class cutie McCutcheon borders on fantasy, but is perfect viewing fodder for couples curled up in each other's arms on the couch.<br/><br/>Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to the wanton slaughter of buxom women before I find myself hooked on rom-coms!"

He provided most of the laughs, the scene in which he is forced to sing carols for the chidren was hilarious. One of my favourite romantic scene is the scene in which Kiera Knightley realises that the best man at her wedding has feelings for her. Bill Nighy was also funny and so was Rowan Atkinson.

","Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth all experience ""Love Actually,"" a shortened form of a phrase, ""love actually is all around,"" as stated by Hugh Grant in the opening narration. This 2003 film, well directed by Richard Curtis, isn't a typical romantic comedy. It concerns all kinds of love...and while love actually is all around, sometimes things don't work out as we hoped.<br/><br/>As you might guess from the formidable list of stars, the film is somewhat episodic. Liam Neeson plays a man who has just lost his wife and now has to deal with his withdrawn son; Laura Linney is an assistant in love with her boss, but personal problems get in the way; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a long married couple, and now he finds himself being seduced by an office tramp; Hugh Grant is the new prime minister who falls for someone on his staff...etc. There are some adorable stories: Neeson and his son plotting to get a goddess to notice the boy at school...hilarious stories: Bill Nighy as a washed up singer who promotes one of his old songs that has been changed with Christmas lyrics; a young man who can't get a date is sure if he goes to America, his accent will bring in women by the droves; and some sadness - something for everyone. What hooks all the stories together is the theme of love.<br/><br/>There is a good deal of fantasy in the film - it's meant to be fun, light and sweet, and it succeeds. I didn't read the other reviews, but from some of the posters, I gather there were viewers who wanted something deeper. For me it's always best to take a film as intended and not wish for more. Surely Curtis had no expectation of heavy-duty story and character development when he utilized so many stories. The great soundtrack adds to the festivities. It's an ultimate feel-good movie, and it's the favorite film of many, including the person who sent it to me as a gift."

But, unfortunately, they are tend to be snuffed out as Chinese parents are, generally speaking, unbelievably realistic. Then, I appreciate the love between the writer and the Portuguese maid. I yearn towards love between different people because it can open new horizon in ones life. Though they haven't a common language, it doesn't mean they cannot communicate their affection towards each other.

I won't talk to much about the actors, but some need to take note. In only a few minutes of screen time Liam Neeson makes one feel really sad and I honestly got a little choked up when the songs starts at the funeral. That is impressive to get that much emotion in a role in such a short period of time. The next that need mentioning is just about all the scenes with Emma Thompson. I like the scene at the end of the play when she confronts Alan Rickman and pulls it off really really well. The next mention would be Laura Linney who I think it is just wonderful and I loved her role in the movie. My next is actually the young women who play Auriela. She put some physical mannerisms in there that made that character extremely desirable and made me believe that it was possible for Colin Firth to fall in love with her with such limited interaction. I almost fell in love with her. Now onto the substance of the film. I like how it approached just about every type of love and showed that it is not just boy gets girl, boy loses girls, boy gets girl back. I loved the different type of loves, from the love of two life long friends, love for a brother in need, a love between kids, a hopeless love, and all the problems that maintaining that love or even obtaining love. The ability of love to transcend language, age, and social class are all there. I liked how the movie dealt with nearly every type of love, but did not bore me by making an entire movie out of each story. But making the movie this way requires an incredibly talented cast and they had that. The soundtrack I loved and before this gets too long I would like to emphasize the point this is not a chick flick. It is just a really good movie that makes one feel good."

","When I've saw the trailer of this film I thought it was going to be one of those typical Hollywood love films, especially since the fact that it involves actors like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.<br/><br/>But I was way wrong.<br/><br/>This film look at love through another point of view. The plot is unrealistic yet it is believable, unlike many other romantic films. This film catches my attention from the beginning to the end, and although it has its flaws, I really enjoyed it and I am confident to say that I've never ever seen a romantic film so unique: It mix sweet love, comedy, tragic and bitterness all in one, with an overwhelming emphases on love, it's main core.<br/><br/>The stories that are, in my opinion, the flaws of the movie are the one involving two porn-movie stars (what's the point?) and the insistence of love between two very small kids (un-touching and also unbelievable). But as these were relatively minors sub-stories, it doesn't destroy the movie. The other stories are simply fantastic and enjoyable. Bill Nighy did an outstanding job and he turned out to be one of the most enjoyable character (from an audience point of view) in the movie, and his story with his manager is both funny and touching. Hugh Grant is another scene-stealer and his little speech was outstanding, and although a real Prime Minister will not behave in any of the things he's done in the movie (unless he/she want to create a big international crisis), it does add hugely to the entertainment value of the movie (which is all I care). Emma Thompson plays arguably the only tragic story in the movie and did an outstanding job (she's so good that it's amazing she wasn't nominated for any major awards). Other stories were great too, I won't go over them in detail but this movie is a very under-rated yet an extremely well-made masterpiece. 9.9/10!"

","This is yet another film on which the critics (as well as most of the viewing public for that matter) and I completely disagree. Not that I think that this was a bad film, but it surely wasn't a good one either.<br/><br/>The movie starts of fine, but then soon enough spins off into the realm of the ridiculous, childish and impossible without even being funny. In essence, this film ends up not being romantic, dramatic, funny (except for one or two scenes with Rowan Atkinson) or anything else for that matter. For example, just figure the probability of a British PM knocking on doors in the middle of the night looking for a lost girlfriend (and by the way, Hugh Grant is pathetic and totally unbelievable as the PM), or a kid simply running through airport security virtually unhindered (whith his father encouraging him to do so), etc. This list could go on and on...

"inkblot11","7","0","2","2 January 2007"," Actually, love, this film is warm and funny...but do note the R rating
","It is nearing Christmastime in England. The new bachelor prime minister (Hugh Grant) is meeting his appointed staff, including a lovely aid named Natalie. His sister (Emma Thompson) is making a lobster costume for the Christmas play and wondering about the fidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, a writer (Colin Firth) has come home to find his wife having an affair with his brother. He takes off for a holiday in France and meets a lovely housekeeper. Elsewhere, a young couple have just been married, an aging rock star is attempting a comeback, a nerdy young man is going to off to find love in Wisconsin, a recent widower is dealing with a confused stepson, and a radio network employee (Laura Linney) is smitten with a coworker. Will this be a happy holiday for everyone? Well, just about! This lovely film has many, many story lines but they all work and they all receive enough attention to satisfy the viewers. The film is quite humorous and humane, giving out smiles and sighs with aplomb. All of the actors do their jobs very well and should be commended for making what will probably be a classic in holiday films and in British film-making. One caveat, however. The film got a deserved R rating for language and for one plot line that involves body doubles doing sexual situations for the film industry. Alas, if these two things were eliminated, the film could be recommended for viewing without hesitation. As it is, the film is not suitable for anyone under 18, without extreme guidance. Or, wait. Doesn't the film show up on television from time to time, with some scenes edited? Instead of getting the movie at the local video store, this viewer recommends taping it right from network television. The movie will still retain its funny and sweet story but will be the cleaner, more suitable family version. For, in truth, the film has so many wonderful moments, it would be a shame for anyone to miss seeing the film, actually."

I thought it was another Curtis Grant movie, where the most redeeming feature was the soundtrack. Actually it was nice to see Gregor Fisher (love him) get tarted up for a change, and get the best line, ""ten minutes with Elton...."" Bill Nighy as always, was great, as was our Emma. As in all Curtis movies, there were some ""funny situations"" and a few ""clever touches."" There were some awful ones too. The ""American Chicks, (""American Pie?"") scene, was ugh. And, as with all pies, you can have great ingredients, but if the cook messes it up, it leaves an awful taste in the mouth. My recording of this film actually cut off before it ended, and I didn't mind actually. Except that perhaps somewhere near the end you got the answer to "" Why did they call it Love Actually?

The audience would have preferred if two or three stories were followed up and the story was taken to its logical end. Instead we are muddled.

I particularly enjoy the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman story. They seemed the most realistic to me. A long time married couple who must deal with one spouse's flirtation with infidelity and the consequences of people's actions. I enjoy how their situation is handled. Also, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's story line. When I say I enjoy the diversity in the film I mean the ethnic, age and size diversity that the director incorporates. It's hardly represented in many movies and the reality is that there are many types of people and they do all fall in love.

The use of the Beach Boy's ""God Only Knows"" with the final airport scene and the closing shots of non-actors (yes, real people) meeting each other in the airport was superb.

","I watched this because there was a special offer at the video shop, so it only cost me £1. It was far funnier in places than I expected, and quite subtle in its balancing of love affairs that do take off, generally in unusual circumstances, against failures and other kinds of love, all in pursuit of the theme that ""love is all around"". I have to say, some of the developments are wildly implausible, and Hugh Grant does not convince as a bachelor Prime Minister, who must, to judge from a remark by his sister in the story, be a lot older than he looks (and would either party actually have a leader in his forties who was not merely a bachelor but without any kind of female partner at all? I doubt it). But many of the performances are engaging, especially Bill Nighy as a clapped-out old rock star, and overall it was good fun."

","If you want a good romantic comedy, you can always count on Richard Curtis. Having written Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones'Diary (and sequel), he's the man responsible for Love Actually, which he also directed.<br/><br/>The film takes place a few weeks before Christmas, and tells the stories of people looking for love. Among these we find Hugh Grant's (priceless) Prime Minister, who develops feelings (""Oh no, this is so inappropriate"") for his new secretary Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), trying to save her marriage with Harry (Alan Rickman, constantly looking as if he's about to announce you're terminally ill); widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), dealing with his son's love problems; one of Harry's employees (Laura Linney), who's too shy to confess she's in love with a colleague.<br/><br/>These characters (and several others) meet throughout the film, with unexpected, hilarious and touching results. As in Four Weddings, Curtis artfully keeps the tone between affecting (the Neeson segment) and gut-burstingly funny (if you don't laugh watching Grant's dance routine, then there's something wrong). All this is largely due to an amazing ensemble cast, comprised of top class thespians from both sides of the Atlantic (Billy Bob Thornton is quite enjoyable as the President of the United States). Standouts include Curtis-regular Grant (the scene where he mocks Margaret Thatcher is comedy gold) and Bill Nighy, who deservedly won a BAFTA award for his portrayal of disgraced (and deliciously sweary) singer and former drug addict Billy Mack. Also notable: Martin Freeman (The Office) playing a porn actor and a cameo by Rowan Atkinson (ace).<br/><br/>Overall a funny and well made film, although I must say I could have lived without a couple of episodes (one featuring Colin Firth, the other about a sex-obsessed guy going to America). But if you liked Four Weddings, Notting Hill and the rest, chances you'll like this too are very big.<br/><br/>As Billy Mack says, love is all around..."

Rather, it provides an insightful look into today's often misunderstood world. In a world where hate and violence are all too common, this movie shows that in reality the world is a place full of love. The simple premise of the movie is clearly stated in the opening lines by the Prime Minister that ""If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" The rest of the movie sets out to prove that point. Through the normal relationships of people's lives, such as husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, friend and friend, father and son, and others, we see that the world is still a beautiful place and that love is one of the most important experiences that this world has to offer.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie.

What is also incredible are the good selected songs that play along the film ending up with ""God Only knows"" by the Beach Boys. You wont regret in watching it and you will see that the cinema doest need melancholic movies thats ends up in tragedies or teenager romantic films. Is beautiful, touching and is for sure the greatest love story of our time."

","i thought all 'couples' are good but the one with daniel and sam is the best. i love how daniel never treats sam like a kid and takes what he says to heart. i also love the 'aging rock star' man he's awesome with that. i don't however like how the harry and karen relationship kind of leaves you wondering. but overall, aces for this one. and if you get the DVD and do the commentary, it's a blast to listen to. the prime minister and secretary is pretty cute, you know they like each other, you can tell to look at them looking at each other, and the kiss at the end, when the school play is over, cool. i like how you're not really quite sure what role the man from the store plays at the airport. is he an angle? or just a someone who remembers what it is to be young and in love? great movie"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","0","2","13 July 2006"," One of my all-time favourite 'chick-flicks'
","You know how most chick-flicks fall under the category of 'guilty pleasures'? Well, Love Actually is not one of them because while it does indeed have chick-flick tendencies, it is a well-made, heartfelt and original film. You never ever need to feel guilty about enjoying it, even as a guy. What sets it apart from the guilty pleasures is its whole approach to love; it doesn't have to be between a young, hot couple but can occur in the unlikeliest of people and in the unlikeliest of times. Here we finally have a romantic comedy that manages to avoid the cheesiest clichés, but is still rich in romance. In Love Actually, we get to follow a multitude of characters in story lines that gradually intertwine. My favourite one was actually between a father (Liam Neeson) and his son.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, it must be put forward that not all story lines end happily or even traditionally. There is no grand romantic ending for all couples, nor is there a big heart-breaking finish to any. Love Actually treats its relationship much like reality--sometimes a relationship works out--sometimes it doesn't. It is not completely devoid of cheap romantic moments and in my opinion the Colin Firth storyline should have been omitted altogether as it is richest in these. Still, a very enjoyable Christmas romantic comedy. 8/10"

","I love this movie. It makes me feel good to watch, and I never get tired of it. I watch it over and over, (especially the part where Hugh Grant, as the Prime Minister, is dancing around, I watch that at least twice per viewing) and I highly recommend it for everyone of any age or gender. It's message is really important especially now, in these times where love is sometimes hard to give/find. ""Love is all around"", no matter where you are, or who you are, in it's many forms. And you know, it's great how this movie isn't ""some sappy chick flick"".

Sure, there were clichés, but I do think that in many cases they are intentional and just taking the p*ss out. Example: the guy who goes and finds girls in the US. I highly doubt the writers ACTUALLY thought that this would happen in real life. It's supposed to be funny. And man, I don't know where all this yapping about misogyny in the film is coming from.

","I fanatically despise love movie or any kind of movie about love. At first, the reason I bought this movie was because I heard Elisha Cuthbert was in it. I watched this film from the most subjective point of view with no expectation or whatsoever and I felt no embarrassment after my perspective of romance film to make this statement. This film has astonished me from the minute I click the ""play button"" until the very end. There are several aspects and factors that made me considered ""Love Actually"" on the top of my list. The music was wonderful, the casting was superbly perfect and the story was beautiful, but what is most important is the message in this peace of art. I believe the film is trying to remind us of something which we thought to be very important but barely exist, love (which cover peace and all the other beautiful feeling of life). After 11 Sept (which was mentioned at beginning of the film)and following the other terrorists assault, hate has spread between Nations, Race and Religions. Many peoples include myself starting to assume that we live in a world of hatred and greed and we become disgusted our self and in my opinion this film have succeeded in giving a good example of what they are trying to tell by taking example of the life of several different people from variety social level, from a kid who just lost her mother to a new selected prime minister. This film has made laugh, happy and cried (which happened for the 1st time). I strongly recommend this movie; it is much more educating than some action film with some fancy move."

Your feelings and reactions probably same, it is hard to explain but when you watched the film; you are very close to live such kind of love. In most case, you smile and laugh even most romantic scene. There are too much stars in the scene but they had little roles as it was in ""Crash"".

","Overall this movie works, though there is much about it that is awkward. It helps greatly that the director, Richard Curtis, keeps his movie self-aware and old fashioned on purpose--when it becomes just too cute and quirky to tolerate, it at least has the decency to know it.<br/><br/>As happens all too frequently with these episodic ensemble films, there are some story lines that are simply more interesting than others, so the movie feels unbalanced. On a second viewing, it was much more difficult to have patience with the English-lad-in-Wisconsin sequences, or those involving the adult movie stand-ins -- which could have been left on the cutting room floor -- when there were such rich and affecting moments delivered by, for example, Emma Thompson, when she realizes the necklace her husband bought and wrapped as a Christmas present isn't for her, or by Laura Linney, in a brief scene of her visiting her mentally ill brother for the holiday. Bill Nighy, as an aging musician fed up with just about everything, is also a standout, and gets many of the movie's choicest and funniest lines.<br/><br/>I very much liked this movie when I saw it in the theatre, but liked it somewhat less when I watched it again after it came out on DVD. I suspect it may be one of those movies that doesn't in the end hold up very well, though it's harmless enough. And it's got a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

Normally movies like that ruin the movie by making a good plot bad with lame jokes, but this one hits the spot.This clever movie has stars we all know and love, and they did the right thing choosing this movie to act in. Each actor is perfect just the way they are. And when you've got all these stories going at once that somehow meet, you can't say its a bad movie! <br/><br/>The movie starts off a little while before Christmas, and you have the man who while at a funeral his wife cheats on him; at the funeral is the boy and stepdad who lost their wife and Mum; there's the rock artist doing a remake of let it show, the Prime Minister who's sisters has a husband who has an employee having a wedding, who is being catered by a man. At the wedding is a man who likes the bride, and a girl who likes a guy who she thinks will never like her until her boss gives her a shove. And then there's the couple working on a movie together.<br/><br/>Confused? Don't worry, this isn't one of those movies where you'll get lost; and if the movie sounds like a horrible American lovey dovey boring soapy soap, 2 things; 1, its British, and 2, its never boring and is really interesting and funny, even if m writing dosen't sound like it (i'm probably not good the best at explaining a true British romance, not being British) so watch it and enjoy.<br/><br/>Listen to me when I this movie is worth it all the way, and get some popcorn to go with it too."

","I absolutely love this movie. When I hired it on DVD I had my doubts, especially since my hopeless romantic friend had told me to hire it because it was her favourite romance at the time (her knew favourite is now the notebook). I thought it was just going to be another typical romantic movie. The people meet, cant be together for one reason or another, but then they change their situation and make it work, living happily ever after. I was wrong.<br/><br/>This movie contains many small love stories, each very different from the last and representing a different side of what we call love. It covers the effects of affairs, the harmlessness of childhood crushes, the obsession young males tend to have with sex, the older adults who just seek true love and the chance meetings that end up forging life long relationships.<br/><br/>This movie may confuse some at first (I know I was confused) but once you get the idea of how it works, you will quickly understand the stories and the way that they're all connected. You will leave the lounge with a smile on your face. If there was ever a movie that was made to give hope to those in the world who don't have strong beliefs in love, this would be it.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for a feel good experience! It'll work it's magic every time."

","The first time I have seen this film it was some months after it was out on the screens because -as often it may happen- the title ""Love actually"" can be misjudged as another superficial comedy without nothing to give us. And yet, after I watched it I felt it had transmitted me the warm feeling that Love is what really matters. None of the subplots is major to the others, and actually one could say that none of the subplots is really relevant to the development of the story. And that could be it true, but there's a deeper reason behind it: be it a child love, a widower love, an affair or a brotherly love, it doesn't need to be odd, eccentric or spectacular to matter. The best line of the film (Hugh Grant's/the British PM's), and the summary of it all, will help you realise it.<br/><br/>""Prime Minister: Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."""

","I have been avoiding this film, as it has been all over Central Fl's HBO 18 times a week and besides that, I was not in the mood for love, actually! However, after stumbling across Richard Curtis' (writer/screenwriter) 'The Girl In The Cafe' (limited release) I decided to give 'Love' a shot at 5:30 one morning and I am quite glad I did. (I will confess at the dénouement I was all tears.) Mr. Curtis' 'The Girl In The Cafe' is so simple (on one level) yet so complex on other levels and the main character, Bill Nighy, plays his role so understated you will not believe this could be the same actor in 'Love Actually.' Love is well enough constructed to keep together 8 'love' stories of different sorts and will pull you in, in a way you will never expect. The acting is good all the way around with some 'bright lights' shining but you will fall for them all, I promise. You do not have to be a romantic to enjoy this well crafted, surprising effort at an emotion we all suffer and welcome at the same time. You will find yourself hoping certain characters do pull it together as it changes their lives forever as love is meant to do. Where Richard Curtis draws upon his story lines in the detail he does, I cannot imagine. He observes people is the answer. Other Curtis films Americans may be familiar with are 'The Girl In the Cafe' (superb), 'Notting Hill', The Bridget Jones series, and this one,' Love, Actually.' If you have a heart and allow your emotions to surface, I promise you will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, do not take professional critics words to heart. They all seem to have serious interpersonal problems. You know if you will like a film from the exposure you are submitted to. I'll read critics but only AFTER I view a film. This film is a good case in point. Many did not like it at all and here we have a wonderful, well acted storyline."

","From the view ""out of Hollywood"" LOVE ACTUALLY is a true gem and one of the most underrated pictures of the past years. HBO seems to agree with me because the movie is shown there on a regular basis. Congratulations to Richard Curtis, one of the most sensitive (movie script) writers (and now also directors)of our time. Compared to most of the big, dull Hollywood movies, Richard Curtis did not forget the art of telling a heartwarming story. As in Four Weddings and a funural and in Notting Hill, Mr. Curtis manages again to makes us laugh, cry and feel good at the same time. Love Actually is a heartwarming true piece of phylosophy that many of today's movies lack. Mr. Curtis can do without any special effects because it is the story that matters, nothing else."

I wasn't laughing because the movie was sweet, but because Richard Curtis has served up a ridiculous parody of these types of movies. The funny thing is that nobody gets it. Every story, however, parodies the idea of love as something that is superficial and based on looks, rather than something that is deep and lasting. There is not a single moment in any of the multiple story lines that offers a sentimental reason for characters to be together. In particular, I thought 1) the storyline where the British guy goes to America and the American women immediately fall all over themselves for him and 2) the storyline where the Prime Minister's girlfriend is called ""fat"" and ""plump"" over and over again by everyone that knows her were not meant to be taken literally.

","Here is a rare bird in my cinema landscape. I really am no great fan of good-feeling movies or romantic comedies, but this Christmas film really succeeded to make me feel good, and romantic. Sure, Richard Curtis is one of the best directors in this genre, certainly the best British one, but it takes a pound of courage to engage in such a deprecated genre and a bunch of talent to get out with a cued piece of work like this one.<br/><br/>Multiple stories movies are often brought to screen in the last few years. To be successful you need not only for each story to be simple and credible, but you also need a script that gives enough individuality and weight for each of the segments, and a good director that brings everything to look like one piece of work, more like a good composer combines different orchestra sections in a symphony. Al these are present here, and moreover, a brilliant cast, including half of the who's who list of romantic comedy actors, and still allowing a few of them to do memorable creations, especially Bill Nighty in the aged rock star role. Hugh Grant is the only one who seems slightly mis-cast, and this is not because he is not a good romantic actor, but because he looks too young and unsure for a British Prime Minister to be believed.<br/><br/>'Love actually' will be on the holidays seasons TV schedules for many years, and for a change will be the one movie on the list that will not cause me switch channels."

","Sometimes it's not easy to put your finger on why you feel the way you do, but the fact that you feel it is undisputed. The fact that i almost always like British comedy is one of those facts. I can't always say why but it more or less never fails.<br/><br/>Light British romantic comedy is a genre that seems to have grown considerably these last few years. Add Hugh Grant and you have a winning formula. And why not? Even though movies like ""Love Actually"" are often quite corny and never really surprising they are nevertheless enjoyable. Mostly because of two things really. First of all the comedy is very British, meaning that it's usually quite subtle and often a little peculiar. Second there is almost always great actors involved. Here we have a big part of the British acting elite. Aforementioned Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman... The one that stands out most in this movie though is without a doubt Bill Nighy as the washed-up rock singer who gets one last chance with a Christmas song.<br/><br/>This is very much a Christmas movie. Not only because it's set at Christmas but also because it's warm, funny and very cozy. And i say that in the best sense of the words, not in the vomit-inducing way that sugar-sweet TV-movies are cozy. It does have problems.

Example: in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" when George crashes into the tree, the man who comes out is concerned ONLY with his ""historical"" tree, not if George is o.k. after the wreck. The man is jaded in his world view or as a friend and I refer to certain people, he is ""hopelessly lost to the world.""

No, it's not. Is it a fun movie to watch? Yes, it is. Let go of the ""necessity"" for character development (it is a comedy after all) and let your own imagination fill in the blanks. Have we all become so intellectually lazy that we cannot invest ourselves in a film to fill in the perceived ""blanks""? I think many minimize the importance of the 9/11 reference. In a nutshell, it points out the critical centerpiece of our lives that LOVE holds when confronted with a crisis. As someone who lost friends in the Pentagon on 9/11, I think it's wonderful to read stories of those in the WTC who were able to make those ""profession of love"" calls to their loved ones before they met their end. My friends in the Pentagon were not fortunate enough to have that blessing and those they left behind have a void left because of that.<br/><br/>Capra believed in the true essence of man and ""universal truths"" like those expressed in another, modern movie that makes a valid point about love, ""Secondhand Lions."" The ""what every boy needs to know about being a man"" speech, or at least the small piece we hear, perfectly mirror Capra's ideals and, to my mind, these ideals seem to be what Curtis was trying to convey in his movie.<br/><br/>If adultness in the world has become such that we must tear apart and parse everything we see, read, watch, hear or feel, then we are a much poorer civilization. If we fail to note that Love Actually IS all around, then we are in far more peril of losing our core selves than we are from the peril posed by terrorists. In fact, the case could be made we are playing into the terrorists hands by abdicating our basic rights to them by letting them dominate our fears.<br/><br/>The story lines, to me, point out the universality of love and its unpredictability. Rickman makes an error; gets caught up in the fantasy and, too late, realizes his error. However, the movie ends with the possibility of a relationship that moves into a more mature phase. Does it require reading into it to come up with that? Sure, but that's what once was the charm of movies. They weren't expected to lay everything out for the viewer; they engaged the viewer and expected them to become involved in the movie. Perhaps in this day and age, we are all too busy to do that. Perhaps in this day and age, we are all too prepared and ready to view criticism as being, necessarily, negative when the traditional definition of critique is to be seen as both positive and negative.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is not the pinnacle of romantic comedies; however, it does have many redeeming qualities and has enough of that magic that elicits from us the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that can, if we allow it, open our eyes to the possibilities. Seems to me the movie does accomplish that goal. It's light-hearted with twinges of pathos in it...if we take the time to notice."

","Me and my friends loved the movie and have seen it several times, but we always argue over if Billy Mack and his manager Joe are gay. I think so, but my other friend says no. What do you think? My friend says that him and Billy just realized that the went through their whole lives just to realize they are best friends and that sense Billy Mack tells Joe that he's the love of his life. I think they finally realize, after all that time, that they do deeply love each other and at that moment become gay. Another things that leads me to believe this is at the end when Billy Mack brings that girl home in the airport and Joe doesn't even know who she is. I think it's a cover-up for their homosexuality.

","This movie had CHICK FLICK written all over it. Consequently, I missed it's theatrical release. What a shame! Movies like this should be enjoyed en masse.<br/><br/>It seems to me that there is a wide rift of opinion on this film. You either love it or hate it. Those who hate it tend to hate the concepts presented in the film, rather than the presentation. So it seems to me that if you're bitter and empty inside, you might not enjoy ""Love Actually"" for what it is: a light happy film about the perils and rewards of love.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast did a great job in a series of vignettes. Colin Firth is amazing with Lucia Moniz. Kris Mashall is hilarious as a Brit who heads to America to get lucky. I enjoyed the interaction between the stepfather and son combo played by Liam Neeson and Thomas Sangster. They have a real chemistry on screen. The story of platonic love between an aging rock star Bill Nighy and his manager is so touching.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a happy tale of love, you'll adore it. If you've recently left a relationship or have never had one, you'll hate it, because you'll want what these characters so brilliantly present. Recommended!"

","This is ""actually"" my first post.<br/><br/>I just got through watching this beautiful film for the tenth (or is it eleventh?) time on cable and wanted to add my own thoughts on the experience.<br/><br/>As a dedicated movie buff (and we're talking from the silents right through to today) I try to see as many films as possible in a their theatrical run. But I took a pass on this one -- maybe there were too many other ""serious"" films around at the time, maybe it just sounded corny -- don't remember. But after much prodding from a girlfriend of mine I decided to rent the DVD last year. Two hours and some minutes later I was wiping the tears from my eyes and hitting the play button again. And again.<br/><br/>Sure, this film is flawed. Not all of the stories work as well as others. Some of the characters and their actions may make even the most forgiving viewer cringe. But writer-director Richard Curtis has forged one of the most enchanting, heartwarming, humorous and ultimately moving testaments to the joy and pain of love that I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Tonight, I was channel surfing and stopped to watch ""just a minute"" I told myself. Right. That's what I say every time I happen upon it. And just like the first time, I'm still sitting there at the very end, wiping the tears from my eyes with a big smile on my face."

","I remember finally getting my hands on this movie the day it arrived at the rental store and popped it in my DVD player. My hands were shaking with anticipation, and by the end I was satisfied but not with all of it.<br/><br/>My only complaint was that it had too many story lines in it. If I could cut down the amount of couples whos story lines were interesting, the top three would have been, Juliet and Mark. I honestly felt bad for Mark who has always loved Juliet, but as a way of protecting himself never said anything and had to watch his best friend marry her. <br/><br/>The prime minister and Natalie. It was nice to see the prime minister portrayed as a guy who's just as lonely, and in love as the next guy.<br/><br/>And lastly Daniel who has just lost his wife and is grieving, and his step-son sam who is in love. Its a touching relationship where we see Daniel coming out of his pain and helping his son which in turn helps him to heal.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, and if it concentrated on these stories instead of so many more it would have been better. Some of the others were good too but I think these 3 if they were given the detail, and time would have made a great movie."

","""Love Actually"" is a romantic comedy about a dozen love stories whose lives are all loosely connected to each other, all rolled into one, slightly over two-hour movie. Although it is a very touching movie which leaves you feeling warm inside, there were a few scenes that could have been cut and some other alterations to the movie could have been done to make it come together better.<br/><br/>This movie shows all different types of love from love at first sight, as in the story about the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and his tea maid (Martine McCutcheon), to Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who sees that his love lies in his best friend and manager, and to Jamie and Aurelia (Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz), whose only language is love. Yes that sounds cheesy, but it is true.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis, the director of this film, who has also done work on ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", does not seem to step out of the box with romantic comedies and casting Hugh Grant.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays a lovable, awkward, young Prime Minister, who falls for the chubby, who probably weighs about 115 lbs., instead of the rest of the cast who weigh about 98 lbs., Downing Street maid. Although all the girls swoon over him, I have seen this character many a time before in all his other films, such as in ""About a Boy,"" nothing new in my eyes.<br/><br/>There is also the love is forever story with Emma Thompson's character, Karen, who has been married to her husband Harry (Alan Richman), who is a potentially cheating husband. This is the story that, if I cried in movies, I would. Karen was expecting a very nice Christmas present only received a CD. She then went into the bedroom and cried. They showed about five minutes of her just standing there with a sad song in the background. It was depressing, sad, and it make me want to go in the movie screen and hug Emma Thompson.<br/><br/>The next love match is Jamie (Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lucia Moniz). He is the character who was cheated on in the beginning and then falls for the Portuguese housemaid and both of them can't speak the same language. Although this also does not stem far from his character in ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", I like this love story. I think that it is innocent and shows that there can be love without language. <br/><br/>You then have Bill Nighy's character Billy Mack who's on-going joke about his cheesy Christmas hit ""Christmas is All Around"" finds out that the love of his life is his best friend and manager- strictly platonic. I thought this was one of the more touching stories because it includes a certain love that everyone knows about at every age. The other stories that are more touching is about the love story between Laura Linney's character Sarah and her mentally challenged brother and the story about a step-father, Daniel (Liam Neeson) and son (Thomas Sangster), whose mother and wife had just passed, and apparently the son is in love with a girl at school. These are the more touching stories that people can relate to: brothers and sisters, dads and sons, elementary puppy love. These are the small stories that make this movie more realistic and like you know the characters.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton plays the U.S. President in this movie and there is an anti-American feeling slammed in our faces during a few of Grant's and Thornton's scenes together. Thornton seems to be compared to a suave Bill Clinton. In the beginning of the movie, it also talks briefly about the war and the security at airports.<br/><br/>There is also one comic relief character, Colin (Kris Marshall), a young , college- aged student, who can't seem to find love in the UK, so he believes that if he goes to America, he will get tons f chicks because of his cute British accent. Inevitably, it turns out that it is true. This is another on-going joke throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie ended up being just over two hours long, a little too long for just a romantic comedy. And although this movie has 3 dramatic scenes with the man chasing the girl in a public, odd place, there is a deeper meaning behind this movie. It shows many different kids of love, besides romantic, and I think those points shouldn't be over looked. In the end, everybody still likes Hugh Grant and shy guys getting the girl. It is a good movie to curl up with a bunch of girl friends. Your classic chick flick, and I, being a chick, like it."

","Just saw it. This movie is a Christmas fantasy. Everyone is beautiful and pretty much only good thing happen to them. Even the most unlikely things happen. It's the impossible dream of the perfect Christmas. In the real world these kind of things don't really happen. Having said that, the optimism of the film is contagious and, despite the flaws, at the end you're kinda happy.<br/><br/>The best of the movie was it's message of love, it's really heart warming. However, the way it was done could have been better. There's too much cheese. It's gets kinda corny at times, especially at the end. Mostly, i think it should have been more serious and drama-like. Like someone said in the boards, i think it should have been more realistic. It goes way to much over the top and it almost ruins the movie.<br/><br/>There's some really good ""serious"" scenes though. My favorite story lines were the friend of the just married couple (the scene when she sees the wedding video-- so sad, so perfect--, the cards scene, again, so sad, so heart breaking); the stand ins (the contrast between the way they are and the job they do-- too funny). The scene with the kid running through the airport to get to his love was the best one. That's what love is all about.<br/><br/>I ended up liking some things, disliking others. It could -- should have been better. Mixed feelings. I guess i mostly liked it, but not as much as i would have wanted... although i wouldn't mind having some of that American girls fantasy.The idea was good but it the end, it's sadly a failed movie."

","The movie follows the lives, primarily the love lives, of many different couples with totally different profiles, life styles and personalities, giving the impression that the movie will never get anywhere. But it does.<br/><br/>At some point everything starts making sense and the total disconnection of the characters and theirs stories suddenly converges, some of them subtly and some of them very obviously.<br/><br/>The movie is not a traditional romantic comedy that deals primarily with corny feelings and clichés only. <br/><br/>Of course it is girly and naive sometimes but it also addresses to more complexes issues and deals with some controversial themes. The movie is also really funny and the cast is fantastic. I believe they were able to gather a good part of the to British actors and actresses still active.<br/><br/>In summary it is light, sentimental (in a good way), tacky (in a good way too, if this is possible), intriguing and very amusing."

","My wife and I like the movie a lot. I should say loved it actually. The use of several families, the use of an all-star cast, the diversity represented among the characters were all wonderful. This may one day become a Christmas classic. There is something in the movie for almost every person or family or couple or almost couple to relate to. And it is refreshing that there was not necessarily a predictable ending for every subplot. Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson put in excellent performances as did many of the actors who are not as readily identifiable by American movie goers. While the writing is not completely unique in content, the movie overall is a breath of fresh air, at least for American movie goers, given the uniqueness of the British location and the slang and language. Even though we never heard of this movie until a friend recommended it, we are glad we decided to watch. Most folks will be glad they did too."
"OllieZ","5","0","2","29 October 2005"," Didn't work.
","Firstly, the score of 5 means average. Therefore, this film is average - the nicest word possible for this overly sweet romance from Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>I like Four Weddings and a Funeral,not a popular opinion for film buffs but I thought it was witty, and save for MacDowells risible performance, well acted. It was a change for British comedy, but it is such a shame it spawned so many bland and lifeless films - mainly from Curtis' own hand (wrote Notting Hill, directed Love, Actually).<br/><br/>Now, you may think I am a miserable old sod, not liking this new rom-com fare...and you may well be right. I am a fan of romantic comedies, yes, such as Woody Allen's films. Annie Hall, Manhattan for example - but what makes them work is that they are sad - Annie Hall in non linear fashion, charts a relationship through its highs and lows, whilst Manhattan, taking place in the black and silver backdrop of Gershwin's in the titular city, also explores relationships. Yet these films almost end (or in Annie Hall's case, start) on a series of down notes, which agrees with Dante from Kevin Smith's Clerks (1994) that life is a series of down notes.<br/><br/>And therein lies Love, Actually's problem - the story, even though it has some down notes, they are ALL resolved in the completely ""coincidental"" ending, where the characters' paths all seem to cross. Almost too coincidental, the Hollywood ending that Allen avoided in The Purple Rose of Cairo. Curtis is all too happy to resolve the ending in this film. Even though Four Weddings does end happily, at least it had the courtesy to include some laughs - which this film seems have forgotten about.<br/><br/>The main laughs for mainstream viewers might well have come from Hugh Grant playing Prime Minister (and strangely enough, himself), dancing and pratting around with house maid Martine McCutcheon. I expected laughs from the morose dead pan of Alan Rickman - instead the story was at its most dramatic with him. I did enjoy his section of the story, because although it was clichéd, it was enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>As for the other stories in this film, they were cringe worthy. Liam Neeson and his son hunting for women was really quite a bore...Keira Knightly and her two lovers was underdeveloped...the guy who went to America, also in hunt of sex and (love, actually!)...Colin Firth's story of love in a foreign climate was well handled admittedly - as for the rest, I have already forgotten them.<br/><br/>Films that handle a lot of characters like this, are normally paced rapidly. Think Altman's Short Cuts, Anderson's Magnolia and Boogie Nights. If Curtis would have paced the film up, injected a little life into this film, it probably would have been a bit better.<br/><br/>""Loce Actually"" had its moments of comedy, its moments of drama - but overall, it never really came together. The happy ending was too sweet, and the lead up was badly directed - the acting was fine. So an average film, with an ending that will be rotting your teeth and burning your brain with anger.<br/><br/>Ah, but I'm a cynic. If you liked this film I recommend you seeing: Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeannours - romance/drama that is subverted.<br/><br/>Happiness - this film also explores a lot of characters. Enjoy."

It immediately brightens your mood and gives you hope when it comes to matters of the heart.<br/><br/>The casting directors on this movie are pure genius. Every single role was beautifully cast, but the real standouts here are Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson.

","I could say that this is a regular romantic comedy but if I was to say that I would be insulting Richard Curtis because this movie is by a long way the best romantic comedy I have ever seen. Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 story lines. This works as a movie because of the chemistry between the actors and the way each of them affected the storyline. I don't normally like Hugh Grant because he is in 90% of English romantic comedies but this is easily the finest project he has worked on and he should be given credit to what he does best and star in romantic comedies. But this movie's highlight is the last 15 minutes when all of the characters are trying to get together. This movies values and attitudes on love and the exploration of the issues behind love should be congratulated."
"madwitch61","4","0","1","14 October 2005"," Funny most of the time, but I didn't appreciate the America abuse
","There were many moments in the film where I was laughing my head off-- mainly Emma Thompson's, but 2 stories gave me a sour feeling that completely ruined the entire film for me: the ""President"" and the ""3 Hot Wisconsin Babes.""<br/><br/>Let's start with the President segment. OK; there are American presidents who have had affairs; to be honest more than you can shake a stick at. But if you're making a statement about current foreign policy (coughBUSHcough), don't make the current president out to be what he's not. Bush is many things, but a lecher isn't one of them. (Billy Bob Thornton, however, was a good choice.)<br/><br/>The Presidential bit would not have ruined the entire film. I could have gotten over it. It was ""Wisconsin"" that made me HATE this film. With the rather sweet, but sex-obsessed dweeb who was going to the States to get laid, I was all geared up for him to be sorely disappointed in his hope that a horde of American women would jump him for being English. I hoped he would find love AFTER he realized this. I laughed my head off at ""A Magical Place Called 'Wisconsin.' "" But instead, his hopes and dreams are fulfilled by not two, not three, but FOUR women he meets the first night there. This ENRAGED me. I understand that there is a stereotype in Europe that American women are very promiscuous, but that... that was RIDICULOUS!!! Completely and totally ridiculous! I am offended on behalf of all American women. I am especially offended on behalf of the women of Wisconsin. They did NOT deserve that kind of insult.<br/><br/>Yes, there were more realistic American characters. But those two stereotypes completely ruined the film. A movie that would have gotten 8 of 10 is getting a 4. It would have gotten 1 if not for Emma Thompson."

"vpathy","5","0","2","25 September 2005"," Disappointing but occasionally entertaining
","Well I felt moved to post a comment on LA after just seeing it on DVD. I had heard so many good things that I actually went & bought the DVD and was really looking forward to it but I was very disappointed...actually. After watching I looked it up on IMDb & checked out a sample of other viewers' comments...and was hugely surprised by the fact that the majority were very positive ones with a high score! I would have expected an absolute slating on a discerning movie site like this to be honest...<br/><br/>OK so for the positive - the film was entertaining in places, had great production values (the London scenery shots were very attractive). Most of the large (and well-known) ensemble cast were good actors and did their best with the material. I laughed (very) occasionally.<br/><br/>But overall the negative prevailed and I came away feeling like I had wasted my time on a film that hadn't ""added"" anything to my cinematic experiences. The main negative IMO was that there were far too many stories, all of which were given too little airtime to make any of the them involving or interesting. I presume it was the director's deliberate intention to give us snippets of many ""love"" stories to expound on the theme that ""love is all around""! This can sometimes work but here it really didn't...the bad stories should have been dropped and the good ones should have been expanded so that we come away feeling some kind of affiliation with at least a few characters.<br/><br/>So IMO the best stories were:- Laura Linney's 2 year unrequited love - finally reciprocated but unconsummated due to her personal responsibilities for her brother, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman and the near-derailing of their marriage by a potential affair, Colin Firth and his cleaner gradually getting attracted in France However these were not developed properly - we saw fragments and then abrupt/uncertain or melodramatic (see Colin) conclusions, which was a shame as I had (eventually) actually started to care about these characters.<br/><br/>Some of the rest were clearly rubbish - English guy in US gets 4 girls, Andrew Lincoln loves best friend's wife despite never having spoken to her (OK I know she's Keira Knightley but still!), little boy fancies American girl. Surely nobody could have found these stories involving! Even the supposedly headline story of PM and his assistant was so underwritten as to be inconsequential. I like Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon and they did their best...but we'd only seen a couple of scenes between their characters where they had barely exchanged 2 words. So when Hugh read Martine's Xmas card the viewer could scarcely be expected to believe in their sudden mutual love!! Again if this fledging relationship had previously been explored a bit more I too would have been rooting for Hugh to find her in Wandsworth!<br/><br/>And there was no credible or consequential tie-in between characters (unlike say Crash or Magnolia) which I think is a must if you are going to have this type of multi-layered story-telling Some of them happened to attend the same school play?! And then some of them happened to be at Heathrow arrivals on the same day?! These were for the most part unrelated characters.<br/><br/>Apart from this mishmash of quantity not quality and unrelated stories, the whole film just felt too slick. It felt like Richard Curtis was following a checklist of ingredients for ""Successful English Comedy"" and though I know he probably did the same for 4W&AF and NH for some reason both of those felt more substantial and I enjoyed them. This one really really felt like we were all (director, actors and viewers) going through the motions one more time. In a similar vein unlike the previous romcoms when I had got caught up in the mush, I really noticed here when the director was giving us ""reaction signposts"" and it irked me enough I stubbornly refused to follow his directions! Ie this bit's silly (English guy meets 4 hot American chicks), this bit's funny (PM dances around No 10), this bit's moving (Liam Neeson bonds with stepson) etc etc<br/><br/>So overall then not terrible but a bit of a wasted opportunity for an interesting idea and some top-drawer talent."

I mean that there are no romantic comedies considered actually as movies, they are mostly entertainment and fun for a while; but I, as a fan of the genre, find more difficult developing a script within these terms than writing an action film, or on the other side a shocking drama (""it is easier to make cry than making laugh"").<br/><br/>Specialists for this are people like Richard Curtis, who has been collecting hits as a writer in the last decades and now has had the chance to direct, and for the first time, what is the most delightful of his tales. I forgot to confess I prefer a drama to a romantic comedy, because of the variations that one can find. Dramatic writers (and this is easy) take things from any part of everyday life, and turn it into a story.<br/><br/>Instead, as I said a while ago, the ideas in the comedy field are drying out. The plots don't change much and sometimes we find ourselves watching the same thing, especially in the romantic comedy. As I was saying, Richard Curtis knows his theme, how it will begin and how it will end; the incredible thing about his scripts is what happens between that. How he makes us arrive to that satisfying final moment is what says everything about him. He has already proved it, creating different emotional impacts in movies like ""Nothing Hill"" or ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which could have been exactly the same.<br/><br/>And it is after more than ten years, that he grabs the camera with his hand. Maybe he felt the need, or maybe he realized he had to take possession of the lives of these characters. Because in ""Nothing Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones"" the central characters were two in a relationship, or three in a love triangle, and everything was more reduced; but in ""Love Actually"" they are neither two nor three, but a dozen of persons, which in some cases don't even relate, although they are united by a same bond: love, that is actually all around.<br/><br/>From that, we become witnesses of these people's hearts most deepest feelings and through the words and superb leadership of Curtis, and the portrayals of Hugh Grant (he should never change what he does, he's an expert), Colin Firth (keeps on growing in romantic terms), Emma Thompson (always talented), Alan Rickman (incredibly funny), Laura Linney (good in anything), Martine McCutcheon (a revelation), Bill Nighy (from other world), Keira Knightley (still divine and promising) and Liam Neeson (he reminds us what is the passion for work), plus an excellent ensemble; we understand, as a friend of mine said, that we must fight for what we love, without fear and against all odds, and that for loveNothing is impossible."

","This was the directorial debut of writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill), originally titled ""Love Actually Is All Around"", referencing the Wet Wet Wet song ""Love Is All Around"" (Number One for 15 weeks), this was shortened, and many people regard it as their favourite Christmas movie. Basically it is an ensemble cast delving into nine (or ten) separate stories involving a variety of characters and their experiences of love, falling in and out and trying to find love, all played out over the week fives, leading up to Christmas. Rock and roll legend Billy Mack (BAFTA winning Bill Nighy) has recorded ""Christmas Is All Around"", a variation of ""Love Is All Around"", he and his longtime manager Joe (Rab C. Nesbitt's Gregor Fisher) know the song is terrible, but are promoting it as much as possible in hope that it will become Christmas Number One, they are successful, but Billy leaves a party with Sir Elton John to spend time with Joe to celebrate getting drunk and watching porn. Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (12 Years a Slave's Chiwetel Ejiofor) get married, best man Mark (The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln) orchestrates and videotapes it, one day Juliet asks Mark for footage of her in the wedding dress, as she watches the video she realises it is all focused on her, Mark has been in love with her for ages and never said anything, it is only on Christmas Eve, through cue cards, he confesses his love for Juliet, as he walks away she gives him an innocent kiss, and this is the end to it. Writer Jamie (Colin Firth) is devastated after finding out his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) has been cheating on him with his brother, Jamie retreats to his French cottage to continue writing, there Protugese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz) helps him, she can only speak her native language, but they form a close bond, Jamie realises after she leaves he has developed feelings for Aurélia, so he learns (roughly) Portugese, returns to France, finds her, declares his love and proposes, in English, she accepts and they kiss. Harry (Alan Rickman) is the managing director of a design agency, he is married to Karen (BAFTA nominated Emma Thompson) with two children, Harry is attracted to new secretary Mia (Resident Evil's Heike Makatsch) who makes arousing sexual comments, while shopping he attempts to buy her a necklace, but is slowed down by obsessive attention to detail gift-wrapping salesman Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) and stops himself getting caught by Karen, however she finds out about the necklace, after he did buy it, but is heartbroken when she does not receive it, she confronts Harry, he apologises for being a fool, she knows their marriage will not be the same. David (Hugh Grant), Karen's brother, has been elected Prime Minister, junior member of the household staff Natalie (EastEnders' Martine McCuthcheon) is also new at 10 Downing Street, David feels a spark between them, and hates that people think she is chubby, he also asserts himself when the President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton) seems to make an inappropriate move on Natalie, he moves her to a new position to end this distraction, but seeing how affectionate towards him, especially in a Christmas card, David goes to find Natalie, they go together to the local Christmas Eve school play, they try to avoid being seen, but are caught out kissing by everyone when the curtain rises to reveal them onstage. Daniel (Liam Neeson), Karen's friend, has mourned the death of his wife Joanna, he raises his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) alone, Sam has fallen for an American girl at school, also named Joanna (Olivia Olson), he wants to get her to notice him, so learns the drums to join the band for the Christmas play, Sam feels like he failed to impress her, but Daniel convinces him to see Joanna before she boards the plane to America, Daniel (who mentions supermodel Claudia Schiffer earlier in the film) briefly meets another parent, Carol (Claudia Schiffer), there is a momentary spark, Sam manages to get away from airport security and see Joanna, she kisses him before leaving, Sam and Daniel hug in happiness. Sarah (Laura Linney) who works at Harry's graphic design company has been in love with creative director Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for years, they finally get together, but are interrupted by her mentally ill brother Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), who constantly phones from his residence in a mental care facility, Karl tries to say something on Christmas Eve, but cannot, so Sarah spends the night with her brother. Colin (My Family's Kris Marshall) has made many failed attempts to woo British girls, including Mia and wedding caterer Nancy (Julia Davis), he tells his friend Tony (Abdul Salis) he is going to America to find love there, convinced foreign girls love British men, Tony thinks it is a stupid idea, but once in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Colin meets three stunningly attractive women, Stacey (Ivana Miličević), Jeannie (American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones) and Carol-Anne (The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert), who invite him to their house, and roommate Harriet (Shannon Elizabeth) joins also. John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Gavin & Stacey's Joanna Page) are professional body doubles for films, they talk to each other whilst filming nude simulated sex scenes, they carefully pursue a relationship. Many of the characters are brought together at Heathrow Airport, with real arrivals and the song ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys playing. It does make you laugh, it's cheesy and schmaltzy, but it is a nice simple seasonal romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. It was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Emma Thompson's cry in the bedroom, and it was 77 on The Ultimate Film. Worth watching!"

","This is one of those movies to cuddle with someone and watch with. There is that atmosphere of ordinary people leaving ordinary lives, yet being extraordinary in their take of things (and in their accent, of course). All those people that enjoyed Notting Hill will enjoy this one, maybe even more.<br/><br/>The cast is full with good actors, starting with Alan Rickman and ending with Liam Neeson. You have celebs like Claudia Schiffer showing unexpectedly. You have personal drama and bliss (sometimes put together). But what is delightful is the humour of it all. Perhaps the Brits will do a dozen films like this one and I'll get fed up with their joking style and I'll write different reviews, but for me it was funny. Really funny. And not in the ""Ha Ha"" sense that we see on the Hollywood conveyor belt.<br/><br/>I think that the attack on the British Premier was not that subtle, but then again, I doubt he gets anything else.

","Love Actually has been criticised for being meaningless fluff. If this is true then it is a very good kind of fluff!

It restores faith in love and happiness and provides a great deal of laughs...if this film does nothing else it will brighten up your day! The cast are superb. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman give beautiful performances, and I cannot review without mentioning the wonderful Kris Marshall (of My Family fame) who is without a doubt one of my favourite actors at present. All the stars (and there are plenty of them!) give brilliant, memorable performances.<br/><br/>My advice: Watch Love Actually, and let yourself be absorbed...do not attempt to pick apart each storyline for hidden meanings or messages.

","Apart from the sequence with Colin Frissell going to America in the hope of getting laid and Jamie Bennett writing his book in France, this film is set in Britain, starting five weeks before Christmas and leading up to it. Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister willing to stand up to the USA is a little bit unbelievable, but let's face it, he'd probably make a great PM in real life (especially if he can dance like that through No. 10). I found the storyline with Liam Neeson a bit depressing as he had just lost his wife, but every film needs strong emotional story lines like that one, and it effected me a lot because I have been through similar circumstances myself. Colin was fantastic, even though I'm sure Kris Marshall was similar to Nick in My Family and doesn't want to be typecast he still put on a great performance. Rowan Atkinson had a small part, but by god it was fantastic, especially with the ever talented Alan Rickman. Whoever cast Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher is a genius. There performances from the start where amazing and you could see that they really where manager and client, but underneath it there was a friendship as well. Alan Rickman was superb especially with his secretary coming onto him, but although all of these performances in themselves were amazing, their all couldn't of worked without just one of the story lines being involved in the film. This film is ""Great Actually""."
"turtle-island","Null","0","5","27 June 2005"," Awful.
","This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Almost none of the characters are likable, and the story lines are ridiculous. Not to mention offensive! This movie is offensive to every American female. One of the biggest losers in Britain can't get a girl in England, so he tries his chances in America. At the first bar he goes to, girls flock all over him simply because he has an accent! And he manages to bag four (or was it five??) girls that very night! Wow. American girls are so slutty and dumb that they'll sleep with jerks and losers simply because they have an accent? I don't think so. Just because it's a comedy doesn't make it any less offensive. I was already hating the movie up to that point, and that scene just made me sick. There goes three hours of my life I'll never get back. I would comment on how ridiculous the other story lines are, but I don't want to waste any more of my life on this shameful movie."
"lawnboy1977","7","0","2","23 May 2005"," Did I miss something?
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into watching this film, I just rented it to see what it was all about. I did expect a total love story with a bunch of different characters, which is what the movie pretty much is. I expected more of a connection between all the different stories that for me didn't quite play out the way I expected. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of British comedies, a lot of the humor just doesn't make sense to me, which might have been my major problem with this film.<br/><br/>There were certain elements that really bothered me about this movie though. At the beginning, we see the characters being introduced. One scene has Colin Firth saying goodbye to his girlfriend, saying I love you about 27 times while doing so, while on his way to his French cottage to work on his novel for several weeks. For some reason he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper who he never says a word to because, alas they don't speak the same language! We never again here from the girlfriend the rest of the movie as he runs off at the end to marry the housekeeper, because he has finally learned to speak Portuguese. That didn't make much sense to me, but I guess running away from someone you say that you love is funny to some people, not to me. I guess the point of that story was that true love exceeds culture and language.<br/><br/>Another story that bothered me was the one involving the best friend of a newlywed groom who is secretly in Love with the bride. The bride, Keira Knightley, finds this out when she comes over to view the wedding video, shot by the best friend in a stalker-like fashion where every single frame is a close-up of the bride. She apparently find this to be cute, and doesn't run off in a terrified state of ""oh my god this guy is obsessed with me""!! They don't run off together but still remain friends, for some reason.<br/><br/>I think I need to watch this film again with someone who understands it because I felt like a lot of the humor was over my head. I guess since I'm not in love, and rather cynical about it, I didn't quite get a lot of this movie."

","Romantic comedy, eh? Totally hate them. Yet with one exception by now.<br/><br/>Love Actually manages the impossible by being both romantic and funny. Furthermore it turned out to be quite clever and unpredictable at times. Here's a picture - for once - the plot of which is NOT drawn up at board meetings and based on demographic surveys. It does have its weak moments - what film doesn't - but the pleasing variety of plot keeps the viewer interested throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Casting is brilliant all round; somewhat predictable at times, but not annoyingly so. And most familiar faces managed to squeeze an ounce of fresh performance from themselves. I've always liked Rickman's grumpy style, but here it got some new dimensions. The big stars actually managed to downplay their most prominent features, thus creating an even playground for all and a very balanced whole."
"Jexxon","4","0","1","7 May 2005"," I didn't hate Love Actually, but I didn't love it either...
","Obviously, Richard Curtis set out to make the ultimate love story film of all time. Love Actually contains no less than nine (I think) different stories intertwined a la Short Cuts. They try to cover virtually every aspect of love there is (however, not a gay one - I guess that wasn't PC enough for a Christmas time feel-good movie).<br/><br/>Equally obvious is that there are way too many stories. The pacing is erratic, some subplots getting a lot of screen time, while others seem to have been forgotten about. Just witness how Laura Linney just disappears towards the end of the film. The end result would have been much better if they had just cut away half of the plots and fleshed out the remaining ones. In my opinion they should have kept the ones with Rickman - Thompson, Firth - Portugese maid, Linney, and (possibly) Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>Too many of the others are simply completely pointless. For example, Marshall's trip to the US to sleep with American women doesn't go anywhere. The only thing it's there for is to show of some ""hot"" young actresses like Elisha Cuthbert, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards. Throughout the film, there's also an obsession with showing women in (or preferably out of) their underwear. There's no reason for it, and it just feels really tacky.<br/><br/>The filmmakers don't want to risk that the audience actually has to think for themselves - so at every key moment in the film there's usually a song or a piece of music that lets you know exactly how you're supposed to feel. I know that everybody does it, but here it's just too obvious and clumsy. This can also be said about the choice of setting the film around Christmas time, as if most of these stories weren't sappy enough...<br/><br/>In conclusion, Love Actually is a decent film that could have been much better. Cramming in material enough for three films doesn't make it three times as good as one. There are some really great moments, but they're all to often lost among not so great ones. With a cast as great as this one, it must be tempting to use them as much as possible, but as it is now, most of them are sadly wasted. This is definitely a film where less would have been more.

","Overall, I'm really glad i purchased this DVD...The stories were wonderfully written and easy to follow...a superior 'chick flick', if ever their was one. Worth it for the few brief glimpses of Rodrigo Santoro, and for the stories involving the always welcome Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>What I'm about to say has less to do with my being an American, and more to the fact that I'm a woman who was of the understanding that I was watching a romantic drama/comedy. Was it really necessary to have yet another 'I just want to thumb my nose in the face of the US' segment? Thanks so much Richard Curtis for your brief and all too transparent 'I've-got-the-power-to-show-how-big-a-bully-that-rotten- stinking-America-is' moment...it really served no purpose in the movie at all...except, perhaps, to make you feel better. It wasn't the attempt at expressing politics that I found annoying...just how childishly it was thrown out there; that, and the fact that you used Billy Bob Thornton to represent the Chief Executive...could you have picked a smarmier persona? The whole bit seemed mean and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Oh, but wait: then there were the stereotypes of the American women being bubble headed nymphets that live this side of porno land, and the whole story surrounding the weight of the adorable Natalie, who didn't look fat at all. Now, unless there was some sort of subtlety I missed in that storyline, I thought it was tiresome to hear everyone talk about how heavy she was...none of that made any sense to me as she looked fine...sure she was shapely, but fat? Whaaaaaa? Those were pesky smudges on an otherwise perfect little movie.<br/><br/>I know that sounds like a great deal of negative about the film, but in all honesty it was a fine piece of entertainment...thankfully, I now have the ability to fast forward through the parts that most irritate me, which truthfully, aren't many."

Honestly, the emotional side of me enjoyed this aspect of the movie as well. But it was the final scene of the movie that left me reeling (and this is in no way a spoiler).<br/><br/>I'm watching the conclusion in Heathrow, with people coming together from all over the world. But it's the music that takes over my consciousness. The Beach Boys' ""Sloop John B"" and the purposely repetitious and sadly remorseful chorus ""I want to go home, I want to go home..."" And the irony hit me: an American surfer band communicating more emotion in 15 seconds than the entire gray, cold British movie could convey in 2 hours up to this point.<br/><br/>Maybe the point was that underneath the cold, gray British posturing there was a heart.

","Never having been a huge Hugh Grant fan, I had always passed this one up walking the aisles of Blockbuster. However it was during the pre-Christmas run on HBO, during which it seemed like it was on at least 5 times a day, that I committed to sit down and watch it at LEAST once. WOW is all I could find myself thinking as the credits began to roll - after going through the roller-coaster of emotions that it brings you through. Not only did I watch it that once, but then once again an hour later on one of the other HBO channels!!! I can honestly say I have NO idea how many times I have watched it since then, but I would definitely say it is well into double digits!! As previously mentioned here in another note, this is definitely a movie that withstands multiple viewings, mostly because it seems that with each one, I uncovered another sub-plot or twist that had slipped by me up until then. (I strongly recommend that you watch it at least twice to catch what you missed - more than a few times in the first run through I caught myself reversing a few frames on the DVD trying to figure out how the characters were tied together!) I really felt so many connections with the different characters & situations, and think that everyone has had these same situations occur at some point in their lives too. It is set during the weeks leading up to Christmas, but I think it is a great ""feel good"" choice any time of the year...

The question isn't who is in this movie, but rather who *isn't* in this movie? There is some great talent here, including Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley... the problem is, the cast list just goes on and on, leaving each of the actors with only a few short scenes in which to develop their characters. Quite simply, the movie just tries to do too much.<br/><br/>There are some memorable sub-plots (Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, Bill Nighy as a washed-up popstar itching for a comeback, Liam Neeson as a recently widowed father, etc. But there are others that just seem thrown in for no particular reason. Yes, the stories are all interconnected, as it turns out, but you never spend enough time with most of the characters to really ever care about them or to bother trying to sort out how the connections work.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the movie involves the amazingly talented-for-her-age Olivia Olsen belting out a Mariah Carey song so well that she made me overlook the fact that it was a Mariah Carey song. It's hard to believe that she was only ten years old when she did the part.<br/><br/>Saccharine, sugary-sweet and light, this is a perfect date movie. Just don't expect to discover any deep revelations about life or even about love. All in all, this is a decent movie.

","This is one movie that actually delivers everything to every type of viewers no matter that one looking and is probably one of the most romantic movies ever created.<br/><br/>The story of the couples lives four weeks before Christmas and how things could change by then.<br/><br/>The story did deliver all types of emotion to its viewer including laugh, smile, tears, and so on. The dialogue is brilliantly good English and very charming. The casting is undoubtedly one of the best with brilliant acting. And the editing, lighting and directing is a joy.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Buy The DVD and Watch It Again and Again.<br/><br/>Note: Rowan Atkinson is a cameo as an angel in case you only see this movie because of him.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A+)"

","I love this movie. I wanted to see it from the first time I saw the trailers for it, and could barely wait for it to get to cable.

Hugh Grant's dancing is to die for, just darling. Little Sam's love interest, Joanna, has a wonderful voice. I'd love to have the soundtrack from the movie.<br/><br/>Laura Linney's love interest, Karl, is drop-dead gorgeous.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend this one.

","Love, a word you can't take your mind off of. The characters in this movie explains love in all different ways. Young love, puppy love, lost love, or forgotten love. This movie is nothing but love. And I say in my opinion can be seen in any holiday, not just Christmas or Valentine's Day. But I do say, It's a good Valentine's Day movie. There's some heavy scenes there, and the cynical Brit who thinks his chum wouldn't find any American women who will love him did. He got lucky with the sister of his friend's girlfriend from Texas. The movie is a one of a kind hit in any way. You got Britain's own Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Rory MacGregory, Elton John and other in the cast, along with Ireland's Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>I liked the the one who fell for the Portuguese woman who happen to take that cold swim to retrieve the story that blew in the lake. And he had to make a big deal like it was unimportant to him. The title of the movie should have been ""Love is Strange"", then again, that title would come as no surprise to anyone. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Had hesitation renting this flick but my wife mentioned she wanted to see it so many times that I decided to ""suffer"" through it for her sake. And I'm glad I did. It turns out to be a genuinely charming and well made film dealing with the various aspects of LOVE, from the comedic to the sweet to the woeful. You find yourself wanting each character to achieve their desires though you know in your heart that some dreams won't come true. The movie is rather long but I became so engrossed in the situations of the various characters that I didn't realize how long it was until I looked at the clock after it ended. Also, the commentary track with The director, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and the main child star is by far one of the best commentaries I've ever heard.

","A very predictable romantic comedy, in the ""white anglosaxon protestant male"" kind of way. Bill Nighy's blatantly clichéd rocker and Rowan Atkinson's divine touch save a lot. Curtis was obviously playing it safe by his choice of cast, although Hugh Grant as the PM is as believable as - well, as believable as many other things seen during the film.<br/><br/>*** Start of Spoilers *** While most of the story lines are rather cringeworthy, while there are chubby jokes calorie, and while the main cast is predominantly white and male, there is a certain entertaining aspect to the flick. Perhaps this is due to the (preciously few) darker, more bitter and less sweet story lines - although these too become diluted in the end, in a true Christmas fashion. It is a shame that Rowan Atkinson's angelic role was not exploited to greater extent; his final line is probably the best one in the film, in its dry, understated glory. *** End of spoilers *** <br/><br/>I guess the film could be viewed as a satirical take on the traditional romcom formula, so overdone are the gender typecasting and certain story lines. That's my rationale for giving it an eight out of ten."
"ale82pineapple","9","0","2","11 January 2005"," Lovely and easy to watch, full of hope
","Richard Curtis was already an expert as far as romantic comedies are concerned (he was the writer of Marshall's ""Notting Hill"", for instance), but in this movie he manages to innovate the genre. First of all, there's no protagonist, and the story, rather than being centered around a character, is centered around a place, London, and a time of the year, Christmas. The viewer begins to love all the people that come on screen, and all the actors (among them Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson) are good; the music is absolutely perfect for setting the mood, shifting continuously from diegetic to non-diegetic and underlying the most important moments in each character's story. Some of the stories are realistic, others are definitely fantastic, but the film manages to be really uplifting, and even if sometimes too cheeky, it succeeds in entertaining the viewer. People want to believe that ""Love Actually is all Around"", even if sometimes it's not visible; dreamers are all around! Do we believe in things because they're true, or do things become true as we believe in them? Especially as far as human relationships, projections of our desires and fears build them day by day, more than actual events: falling in love is a pure and extreme act of faith. I like this movie, it makes me smile every time I watch it, and that's a lot; it conveys hope, even when showing betrayal and gloomy situations, and love needs hope. It doesn't tell everything about love, but what movie or what work of art, generally speaking, can be complete and satysfying about something so mysterious, so different in shapes and developments? A lovely movie, definitely."
"mitchells","9","0","2","7 January 2005"," I Love It, Actually
","Love Actually is the kind of a movie that tells multiple stories with a common thread, in this case love (shocker, I know). The different stories give different perspectives on such a touchy subject in Hollywood. The love stories depicted in the movie are quite real and not just a romanticized view of a love that nobody could have as in ""The Notebook."" I commend Richard Curtis for making such a down to earth movie regarding the values of love, because let's face it, these days we have been exposed to a Hollywood romance that could never happen in real life.<br/><br/>While it may run on the long side of things, I found the stories engulfing enough not to notice. The cast is all-star and some of Britain's best (including fellow American Laura Linney). It is a feel good movie, and it is the ultimate romantic comedy. It has the humor, it has the romance (including the gritty parts of love that people forget about), and it also has a nice holiday touch to it. It is the kind of movie you can watch any time of the year for a pick me up, and the kind of movie you can watch every Christmas because it has that magic quality to it. My review: 90 out of 100"

Ever since I watched Robert Altmans Short Cuts I have had a thing going for all the small stories weaving into one. Like that Love Actually can compete with Magnolia and several other.<br/><br/>Why? Probably because it gives space for thinking. The stories are spinning, and the viewer isn't forced to just be a mindless spectator, but may weave into the story, he may do something that is more worth while than just pouring out his money. Now of course the actors do great jobs do.<br/><br/>Especially Alan Rickman... who gets to show that he really is a great character actor.

"Movienut88","10","0","2","24 December 2004"," A truly wonderful film
","From the trailers, this looked as if it would be cute, but not astounding. It seemed romantic but not original. But ultimately it seemed like a rehash of the past Working Title romantic comedies we have come to expect year after year. With this in mind, as well as the thought of the astounding cast, which includes at least 20 well-known actors in either leading roles or cameos, I went to see LOVE ACTUALLY, expecting to see a nice and easygoing romantic comedy. I was wrong about it. Instead of just being good, it was fantastic, and exceeded all of my expectations. This movie is so romantic, so clever, so funny, and so utterly sweet that it could truly be described as the perfect romantic comedy. And to boot, it has a storyline that is sure to make you feel good about the upcoming holiday season.<br/><br/>LOVE ACTUALLY tells a truly original tale of several love stories that occur on the streets of Britain during the five weeks leading up until Christmas. It would take too long to describe all, but there are several that receive more attention than others. For example, one involves the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and his adorable and sweet secretary Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Others include a married couple (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman) discovering marriage problems, a hidden love between a newlywed (Keira Knightley) and her groom's best friend (Andrew Lincoln), a blossoming love between two people (Colin Firth and Lucia Monz) who don't even speak the same language, an aged rock star (Bill Nighy) hoping for a comeback while realizing what is important in life, a father desperately trying to help his 10-year old son reveal himself to the love of his life and many more. The movie is so filled with love and heart that you will almost be overwhelmed. It truly is a film that shows you what love is all about.<br/><br/>The cast is astounding. Hugh Grant once again proves he is a talented rom-com lead, and he really is likable here. Martine McCutcheon is adorable in her first major film role, playing a very sweet character the audience immediately recognizes. Colin Firth and Lucia Monz both steal the show, providing great chemistry and sweet, adorable and touching scenes. Their love story was one of my favorite parts of the film and I felt like cheering at the end when they finally got together. Emma Thompson is ASTOUNDING here as the wife who discovers her husband's planned infidelities. I'm shocked she didn't receive an Oscar nomination for her work here. In one truly heartbreaking scene, she makes the audience cry with her as she makes the discovery. Alan Rickman isn't very likable, but he gives a decent performance. Liam Neeson is very good as the troubled stepfather who wants his stepson (Thomas Sangster) to tell the love of his life how he feels. The scene where the son finally does tell the girl is one of the film's most memorable sequences. Keira Knightley is great here, showing emotional range and adding depth to her character. Laura Linney gives a cute performance as a woman pining for her co-worker. All the other actors do a great job, especially Bill Nighy, who steals the show with a lot of hilarious scenes throughout the film.<br/><br/>Director Richard Curtis has crafted a true work of art, from the astounding cast to the wonderful and beautifully written screenplay. He has truly proved himself to me as one of the most talented men working in film today. He brings a distinct and bright vision to the film, and this really adds to the heart and soul of it. Another thing that works here is the music. The musical score in this film is fantastic. It didn't stick out to me during the first viewing, but really got to me after that. It's sweeping and romantic, and really conveys the emotion being played out on screen. I'm shocked and dismayed that composer Craig Armstrong didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his work here.<br/><br/>LOVE ACTUALLY is a fantastic romance, but in addition it is also one of the most joyous and heartwarming Christmas films I have ever seen, possibly the best one. No film has ever made me anticipate and realize the importance of a holiday more than this one.<br/><br/>In closing, LOVE ACTUALLY is truly perfect. A perfect romantic comedy, a perfect Christmas film and a perfect cast of characters. It's a wonderful holiday experience that is one of my all-time favorites, and I look forward to watching it numerous times throughout my life, especially on Christmas 10/10 (A+)"

From Hugh Grant's chubby woman loving Prime Minister character to Alan Rickman's (almost) cheating husband. The only thing that the movie could do without is the porn body stand in love story. (To make room for more Alan Rickman.) Possibly the best story though is about the little boy who's recently lost his mom and with the help of his step-father sets out to win the heart of a little American girl in his school who has the same first name as his mother. <br/><br/>Love Actually is sweet, well written, and wonderfully acted.

You have moments of Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Fuenral, 9 Months, etc. all seens in Love Actually, Even some actors from Bridget Jones' Diary make an appearance in this movie. An amazing cast, Love Actually doesn't get the credit it deserves as being a big motion picture. The actors in the film alone make the movie good. A typical Romantic drama / comedy withe several stories in one, the movie jumps back and forth to one romantic / drama to another. Although it works to its advantage, it also works against it. Many in the audience wished there was more story to Liam's character as well as Hugh's. The story of a single Prime Minister alone makes for a good romantic comedy. Still, Hugh is a strong supporting actor instead of the main attraction."

","When we first watched this movie at the theater, it seemed to take off way too slow. By the end of the movie, we were just waiting for the ending so we could go. However, it did leave a good feeling, as most of the love stories going on inside the movie ended ""happily ever after"". When I watched it again on DVD, it was much better. It seems that if you know where each story is headed, it makes the simultaneous telling of all these stories manageable. Its another example of a movie that is better when you turn on HBO and watch 20 minutes of the ""good parts"", then when you decide to sit and watch it for over 2 hours. It definitely reminded me of ""Pulp Fiction"" with all the jumping around, except that this movie was shown ""in order""."

She gave a very quiet heart wrenching performance, It wasn't over the top. When she went into her bedroom and looked at the photo's of her family, it showed us the history of this couple, and how it seems that the husband lost himself in his work, while she lost herself in her children.<br/><br/>This is like the old cliché, it will make you laugh and make you cry. Sam played by Thomas Sangster was one of the sweetest characters. I also like the scenes in the airport.

","This movie was great. It would have been a good one to see at the theater. The film follows several characters and what happens to them in the weeks before Christmas. It follows their love lives and some of the characters have interactions with each other at the end at a school Christmas play. There are some humorous and touching scenes. I particularly liked the washed up singer, Billy Mack, as he promoted his Christmas song all throughout the film. How could you not laugh when you see the music video and what he does when the song reaches number one. And my next favorite character was Hugh Grant as the prime minister who has the hots for one of his assistants. Then there are some more serious relationships between a husband and wife and two co-workers, who try to hook up but the girls crazy brother keeps interrupting them. Then the very sweet relationship involving Colin Firth as he falls for his non-English speaking helper. The other really funny guy was Colin Frissell who goes to Wisconsin to find some hot American girls. It's like Wisconsin, but he goes to a bar there and finds some LA looking women. Very funny.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I highly recommend it. It has a lot of great stories and is funny. And all the stories make sense in the end."

The British Prime Minister, on the other hand, was the same character Grant has played all his other movies, inappropriately plunked onto Downing Street. And his feelings for his aide Natalie seem to come out of absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>Love Actually was remarkably similar to Magnolia, one of my all-time favorites.

","The creators of ""Notting Hill"", ""About A Boy"", & ""Four Weddings & a Funeral"" sure know their formula. The first step is to hire Hugh Grant and the rest pretty much takes care of it self. This time around we have eight different stories taking place, some of them are intertwined, and all about conquering love and relationships. Hugh Grant plays the newly elected Prime Minister, who falls in love with the girl brings his biscuits. Emma thompson and Alan Rickman are a married couple struggling to keep the tingle. Colin Firth is a writer who falls for an Italian servant. What is it about servants? Laura Linney wants to have a relationship with her co-worker but her family struggles get in the way. The cutest story is about an 11 year-old boy who falls in love with a classmate and with the help of his widowed dad, he does whatever he can to impress her. There are three other stories going on, but the funniest has to be Bill Nighy as an aging has been rock star trying to make a comeback by remaking one of his hit songs. He is hilarious as he curses his way to the top of the charts.<br/><br/>The casting is great, the soundtrack is terrific, and despite some corniness, this film is extremely well written. The film takes place leading up to Christmas, but I wouldn't classify this as a Christmas movie. It's a romantic comedy that is set around Christmas that'll put you in a good mood any time of the year. (****)"

","Whomever called this movie a cute date movie is pretty much right on the money. The acting is stellar, but how can it not be? The story lines, yes plural, in fact, very much so, are underdevelopped for the most part, and just hard to follow. This didn't stop Love Actually from being a pretty cute movie, and this coming from a die hard horror fan. It seemed cliché though, almost contrived to have all these different, interconnected love stories end up so well. Oddly enough, the only part that really struck a chord with me for no apparent reason was the storyline with Jamie the writer striking up a romance with Aurelia the cleaning lady. When they learned English/Portuguese for each other, it was really...well, cute, but just a tad cringeworthy. The weird gratuitous sex scenes weren't really offensive per se, just slightly unnecessary. The film would have definitely worked without that story line, from which I can't even remember the characters' names. The ten year old with girl problems going to his grieving stepfather for advice was *very* cliché, to the point of groaning whenever they came on screen, since I'm such a nice critic. Hugh Grant was good as the newly elected Prime Minister. Well, Hugh Grant is always good, but he was really good in this one, and the small part he had alongside Thornton was well done indeed. His romance with Nathalie, and especially that kiss at the end was perfect. All in all, there were some story lines and some actors that this film would have done fine without: The sex scene stand ins and I guess the burnt out pop singer/manager thing we could have done without. Alan Rickman was great though, and whoever played Billy Mack was very Keith Richards-ish. This has been another useless review of another weird romantic comedy. Cheers."

The writer/director is fantastic, if you watch the trailers with the deleted scenes and about the music you will find that this man (Curtis) will show you his heart and insite to life, he is one that does not just hear music, but rather he really hears the whole effect of music, especially the message of the music, he feels it in his soul and to me that makes him a very rich well versed member of the human race, all in all this was a very heart warming movie one that will be on my list of favorites that you watch a million times and love it more each time. And a last comment, where did they find such beautiful actors/actress's? A rich performance by all!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","To begin with, I have to confess that I found the movie a little bit strange the very first time I watched it. Too many characters, too many stories, too many relationships to follow... and then, I watched the movie for second time and I can appreciate the details, enjoy the songs, the performances, the interesting mixture of happiness, sadness and comedy... I like some stories more than others... maybe the goal is too ambitious, the theme too extensive and difficult to determine. However, the result, the film, is quite nice and the rhythm appropriate.<br/><br/>It's not the best movie that I have seen, but, you know, it is extremely difficult to not be moving by this beautiful picture, a faithful reflection of the society in which we live in.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","British productions usually do not seem to stand out, except for those Harry Potter movies, which were all based on books, but this movie was an original idea, as it was written and directed by Richard Curtis, and was funny, sweet, and just made you feel good.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is that no such 'main star'- instead many fragments of equally important characters, have been stitched together, all bearing the same foundation of the alleged four letter word. However, this movie has THE best cast ensemble of 2003, and the fact that each and everyone just would capture people's hearts, makes this movie a deserving blockbuster. However, some of the best performances in this movie include Hugh Grant who was magnificent as the prime minister of UK, next comes Emma Thompson, whose emotionally filled character Karen, was so well portrayed, that she deserved something more than just a BAFTA nomination. The next comes Laura Linney- whose character Sarah, would appeal to any lustful working girl, and last but not least Martine MacCutcheon, whose shy/ beautiful character of Natalie, was just picture perfect. The cameos in this movie, would also make any person amazed. Elisha Cuthbert ,Dennis Richards and Claudia Schiffer's cameos were the most surprising.<br/><br/>*contains spoilers*Though certain segments were cliché ,( would a person seriously go through the torture of becoming thorough with another language- Portuguese for that matter, to impress a girl?, or would any record label even bother to promote such an obnoxious record like 'Christmas is all around' ?- may be in UK!!)- it just all seemed to just seem appropriate- all thanks to director Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a brilliant movie- and it Britain's best after a long time( Ignoring the Harry Potter's movies). It would be a great recommendation for anyone to watch over movie night, or take their partners to watch it with at the cinema."

","I think the film does a wonderful job of combining all the stories and relationships. I made a relationship web after I saw it, and the overlap was frightening in its complexity. It is in part because of this that it felt so real to me, despite the obvious hokeyness of everything turning out happily on Christmas Eve. The hokeyness itself is endearing, although it is also realistic that not everyone ends up completely happy: Laura Linney's character, for example. This reminds me of Amelie: Happy, but not sickeningly so. Those that do achieve it in a very humorous way (Colin landing the four hot American girls). And Billy Bob as president... my sides almost split. Other people seem to have different reactions, to some extent, than I did. I've introduced it to three other people, with a result of ""it was good"". They didn't seem to warm to it the way I did. As I am usually, I admit modestly, quite discriminating in my movie tastes, and refuse to see the crap that my friends are subjected to, it seems that this film is more about personal reactions than merely about quality. I love the warm feeling of a feel-good movie, combined with the faint stomachache of prolonged laughter. This is also a very important message for today: however disgusting things may seem, love is always there underneath. We just need to hope it surfaces in the end."

Most of the actors I knew, but never expected them in a role quite like theirs in Love Actually. (Alan Rickman, Keira Knightly, and Rowan Atkinson). Seriously, even my dad liked it! Some characters were stupid while others were touching, but I think it carries a nice message. It is rather unlike any movie I have ever seen before. The funniest part by far is the scene where Alan Rickman is buying the necklace and the whole thing with Rowan Atkinson wrapping up the gift. Hilarious!

","I have seen so few movies that capture the many facets of love.  This is ONE of those films.  It is a poignant montage of the many loves we encounter in life and it is delivered in a very funny and heartwarming way by the finest ensemble of UK actors lead by Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Kiera Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and the very funny Bill Nighy who really knocked my pants off with his rendition of love is all around retitled :Christmas is all around'.  With a soaring soundtrack by Craig Armstrong there is really nothing you can hate in this movie.  It is a very modern view of love and relationships in the 21st century.  In this day and age when most romantic comedies are simply shallow,  Love actually delves deeper (but not to the point of being boring) into the more wonderful circumstances that surround the feeling of being in love in all its many forms be it puppy love, forbidden love, blind love, familial love, etc. its all here.  Indeed, when I finished watching it I really felt that love actually is all around <br/><br/>

","*****THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS!*****<br/><br/>This is a beautiful little piece about the loves and lives of about 15 interwoven characters in the lead up to Christmas. It explores love, lust, greed, jealously, betrayal and why humans get knocked down but they'll get up again all for the sake of love.<br/><br/>The opening scene says all really (NO SPOILERS! :-) ) it shows shots of people coming from the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport, running from the barriers into the loving arms of the partners, friends and family. Hugh Grant (who I dislike but his performance is great!) says over the pictures <br/><br/>""General opinion is starting to make out that we live in a word of hatred and greed. But I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified of newsworthy. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the twin towers as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge.<br/><br/>They were all messages of love. If you look for it I've got a sneaky feeling that you'll actually find that Love Actually Is All Around""<br/><br/>I cannot fault the casting or any of the performances in this movie but the outstanding members of cast are surely Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Andrew Lincoln (who made me bawl!) Hugh Grant, Billy Bob Thornton and the young Thomas Sangster whose performance was surprisingly good for someone so young.<br/><br/>Why should you see this movie? Because there's no cynicism, just a beautiful piece about putting your heart on the line for love and the lengths people will go to to get it. The humour and wit is very English (which, personally, I love) and it will make you laugh and cry  and with so many stories it's constantly fast paced and doesn't drag. Also there's some lovely scenery of London with all the Christmas lights!<br/><br/>I think the main thing is not to go in feeling cynical, be prepared to get mushy and just enjoy it for the entertainment it is about love in the 21st century."
"Draykov","7","0","2","16 August 2004"," ""Feel good"" film that is funny, optimistic and grounded in reality.
","Many of us have probably been fans of the writing of Richard Curtis for some time, though we might not have realized it. Blackadder, Bean, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jone's Diary...his resume is extensive.<br/><br/>In Love Actually, Curtis takes the next step, as this film is his directorial debut and I'm pleased to say it doesn't show. <br/><br/>I hate to use the ""feel good movie"" cliché, but this is one film where the description applies in a way that seems more sincere than the typical ""spend some money at the theater this Christmas"" pitch. <br/><br/>Love Actually is a beautiful story with many interesting and lovable characters. It's full of humor, emotion and damn fine acting. The film boasts a star-studded cast that really is put to good use. All of the characters on screen have unique, human traits that make you truly interested in what happens to them. No one actor gobbles up the scenery, though this may merely be because each character has their own unique story to tell. <br/><br/>The music in the film is top notch (both original score and tracks from well known artists), and really lends itself to the mood of the film.<br/><br/>I'm a bit of an idealist at heart, but old enough to maintain some cynicism about things (especially the money grubbing bore-fest that modern movie making has become to a large extent), and I found this film to be honest, refreshing and positive without seeming to be served up as pap to satisfy the masses. Watch this with the people you love."

","I had a feeling, 5 minutes into the movie, that I was in deep trouble. Okay -- so the couple being married just so happened to have about 30 friends, all musicians, and hiding in the chapel waiting for their exit. A few singers was okay, but by the time we hit the row of trumpets I could smell the funk. And it only grew stronger. I kept thinking I was wrong, that it wasn't as bad as I assumed, and that I just needed to give it a chance. Right.<br/><br/>Well, at the moment Hugh Grant cranked up the Pointer Sisters and shimmied around the room, the movie had completely jumped the shark. For the next hour I kept reminding myself I had paid money for this vile, putrid, nauseating rubbish, and that -- who knows -- it MIGHT get better. Oh, I so hoped that would be true. But the movie never got better, and only grew more unbelievable, ridiculous, adolescent, and just downright CORNY to root for.<br/><br/>It's such a shame, for there are quite a few talented actors in this, but the director never allows the audience to connect with any of them. It shoots from one pathetic, sad, phony moment to the next. Not at all recommended, even if you're bored beyond belief."

","What can I say? I'm a sucker for the rom coms, namely British rom coms. Give me a Hollywood one and I may not praise it as highly. I really, thoroughly enjoyed this film. It makes you feel good about yourself, especially if you're with someone although I fear it could have the opposite effect on those who aren't. So what if it's a bit cheesy? OK, it gets to very cheesy when the boy-next-door turned Prime Minister Hugh Grant dances round 10 Downing Street to ""Jump for my love"". And well, the Heathrow scene at the end is a bit too much. However, all the little stories intertwined was in my opinion genius. We weren't stuck on the same characters for approximately 2 hours, but instead there was lots of variation. And the love stories weren't you're average boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, love is destroyed by something major, boy follows girl to airport stories. The representation of all the different forms of love was excellent, from affairs to love between a brother and sister. The cast in this film is certainly worthy of note. I'm a fan of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman, and to a lesser extent young Hugh. it was brilliant to see them in a film together. This film even stopped my life long hatred of Martine McCutcheon (oh come on, who didn't hate her in Eastenders?). Liam Neeson was fabulous, Emma Thompson her ever brilliant self, Bill Nighy as the hilarious, but quite frankly a bit scary, Billy Mack and a very welcome reappearance of T.V's Rab C. Nesbitt (Gregor Fisher). I just thought it all worked and it is the perfect movie for a night in.<br/><br/>P.S. In homage I named one of my fish Billy Mack"

","First of all I hate movies categorized as chick flicks. I think this one may qualify as one but I have to say it has become one of my favorite movies!<br/><br/>I love that there are several different stories going on at once, but the difference between this movie and others like it is not one storyline suffers from having to share time on screen with the others.<br/><br/>All of these people know each other in some way, which adds to a sort of family feel to it. I thought it was great how they made it a movie where men are the focus of the film and not women and I found that very refreshing. I also think that each man portrayed his situation with a very real life quality. These things really happen, and they happen just like they are happening in the movie.<br/><br/>I loved the performances and I especially loves watching one of my über favorite actors in action, Alan Rickman.

"NoArrow","Null","0","2","9 August 2004"," The best holiday film in years
","It's curious that Richard Curtis' `Love Actually' is so good, because it doesn't present anything new to the audience.  Pretty much all of the eight or so different love stories have been seen many times before in hundreds, if not thousands of holiday movies.  I think the reason for its surprising greatness lies in the writing, the performances and the characters.  My point is, `Love Actually' proves that for a holiday romantic comedy, it's okay if the plot is filled to the brim with clichés, as long as the writing, performances and characters are well done.<br/><br/>I'll list all of the plot lines I can think of, though I may miss a few (there are many).  First we have the Prime Minister of Britain (where the film is set, by the way), played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love with his secretary (Martine McCutcheon).  The prime minister's sister Karen's (Emma Thompson) husband Harry (Alan Rickman), who is drawn to his seductive assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch).  Their friend Sarah (Laura Linney), shyly in love with her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro).  Recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his step-son (Thomas Sangster) confront his school love.  A writer (Colin Firth) who found his     friend cheating on him and moved to Brazil to fall in love with his maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz).  Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who is in love with his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley).  John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) meet while they work as stand-ins for an       film, and love flourishes.  There's also Colin (Kris Marshall), who believes that if he goes to America he'll find  a lot quicker and easier than he would in Britain.  I think I've tackled them all.<br/><br/>If any of these stories had a movie of their own they would probably be boring and almost impossible to sit through because of how over used the clichés are.  For some reason putting them all in the same film helps, most likely because director Curtis knows that he's working with clichés and revels in them.  Of course, few of the characters are very well developed, but they're very fun characters so it's hard to notice.<br/><br/>This does present a few flaws though.  Like, say, Linney's character isn't very dimensional so it's hard to completely accept her story's sort of sad-end.  We don't know why she doesn't do what she should do, but if we got to know her better then, maybe, we would.  I think that some of the stories, like that of Linney's, Firth's and the out-of-place satirical story of the Colin character going to America could very well have been left out.<br/><br/>But the other stories are great.  Hugh Grant is very charming and witty in his role, reminding all of us of that other Grant from a long time ago, Cary.  Liam Neeson's story is sweet, he presents a sort of easy-going, fatherly love to his step-son.  Alan Rickman is terrific as the lawyer who acts cynical and tired to hide his obvious affection for his assistant, and Emma Thompson is also great as his wife, slowly catching on to his affair and trying to deal with it with dignity and sense.  The smaller parts, like Knightley's and Sangster's, are well played too.<br/><br/>It is mandatory for an ensemble piece like this to have a scene-stealer, and here that part goes to Bill Nighy as the shaky, randy, cynical former rock artist whose trying to make his new Christmas song number one for Christmas. His story is kind of in the background to the others' foreground, but it is the best part of the film.  Nighy is hilarious, with perfect timing and mannerisms, effortlessly keeping our attention in every scene.  He is perfectly written and perfectly played.  The performance is worthy of an Oscar, the same Oscar that went to the undeserving Tim Robbins (boo!).<br/><br/>`Love Actually' is the best holiday film to come out in years, so I think it should've been enjoyed by families.  The        and some of the swearing could've been easily removed, and the film would be a perfect family gem. But I guess we have everything, it's still great how it is.<br/><br/>Sure, it's fluff, but it's admirable fluff, 8/10."

","I bought this film for our collection not noticing that is was R rated, now I will add it to my collection and buy something less revealing for our library.  Admittedly there is nudity, language and questionable behavior but it is so funny and outrageous that by the end I decided I had to keep the film-wish I'd bought the DVD now. The story involves several couples and at times it is hard to keep them straight.  I knew of three of the actors; Hugh Grant Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman so I had to get familiar with the other faces.  I wanted the film because it was a Christmas time comedy. I nearly fell off the couch when the one guy flies to Milwaukee to meet girls.  Brit accents are popular in this country and I can easily see this happening to some extent.  We tend to be pretty relaxed and open to strangers, of course the film goes a little far. I liked the part Alan Rickman played, I have only seen him in the Potter films.  I find him very interesting but he doesn't get as wild as the other couples so I guess I'll have to see some more films he has been in to get more of a feeling for his acting.  I love the way he plays Prof. Snape and he really touched a note in this film too.  I have liked Liam Neeson for a long time and  Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister was funny if a little far fetched.  I suppose the U.S. President they allude to is Clinton since he is on the make so that was a little uncomfortable.  If you are looking for a good laugh and don't get upset by the R rating this is a great one."

Movies like Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Underworld, and Jeepers Creepers 2 and some others that I can't think of off the top of my head have all been movies that I expected to be good, but they all turned out to be pieces of crap. Now, there's finally a good surprise. I came into this movie thinking it was just going to be another chick flick that I would deeply regret seeing, but it wasn't, it was surprisingly good! Usually though, I know exactly why I like or hate a film, but I can't seem to describe what I like about it. There's way too much going on with all the characters for me to give a damn about any character, but I did. I really understood them. There's one couple in Love Actually where we're not even sure if they're going to be together at all. So why was it good? I guess it was good because it made you feel good about yourself (as cheesy as it sounds). Who cares about any of the damn characters?! The movie as a whole puts a smile on your face. If you hate romance no matter what form it's in or how it's told, the movie does offer some funny moments. One of the funniest characters is an old rockstar who would probably be the last person you want to sing any Christmas song at all and there's a little kid in there that definitely takes some of the grown-up feel out of the movie (to me, that's a good thing). So overall it was a great feel good movie!<br/><br/>Love Actually- 8/10<br/><br/>Note: I wrote this review while it was still in theaters."

","Love, so the song tells us, is a many splendored thing.  It would seem that Richard Curtis' goal for ""Love, Actually"" is to embrace all the splendors of mankind's most basic and universal emotion.  The subject is one that can't really be covered in a single film (even at two and a quarter hours, Curtis only skims the surface), but you can't blame him for trying, especially when so much of what he does put up on screen is touching and entertaining.<br/><br/>The film, which takes place in the weeks before Christmas, isn't a liner story so much as it is a series of vignettes.  The characters are all loosely connected to each other, but what really matters is how they connect to their respective partner(s).  Among the various ages and stages of relationships: a bachelor PM (Hugh Grant)who's smitten with a staffer, a married couple (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) shaken by the specter of infidelity, a heartbroken author (Colin Firth) who flees to the Continent, and a widower (Liam Neeson) who copes with his stepson's first love while coming to terms with his own loss.  There's not enough space to detail all the talent found here, but two performances particularly impressed me: Thompson's Karen, who carefully masks the agony she feels at her husband's straying eye, and Bill Nighy as aging rock legend Billy Mac.  A broken cynic in a crowd of romantics, he provides a sort of connecting thread throughout the film.<br/><br/>With so many characters and ideas in play, ""Love Actually"" can't help but feel as crowded as a mall on Christmas Eve.  Among those almost lost in the crush are Kiera Knighley as a newlywed bride, and a couple who meet while working as body doubles for a series of sex scenes (the shots of the two characters engaging in casual conversation while striped naked and in compromising positions are some of the film's funniest moments, but the characters never fully emerge).  But it's hard to ignore the charm of a film that's sentimental without being sappy, realistic without being brutal.  And if even Nighy's world-weary loner isn't completely immune to love's charm, who am I to deny it?"

","This film came highly recommended to me by several people, and I was highly skeptical that it could live up to its promising title and promotional trailers. However upon seeing it for the first time I was simply stunned. The cathartic feeling i experienced at the end of the film was so great and difficult to describe that it has placed the film into a very select inner circle of films that ever impressed me so much. Upon viewing it for the second time new details and connections made sense, and this made me feel like I'm watching a whole new movie, not a review of the same. But mostly I am surprised that in an era of commercial flicks and overrated box office hits there exist such movies that really deserve the time you dedicate when you watch them, and give more to you than the ticket money you give to the producers. Its a daring film about the most universal theme of them all, love, and it hits its mark bullseye!"

","I saw this film this week and was left thinking how excellent it was. There were classical romantic clichés which, in my opinion, enriched the storyline, and left this 25 year old guy almost crying.<br/><br/>There were a few points that could have improved the film, here they are:<br/><br/>* The American Girl: It was sad that she couldn't find love because of her unwell brother. It would have been a little better if the brother was just irritatingly annoying, and towards the end she decided to stop taking his calls and live her own life.<br/><br/>* Alan Rickman: His character, the publisher who had an affair, could have better seen the error of his ways, and when he returned from New York (we're never told why he went) took out a box, from say tiffany's and told Emma Thompson ""I was stupid, you're the only one for me"" and given her a necklace that was bigger and better than the heart one.<br/><br/>* The naked couple: Why are they in the film, they're crap, one doesn't get a feeling for their love, OK so we know that even porn stars can be shy, but is that what the film is about?<br/><br/>* The married couple / Jaded best friend: would it have been better if he decided to be happy for his best friend and the beautiful bride, and love her unconditionally, without the possibility that sometime in the future they would get together.<br/><br/>* The Prime minister / assistant: probably the best part of the story, why couldn't the whole film have been just about those two?<br/><br/>If you look at the director's commentary, you will see that he wanted to show how love can grow anywhere, between any individuals. But, why not allow it to last once it develops.

","**Warning: Minor Spoilers**<br/><br/>Love Actually is a sweet picture with a positive view of the world. This film is not for most people who are cynical and believe that the best movies show that human beings are trash and without goodness, but even though I like darker pictures I still enjoyed this feel good movie however.<br/><br/>It starts out with a narration by Hugh Grant about how there is much love in the world despite tragedy's like 9/11, and other bad things in life that cause human suffering. Love Actually does not ignore life's problems as the Emma Thompson character discovers on Christmas eve that her husband, played by Alan Rickman, has been having an affair while the family happily open their gifts. It takes the idea that despite hardships and suffering, love still conquers all as each of the characters predictably find not only love in the end, but happiness.<br/><br/>Though I hold a more cynical view of the world and prefer pictures like Bad Santa about selfish and greedy people and don't see Love Actually as being realistic(how its characters find love and win other peoples hearts would be viewed as stalking in our own selfish and mean spirited world), I still found much to enjoy in Love Actually. I suppose in the post 9/11 era where so much tragedy is taking place in the war on terror, it is nice to see a movie in which love becomes easy to find and people are more kind then what they are in the real world. The director believes we do live in a predominantly loving society, and watching the picture allows us to comfortably sit in his dream if we are not bothered by its corny messages.<br/><br/>It is necessary to have pictures like Love Actually to make you feel good and happy, but I unfortunately still prefer movies like Bad Santa or Mystic River where survival depends on selfishness rather than love, that describe people in the real world more accurately than Love Actually which carries the old Hollywood message that love will always rule. ***1/2 (out of 4)"

","Love actually was a strange but unique film. The reason for why it was unique is because it was like 10 love stories that were all combined into one movie and each of them showed a different aspect of love. Everyone in this film had a fairly big part and the cast was spectacular. I give this film 9/10 because it was an excellent romantic comedy, but I don't think that there should be a sequel because it is only good if it is shown alone without any second parts or third parts along with it.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend anyone who likes a good romantic laugh to see this and it also shows you how love doesn't necessary have to be ""love"" in a romantic sense, but it can be love between family as well"

It makes me sad to think an adult would have a conversation with a small child, and use the F-word so casually. At one point, in their kidding around, he called the little boy a Bastard. Do real people talk to kids like that? Another silly story line was the porno stars--- it didn't add anything to the movie, and took up too much time. The movie was too long anyway. The cute girl that captured the heart of the Prime Minister, Hugh Grant, was too fat? Big thighs? Pul-eese--- when she turned sideways she almost disappeared. Thin, very thin. And her character used gutter language when she was first introduced to the P. M. ? Hard to believe. Also, the Nativity scene was totally unnecessary and uncomfortable to watch.

As for everything else I loved it, I could have done without the shy porn stars... (with a teenager in the house it was a little too much to watch in his presence) Hugh Grant was as usual perfect as the single PM..., and his longing for his tea girl was just precious, his speech at the press conference made me want to jump up and scream ""Rule Britannia"" (okay I am a brit, forgive me).  As for the other love stories I was heartbroken that the American girl (forget her name) had to choose her mentally ill brother over the love of her life, kept thinking that perhaps she should TELL HIM ABOUT IT perhaps?  I mean if he loved her he would understand right?  As for the English guy going to the US to get sex, I can confirm that he is probably right.  You have no idea what a British accent does to Americans, I get really good service in restaurants you know:)  Anyhoo see it, if only to watch Emma Thompson at her absolute best, I would watch her read the phone book, but in this movie she is superb.

The overall theme with the setting at the airport - which automatically throws a feeling of love and affection, was brilliant.<br/><br/>The acting in general was done very well; Colin Firth did a great job playing Jamie, who falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper. Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Laura Linney all did a wonderful job. My favorite scenes in the movie were with those with the boy character of Sam, played by Thomas Sangster, a great young actor with lots of enthusiasm and talent. Nonetheless, I think Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman could have done a little better. Also, Rowan Atkinson's character is inappropriate and doesn't really fit into the film.<br/><br/>The endings with Jamie/Aurelia, Sam/Joanna and Mark's huge cue cards to Juliet were all very delightful to watch. However, some things that could have been omitted is the movie stars (John and Judy) sex scenes; it was slightly overdone. In the end, however, it's sweet, but the sex scenes just clashed with the cute, loving feeling in the movie.<br/><br/>Generally, the movie was very sweet and delightful to watch.

I have studied this score in 8 viewings and cannot believe how clever the music works - on three levels: the melodies link the most disparate story lines; the winds/flutes forbade the worst.

I would love to see that happen. Liam Neeson plays a very nice role and Alan Rickman is always a pleasure to watch, so also in this movie. Bill Nighy provides the most comical elements of the movie and he does that in a very good and fun way. The movie is full with many cameo's of both British and American actors. Maybe a bit too much but that hardly is a complaint.<br/><br/>But what was with all that nudity and cursing?

","This movie is fantastic because it reminds us of all the great things in our life that we don't take notice in. This was  spoken by Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting when talking about the death of his wife and it is the perfect line to describe Love Actually because that's what it does.<br/><br/>The opening scene with everybody arriving at Heathrow Airport is a very moving and is something to think about when Hugh Grant mentions that all the messages left by the people on the 911 planes were messages of love and not hate which is what the world is lead to believe and is a great reminder. Richard Curtis has done some great films but Love Actually stands out to the rest because of its great message.  If you hate films about love then you will hate this because that's all the film is full of and I am not to keen on these kind of films but the British romantic comedies are always better than any American films ever could be and one main reason for that is Hugh Grant.  Along with Hugh though you have a bigger film cast than every Woody Allen film ever made.  Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson and of course Hugh Grant and the list does not stop there with lots and lots of cameo's.    Curtis doesn't just explore the up side of love but also the down side.  Emma Thompson is a woman who loves her family very much but her husband played by the Great Alan Rickman who is a culture vulture and loves his family isn't that fussed as he should be and also but also loves the idea of playing the field but has many do's and don't running through his mind.  You have Hugh Grant as the prime minister who is secretly in love with his Maid but finds it hard to communicate with her and mumbles like a stuttering idiot.  There are about in total seven different stories to follow in less than two and a half hours and what do we think about the film after that.  I don't know what you feel but this is an important romantic film instead of just being a romantic comedy.  All the characters are just as interesting as each other and have wonderful stories to tell and it makes you feel all good about yourself at the end but what it will make you do is appreciate the loved one next to you because you never know when the days you have with that special someone are up so grasp it by the balls or nipples and just watch this movie and remind yourself just in case you forget."

To me the highlights are Bill Nighy and his manager storyline, the Emma Thompson-Alan Rickman storyline, the Laura Linney-and her needy brother storyline, and the story line between Neeson and his step son.

","'Love Actually' is jam-packed with storylines, jokes, romances, kisses, heartbreak and various forms of love. Ninety percent of the film works brilliantly. Only a few scenes are awkwardly inserted but they are soon forgotten by the time the next good one rolls around. Rarely will you have ever seen a film crammed with so much stuff. Apparently the original cut was almost four hours long and, for obvious reasons, the director had to do some serious trimming. He managed to get it down to about two hours and ten minutes. The film could have been virtually perfect if it had been an hour and fifty minutes.<br/><br/>The premise surmises that love is all around us all the time... that to find it, one only has to open one's eyes, especially if you are at the arrival gate at Heathrow Airport. This film displays virtually every type of love: The burgeoning romance of a Prime Minister and a member of his housekeeping staff; The slightly fading love of a married couple in their fifties; The love of a stepfather and stepson for each other after the mother has passed away; The love a man feels for his best friend's new bride; The love of an author and his Portuguese maid with whom he cannot communicate; The love of a sister for her sick brother; and the love of various other crazy characters who long for and lust after those around them.<br/><br/>There were a few threads that weren't particularly interesting. The story about the aging rock star trying to get his Christmas record to number one on the charts and the story about the young British lad who dreams of heading to America to find beautiful women willing to sleep with him were both a tad belabored and repetitive despite producing the occasional laugh.<br/><br/>However, most of this film bounces us energetically from one silly scene to another, with a few stops along the way to introduce some weighty material. I like the way that 'Love Actually' balances all its material and rarely seems to inappropriately connect a frivolous scene with a profound one. The director does a marvelous job of stirring the ingredients without turning it all into mush.<br/><br/>This movie follows the tone set by so many recent British romantic comedies like 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jones' Diary' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. But instead of focusing on one particular romance, there are almost a dozen to choose from. 'Love Actually' is a perfect date movie that will be easy to watch over and over again with a loved one. It may be rated R for a little gratuitous nudity, but it can be watched by teenagers too. The MPAA proves yet again that they obscenely think that sex is grossly more heinous than blood-curdling violence. I would have no problem showing this film to a fifteen or sixteen year old.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this romance-fest despite a few clichéd scenes and few unnecessary threads. There are a ton of belly laughs to be had here and a couple of tear-inducing moments too. I found the 'Christmas Caroling Bob Dylan Cue-Card' scene to be quite touching, in part because I think Keira Knightley is perfect too! 'Love Actually' is a delightful mix that will be a romantic favorite for years to come."

","I found this film to be terrific in it's genre. I thought the dialogue was witty and the plotlines very clever in their interaction. All the characters were believeable and I found myself empathising with many. It helps I suppose that I liked all the actors chosen for their characters in this film. I thought Hugh Grant's little dance scene was a show stealer although his portrayal of the British PM was a little far fetched. I also thought veteran actors Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman did a fab job as always. Honestly I would watch just about anything with Colin Firth in it, but I found his character to be a little irritating. The jumping plotlines kept the story interesting and it was good to see younger characters being incorporated in difficult storylines. This film made me laugh out loud in many places and that is enough for a stamp of approval from me."

","LOVE ACTUALLY is one of the sweetest, most audience-friendly films I've viewed in quite a while.

You care about all of the characters, and they are so deserving of happiness that you can't help but root for them to succeed.<br/><br/>While all the stories are well-done, three are my favorites; Hugh Grant, as the new, charismatic Prime Minister, discovering the void in his life is being filled by the klutzy staffer he has to transfer (Martine McCutcheon); Colin Firth, learning Spanish so he can propose to the girl (Lúcia Moniz) who helped him recover from a cheating girlfriend; and Laura Linney, as a woman whose romantic aspirations are put on hold by a mentally ill brother (the only subplot without a happy ending...although the Alan Rickman/Emma Thompson subplot is iffy!)<br/><br/>With a memorable pop music soundtrack, some funny cameos (Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton shine), and a London that is shimmering and nearly too beautiful to be true, LOVE ACTUALLY will be a film that will DEFINITELY grace my DVD collection.<br/><br/>This IS the perfect 'date' movie!"

","The worst thing that can happen is when a talent, whether musical, political or literal starts to believe their own hype. Just such a thing appears to have happened to Richard Curtis, writer of Love Actually and lauded genius of cast-iron bankable brit comedy hits.<br/><br/>Whilst most of the lottery cash and hopes for a resurgent British film industry have gone round the u-bend with turds like 'Sex Lives of the potato men', and a rash of bad, cheap horror movies, Curtis stands in a different league, able to command huge budgets, bona fide movie stars and his own skill in writing sharp dialogue and memorable characters. In the past his films have also relied on the picturesque, and free, sound stage of London and the English countryside.<br/><br/>The main flaw with Love Actually is that it's overkill in all of these elements. Crammed with name actors, from Niam Leeson to Emma Thompson (an act of Parliament should also be passed to ban Hugh Grant from at least one of his moves, for all our sanity), charming, but slightly jaded London - the way Americans like to consume it - 8 different story strands of characters and continuous contrived situations allowing Curtis to indulge in his slapstick-cum-'Kids say the funniest things' type screenwriting.<br/><br/>To digress, one of the most tedious 'jokes' in British comedy screenwriting is the one where a middle class, RP-accented kid makes a reference to drugs, yardies or gansta rap as these were two unimaginably seperated words. Well, they're not.<br/><br/>By cramming all this in, the film does not feel like the light-calorie comic smorgasbord of 'Four Weddings' (The original - and still the best 'brit flick'), but one of those 'all you can eat' Scandinavian cruise liner buffets.<br/><br/>Two hours of being fed whimsy, coincidence, posh kids and Curtis' trademark pantomime style endings. In search of the whimsy Curtis has set absolutely no boundaries in letting the Prime Minister fall in love with his tea lady: while the President of the United States is also keen on getting into her pants.<br/><br/>The outcome of this - Britain decides to change its entire foreign policy position towards the US doesn't feel charming or amusing, just stupid and unbelievable.<br/><br/>But Love Actually not so much leans on the principle of suspension of belief but is propped up on it like crutches to allow it to get away with various outrages, including the fact the tea lady's working class nephew and the Prime Minister's sister's upper middle class kids all go to the same comprehensive in South London.<br/><br/>Curtis is bound at that point of bringing his disparate stories together at that point for that coherent sense of a unified end to the movie, but in reality there is no real connection between his tales of unrequited love, secret love, unexpected love, filial love, love across the social divide and the dying love of a middle aged sexless marriage.<br/><br/>This last one is probably the most infuriating, as Emma Thompson is a great actress and the film's one moment of genuinely acted (rather than cue-carded) emotion is when the reality of her husband's disinterest in her is unavoidably presented in the form of a Christmas present.<br/><br/>I'd like to have seen more of her, of this, of Rickman, especially as the first part of the story - the mechanics of his infidelity is treated entirely as a joke.<br/><br/>But the film is like a Ghost Train, it's whisking you off to the next silly situation before you have time to pause breath.<br/><br/>In a supreme effort not to be cynical I believe there is a point to what Curtis is trying to say, rather than divest us each of a fiver at our most emotionally penetrable point of the year. Love is a protean, healing, binding force that perhaps gives our daily activities some sort of meaning, or at least makes them bearable, and in the final analysis it is the human connections we have we will turn to in our darkest and lightest moments.<br/><br/>But the examination of it is impatient, badly-structuted, often trite and ultimately, despite its high-calorific content, unsatisfying."

","Good material for relax with a refreshing plot and a good cast of actors and actresses, among them Hugh Grant as a new Tony Blair, more critic and independent from USA; Billy Bob Thornton as the invasive US president who even wanted to steal the love of the primer Minister of UK; the always effective Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson, and many others. The plot consists of lives and behavior of various people in UK, from the head of the government to simple persons in this society and the ways each tries to celebrate Christmas. Not all is positive, a couple is also shown having a husband with false values always looking for other ladies and fun.

It's like a McDonald's set lunch. The seemingly interwoven stories are actually superficially added-up, which makes the movie look like a bunch of court-metrages shown in a messy way. And for each story, time is so limited that it's impossible to include any ""foreplays"" or ""after-plays"", nor emotions. It's all orgasms, or ""selling points"".

The most touching part i felt was Laura Linney and the relationship that she has with her brother. I was clost to tears. Richard Curtis doesnt lose sight of any of the stories and he entwines them beautifully. If you come out of this film feeling depressed, then there is definitely something wrong with you.

If we can have a joly good laught at it, the better and even a somewhat sugary happy-end does not turn us off, like the professional art critics. This film fully fulfills these expectations: it is entertaining, humorous, very well acted by all, quick-moving and has the happy end, which maybe is somewhat unreal and does not belong to the stories.

","It is. And I generally don't like romantic comedies because the plots are too contrived and the characters (of which there are usually two, of opposite sexes) fall too easily together. ""Love Actually,"" however, reconstructs and outdoes the genre. It's the ""Nashville,"" or ""Magnolia"" of romantic comedies; a multi-character, multi-sub-plot, multi-layered and hard-to-describe-without-a-crapload-of-hyphens film. It's pleasant to watch, it tries to be very honest and it's constantly entertaining. The stories intersect through the relations between the 12 (or whatever) characters, and often in a very amusing way. But they also cohere through the common theme: namely, that love is present in one way or another in each of the characters' lives. The movie has several advantages because of its large cast. With many stories, the film has both pay-offs known in romantic comedies (ex: guy declares his undying love for a girl in front of a large crowd) AND romantic disappointments. Still, regardless of what the characters go through, and where fate takes them, ""Love Actually"" never falters in its warm atmosphere and great sense of humor. It's a pleasure to watch - and it's one of the few comedies that I've walked out of smiling and not feeling cheated by the story. It's a romantic comedy that transgresses the conventions of the genre and does it refreshingly well."

Bill Nehy's Christmas rock and roll song is destined to be a Christmas classic, baby.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis' film can even make the most bitter amongst us think love is all around us, actually.  Love is a silly old fashioned word.  But this film gives it new life and meaning, actually."

","My partner and I wanted an absorbing, feelgood film for a Saturday night. 'Love Actually' fitted the bill very well. The characters are engaging. The eight separate episodes are well worked out and come together very cleverly.It has good production values.<br/><br/>It has a number of well thought through and original plot devices. These vary from the all-too-believable to the surrealistic. If Colin's experience in Milwaukee is real then I want to know when the next plane leaves!<br/><br/>There are a number of strong performances. My personal favourites were Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, LÃºcia Montez and Bill Nighy but other people will have their favourites. Lovely cameo from Rowan Atkinson. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister? Oh dear!<br/><br/>Nevertheless the scene where he tells the arrogant American president off in public nearly got a round of applause here and probably did so in London.<br/><br/>
For what it is, an entertaining and well done piece, I would certainly recommend it."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","Null","0","2","10 February 2004"," A somewhat fun look at love
","'Love Actually' a film written and directed by Richard Curtis tells the (love story) of several characters through out, placing them often in funny situations. The main characters are Bill Nighy as an honest burnt out rock star looking to sell his CD, Hugh Grant as the charming, newly elected Prime Minister of England, Colin Firth as an author looking to write a new book, and Liam Neeson as a recently widowed person who's 11 son claims to be in love with a girl at school. Eventually, these stories connect in a way, and it's interesting to see how it happens. The cast here works well, they all turn in believable performances, especially Emma Thompson as a wife who is a bit shocked and saddened by what her husband (Alan Rickman) has done. Laura Linney also comes into play as a worker for Rickman, though she is a bit shy to go after the one she loves. The main idea of the film is that 'love is everywhere'. The audience sees through these stories that, and the film starts on a high note and ends on a high note. Curtis keeps on his idea, something to admire, he doesn't get sidetracked by other things. The film has its moments, there are some funny bits mainly with Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. The film was made with heart, something else to appreciate, Curtis seems to want the audience to genuinely care what happens to these characters, and in a way, he gets the audience to do so. However, at times the film isn't quite the comedy it was made out to be. These moments occur mainly with the characters of Linney and Thompson, whom have problems in their personal lives. These moments painfully stick out, as much the film is supposed to be a realistic reflection on love, the moments don't exactly fit in well with the rest of the film. All in all, 'Love Actually' is an okay film. It has its moments, there is some good work from the cast, though at times the humor gets a bit excessive and the film can't decide which direction it wants to go. 7/10"

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Christmas 2003,for me,anyway,has got to rank among the most excruciating experiences in my meagre 20 years on this planet.It was that time of the year again and boy did the message seem to be plugged to me,in a year when I just really wasn't in the mood.It seemed no matter where I went or what I did,there was no escape from the festive pluggings in all their forms and glory,more so than any other year I can remember.Not only that,but everyone seemed to keep going on about the countdown to add insult to injury.Love Actually appears to have interpreted my (and possibly other peoples) frustration and,as the story progresses,has included banners indicating the countdown to December 25th starting from the five week mark point and progressing downwards from there.<br/><br/>The film has a Pulp Fiction esque feel to it by focusing on not just one main storyline but an interwining series of them,all seemingly revolving around how love is the ultimate binding force of the universe and how at Christmas,the time of peace and goodwill to all men,this sentiment should especially shine through.We open with Hugh Grant's Prime Minister,the main character,telling us how ""people can find the most love at airports"" as this is a main greeting area where people come to meet and say goodbye to people they love.Hmmm,very intuitive.Said PM has a thing for his new tea lady (Martine McCutcheon) and spends the film working towards the outcome of this fancy.Photographer Liam Neeson has recently lost his wife and has to help his young son get the girl he fancies at school.Colin Firth plays a man trying to get the Spanish girl he's dating to marry him.Laura Linney plays.....a character whose purpose I was unsure of throughout the film.Emma Thompson plays the PM's secretary and personal assistant.Alan Rickman is her grumpy husband.Keira Knightley is the love interest of a man who's best friend she's married to.Bill Nighy plays an ageing rock star,so warbled in his mind on account of years of heroin abuse who's trying to hit the Christmas No.1 spot with one of the worst,most laughable songs ever.And there's a bizarre cameo appearance from Rowan Atkinson as a jewellery store assistant who inconvieniently faffs about too much,causing various inconvienience to different people.<br/><br/>Grant's character is almost certainly a parody of Tony Blair right down to a tee,with his overbearing niceness and constant cheesy grinning and this especially comes to light in a scene featuring Billy Bob Thornton in a cameo as the American president.They're taking the p**s as,during a press conference,he tells the president exactly what he thinks of his policy and where to shove it.This was almost certainly making a statement of how everyone didn't think that this was the true of the real PM Blair,and how they seemed to perceive him as doing a lot of gutless pandering to the real American president George Bush during the year of the war with Iraq.In the leading role,he carries the film in the way he's carried films of a similar ilk that he's been the leading star of in the past,but is ultimately unremarkable.McCutcheon's certainly worked hard to get roles in films like this,but she still has a little way to go to prove she has what it takes to send her career to even greater levels,unlike co-star Knightley who is both exceptionally pretty and carries a natural charm throughout.Many of the other head-billed cast members do well in their roles too,especially Neeson,Nighy as a milder version of Ozzy Osbourne and,Atkinson,bringing his usual quirky comic charm to what is essentially only a walk-on part.<br/><br/>The film itself is not particularly funny or charming in any way,but it does carry an engaging enough concept.And the soundtrack ain't bad either.***"

","The interweaving of all the stories was very well done. The characters were well drawn and believable.  Hugh Grant plays the silly git so well, Emma and Alan were lovely together and I wanted to slap him for causing her pain. All the stories were interesting and the laughs were frequent.  The couple playing the movie stand-ins made me blush and the interaction between Liam Neeson's character and his stepson were lovely. Colin Firth is always great to watch and I enjoyed his journey. Unlike everyone else, I didn't enjoy Bill Nighys character.  I thought it was cliched and silly. I did laugh at some of his antics but there was no way that stupid song would top the charts, even in England!<br/><br/>It's a feel good, laugh out loud film with a little sting and should be viewed as such.

","I've had numerous surprises this year as far as how good a film is, but they've all been a bad surprise. Movies like Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Underworld, and Jeepers Creepers 2 and some others that I can't think of off the top of my head have all been movies that I expected to be good, but they all turned out to be pieces of crap. Now, there's finally a good surprise. I came into this movie thinking it was just going to be another chick flick that I would deeply regret seeing, but it wasn't, it was surprisingly good! Usually though, I know exactly why I like or hate a film, but I can't seem to describe what I like about it. There's way too much going on with all the characters for me to give a damn about any character, but I did. I really understood them. There's one couple in Love Actually where we're not even sure if they're going to be together at all. So why was it good? I guess it was good because it made you feel good about yourself (as cheesy as it sounds). Who cares about any of the damn characters?! The movie as a whole puts a smile on your face. If you hate romance no matter what form it's in or how it's told, the movie does offer some funny moments. One of the funniest characters is an old rockstar who would probably be the last person you want to sing any Christmas song at all and there's a little kid in there that definitly takes some of the grown-up feel out of the movie (to me, that's a good thing). So overall it was a great feel good movie!<br/><br/>Love Actually- 8/10"
"clerk123321","10","0","5","23 January 2004"," Very good actually
","Yesterday my girlfriend just decided that we should go see this movie. Now i had heard of it, but vaguely to be honest. It sounded like 'just another romantic comedy'... With the loads of mediocre movies my girlfriend usually likes watching (for example stuff like the wedding planner, or freaky friday) I didnt have my hopes up high. When the movie started, I heard Hugh Grant's voice and I thought ""well, this can't be all bad"". And it isnt! To be honest, it's absolutely brilliant. This movie, from the same writer as four weddings and a funeral, notting hill and bridget jones' diary, is the best romantic comedy i've seen in ages. It's quite easily better than the aforementioned movies and although the general theme (being 'love' ofcourse) is oozing from the screen, the movie succeeds very well in going beyond that. You see a lot of 'could have beens' and some sorrow as well. And that's what makes it great. Instead of just showing how great love is, it also shows the downside of making wrong decissions in love (and ways to possibly solve that)... This movie is just great and i'd watch it again today, if i could.. but that's the real downside to the movie... The DVD is still so far, far away :( It's highly recommendable for everyone though, with a great cast, good writing and directing and you will leave the theatre with a smile on your face! Brilliant!"

","This movie is really what we call a ""feel-good"" movie. It is an intricate web of love stories that leads to a positive ending for all of them. Everything is uplifting in this film, the humor, the actors (Britain's best), the score (exhilarating moment when Prime Minister/Hugh Grant dance in his office!) and of course the stories themselves. Comparing this movie to a lot of ""romantic comedies"" of recent times (Two weeks notice, Maid in Manhattan to name just a few), it is a welcome and positive change. You feel concerned by the characters and you want to believe that love is indeed what drives this world. In this matter, we are justly reminded that it was love messages that all the victims of 9/11 gave to their families, not messages of hate or revenge. Love should rule!"

","Man, what a great movie. It's like one big soap opera. Coming from a person who idolizes action and martial arts movies, Love Actually actually interested me. With the amount of known actors and actresses, this movie will surely satisfy the audience of this romantic comedy genre. I put this movie off for a while, but I just watched it and it was hyphy!! (meaning good, amazing, fabulous, the s**t, etc.). I love international movies. This movie sure beats your average American romantic comedy. Hugh Grant always gives his usual, but Colin Firth's performance was interesting. He learned some Spanish just to ask Aurelius to marry him. THAT'S LOVE!!! I know I would. I also liked Mark and Juliet's story. Telling somebody that you love them is hard enough, but when you finally do it, the worst that can happen is the other person telling you they don't love you. But, oh well. A person only lives once. Overall great romantic holiday movie. I liked the way the stories kept getting switched around to keep interest.<br/><br/>Final Judgement: 3.5/4 stars"

","When I first heard about ""Love Actually,"" I didn't want to see it because of the reasons for which it was rated R.  Yet when it was nominated for a Golden Globe and I saw it was playing at the ""$1.50 Theater,"" I decided to give it a try.  What I got was much more than my money's worth: a truly delightful, thoughtful film.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" is advertised as a romantic comedy, but I believe the movie was much more than that.  Richard Curtis' story is complex, yet believable, showing the ties between between several different people with the common factor of love.  Also, the love portrayed is not only romantic love, but also love for friends and love for family.  The love in the movie is often unexpected, sometimes not, but always enjoyable.  The movie was simply hilarious, seemingly without much effort.  Also, Craig Armstrong's score is simply immaculate, portraying the themes of the movie through both uplifting and dramatic pieces.  The score succeeds in not only showing the ups and downs of love, but also how little events can seem over-dramatic to those involved, especially those ""in love.""<br/><br/>Complaints: I have very few for this movie, because of how extremely enjoyable it is, but I must say two things.  First, the beginning, maybe, fifteen minutes of the movie seem chaotic,as Richard Curtis switches from one story to the next.  Yet the movie quickly warms up as the characters in the movie are developed.  Second, those who read my reviews probably get tired of me saying this, but there was a little too much nudity for my tastes.  However, I will say this, I liked the point that the director makes through his use of sex scenes.  Nevertheless, the film still could've been even better if the scenes had been implied instead of shown.<br/><br/>See ""Love Actually,"" not to see a mindless comedy, but to see possibly the most enjoyable Golden Globe-nominated movie of 2003.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A-."
"shinymc_shine","8","0","2","28 January 2004"," Laughs Are All Around
","""Love Actually"" is a crowd pleasing romantic comedy from writer Richard Curtis, making his directorial debut.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in England, five weeks before Christmas, and has multiple storylines about love and sex. The main focus is on three siblings. One is the new Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, who has fallen for one of his staff, the new tealady. The other is a long married wife, played by Emma Thompson, who suspects that her husband, Alan Rickman, maybe contemplating having an affair with his secretary. The last is a newly widowed stepfather, played by Liam Neeson, encouraging his stepson who's trying to impress his first crush. There are other characters including Bill Nighy as a fading, old rock star, Laura Linney who holds a flame for someone at work but has a secret which is ruining her love life, and Colin Firth as an author who can't express his love for his foreign housekeeper because she can't speak a word of English. Majority of the characters intertwine at some point in the movie but due to excellent casting and solid writing you're never lost plotwise.<br/><br/>Curtis is possibly the best screenwriter for Grant. Every line roles from his tongue as if he had thought of it. They're the comedy equivalent of writer David Mamet and actor Joe Mantegna. I feel that the sequences with Grant as Prime Minister could've been a movie all by itself. Grant has real competition humor wise from Nighy who always brings a smile to your face the moment he appears on screen. He's perfectly cast and his lanky frame brilliantly conveys his aging, laid back rocker. On the more serious side Neeson has never been better. His scenes with the young boy are the emotional heart of the movie. This strand of the plot is possibly the most successful of all the storylines. Thompson has the more thankless role and is overshadowed by her on-screen husband Rickman. It's been years since we last saw her and I wish she'd had a more meatier part. Rickman over comes the simplistic kitchen sink drama of a man tempted by a younger woman. We feel more for him rather than Thompson even though he's the one thinking about cheating. The pairing of the two as a married couple has a comfortable and true feel to it as if they had played husband and wife before. Linney seems miscast possibly because she is the only American lead in this extremely British movie. She sticks out like a sore thumb and you can't help but think that there must be a good British actress who could've played her part. Her appearance smacks of an advertising ploy to get an American name who could sell the movie in her home country. Firth is good though a little typecast in the more romantic storyline of the movie. His role has you on his side from very early on and you constantly root for him to make the right decision. The other cast are excellent though in the case of the gorgeous Keira Knightley there isn't much for her to do apart from look beautiful. Outstanding cameo from Billy Bob Thornton, the perfect choice to play the American president.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Curtis' writing since the TV series ""Blackadder II"". His writing is the highest calibre of British comedy and it's not often that he makes a mistake. (""The Blackadder"", ""Blackadder: Back And Forth"" and ""Bean"" are possibly his only work that isn't up to scratch and he can't be solely blamed for those as he was credited as a co-writer.) He has been lucky with other directors, Mel Smith with ""The Tall Guy"", Mike Newell with ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", Roger Michell with ""Notting Hill"", but it's entirely logical for him to take up directing as most writers want to control the way their work appears on screen. He does a fine job. None of the storylines outstay their welcome and the scenes have a Christmas glow about them. It's also good to see Curtis regular Rowan Atkinson in a glorified cameo as a sales assistant.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great, grown up, inoffensive comedy that doesn't necessarily have to be watched at Christmas time. The negative aspects which I have already discussed are only minute and if it's pure entertainment you want you can't go wrong here. So many romantic comedies of late, ""Two Weeks Notice"" and ""Maid In Manhattan"" for example, have been seriously lacking in the comedy department. It's refreshing to find a good date movie that a man can safely enjoy."

","Old and new talent abounds in this film. However, there are too many storylines for any actors to lead; Love Actually employs a true ensemble cast. Such a film must be carefully crafted, and Richard Curtis winds the storylines together, at times unexpectedly, as when the plot reveals the surprising relation of two key characters. The net of characters resembles the net of love between family and friends. Love Actually unfolds a philosophical message, which is stated in the opening and endorsed throughout: ""Love actually is all around."" I did wonder about the character named Colin, who was so sure that American women would adore his British accent and charm and desire his company. Odder than that assumption was Curtis's confirmation of that. What a strange portrayal of American girls! Colin was not an interesting character, and his interactions with the Americans were not interesting. Despite that distraction, and the overwhelmingly large cast that begs you to take notes, I enjoyed Love Actually greatly-I hate to dismiss any film as a romantic comedy, and Love Actually, like Notting Hill, has that unique British flavor that makes the film more an intellectual romance."

"macpherr","8","0","2","22 January 2004"," Very uplifting movie.
","This is a delightful movie. As we walked out the of the theater my husband said:' Get the tape, get the DVD, whatever.' There are many aspects of this movie that mean a lot to me: (1)  The majority of the movie was filmed in England, a country that I have great memories of. It is true that there is a lot of love in airports. I was there just last Spring, and felt very loved when my friends waited for me at Heathrow with big smiled giving me hugs and kisses; (2)  I do live about 10 minutes from Dulles airport where one of the planes was hijacked from on September 11,  and the amount of security we had to go thru at Dulles gave me a strange feeling. Although such a crime against humanity started at the airport, the writer of the screenplay was inspired by the events and came up with such an uplifting movie;  (3)   I do speak Portuguese and I must congratulate Colin Firth (Circle of Friends, Bridget Jones Diary, and the much anticipated Bridget Jones, The Edge of reason). I watched him in an interview where he said that he does not speak Portuguese at all. I thought he was fluent. Perhaps his knowledge of Italian and French helped. It was flawless. It was such a pleasant surprise, to hear Portuguese. It is very hard to summarize this movie, because it has a lots of people and lots of stories. Just think of it  as a spoken musical, during the Spring and it is all about love.  It is impossible to write a summary about everyone without making people bored to tears, and have their eyes crossed and their mind wandering after the third sentence. After awhile it is ludicrous to read because your mind will wander if you try. This movie  is to be watched, and felt and not to be described. This movie is to be enjoyed, like love. The characters are all flirting, falling in love, falling out of love.  The movie is excellent.  We left the theater happy, enthusiastic about life. The cast is full of giants of the British Cinema. I  highly recommend it!"

"madsbs","6","0","2","16 January 2004"," Subtle and funny, but no cigar...
","A patchwork of narratives about the love that is found in every corner of the world is, indeed, a beautiful plot. Thus, the outset of this movie is simple but meaningful, and the result is for the better part fine, humorous, and even touching at times. <br/><br/>A few of the stories are devised in an exceptionally ingenious manner. One example: The whole movie is set in Britain, where an ordinary young man babbles away about going to the States, because there, he claims, he'll find girls who are willing to sleep with him. His friend is very skeptical about the likelihood of success in this project. The young man buys a ticket anyway, and the outcome of that trip is skillfully staged, though it should not be revealed here.<br/><br/>
There are a few major flaws in the movie too: (1) You just don't choose Hugh Grant for the role as PM of Great Britain - unless, of course, your POINT is to avoid credible characters; (2) The fine understanding of everyday situations is generally ruined towards the end of the movie, when all the subtle portraits of everyday 'love situations' is hastily merged into a paradisiac mass hysteria."

","Love Actually has something in it for anyone who has ever loved someone. And that's pretty much everyone, as this movie is not just about romantic love, but love in all it's forms. It also explores the love we feel for family and friends, and our attempts to reconcile that with romantic love.<br/><br/>Some of the story lines were better than others. Hugh Grant, while amusing, plays himself again. And the thought of him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is not far short of farcical. However, this was made up for by the touching storyline played out by Emma Thompson of the wife who finds herself being overlooked by her husband, for a young flirtatious woman at his work.<br/><br/>Also, the storyline about the body doubles standing in for actors in nude sex scenes. While this was pretty ridiculous on the surface, it was a great story for two reasons. Firstly, the fun it poked at the quaint English manners - it would be hard to think of a less appropriate setting for such formality. And secondly, I think it made a very interesting point which to me was the background theme of the whole movie - that what really matters in human relationships is not just the physical (that is easy to come by), but an emotional connection. Without that, we are just going through the moves, without really knowing the other person.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked about this movie was the use of the airport arrivals scenes. It really tied together the fact that here was a series of stories about everyday people, and every single person has their own story. Next time I'm at the airport, I will be looking more closer at those around me, and wondering what interesting story has brought them there.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie. If you have ever loved, you will find something in it you relate to."

","Love Actually is all around us, so we are told. And it is too even if you don't always find it for yourself. You may have it, you may find it , you may lose it, but it's there. Love is faithful, loyal, lost, found, it is perfect timing, bad timing and a near miss. Love is taking risks, taking that opportunity when it comes along because you never know, you might not get the chance again. Love is playing it safe, it is unrequited, it is full of grief, full of joy. There is first love, last love, new love, unrequited love, old love; father and son, brother and sister, best friends, the meeting of strangers. Love is dark, tempting, lustful (or is that really love at all?). It is not restricted to adults. Love Actually is a movie about love (no kidding!). It is so real that you will most certainly identify with at least one character, more likely several. It is pure fantasy. On the surface, it is all the traditional definitions of the words and phrases i just mentioned, and it is many other meanings of the same things. It will make you smile with sentimentality or nostalgia , and it may make you cry because you feel the pain from your own experience. Ok there are some of you out there that are skeptical of this kind of movie and it won't be something that everyone would enjoy. It's an ensemble British cast under the debut direction of Mike Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral among other things and i think he did a pretty good job. If this movie had been made in Hollywood it would have been utterly unwatchable dreck, overacted and very, very twee and trite. It has it's sentimental moments but those moments are broken unexpectedly at times. I thought it was a fresh view on most of the situations.<br/><br/>
There's no point in going into all the subplots to do with all the various couples involved in the movie, it would be too confusing. Most of my favourite actors are in it, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and that alone was reason enough for me to see it. I came away with a smile on my face and that's enough for me :)"

","It seems Richard Curtis was sick of all the hatred that's all around. So he wanted to make a point through this movie: that it's only love that's all around. Quite true, at least in the movie. It's got not one, but eight couples dealing with their love lives. With so many people and so many activities, all in one movie, Richard has done quite a good job.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to judge the actors' performance, because with so many characters, none have a major on-screen presence. However, the movie doesn't demand anything extraordinary, as is the case with most romantic dramas.<br/><br/>I thought I'd say that I hated the movie, but somehow I feel like watching it again. Maybe it's because the movie is quite refreshing, or whatever, but definitely worth a watch...at least once!"

It's one of those movies where almost everyone winds up in the same building at the same time on Christmas Eve, so don't expect a lot of ""documentary realism"", but if you're in the mood for a funny, very romantic comedy, this could be just the ticket.

All the stories work for me, especially the main ones: the Prime Minister & Natalie; Jamie & Aurelia; Sam & Joanna; and the Emma Thompson-Alan Rickman tragedy. Billy Mack was a hoot, & I so wanted to be Colin Frissel 'liasing'with the quintet of Wisconsin uber-babes!<br/><br/>
I bought the soundtrack just to hear that little girl, Olivia Olson, sing ""All I Want for Christmas is You,"" but the rest of the music - songs & score - is very good.  I've used music to 'decorate' several plays I've written & directed, and I can see why Richard Curtis said that Love Actually wouldn't be a complete film without the music.

All performances were far above the usual holiday rubbish Hollywood peddles. It'll be in my DVD collection ASAP.

"ruby_fff","7","0","2","12 January 2004"," How reassuring that love IS actually all around us -- unabashedly optimistic ""Love Actually"" is.
","British writer Richard Curtis' directorial debut of his own script ""Love Actually"" is an ambitious endeavour -- a big heart packaged to encompass the world. It could very well be as grand a scale as ""The Last Samurai"" with cast of extras just as plenty (imagine the airport scenes) besides managing nine concurrent stories about love. He pulled it off successfully with a stellar casting by Mary Selway and Fiona Weir. Bill Nighy's Billy Mack rock singer story is used as the staple timeline the other stories revolve -- it's countdown with 5 weeks to Christmas. Here, Hugh Grant's Prime Minister role is not exactly the main one, each of the other stories share its sum of on-screen time. Some of the characters do cross each other's path. For example: Emma Thompson's Karen is sister to Grant's PM, her husband (Alan Rickman) Harry's secretary Mia turns out to be neighbor of Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon). <br/><br/>The story of Liam Neeson's Daniel and his 11 year old stepson Sam is a hit. Thomas Sangster played Sam (his sixth acting endeavour and first feature in 2 years) certainly tugs at our hearts by his innocent love pursuit. You'll find satisfactory rationale to all this in Curtis' genuinely thoughtful dialogue. He's never flippant about any aspect of the subject at hand. Not even when he showed us John and Just Judy -- just the right restrained dosage of comedic pairing of Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as stand-in actors on set. There's the 'triangle' of Keira Knightly (shines in both ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") as Juliet, Chiwetel Ejiofor (the intriguing Nigerian doctor in Stephen Frears ""Dirty Pretty Things"") briefly as Peter her newly wedded husband, and Andrew Lincoln as Peter's best man Mark secretly, hopelessly in love with Juliet.<br/><br/>
Life is not all roses, and Curtis is not coy about uncomfortable aspects of love. Karen's (Thompson) suspicion about Harry, the sentiment though sad is eased by the chosen song played at the time. Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" rings true.  Harry's employee Sarah (Laura Linney from U.S.), her crush on colleague Mark (Rodrigo Santoro) is like a painful fairytale, time may generate hope. Kris Marshall's Colin is certainly the most happy go lucky one: 'coming to America,' meeting dream girls like Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth and returning home with him -- such satisfied faces at the airport.<br/><br/>I'm most akin to the story of Colin Firth's writer Jamie and his Portuguese-speaking only housekeeper Aurelia played by Lúcia Moniz. I like it already when Firth sat down at his writing hide-out in the French suburb and said, ""Alone Again, Naturally"" -- the title of a popular 1970 song by Gilbert O'Sullivan. The comic yet tender language barrier scenes with subtitles remind me of the Russian/Finnish film ""The Cuckoo"" (Kukushka). There are dashes of references to other movies or songs, e.g., Grant doing a 'Tom Cruise Risky Business' singing pose as he starts a gig of a song; Daniel and Sam watching 'Kate & Leo in Titanic' for motivation.<br/><br/>
To w-d Curtis' credit, following the 9 stories was not at all confusing. I saw the movie on its opening weekend and the packed audience thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hrs. 15 mins. of laughter and tears. The story scenes intercut each other in an assured pace, like movements of a symphony -- overture, interlude, yes, the finale is well-crafted to the cadence of love IS actually all around -- visual camera at play.   If you're interested in behind the scenes, visit the official Web site of ""Love Actually"" -- there are generous production notes including excerpt dialogues and how each story came to be. Enjoy!"
"Jenny Ho","7","0","2","9 January 2004"," Another feel-good offering from Curtis. I actually like Four Weddings and a Funeral' and Bridget Jones' Diary' more
","The film is set in the five weeks leading up to Christmas and consists of a number of love stories affecting people who are related to characters in the other stories: a best man (Andrew Lincoln) is inexplicably hostile to his friend's new wife; the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls in love with his tea lady (Martine McCutcheon); his sister (Emma Thomson) is faced with her husband (Alan Rickman) having an affair at work; Alan Rickman's colleague (Laura Linney) finds her long term crush and love for another colleague requited; a widowed father (Liam Neeson) helps his son cope with falling in love for the first time; a writer (Colin Firth) escapes to France after being cheated on by his wife and finds new love; and an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) aims to make Christmas Number One in the pop charts with a cover of Love Is All Around' only the lyrics have been changed to Christmas Is All Around'.  (Astonishingly, this song has been released for real in the UK and made the top 40!)<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Richard Curtis's previous offerings Four Weddings And A Funeral' and Notting Hill', you will not be disappointed by Love Actually' which is fun, likeable and romantic, if a little formulaic.  Hugh Grant gets another starring role in a Curtis movie and gives an endearing performance as the British Prime Minister.  I like him a lot but I am sure that there are some people out there who will be irritated to find him in typical bumbling mode (yet again!)<br/><br/>It is a joy to see the abundance of British stars on the screen and it is fun to spot the additional television stars including British television presenters of the moment Ant and Dec!  My favourite moment is one I'm sure many of the British public have been faced with at some point in their lives when Bill Nighy refers to one of the presenters as Ant or Dec' as he has no idea which is which!  Other comic highlights include Hugh Grant dancing in the hallway at Number Ten and the language barrier between Colin Firth and his maid in France even though they are unable to speak each other's language, the subtitles on the screen show that they are communicating even if they are not aware of it.  The chemistry between these two is irresistible but is let down by the silly way that their story is resolved.<br/><br/>While the film is filled with likeable performances, there is one piece of casting which let Liam Neeson's story down.  His son is cute but he sounds far too posh and well spoken for me to feel sympathy for his situation!<br/><br/>Alongside the humour, there are some unexpected serious moments which I think over tip the balance and sit uncomfortably in a mostly lighthearted comedy.  One of these is the discovery that Laura Linney's new love is jeopardised by her commitment to her mentally ill brother.  Emma Thomson's realisation that her husband is cheating on her is also heartbreaking.  You have these serious undercurrents on the one hand and on the other you have a couple of silly stories: one featuring Kris Marshall leaving his life in London for Wisconsin in search of beautiful girls and rampant sex and another featuring Martin Freeman (Tim from The Office') as a porn body double having getting to know you' conversations while engaging in various sexual positions with his naked co-star.<br/><br/>Love Actually' is like a book of short stories and suffers in the same way: by the time you get into the stories and you are just starting to get to know the main character, it is time to move on to a completely new story which is sometimes less interesting.  However, it makes for an enjoyable and romantic enough date movie and is Christmassy enough to warrant repeat viewings on DVD and television over festive seasons to come."

","There's only one manner in which to describe Richard Curtis' intriguing masterpiece--Hugh Grant himself would have said, ""Surreal, but nice."" Richard Curtis seemed to have outdone himself again with this zany comedy. Apparently, some people would have presumed that this film was somewhat formal like his other films, but in fact, it was a great film in which everyone would have enjoyed.<br/><br/>The ideal tale of showing eight different love stories in the film was a perfect way of depicting this wonderful comedy. In my personal perspective, however, I would have merely thought that Curtis should have entitled his wonderful film ""Six Weddings and Two Funerals."" I kept getting this impression that Curtis' characters were similar to that of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but in all actuality, that was never his intention. If there were sheep included in the film, I would have given second thoughts.<br/><br/>The characters in this film were extremely intriguing and very hilarious (especially Rowan Atkinson's role where he plays the jeweler). The dialogue seemed well written and the cinematography behind this entire atmosphere was entirely amazing! Curtis' various shots of London really made the film seem entirely undismal. The entire question that should have been asked would be, where was he when ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" was created or perhaps ""Notting Hill?"" Who knows, but for now, I seem to enjoy where Curtis is in the film business, and may we expect more stuff from this man in the near future!<br/><br/>9.7/10 (or consider it an A to due its illumination and well developed plot plus the cinematography. All the credit for this ingenuity belongs to Richard Curtis and some hilarious scene stealers such as Bill Nighy, Rowan Atkinson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, and most definitely, the Colin bloke that went to America to find true love.

In another time and place this film might just be a nice, amusing, upbeat film. But here and now, it's a powerful story that beautifully counterbalances the daily propaganda barrage of terror inflicted on us by the news media. Not since American Beauty have I seen a film that demonstrates that rare but wonderful quality of being able to recast the viewer's world in a new, more accurate light.<br/><br/>Love Actually is a credit to its media.

","So I'd had this God-awful row with my girlfriend, and I really wanted to see Dead End but had promised to take her to this...I sat in the cinema desperately leaning away from her to let her know I was still angry. Then Hugh Grant makes that SICKENING speech about the 9/11 victims. Mood blackening. Bill Nighy and the hilarious wasted rocker strand cheers me slightly, but the scene in the church where the WACKY best man/stalker arranges for a band of Chicago proportions AND a full choir unexpectedly to sing ""All You Need is Love"" - well, for the first time since Interview With The Vampire, I was ready to walk out. Liam Neeson's brat didn't help - don't you HATE kids spouting adult dialogue? Memo to screenwriters: kids communicate in surly, monosyllabic grunts, not flowing streams of bons mots!!<br/><br/>Slowly, inevitably, I warmed to it. There were more sick-making moments, and Curtis' habit of placing coffins in his stories to shock us, only to juxtapose something bathetic...in this case the Bay City Rollers...is cheap. But, like most of the other contributors here, I left the cinema feeling happy (though still refusing to speak to my girlfriend).<br/><br/>One really annoying point was the Prime Minister's decision to go all anti-American on our asses because of jealousy over a woman! (And a woman, at that, who, ridiculously, says ""Oh, piss it!"" - in fact, is there an award for least-convincing swearing in a movie? Martine McCutcheon is a shoo-in). We don't see the CONSEQUENCES of his tub-thumping speech - only the tearful reactions of his staff (mainly the soppy women, of course). I don't think the US would be quite so cowed in real life.<br/><br/>Plus points: the porn stand-ins strand (funny in an uptight British way), the wish-fulfillment of the hitherto ANNOYING berk who goes to the states (you keep waiting for him to wake from his dream), Rowan Atkinson, the Emma Thompson strand (never warmed to her before, but, with the help of Joni, she provides an adult heart to this movie)...and Bill Nighy. The aging-rocker thing has been done to death, but this strand provides belly-laughs - what a pity the US audience won't appreciate his ""Ant or Dec"" line (as, fortunately those two no-marks are unknown across the pond). I actually had to stop myself laughing, lest my girlfriend think I was thawing.<br/><br/>So, serious flaws but, despite them, and despite yourself, you'll enjoy it."

","When a film has the creators of, and actors from, the likes of Bridget Jones' Diary, About A Boy and Four Weddings And A Funeral to its credit, it promises to be something quite funny. But in his directorial debut, Richard Curtis has done something different from his past works. While still creating a riotous comedy and including the usual provocative storyline, Curtis has made the latter far less subtle. In fact, he uses Love Actually as a vehicle for some very powerful messages. <br/><br/>The film presents several different people, their various relationships and associated problems. These are all of varying qualities with married couples suffering from the complications of an affair, single people finding each other and even those suffering from simple sexual desperation. Through these variances, Curtis delivers the same message: that `love actually is all around'. This message and its use in the film can only be described as sentimental, perhaps even mushy, but Curtis' sense of direction and comic timing never let it get out of hand and even at some of the films saddest moments he injects the necessary humour reminding the audience that they are watching a comedy, albeit one with a message. Love isn't the only message, with others coming across as far more subtle, though the recent War in Iraq is also used to provide a strong message, that of peace, with Hugh Grant's British Prime Minister shown standing up to America's push for war.<br/><br/>The actors respond well to their material with Grant providing his usual solid performance, full of quirky faces and eye-lid batting but his limited screen time prevents him from giving something of stellar quality along the lines of About A Boy and gone too is his new-found selfishness. Other noteworthies include a hilarious performance from Bill Nighy as the drugged-out ageing rocker and Rowan Atkinson's minor appearance. However, it is Emma Thompson whom really steals the show, providing one of the most solid performances as a mother struggling to keep her family together while her husband verges on having an affair. <br/><br/>While the multiple story lines allow for some fantastic onscreen presence, the film does feel a little bloated at times. Part way through you can't help but wonder where certain characters have disappeared' as their own storylines haven't been looked at for some time. This is particularly true of the odd-sex-groping' couple (you'll understand that term should you see the film) who appear sporadically and the exclusion of such characters wouldn't have been amiss and always could have been saved for the films DVD release. <br/><br/>And while such flaws exist, Curtis succeeds with his directorial debut thanks to a witty script and a brilliant cast, all able to inject something special into their performances. While there are attempts to avoid it, at times Love Actually does feel far too sentimental, but even with its sheer mushiness, and my natural desire to throw something at the screen in response, Curtis succeeds with his message of love. For I left the cinema more in love than when I entered.<br/><br/>Don't you just hate that?"

","I can't express how good a film this movie is and how much I love it. I know I may seem a little biased since I love pretty much anything British, but this is an excellent film. I wanted to see this film when I saw the preview for it and when I finally got there I was afraid that I would be let down. Of course, I like to think that I have pretty good taste in films and this one did not let me down. <br/><br/>The movie had many plot lines and even though some of the plots were overshadowed by others, I think that they did a great job wrapping it all up. I really enjoyed each story to this film. There wasn't one scene that didn't have my full attention. This movie is about love and they showed love in many different forms and I really respected that the most. It just wasn't about boyfriends and girlfriends, it was about love and all the ways that the human race can love.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see how all the stories ended, not all of them were happy, but that's life. At some points in the movie you question the credibility of these people's lives, but this is Hollywood. Use your imagination and open your heart to these people and you will see that maybe not all things are possible, but for these two hours you can turn a pumpkin into a carriage.<br/><br/>On a personal note, when Hugh Grant made his speech about the U.K. I was just in awe. I've always wanted to live in England and after that speech I wouldn't want to live anywhere else, except for maybe New York.<br/><br/>
I suggest that people do go see this film. There are scenes that take place that may be offensive, but for the most part it's just a fabulous story. If dig love, like George Harrison once said, you'll dig this film."

","Love actually was actually a good movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows several characters and their romance lives. Although the storyline can feel a little muddy, and you don't always care about some chracters as much as others, the film can hold your interest. My personal favorite subplot romance was between Jamie(Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz). It was cute. And throughout the film you grow to learn that most of the chracters are related to each other in some way or another.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW, READ AT OWN RISK*** I, however, was somewhat disappointed with the resolutions for Sarah (Laura Linney) and the married couple Karen(Emma Thompson) and Harry(Alan Rickman). I didn't feel like the characters relationships were justified in the end. And although love isn't perfect and not every ending is happy, it would have been nice to see these situations treated differently.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'm a satisfied movie-goer, actually."
"revsonya","8","0","1","12 December 2003"," actually loved it!
","I had braced myself for disappointment. After all, what movie could ever live up to the promises of such a stellar cast?  Emma Thompson, who may very well be the perfect actress...if not woman. Colin Firth, my not-so-secret latest crush. Liam Neeson, who always makes me think of naked guys since seeing him as Oscar Wilde on Broadway in The Judas Kiss. The always brilliant Alan Rickman. And no matter what his failings, I can't long resist the charms of Hugh Grant...often to my chagrin.  Yet, even with Richard Curtis at the helm, good romantic comedies are hard to find, so I dared not hope too much.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise.  Love Actually actually is a delight.  As the opening monologue relates, the prevailing wisdom in our world is that hatred and greed run rampant, overshadowing anything decent about humanity and its intricate relationships.  But when we stop and look around us, it's amazing how much love there really is- among friends, partners, family, and even colleagues.  Just watch the arrivals at the airport to see the joy we bring one another.  When faced with corporate scandals, bullying nations, and desperate terrorists, we too often we overlook the daily graces of life. Yet they continue...and even abound...for many of us.  This film explores such graces through a multiplicity of relationships:  a man (Neeson) and his stepson; an aging rocker and his manager; the new Prime Minister (Grant) and one of his staff; an aging, successful businessman (Rickman), his wife (Thompson) and his would-be mistress; a cuckholded man (Firth) and his cleaning lady; an artist struggling to adjust to his best friend's marriage; a woman (Laura Linney) torn between her commitment to herself and her commitment to family.the list goes on and on.  Like the intricacies of our lives and commitments, many of these plot-lines overlap.<br/><br/>Admittedly, in spite of the challenges of their relationships, these characters spend vast amounts of time in the lap of luxury, enjoying privileges unknown in large sectors of society.  Without a doubt, they're delightful eye-candy.  Even so, like the rest of us mere mortals, they face personal challenges, disappointments, and even griefs...none of which are trivial...or trivialized.  But somehow these characters survive...with plucky courage, humor, and even joy.  In a world full of despair and degradation, Love Actually offers signs of hope both for creative transformation and for good's triumph - at least for those who can afford it.  Julian of Norwich would've loved it:  All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.<br/><br/>And a number of things in Love Actually actually are well. Near the beginning of the film we witness a wedding between a white woman (Keira Knightley) and a black man (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and no one even blinks. Undercurrents abound around this wedding, but they aren't about race.  How nice. And while the film doesn't demonize (or, god-forbid, glorify) Americans (thankfully), it does dare to poke fun and even point-out some of our worst failings at present...in an oh-so-polite-but-stalwart British way. How refreshing.<br/><br/>But ALL is not well in Love Actually.  For a film of 135 minutes, there are an inordinate number of fat comments-an indication of laziness on the part of the writers who opt for cheap laughs at the expense of any woman larger than a size 6.  Driving the film's excessive attention to weight is its sexist undercurrent.  Perhaps that's part of the film's appeal - it doesn't threaten or challenge or call to accountability in any way the ""traditional"" world where men wield power in the public sphere and women are subordinate to them, both in the office and in the home.  In spite of the vast variety of relationships explored and the vast talent of the women in the cast, not one of the plot-lines is about a relationship between or among women. Ultimately, all of the stories revolve around the needs, wants and problems of the men in them - the women serve only as foils.  Important as the needs, wants and problems of men are, I suspect the women in their world have needs, wants and problems of their own.  Sadly, in this film, we'll never know about any of those except the ones that revolve around the men.  So although Curtis and Co. envision a world in which persons are judged by the `content of their character rather than the color of their skin,' they fail miserably even to question a world ruled exclusively by men with full support from `their' women.<br/><br/>Like most romantic comedies, Love Actually abounds with the implausible and the outrageous. Such circumstances are part of the fun and easy to forgive. Would that its sexism had been portrayed as equally implausible and outrageous....still, for solid performances and reliable laughs in a romantic comedy, Love Actually actually can't be beat."
"Sharonacles","Null","0","1","11 December 2003"," Love Actually actually is great.
","This is the best movie I've seen in a long time and I really do think it captures all the different aspects of love (familial love, ending love, beginning love, sexual love, love spanning cultures just to name a few). Each of these are represented through mini-stories that focus on a handful of characters which are all inter-woven/inter-related. The movie doesn't focus too much on any one character but swaps around successfully between about 10 or so important characters. All of the characters are pretty charming and quirky. There are some very ""cute"" moments in the movie and I'm sure it will make you laugh at least a few times. It can also be very sad, the beginning is particularly touching and heartfelt. However, be forewarned the movie contains some nudity and isn't shy about making light of it. There are a few scenes with porn stand-ins in particular. The soundtrack too is really effective at expressing the emotion of the movie (PLUS the scene with Hugh Grant dancing is hilarious). Overall I can see how this could be labeled (wrongly) as a ""chick flick"", but I think it's a really great and worthwhile movie for anyone who is romantic at heart."

","The opening solo of `Moulin Rouge' made the comment, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.' In `Love Actually' we get the same feel, except with combination of romantic, friendship, and familial love. It works remarkably well! `Love Actually' was written by Richard Curtis, who brought us `Notting Hill' and `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Curtis has a knack for showing the realities behind love that is not as sugar coated as the common Hollywood melodrama.<br/><br/>	Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister of Britain. He opens the film with a narration on the greatness of love. We get that impression as we follow all the characters as they struggle to accept the difficulties that come with love. No one just gets up one day and automatically finds that perfect someone. Sometimes, that perfect person is someone we cannot have. For instance, the character Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with his best friend's wife, Juliet (Keira Knightley). In one scene, he goes to his friend's house, knowing that Juliet will answer the door. He signals for her to keep quiet, and he plays Christmas carols from a radio to sound like carolers. He then holds up poster boards in which he writes how much he loves her. She is flattered by it, but they both know that this will be the only time that such affections can ever be shown. It is one of conundrums of love-more often than not, it is kept a secret inside that person's heart when they want to tell the world. The scene is easily the film's most charming moment.  	Another hard fact that `Love Actually' faces is adultery and the pains that it can cause spouses-not from sexual infidelity, but from the loss of love. This happens between the married characters of Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson). Harry is approached with the sexual interest of his secretary. Karen discovers the affair when she finds a gift that Harry plans to give to his secretary. Karen questions Harry as to what he would do if he found a gift that was meant for someone else that she loved, and approached the subject of splitting up. She says, `Would you stay, knowing that life would be a bit worse? Or would you cut and run?' 	One of the film's cuter tales follows the character Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Sam keeps a secret-he loves a girl at school who is leaving soon. When he finally reveals it to his father's chagrin, the two conceive plans to let the girl know that Sam loves her. It leads to some of the film's cutest moments that would make us all laugh at our own childhood escapades to get to the ones we are in love with. 	`Love Actually' is marvelous in its humor. There are quotes that would make us smile and those that would give us all a good belly laugh. The funniest moment in the film, seen in the trailer, occurs when Bill Nighy, who plays an old rock-star making a comeback, is interviewed on the radio. When he is questioned as to whom he has had the best sex with, his answer is `Britney Spears. No, only kidding, she was rubbish!' 	There is some rough language and a few scenes with nudity, but this is clearly a film for adults. In the end, `Love Actually' is a treat this holiday season and is easily the best romantic comedy of the year. ***1/2"

","Love Actually"" actually has the credentials to be judged as the supreme romantic comedy of the year. The film follows an ensemble of lovestruck characters in a five-week period before the Christmas holidays. It combines the ingenious character-filled interrelated subplots of ""Magnolia"" with the exhilarating joyous connotations of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". Moreover, the irony of the situation is that too much love actually leads to 4 weddings and in some cases can lead to an unexpected funeral in an unexplained magnolia occurrence. Screenwriter Richard Curtis' freshman directorial effort deserves a Curtis curtain call. Ok! Let's go back to our cupid players. Hugh Grant grants us another superb bland performance as the crafty Prime Minister who falls for one of his assistants. Alan Rickman, the famous ""Die Hard"" villain Hans Gruber, executes a towering performance as the editor who is tempted to an infidel act by his sexually obsessed secretary. Emma Thompson was also wonderful here as Rickman's endearing wife. Colin Firth, of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" fame, was ""write"" on as a secluded writer who falls for his Portuguese aide. Liam Neeson's performance as a widowed stepfather who strongly bonds with his 10 year old stepson is in my ""Meezer's List"" as one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, I am not saying ""nighty nighty"" yet to the superb acting of ""Love Actually"" because I must commend Bill Nighy's work as an aging musician who executes the scene-stealing performances of the film. ""Love Actually"" is a cinematic classic film act to act. You actually have to see this one! ***** Excellent"

","Well yes, it was heart-warming, made you feel those tingles... like those christmas films supposedly should, but you all know, deep-down inside, that that counts for nothing in terms of a good film. But this is where britain always falls down, so interested in having something bigger and better than those yanks. Having a film which can be advertised purely on how many big names are in it is ominous from the outset.  What about the plot? the character development? the intricacies which Curtis tries to envelop us into just don't work for me. I'm not saying I hated it inconsolably, I probably could watch it again, it was ok for a film.  However, in true british style, i'm afraid i'm going to be cynical and nit-pick. There was no substance, no real dimensions to it, the only thing that held me to actually caring about the characters was hoping to see colin firth get wet again, or maybe just to see hugh grant get just a little bit naked.  It was like watching a documentary on love, or the Christmas spirit, it just didn't appeal to me as something which could contend in the film world. And as for the soundtrack - since when did films become about having songs which threaten diminishing the actual film and becoming better known/liked? I'll agree that the soundtrack is good,very good, but I'm finding myself more inclined to spend money on that than on the film, which should just never happen.<br/><br/>But, having said that, I probably have been too harsh - it was a funny film, heart-warmingly so. I even got those tingles more than once, I even wanted to sit there and burst into tears/song, i never quite knew which one. I would recommend this if you just want a film you can sit down to with your friends or your partner, if you want that kind of Christmas film that will make you want to spread the love...but if, like me, you're more of a cynical at heart, then pleeease, just rent out It's a Winderful Life, which isn't happy and merry, I find it deeply dark, or go and see Dead End, a much better movie for christmas!"

Especially when Jamie proposed to Aurelia in her language and she accepted in English. I thought the writer/director did a very good job of tying all the characters together.

"smithr55","10","0","1","7 December 2003"," Well balanced subtlety and honesty
","** Mild Spoilers **<br/><br/>By far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The plot, if not incredibly in depth, never bogs down, and keeps you continually engaged in each character's life.   I found myself several times just as one event was concluding, wondering what was happening in another's character's life, only to be taken right to them moments later.<br/><br/>Special appreciation to the wonderfully done relationship between Daniel and Sam, and Aurelia and Jamie.<br/><br/>Two themes I've found in people nay-saying the movie:  political/social commentary and nudity.<br/><br/>We must not forget that film makers and writers have the privilege in the free world to comment however they wish on the choices those in the political arena make, just as they do social trends.  The right to question and examine these things is what makes movies independent art and not just propaganda.  More specifically, the Prime Minister-U.S. President relationship issue in the movie may be a chance for Americans to get a very real look at how those on the other side of the Atlantic view the single man ""chosen"" to represent all of us.  You don't have to agree with it, but don't close yourself to its possibilities.<br/><br/>As far as nudity, aside from the fact that there are a few scenes with frontal exposure, I've most definitely seen more sexually aggressive subject matter in prime time network T.V.  While perhaps superfluous, it was in no way pornographic, as reviewers and critics have lamented.  And don't forget - we now have a rating system that tells you point blank if there is nudity. The doe-eyed parent has no grounds to cry foul over an unexpected nude scene.<br/><br/>It is absolutely the most engaging movie about all the various incarnations of love I have ever seen.  It was heartwarming, real, and a real affirmation that good movies can still be made in our era of plot-less sequels and fanatical jingoism."

Curtis has carefully calculated everything or not, undoubtedly it's a 100% ""money collecting"" commercial movie, one ticket for 10 love stories played by so many world-renowned actors, what do you ask more for?<br/><br/>Good stuff for Christmas especially when so many Brit soldiers are still in Iraq.  Hugh Grant's words to BB Thornton, ""We may be a small country but a great one."" are truly the thought of most Brits in unity to both Tony Blair and GW Bush!  More love stories, more and more to the Brit troops.  At this time of the year, they need over-sweetened nectar plus positive messages like, ""Love actually is all around (you and I).""<br/><br/>What a huge tank of top-notch actors not only from the UK, but also portuguese speaking countries like Portugal (Lúcia Moniz) and Brazil (Rodrigo Santoro), USA (Laura Linney) and astronomical-figured German model. Amongst all the male actors, Santoro should be the sexiest even without taking his clothes off, the Latin virility is filling the air... hmm... unforgettable.  Colin Firth's part can be cut away, it's not really attached to the main line.  Why such a development?  Poor Firth, he has to struggle with the Portuguese.  Actually this language is not for the mouth development of the Brits.  Perhaps Curtis finds that Firth's wife is an Italian, and Italian is so similar to Portuguese so he think this tall guy should be the one for Jamie because he listens to the language everyday at home!<br/><br/>I don't exactly remember many of the actresses in the film but Laura Linney for her episode should be the one of the greatest love amongst all the subplots.  I gather that nowadays not many sisters would sacrifice her time, love, even career to take care of a mentally-challenged brother.<br/><br/>Curtis can make lots of sequels:<br/><br/>1) Alan Rickman should give a clear account of his dubious office affair with his secretary.  E Thompson is seeing him at the airport with the children and so what? (Another Kramer vs Kramer)<br/><br/>2) How about Linney and Santoro?  Many possibilities.  Married? Living together and taking care of Michael?  Killed Michael (so it can turn to be a thriller)?<br/><br/>3) Neeson and Schiffer's new life.<br/><br/>4) See 3) N and S's boys' come-of-age movie<br/><br/>5) Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln triangular relationship, add some racial elements... (clash of civilization)<br/><br/>Good discovery of the kid-actor Thomas Sangster, the never-met-before cousin of H Grant (an unimaginably enormously big family the Grants and Sangsters have, I believe).

","To to a brief summary, this has been one of the more uplifting, witty and ""feel good"" films that I've seen this year, if not the most.  A combination of solid writing and an incredible cast makes this worth the watch for those who are not completely cynical on the concept of love.<br/><br/>The overall plot follows the life of several couples or wannabe couples, and an aging rock star who could care less about ""Christmas spirit"" or a quality record. It's all about making a quick buck and a quicker comeback.  That particular subplot is hilarious due to ""Billy Mack's"" blatant and unrestrained candor that his newest ""hit single"" is utter garbage.<br/><br/>The other plots each have their own charming moments, though my personal favorites had to do with Hugh Grant's, Liam Neeson's, and Colin Firth's subplots.  In my opinion, those were the more charming and fun of the stories.  But each story each had their own little moments, never really focusing too heavily on anything negative, and everything (generally with the exception of one or two) came to their own little happy ending.  This was carefully designed as a ""feel good"" movie, and it does its job very well.  And fortunately, the movie never drags or lingers in pacing, making the overall experience a satisfying one.  And very, very funny.<br/><br/>The acting is remarkable.  It's amazing that this film would be able to have an ensemble cast of this size and caliber, and be able to utilize them as properly as they were.  The writing is clever and witty, with realistic sounding dialogue, and a nice ""bookcase"" feeling for the beginning and end. The subplot of Colin Frissell is by far the most far-fetched and unrealistic of the stories, but it's genuinely funny because it is so unbelievable. The soundtrack is light and pop music filled, and even helps the story along at points, instead of blaring for you to buy the soundtrack for a ""5 minute career Top 40"" artist.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, this film is designed purely to cheer the audience up, and to cheer on the concept that love can happen for anyone in some form. It plays heavily on the ""happy"" factor without delving into sickly-sweet sap that you just can't take.  All this, and an eccentric cameo by Rowan Atkinson.<br/><br/>It's nice to see a film like this that relies more on well-written humor and solid acting than what a lot of films have been missing lately.  I really couldn't get enough of this film, and I look forward to its eventual DVD release.<br/><br/>Recommended if you just want to spend 2 1/2 hours having a movie cheer you up."

It's message, spoken over the title credits by Hugh Grant, is probably true: love is ubiquitous.  The device of using the arrivals gate at Heathrow to drive home this fact is at once kitschy and poignant.  There are so many odes to hate, violence, war, and conflict in movies that this clever, fun, and upbeat movie will find difficulty gaining footing in a desolate filmscape.<br/><br/>It is a challenge to review this movie because so many aspects of love are explored.  Unrequited love.  Love's first bloom.  Love on the rocks.  Love ended prematurely.  Fraternal love.  Love's sacrifice.  Love bridging language.  Love bridging class. Ugly duckling finds love.  They don't all work, but most do.  And in many there is a rich and economically communicated subtext about how these people succeed in love.<br/><br/>Things that work especially well:  Laura Linney caring for her mentally ill brother.  Bill Nighy's irreverent, unapologetic rock-and-roller.  Emma Thompson and Allan Rickman's brinksmanship with adultery.  The hurtfulness of the Martine McCutcheon chubby jokes.<br/><br/>Things that don't work:  Rowan Atkinson (not here, not like this).  Billy Bob's wooden, implausible American President.  Denise Richards (waste). Hugh Grant's trite rebuff of the US.  Rodrigo Santoro saying virtually nothing to stir love in anybody.<br/><br/>Love can be painful, limiting, paralyzing--and it is in this film--but every character in it doggedly pursues it anyway.

Even the most crafted of directors, namely Robert Altman, has had more failures with this practice (Cookie's Fortune, Pret-a-Porter) than successes. <br/><br/>
With film history not exactly on its side, it is even more incredible that Love Actually, works, and works rather well.  Writer/Director Richard Curtis, known for such romantic flicks as Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, assembled as many hip British actors as the marquee would allow including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Liam Neeson,  and threw them into a comedic script that is cut into so many segments, that a small review cannot possibly cover.<br/><br/>
What Curtis does that is so refreshing is that he never stays on one storyline more than 10 minutes (which is actually quite back and forth considering the 130+ minutes running time), yet he never leaves us with a serial cliffhanger as he moves from character to character.  Each segment gives us enough of each story without over saturating us with a specific plot development.  And the surprising part is how well it works.<br/><br/>Actually, the only thing that doesn't fit are the American actors and their contributions to the mix.  Billy Bob Thornton plays the President of the United States that is awkwardly caught trying to seduce the English Prime Ministers intern and Laura Linney plays a down on her luck workaholic that spends more time tending to her sick brother than dealing with her emotional needs.  The President sub-plot was too forced as if Curtis was trying to use his soapbox to make a post 9/11 political statement, and Laura Linney's woes just take from the joyfulness of the overall film.  A Curtis favorite, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) is given a moment that should also have seen the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>However, when all is said and done and the stories all come together and intersect like a loosely wound Tarantino movie, you notice that the two plus hours have been more than enjoyable and that your cheeks are sore from grinning so much.  So, Love Actually is the 2003 Serendipity of the holiday season, a good date movie that at least gives you your money's worth."

","This film was a real surprise for someone who really isn't in to the rom-com, sappy-happy gook that i expected this to be. Richard Curtis is a fine director although his portrayal of England, particularly London is a bit far-fetched at times verging on an almost fairy tale representation.<br/><br/>
However it is not the location that matters with this film but the stories and the complexities that surround them. They are issues that on the whole we can at one time in our life relate to, even if some seem at times comical in parallel to reality, most notably the body double porn stars and the almost remarkable advanced intellect of Liam Neesons' young stepson. I'll pretend that the chance of the British Prime minister falling in love with his tea lady is plausible for the purpose of my argument!<br/><br/>Love actually succeeds in the comedy department too. Some brilliant turns are put in by Grant and the show stealing Bill Nighy. It is undeniable that this film is fluffy to say the least but does make a welcome change from some of the recent American films that seem worthless and unjustified- ""Cabin Fever"" springs to mind.<br/><br/>Love actually should be seen by those who intend to leave the cinema feeling good about life, true the feeling may not last long but i bet it's better than the feeling you get after watching ""Cat in the Hat"", can't wait for that one!"

","First, the good parts of this movie: there is some humor and some charming and endearing scenes as are promised in the trailer which enticed me to go and see this kind of film that I would typically not see in the first place. In addition, there are a bevy of very fine actors. Unfortunately, that is about where the qualities of this film end.<br/><br/>While the concept is fun (SPOILERS), various characters and there attempts at romance that in the end somehow are all interconnected, there is simply too much going on for any of these very fine actors to do much with the roles they are given. Half of the roles could have been eliminated and the picture would have been far more tightly bound and perhaps even given the audience to learn the characters names before you see them naked. The result of having so many separate plot elements is a rather disjointed plot with some characters that I would like to know more about and other that I wish would not reappear. Colin Firth's character and Laura Linney's role were two that I wish would have been developed further whereas the washed up rock star and lust driven young Brit (do we ever even learn his name?) could and should have been dropped entirely. As ever, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are brilliant.<br/><br/>However, I could forgive this if it weren't for the over the top cultural subversiveness that I detected in the movie. I found the depiction of the American President to be a sick cariacature of a lust-maddened Clinton with a power-mad Bush that the upstanding Brit PM must counter. Praytell, why was this necessary? That scene smacked of a political agenda so blatantly obvious that one must be dense not to see it. The inclusion of the porno actors who meet and fall in love was a cute plot (though not at all needed in the movie) that could have been much less gratuitously in some other situation. Did we really need to see Just Judy's teats or her fellatio simulation? How did that add to the drama of two people, total strangers, falling in love at Chrismas time? Was it absolutely critical to include not only miscegenation in almost punishingly over the top (three cases, or about half of the couples) but two blatant homosexual situations as well? Why was it relevant to have Laura Linney get half naked when the builiding up to passionate love scene interrupted by her cell phone would have been much more effective?  Is this really a movie about love or about what Hollywood would have us believe is normal?<br/><br/>Must a Christmas movie be so rife with nudity, profanity and vulgarity? Must their be a homosexual reference to everything? I saw this film with my mother in the hopes that it would be an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. Instead, I found myself reaching for watch to check the time and wishing that it would end and sinking deeper and deeper into my chair."

","Richard Curtis is now my writing hero.  The film was touching, frank, sweet, and daring all at the same time.  Daring, you ask.  Who else would have the courage to make the sweetest, most innocent love story the one between the two nude stand-ins?   Who else would have the courage to open the film with a voice over that pondered the cell phone calls from the September 11 aircraft passengers, and suggested that surely none of them were calling with messages of hate, but of love?   That took guts, friends...<br/><br/>Although the film has its share of casual profanity (no more so than passes between friends in many walks of life) and the aforementioned nudity, ""Love, Actually"" is the antidote to real garbage like ""Kill Bill"" (with its lovingly crafted scenes of graphic brutality, rapes of coma victims, and the murder of a mother in front of her child).<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.

","Way ahead of it's time......and why is that?<br/><br/>Frankly, nobody wants pure love like this in the world right now; we all revolve around our misery and what we think is 'real' and relatable to our society.  Which is a sad fact because that's what this movie tries to point out, and contrast with lives that DO go through the struggle of love in a world like ours today.  It seems that that's all there is in the media today as well: sex, violence, and dissapointment.  Why not fight back with what we should be living for?<br/><br/>That's exactly what this movie stands for.  Unfortunately I don't believe everyone out there totally accepts its message, which is why it's really sad how many reviews on this movie are bad or tear it apart.  Viewers generally like to disect movies like this for all they're worth, and even afterwards overlook their solid structures, not wanting to accept their messages as ""good material"".  So what did I think of this movie?<br/><br/>Absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>I know I'm not the only one out there sick of all the material we get thrown in today's entertainment and media, I'm tired of all the pretty faces and booty-shaking and perfect endings and shoot-em-ups too.  ""Love Actually"" leaves you happy and dissapointed and embarassed and grateful at the same time, because isn't that what love always leaves you with?  I'm sure everyone's felt every end of the emotional spectrum in the name of love, which is why it's such an incredibly difficult genre to depict, espetially in the context of a film.<br/><br/>That's where ""Love Actually"" comes in and gives us every pick of the crop. Every story from the flirty secretary and her co-worker who's hopelessly in love with another co-worker who's boss is having marital problems with his wife who's brother is the prime minister also with love problems and her friend who just lost his wife and his step-son's depressed with having a crush on the most popular girl in school etc. etc. etc......<br/><br/>Confusing?  Not at all; after a while into the movie you're wondering just how all this CAN'T be confusing.  ""Love Actually"" is so perfectly pieced together, that if done in any other way it would spell disaster.  And you can't get any more real with love that by showing all the dissapointments and rewards that such a simple, four-letter word can bring.<br/><br/>
AND this movie is funny; with just the right mix of humor in the midst of it all (everyone gave genuine roars and laughs in the audience I was in, and I just about died during the scenes of the stand-in couple).<br/><br/>
Oh, and about the American-bashing....I totally agreed with it.  We are the bully country after all, driven way to constantly by the lure of sex and power.  Our morals are sad today and rotting away our core.  ""Love Actually"" is the most perfect counter to our social corruption.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND BE HAPPY FOR ONCE without feeling like you should go home wanting to kill your neighbor, bang a ton of hot girls, drive around recklessly in fast cars, blow up things, steal things, or tear your eyes out of their sockets for all the terrible things in the entertainment industry today.<br/><br/>""Love Actually"" gets a 10 from me."

The theme that love is all around is treated in a humorous and adult fashion that most people over the age of 16 can relate to.  The film has whimsy, pathos, mild erotica and some old fashion romance.  If you have ever been in any of the situations as portrayed in the film then you will come away from this film with some memories that have been once again re-energized.<br/><br/>More than the stories is the spectrum of British and American talent on the screen.  It is really hard to beat Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Alan Rickmann.  The performance of the Portuguese maid to Colin Firth's writer's role was winsome and very authentic.<br/><br/>If you do not leave the cinema with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye then you might want to contemplate a monastic existence."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","3","1 December 2003"," A palpable success, actually
","The film opens with the recording of a cynical repackaging of the old hit single ""Love Is All Around"" by an aging rocker who aims to hit the populist Christmas market and critics have suggested that essentially ""Love Actually"" is a manipulative reworking of earlier Richard Curtis scripts designed to pull in cinemagoers in the run-up to Christmas. <br/><br/>It certainly is - but it is rather more. The evidence of the crowds at my multiplex is that Curtis has succeeded handsomely in his directorial debut and created a natural feel-good alternative to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for television viewing at endless future yuletides.<br/><br/>OK, so this is moviemaking by the numbers, but they are some numbers. A multi-stranded storyline gives us nine different looks at love, most of them sweet to the point of saccharine, but the whole thing is saved from excessive sentimentality by a couple of harder-edged scenarios, one topical political scene, and a cracking script with lashings of humour.<br/><br/>
The whole thing lacks focus and a clear narrative form, but few viewers will bother. They'll be too occupied laughing at the gags and spotting all the stars.<br/><br/>The cast is one to die for. We have the best of British - from Hugh Grant as the affable Prime Minister to Rowan Atkinson as the bumbling shop assistant, with the highlights being Bill Nighy as the over the hill and over the top rock star and Emma Thompson as someone who can express pain equally as well as laughter. These 'Brits as imagined by Yanks' only exist in Curtis's dream world but we cannot help but warm to them. <br/><br/>On top of these dozen or so skilful performances, we have several surprise guest appearances by Americans, a German super model, and a delightful Portuguese ingenue. Throw in tourist scenes of London and a lively soundtrack and you have all the ingredients for a runaway success."

","With a movie name like ""Love Actually"", you can just tell people are going to be instantly put off. All we do these days is get subjected to fairly unintelligent love films that are aimed entirely at getting our money. And then, we have those ""in-between"" movies, that we like to call ""romantic comedies"", an attempt at not taking love too seriously, but usually ending up so pathetic it's just as bad anyway. So when it comes to Love Actually, it's depressing when I realise that, as a male, I had to ask a friend of mine to pretend to be my girlfriend so that I didn't look too dodgy wanting to see a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>What's even more depressing is that I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Hugh Grant's ever-so-familiar voice explaining to us that no matter how corrupt the world is, love is still such a strong emotion. I started regretting seeing the movie at this point, but before any of you walk out, I can safely tell you that the movie is not as warm and fuzzy as it's introduction makes out.<br/><br/>We then get to meet some of the characters, including the newly wedded couple Juliet and Peter (and his seemingly insecure friend, Mark), Sam and Daniel (a fantastic father/son relationship that will make you end up wishing your dad had been as caring) and my personal favourite, John (Martin Freeman of Office fame) and Judy, two porn movie shoe-ins. And then of course, Bill Nighy manages to tie the whole movie into a nice little present, just in time for Christmas.<br/><br/>Character development was lacking a bit, but it just managed to be enough for you to care about them. The dialogue's great, with some fairly witty things thrown into the equation. It has the perfect balance of comedy and romance to actually be able to be defined as a decent romantic comedy.<br/><br/>It's always great to see a good British movie, and especially when it manages to be a good romantic comedy. All in all, it's a nice, upbeat movie (which after Terminator 3 and the Matrix movies, is exactly what we need) to define this year's Christmas. You'd do a lot worse than going to see it.

","Having scanned over 60 or so user comments, I find it odd that I appeared to view this movie very differently from most people.<br/><br/>It's not a typical romantic comedy, but obviously borrows heavily from the genre in terms of feel and what several have termed ""cliches"".  It self-conciously borrows those cliches and jokes about them more than once. <br/><br/>
Several people have complained of shallowness and lightness.  Most romantic comedies focus deeply on one, occasionally two couples.  We watch a long progression of their relationship and the various obstacles they encounter. Sometimes it's done well, but it's been done to death.  I sometimes wonder if Meg Ryan doesn't have someone in a backroom photocopying scripts and changing the names around.<br/><br/>This movie pulled the camera way back to look at a ""sample"" of love. There's no time for drawn out development of each picture, but we see all the elements spread out over the whole set.  Not every love story in life is a tragedy and not every one a fairy tale, but you can bet all the possibilities occur in life.  I found this refreshing compared to the standard fare and loved it throughout, although there were some weak patches in there.<br/><br/>*** VERY, VERY MINOR SPOILER ***<br/><br/>Lots of people are complaining about how some of the stories (particularly the naked couple) are too silly, or insignificant or not funny.  They were jokes.  A whole sub-story.  One joke.  Bloody brilliant.  A bit expensive in terms of screen time, but I loved them.<br/><br/>Finally, the thing that struck me very early in the film was that most of the stories were about situations where there is clearly some workplace relationship or difference in power that throws some uncertainty and tension into the situation.  In today's society, we're very worried about sexual harrassment in the workplace, and rightly so, but there's no doubt that the resulting restraints are probably killing some healthy romances that might flourish if people were a bit more relaxed and open.  I think Curtis was pointing this out (the naked couple is hilarious to me as the uttermost extreme) and suggesting that love needs to be given a chance, even if there's some risk.    Would you talk to your boss about love?  Your kid? The person who sits at the next desk?  Maybe you should.  I saw this as one of the main messages of the film.  Evidently I'm alone. :)<br/><br/>*** NO SPOILER FROM HERE ***<br/><br/>Looking for depth?  Try breadth instead, it can be quite as interesting. Looking for messages?  Explore the connections between the stories, rather than the stories themselves.  It wasn't perfect, but I loved it."

","This is the definitive romance film and its not just about one couple but about twelve! This film runs about 2 hours and 10 minutes and it crams a lot of characters and events into that span of time. Emma Thompson is Karen and she is married to Harry (Alan Rickman) and things seem to be fine but she notices the obvious flirting between him and his secretary. Things get worse when she finds out that he bought an expensive piece of jewelry for her. Liam Neeson plays a recently widowed man named Daniel and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) is in love with an American girl at school and together they try and figure out how he can get her to notice him. Hugh Grant is The Prime Minister and on his first day in office he meets Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) who works for him and he is attracted to her. We watch an aging rock star named Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who has put out a bad Christmas CD and he has come to realize that he has no one in his life after all these years. Harry works with Sarah (Laura Linney) who is in love with  Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is too shy to tell him. Colin Firth is a writer named Jamie and he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) but there is a language barrier keeping them from communicating they're feelings. A young bride named Juliet (Keira Knightley) finds out that her husbands best friend has been secretly in love with her since the beginning and she is stunned. A young man named Colin (Kris Marshall) can't find a girl and thinks that its because they're British so he decides to travel to Wisconsin where he can find an American girl.<br/><br/>
This film is directed by Richard Curtis who is the great writer of such films as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as ""Notting Hill"". Romantic stories are his forte and he possesses a real knack for creating romantic scenarios for characters. This is the first time Curtis has directed a film and he manages to juggle a plethora of events and characters and he does pull it off for the most part. Some of the stories work better than others like the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman crisis and Bill Nighy practically steals the film as an aging rock star. Hugh Grant also fairs pretty well as The Prime Minister in love and he seems to be cut out of the same mold as Cary Grant. Others don't come off very well and I think Kris Marshall as Colin going to Wisconsin is totally ridiculous and contrived. Nothing seems to come of Linney and her infatuation with a co-worker. It was never resolved and just seems to fade away without any closure. But this is a genuinely charming film and has so many romantic moments in them that I'm sure any viewer can find one or two that work best for them."

But somehow, the movie works. It somehow made me turn my cynicism off and buy into its many implausible moments, and ultimately really touched me.

","I have to say, I've never been too happy about British humor, I've always been more fond of the American humor. This movie has turned it around; while not always being laugh-out-loud funny, it is persistently funny, throughout pretty much the entire thing. I can't say I was bored at any point in the movie; even when it isn't funny, it isn't boring. And this is definitely the best movie I've ever seen about love. At the beginning, a lot of the characters are alone and lonely. At the end, most of them are with their love, having found the 'one and only'. I enjoyed every aspect of this movie, Hugh Grant being his typical British charming self, Keira Knightley being her adorable sweet self, even Rowan Atkinson's small, yet funny character amused me. This is not only for couples, or people who have found true love. It is most likely enjoyable, at least a little, to everyone. Whether you like British humor, wonderful music, or romance, you won't be disappointed. This movie has all three, and plenty of each. This is for anybody who likes funny movies, romance, and isn't too easily offended. 10/10"

","Having had galloping indigestion all afternoon, teen problems and TTOTM I really wasn't in the mood for much. I had seen so many bits of the movie I didn't think there would be much left to see!!<br/><br/>As the well-known British advert says ""It does exactly what it says on the tin"". It's labelled Romantic Comedy and it is. It is also sentimental and a fairystory. In CurtisLand everybody is gorgeous (allowing for token fatties, quaint old folk and a disablement of some kind). London shines and twinkles (it doesn't) and every scene sparkles. This is the land where all problems are solved or summed up with a witty one-liner.<br/><br/>But hey, this is the movies so why not?<br/><br/>The story line was complex and I could have done with a couple less threads. You found yourself wanting to see more of one story and then another popped up just as you were getting all involved with another one.<br/><br/>The Keira Knightley didn't seem to amount to much and Kris Marshall just played the same brainless idiot that he plays in the British sitcom My Family.<br/><br/>The Laura Linney story just faded away too and although the porn stand-in couple were cute I thought they took up too much time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Colin Firth story especially the sub-titles and of course once you had accepted Hugh Grant as Prime Minister(!!) well, Hugh was just Hugh and although not a HG fan he does what he does so well and he gave me some of the biggest laughs.<br/><br/>Through all this the wonderful Bill Nighy popped up regularly like a naughty deed in a good world and stole the film.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's story brought a bit of well deserved depth to all the fluff but sadly there was no time for their development and I was left wanting to see more of that story (and not just for the obvious reasons!!) Emma T is, I think, one of the finest actresses of her generation and brings a special quality to all her parts. Alan was great too, I especially like the scenes with Laura Linney and the Selfridge one with Rowan Atkinson which I hadn't been (or should I say Bean?) looking forward to!!<br/><br/>Well, if you can suspend your disbelief there is something for everybody to relate to in there. For me, it was the AR/ET storyline, thankfully not given a tidy ending as there are no tidy endings in real-life. The other scene strangely enough was the Laura Linney character dancing with Karl summing up that wonderful feeling you get when you finally get your hands on a crush!!LOL<br/><br/>Well, when all's said and done I left the cinema happier than when I went in and that's got to be worth the ticket money for any film!!"

"psi_fla","Null","0","2","27 November 2003"," It's quite good, actually
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Well, we've arrived at one of the season's most-awaited films  Richard Curtis's directorial debut, Love Actually. Like many, I hold Curtis's written work in very high regard, especially the likes of Blackadder, Four Weddings & a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary.<br/><br/>So the thought of seeing a film both written and directed by him is bound to cheer up his fans. But Love Actually has more going for it than that, like a star-studded British cast and the Christmassy setting. I remember how Notting Hill pleased many of us in the summer some four years ago, so what will stop Love Actually doing the same at Christmas? On this evidence, absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The film has not one, but at least NINE significant plotlines. That tells you this film is obviously going to be an ensemble piece. And what an ensemble there is. <br/><br/>We have the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with a tea lady (Martine McCutcheon). Then we see Colin Firth as an author who falls for his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz), Liam Neeson as a widower looking for more love while helping his son (Thomas Sangster) to cope with a schoolboy crush, and Alan Rickman neglecting his wife (Emma Thompson) in favour of flirting with a younger woman. <br/><br/>And that's not all. Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is hopelessly smitten with Juliette (Keira Knightley), the new wife of his best friend (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  Colin (Kris Marshall) is looking for women in America. Love could be blossoming for two porn stars (Martin Freeman & Joanna Page) & two office workers (Laura Linney & Rodrigo Santoro). And, last but not least, ageing rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) has an unorthodox way of attempting to top the charts. Love is definitely all around.<br/><br/>Cynics have already attacked the film. Yes, some of the subplots in Love Actually are a little too incredulous. Yes, it has no substance, no real plot and is more sentimental than Curtis's previous offerings. But haven't critics seen enough Richard Curtis films to realise that journeys into ""Curtisland"", as we call them, are meant to take you away from reality? We want Love Actually to be funny and sometimes moving, and that is precisely what it is. At not one point were my eyes diverted away from the screen, which is probably the best compliment you can give to this kind of film. The detractors can talk about the excessive sentimentality all they like. Frankly, if Curtis's formula isn't broken in any way, why should he modify it?<br/><br/>The stories may be simple, but the plotting isn't. Rather, the plotting is a little too ambitious. There are few  if any  real characters to be found. Here's an example: at the beginning, instead of watching Juliette, we feel more like we're watching Keira Knightley in a wedding dress. Knightley, like many, doesn't have much to do, for she is merely the object of Andrew Lincoln's affection. Speaking of Lincoln, I didn't see a lot of difference between his Mark and Teachers' Simon. But that sums up the cast in general. The unknowns are more credible in their roles because we are not distracted by star recognition. I mean, who won't see a little of My Family's Nick in Kris Marshall's Colin? Or a bit of Martin Freeman's alter ego from The Office in his character? I think you get the message. Even Hugh Grant is pretty much being himself as the PM (although he is careful not to tread too far towards his About a Boy persona). Still, him and Billy Bob Thornton, who plays the US President, are great fun to watch, and Martine McCutcheon is convincing in her film debut (mind you, she's been around for so long that you forget that's the case). The only real character, however, belongs to Bill Nighy, and he is hilarious in his role. Everyone else just plays themselves, looking like they're having a ball. <br/><br/>Just like Richard Curtis. He has taken few risks, adopting a laid back approach and letting the actors enjoy themselves. As a result, instead of coming up with the ultimate romantic comedy, as the ads have trumpeted, he has made what is purely a solidly entertaining diversion. But the film will be a success. To cover such a large ensemble in 2 ¼ hours was overambitious, and it shows (in this respect I was reminded of Gosford Park), but Curtis has still done enough to make his audience feel happy. And that's exactly what you want from a romantic comedy, isn't it?"

","""Four Weddings,"" ""Notting Hill,"" ""Bridget Jones."" Is there anything else comic writer extraordinaire Richard Curtis has yet to accomplish? Well I suppose I could try directing. Seems like the thing to do. For his fourth, and ultimately most important Brit comedy, he treads on the directing techniques that have made people like Robert Altman and Woody Allen infamous, and tries to unravel the riddle that plagues millions everyday: Love. <br/><br/>""Love"" follows nineteen people living in and around London. We join them in the run up to Christmas (December, not mid-October), and all are at a crossroads in life, seeking their next step. However, before they can, the jolly, holly holiday proves that even falling for your tea lady doesn't mean all hugs and kisses, and as Santa gets closer, every one of them begins to wonder whether love actually is all around.<br/><br/>So confident in this multi-layered, multi-characterised and self-penned premise, that Curtis decided that this would be his directorial debut. Even star Colin Firth was nervous for him when he announced he would be directing. Nevertheless, he discounts any such pressure by making this a rather impressive debut. Intelligently opting for an effective, rather than mesmerising direction allows Curtis to pay more attention to his script, than try to win plaudits for making the film look stunning, and could ill-afford to be over-ambitious on the flair front. With so many stories intertwining and running parallel to one another, it looked on paper, enormously problematic, but with his typical wit and heart, Curtis manages to orchestrate the bulk with surprising assurance and ease. However, there are those stories that unfortunately do not work because of this: Kris Marshall's `life-defining' trip to the States seems rushed; Linney's brother sub-plot is annoying, and tramples on an encouraging story with her and dreamboat Karl; and the love triangle involving Knightley lacks bite and real emotion. Nevertheless, the daring of the plot is not hindered, and the film does not suffer too much.<br/><br/>It's the truly exceptional cast though who really make the film dazzle. Grant steals the film, his boyish charisma and impeccable comic timing as good as ever. In addition, Firth's typical magnetism is a delight; Nighy is hilarious as an aging rocker, and old timers Neeson, Thompson and Rickman are as accomplished as you would expect. In addition, Linney and Knightley are as luminous as ever, and Atkinson's magnificent cameo is the film's funniest moment. Even more surprising is the debuts of McCutcheon and young Thomas Sangster. Both look surprisingly assured and confident in their integral roles, and holding their own against the rest of this phenomenal cast.<br/><br/>At times during the film, Curtis' does overdo on the `sickly' side, and at times teases his audience into thinking this will be your stereotypical Christmas flick. But he restrains himself, and never lets the love flood the astuteness and intelligence of the story, and in tandem with his unfailing cast, execute a warm, cosy, hilarious and perfectly performed film, which if not a main present for everyone, must a least be a stocking filler. ****"
"ClaudeSchneider","9","0","2","25 November 2003"," Actually Lovely
","A wonderful British feel-great film, 9/10.<br/><br/>There are cynics who will label this film ""too sugary"" and unbelievable; and there are romantics who will love every second of this film, and come out brimming with warmth and happiness. Maybe it depends on your current situation (are you in love yourself?), or maybe it doesn't at all. As you will probably already know from posters/trailers, there are at least 9 couples/relationships in the film, and each relationship covers a different aspect of love. Many of these relationships appear to be based solely on desire (but how can you really build an impression of deep love with 9 relationships in 2 hours? And many relationships in real life ARE initiated by desire). My point: whatever your current situation, you'll find a character you can relate to.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't realise before seeing the film was how much of a Christmas film it is. There's nothing wrong with that - after all, Christmas is a time when people come together, and express their true feelings of love and friendship. ""Love Actually"" is a wonderful Christmas film, which I look forward to watching again and again each Christmas. Do see this film in the cinema now, as it probably won't have the same impact if you watch it a while after Christmas.<br/><br/>For lovers of British film and television, there are myriad well-known and loved UK actors to delight you (whether they have central roles or just cameo appearances) - I was pleasantly surprised to see Andrew Lincoln & Nina Sosanya from the UK TV Series ""Teachers"" taking good roles. I say pleasantly surprised, not only because I'm a fan of ""Teachers"", but also because Richard Curtis hasn't relied on big-name stars to fill every role - and that's a good thing. It's all well and good having great actors like Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson playing their part, but most viewers will be thinking of Emma Thompson playing a character, and not see just the character she's playing. It's also entertaining to see one or two of America's well-known stars making appearances in this film (Billy Bob Thornton, Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth) - I guess it just goes to show how much appeal Richard Curtis' films have (both for the audience and actors alike).<br/><br/>I'm surprised not to have seen more (or any?!) reviews mention one of my favourite films, ""Magnolia"", which also weaves together the lives of about 10 people, and their relationships with each other. There are many similarities between the two (the intricate interweaving of many people's lives and their relationships, loving and losing), but also many differences (Magnolia is a great American drama, which shows several aspects of life; Love Actually is a great British romantic comedy, which shows aspects of love, making us laugh and warming our hearts).<br/><br/>Love actually IS all around - it's your decision as to whether you choose to see it, seek it, feel it, and give it."

This makes the movie unbelievable, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>All the actors plays well, and most of the characters are believable.<br/><br/>I have noticed that other reviewers concentrate their energy on two things in the movie:The ""sex"" and the criticism of the American president.<br/><br/>As I live in Denmark (Europe) I am off course used to much more than this =0), and all though you see a girls breasts, it is very clear that no loving is actually happening.<br/><br/>As regards to ""the president"".. you had it coming Yankees! =0)<br/><br/>When i stepped out of the theater I had a good loving feeling, and wanted to hug someone.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 75 out of 100 and recommend it to: Everybody"

Some love-at-first-sight romance (Colin Firth), some young puppy love (Liam Neeson's character's son), a wedding (Keira Knightley), a best-man/best-friend who loves the bride, an almost affair (Emma Thompson), platonic love (character: Billy Mack), an unrealistic but hilarious bit about and English guy (character: Colin Frisell), who heads to America looking for sex/love, and a funny bit about two sex-doubles in meet on the set of a movie and get married shortly after, and a charming story about the prime-minister (Hugh Grant) who falls in love with his ""catering manager"". Personally I thought this was the best story and I wish there was more of it.  Martine McCutcheon was HOT and I got a bit annoyed that they kept referring to her as ""chubby"" in the movie.  Hugh Grant was great in this role.

It is actually nice to see a movie where America is the subject of the joke, after seeing so many US made war films, for example, where the British are only referred to in complete derrogatory terms.

","Further to my recent comment...<br/><br/>Describing a movie as ""fragmented"" is by no means a term of abuse. Life is fragmented and we are all loosely interconnected. No one can understand the complex, extraordinary, mundane, obsolete connections that there are in the world. <br/><br/>American Independent Cinema thrives on ambiguity; on keeping stories open ended; on not explaining everything; on discontinuity; and on fragmentation.<br/><br/>Wile I am by no means even suggesting Love Actually is independent (I'm sure we all know it's a colossal British picture marketed very wisely to certain demographics at this time of year), it shares some small similarities. Its skill may be in drawing in people outside those demographics as well.<br/><br/>Finally being a fan of certain actors is a fact of life, a common obsession. Yet cinema is not made up of its stars, but of its characters. It is the moments and the scenes that make up a film. And in seeing a film for a certain luscious actor detracts from the true essence of cinema. Furthermore in an ensemble film it is about all the actors, not just one."

Frankly, if you passionately loath Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones etc...then you probably shouldn't even bother turning up to the cinema.<br/><br/>Now this is said I must point out that, as someone who has mixed feelings about his films, I enjoyed this one more than I expected.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES<br/><br/>Obviously, it also had some moments where you wanted to throw things at the cinema screen.   For example, the airport scenes at the beginning and end are completely over the top (and might I say that the voiceover during this scene is basically stolen from Dogma).   The sections with the little kid are faintly annoying and there are probably too many stories competing for space so that whilst some are perfectly weighted (Andrew Lincoln, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Keira Knightley and Martin Freeman & Joanna Page), others could use more room to breathe (Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson) while others still maybe should either have been developed or cut completely (Laura Linney & Rodrigo Santorio) and the Kris Marshall section seems to have strolled in off a different film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, comparisons with It's A Wonderful Life are misguided (Frank Capra's film achieved its status as the most feelgood happy ending in film history by preceding the ending with two hours of some of the darkest, bleakest material ever to grace the screen and the multiple endings here do not have enough lows preceding them to anywhere near match up to this).<br/><br/>POSITIVES<br/><br/>All that said, there are a lot of strengths to this film.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy is exceptionally funny and, as is always is the way when he appears in anything, he is the best thing in it by a country mile although Hugh Grant & Colin Firth also put in fine (though admittedly hardly mould-breaking) performances.   Quite unusually, there is something of a political agenda in the film with regard to Hugh Grant and comments about his predecessor and there is something satisfyingly subversive about the fact that this mainstream entertainment takes an albeit subtle and foppishly charming stand against US Imperialism.<br/><br/>Andrew Lincoln's story of unrequited love is one of the most appealing sections on offer here whilst Martin Freeman & Joanna Page's section may be one-joke comedy but it is a funny joke and sustains its section well.<br/><br/>TO SUM UP THEN<br/><br/>So, basically when all's said and done, this is a funny, likable and entertaining film which probably won't change your life or your view of the cinema will keep you entertained for a couple of hours.   But then, this is a Working Title film by Richard Curtis, so you probably knew that already didn't you?"
"Darkest_Rose","7","0","2","24 November 2003"," Is Love Actually all around Us?
","I heard a lot of good things about this movie and since I'm a sucker for holiday films I decided to check it out for myself. The story revolves around several love stories and the movie goes back and forth to show what's going on with each character. There is the Prime Minister(Hugh Grant) who slowly starts falling in  love with his pretty maid Natalie(Martine McCutcheon). A married father and husband(Alan Rickman) who has a thing for his younger secretary Mia(Heike Hakatsch). A young man Mark(Andrew Lincoln) who has always liked his best friend's wife Juliet(Keira Knightley) but has always been afraid to tell her how he really feels about her. A young boy Sam(Thomas Sangster) tries to win the heart of his classmate Joanna(Olivia Olson) with the help of his father(Liam Neeson). A young rather unattractive man(Kris Marshall) is sick of snobby British gals and decides to go to America to find the right girl for him. A lonely woman named Sarah(Laura Linney) who has always had a thing for her sexy coworker Karl(Rodrigo Santoro). An old drugged out rocker(Bill Nigghy) who realizes that his fat manager is the only real friend he has ever had. A man(Colin Firth) working on a novel in his cabin in the middle of nowhere falls in love with his foreign caretaker Aurelia(Lúcia Moniz). And last but not least, a couple who fall in love while shooting a porno. At first I thought of this movie to be overrated and I didn't see what all the fuss was about but I have learned to appreciate it. It is rather long and sometimes it feels like everything is just thrown and mushed together with no directions and it makes you wonder if it will ever come to an end. However, it is touching in it's own way and it's interesting to see how each love story turns out. I did not leave the theater with my heart humming happily like the critics promised but it was still a enjoyable and entertaining movie. I would give Love Actually 7/10."

","This film, although having only been out for a short time, is getting the 'too sugary to stomach' rap, which I can understand but think is unfair. I saw Love Actually this morning and had purposely ignored as much review information on it as I could, so I could have an honest reaction for myself. I came away having laughed and cried (a little) and wanting to hug my best friend and my Mum (cheesy I know).  The film makers, were obviously trying to cover most aspects of 'love' as possible while not making it too intense. I liked the Laura Linney storyline that didn't cop out to a happy ever after and the Andrew Lincoln aspect that covered unrequited love nicely. It was Emma Thompson that really got me in the end however, there had to be some raw honesty in that performance, as it really hit home.  In this era where movies can be as violent as you can stomach without anyone batting an eyelid, surely a little sugar is acceptable and perhaps even needed, to keep the balance and remind us that, we have good things to turn our focus to after all the bad.  I'd give it a definite thumbs up."

","What a perfectly wonderful British film, as well-rounded and comfortable as a good cup of tea in the middle of the afternoon. No, really, I mean it. I'm in a ""loving relationship"" and came out of this film really satisfied with the diverse way it handles different types of love -- family, unrequited, good old-fashioned seduction -- as well as the completely new take it manages to bring to the good old fashioned chick flick. Some cutting comments and amusing witticisms, many fairly subtle and definitely a treat to observe - I'll be going back a second time to pick up on the sub-sub-threads I missed. The ending is particularly clever as it brings all the mini-plots together, and although there is little backstory on the characters themselves, the situations are well-described (for example, instead of just people looking soulful, actually using a 'language barrier' to show feelings that the characters couldn't say to each other -- particularly clever, in my opinion).<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic film for anyone in love or who has been, and although it has a bittersweet ending, you leave satisfied that it could be -- and indeed is, in many ways -- very true. The timing of the release in England couldn't be better, and we've had a good old laugh at the cardboard stereotypical Americans time and again during this film - no wonder the IMDB reviews aren't brilliant.<br/><br/>An excellent opportunity to see almost a Who's Who of British comedy all in one place."

It's a romantic comedy, with a very small amount of social commentary about love (and British attitudes to America) thrown in.<br/><br/>The ""love at first sight"" in the movie wasn't based on looks, but on chemistry (which has nothing to do with looks). It was looking at love as it should be, if everyone was open to it.<br/><br/>It also looked at love when it doesn't work, or when it goes wrong.<br/><br/>It was a great escape movie.

"kenadler","Null","0","2","20 November 2003"," Shallow Love Stories and Left-Wing Feel-Good Nonsense
","The love stories in the film were shallow, and almost entirely superficial. While one of the couple's love story had slightly more depth than the others (and I do mean, SLIGHTLY), it was interrupted by the fact that they were always in a rather stupid ongoing simulated sex scene (sans clothing).<br/><br/>The one scene I found most offensive was when Billy Bob played the role of a U.S. President, found groping the Prime Minister's (Hugh Grant) love interest.  While images of Bill Clinton come to mind, this President seemed to be a Texan.  Even Bill Clinton, from what we know, didn't engage in forced sexual acts.  To suggest that our ""Texan"" President might behave in such a way is equally ridiculous.<br/><br/>In any event, whether they meant to suggest Bill or George, their message is clear:  America Sucks.  What's even more offensive is that this ""America Sucks"" message really had no relevance to the film other than to give the Prime Minister a soap box upon which to stand. I'm sure they could have come up with about 1000 other ways to allow the Prime Minister to show character, other than slamming America.<br/><br/>Once this tone was set, I knew the rest of the film would equally as meaningless and I was right.  Most of the relationships were built upon appearances and crushes.  There are scenes of families reuniting at Heathrow as a backdrop to illustrate that love is all around us.  These fragments were the only scenes that presented genuine love....actually."
"cmqp","Null","0","1","23 November 2003"," Unrealistic, but wonderful
","I saw this movie with some professional reviewers' opinions uppermost in my mind. The prevailing view, I thought, was that this was a patchwork of sentimental nonsense sewn together by swearing, a Christmas theme, and some good acting. The reviews were wrong (again!), and it's my assumption that those same boring, cynical, elitist reviewers would've showered 'Love Actually' with praise had it been French and shot in black-and-white. I totally fell for this movie - a charming, beautifully-made festive confection. <br/><br/>You'll already know, I'm sure, of the set-up. Several inter-linked love stories of different types, played out in the weeks before Christmas, centred on Hugh Grant's bachelor Prime Minister falling for his tea-girl (Martine McCutcheon). From Downing Street, the love flows in all sorts of directions, although never really beyond middle-class town-houses owned by people with vague, well-paid jobs, (but what would you expect?) To be fair, there were a couple of stories whose cutting wouldn't have damaged the movie - the English loser in Wisconsin, for instance - but I guess Curtis had a load of points to make about love, and he wasn't compromising on any of them. <br/><br/>Grant's Prime Minister is well-acted but pretty unrealistic, of course. Having said that, how many US Presidents have we sat through in movies who are the epitome of square-jawed greatness, and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the real occupants of the White House? More power to a kick-ass British leader. McCutcheon gives a lovely performance as the beguiling beverage-server, and Emma Thompson is brilliant as usual. Her strand, as the PM's sister whose husband (Alan Rickman) is being tempted by a predatory colleague, is heart-rending and sincere. The same is true of Colin Firth's character, whose wife cheats on him with his brother, and who ends up engaged to a beautiful Portugese cleaner. Each tale has a share of laughs, and the body-double pair who talk traffic and motorways while rehearsing their sex-scenes, are hilarious. Equally, Rowan Atkinson's tiny cameo, which I haven't seen mentioned anywhere, is a triumph of performance comedy.<br/><br/>I feel like I could be one of the characters in this movie. I'm a Londoner in my own personal Curtis-esque scenario - adoring the girl of my dreams even though she's with another man. Perhaps because of this, the story about the guy videoing his best friend's wedding won me over even more than the rest, not least because of it's wonderful resolution. <br/><br/>Maybe you have to be in love in London to appreciate Curtis' latest work as much as I did. That's certainly the impression I got from my unmarried, uncommitted friends. But they enjoyed the jokes and laughed loads, and from a comedy, that's a pretty good return. Christmas, love, and London have rarely looked so tempting from the late-November drizzle."

","Richard Curtis, the guy who wrote the screenplays for several classic British comedies (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") wrote and also directed ""Love Actually"", and with it, has set out to make the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. It even says so on the poster.<br/><br/>It's over 2 hours long, it's crammed with several different storylines, well over a dozen main characters (most of whom know each other in some way), and has numerous subplots, some of which add depth and others that take it away. Yes, it definitely wants to be the ""Magnolia"" of romantic comedies. And...it doesn't really succeed. But it's a valiant effort.<br/><br/>Although I do have to say that it certainly does LOOK like the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to try to summarize all those storylines, so I'll just say that it has an all-star cast including Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and many others.<br/><br/>Some of the storylines are very enjoyable, but others could have been cut completely and wouldn't have been missed. And it's that kind of constant teetering, between the interesting stories and the not-so-interesting stories that makes this ambitious film fall far, far short of being the ""Ultimate Romantic Comedy"". Not to mention the many dry spots and flat jokes.<br/><br/>That said, the last half hour or so of ""Love Actually"" is about as perfect as a movie of this kind can get. All the stories are drawn together and concluded in a way that is very moving and satisfying. And I fell for it, what can I say? Sometimes, you just gotta surrender to the warm-fuzzies.<br/><br/>It's nothing too special, and it certainly doesn't compare to some other recent British comedies, like ""About A Boy"" or ""Bend It Like Beckham"", but it's pretty enjoyable, has wonderful cinematography, a good soundtrack, and some nice Christmas spirit. So there ya go. It's more or less worth it."

We've chosen a Richard Curtis, we know what we're in for.  despite my penchant for subplots, this was a few too many.  Some of the more interesting points are left undeveloped while we are brought to others that would be better dropped: for instance the adult film performers.

Alright, I have to admit that most of the time he does play the same sort of character (with the exception of Bridget Jones' diary), but he is just very good in playing that clumsy guy who has his heart in the right place. He is just very likeable. I really loved the rest of the cast as well. How on earth did Richard Curtis get a bunch of actors like that in one film. It was just unbelievable. The story-lines are great. At some points the film was just hilarious. Especially the honesty of Bill Nighy on that Radio show, the really unsexy ""porn"" part, and the dancing of Hugh Grant made me almost cry of laughter. But next to all that, this movie has some very sad and touching moments as well. The crying scene of Emma Thomson, The relationship between Laura Linney and her brother, the funeral of Liam Neesons' late wife to name just a few of them. Also in his previous writing Richard Curtis shows some drama in his comedies and I'm just thankful that he does that. It makes the characters and their story's so much more real.

Because there is only one common denominator in this entire movie-who can sleep with who. I have enjoyed several of Hugh Grants movies,  but I am disappointed with him for degrading himself to participate in a film such as this. This movie is rated ""R"" but should really be rated ""NR"" or even ""X"" due to the nudity and sexual content. It is definitely not appropriate for teens-who we all know still get into ""R"" rated movies and is NOT appropriate for most adults-that is any with any moral fiber. My biggest regret to seeing this movie is that I didn't walk out! I was so shocked I didn't know what to do-next time I see something this bad I won't hesitate to find the door.

","To sum up this movie in a brief review probably wouldn't give it justice. It's a cute movie about all different kinds of love--love between a sister and her brother, love between married couples, love between language barriers, love between fathers and sons, and even first, more innocent ""love"" between 11-year old children.  I have read some comments on this board that the movie was unrealistic and even offensive in its use of nudity and language.  <br/><br/>**Spoilers** Well, some of the situations are a little far-fetched, which can be somewhat frustrating in a movie that more often than not nails the realism of love. For example, two people can fall in love despite the fact that they don't understand a single thing the other is saying?  I'm not sure that would be love--lust, maybe, but not love.  And a man travels to America so he can improve his love life and instantly hits it off with not one, not two, but FOUR American girls at the first bar he goes too--all because of his English accent.  Somewhat doubtful.  But as I stated, the movie definitely touches more realistic aspects of love, too.  For example, a middle-aged man is tempted by his younger secretary.  A young American girl realizes that her crush cannot be fulfilled because of her obligations to her brother.  A man falls in love with his best friend's girl, but achingly realizes he can never act on those feelings.  All of these situations rang true to me, and I found these storylines to be touching and even sad.<br/><br/>But the thing that really touched me about this movie was the speech that Hugh Grant gave at the beginning.  And I think that speech summed up the entire 2 hour movie in 2 minutes.  The scene takes place in an airport, and we watch as people greet friends, relatives, and lovers.  Hugh Grant begins to talk about how all you read about these days is that the world is filled with hatrid and greed.  But when he thinks about comments like that, he thinks about the airport, and all he sees is love.  He mentions that when 9/11 happened, the phone calls that were made from inside the buildings were made from love, not hate.  And he realizes that love, actually, is all around us.  That speech gave me the chills--and after the movie was over, you realize that this speech is the message of the movie.  Maybe it's not all meant to be totally realistic.  Maybe some aspects of the movie ARE fanciful and far-fetched.  But when you look at the movie as a whole, it's all about love being everywhere, and how can that offend anyone???"

If you want to see naked people and loved X rated stuff - you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>However, if you were waiting for over a year to see a vehicle that would use the talents of Liam, Hugh, Emma and Colin and are huge fans of their previous films (as I am) then you will probably find lots of things about this film that could be improved - which are well noted in all the previous user comments that have already been posted on IMDB for you review.<br/><br/>Basically, word of mouth is much more powerful that anything anyone can type here and obviously word of mouth by people who have seen the film have led to it being #6 and only taking in 8 million opening weekend."

","Just having 97 other commentaries (at this point) should indicate the wide appeal this film has.  While I went to see Hugh Grant dance, I was surprisingly impressed with all the soundtrack (sad to hear that some songs were not on it).  Would have really enjoyed a duet with Hugh and Martine McCutcheon (or Sir Cliff Richard) but maybe there will be a sequel since there are so many storylines to finish. I'd certainly like to see more footwork by Hugh.  He was just getting started! Could have done without the foul language and nudity. Its release in line with the battle for Christmas #1 is timely and the film should be a seasonal favorite.  Unfortunately it's R rating will inhibit many thousands more from viewing an otherwise enjoyable movie and seeing such wonderful actors (and singers) in one ensemble. Billy Bob Thornton was perfect but any resemblance to President Bush was as lost on him as Hugh Grant is to Tony Blair."

","This movie is exactly what we need at the holiday season. Something fun and funny that touches the heart in a non sappy kind of way. ""Love, Actually"" is the intertwining of 9 seperate love stories. At Juliet and Peter's wedding (Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor) Pete's best friend realizes he should have told Juliet he loved her. Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his step son are trying to figure out a way for his step son to win the heart of a classmate. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) is starting to fancy his secretary, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). His sister, Karen (Emma Thompson) is finding out that her husband (Alan Rickman) is having a fling with his secretary. His employee, Sarah (Laura Linney) is trying to get something going with a fellow co-worker. Jaime (Colin Firth) is trying to write a novel while falling in love with his house keeper. And lastly, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is an aging rock star trying to get his Christmas cover song to the top of the pop charts. There are a couple of subplot stories as well. The writer/directer Richard Curtis has exactly the kind of comic flare and heart that so little filmmakers try to capture. His brand of humor can please anyone. The star power in this movie can light a building, there's so much of it. It makes you all warm inside when you leave, hoping that the same thing can happen to you in real life. The film captures a charm that Britain is uniqely known for. Makes you want to pack your bags and head there for Christmas holiday. Every character is likable. So when they transition to other parts of the story, you're always left entertained. It's a classic movie going experience. Go see this film, it's gureenteed not to disappoint!<br/><br/>RATING: **** out ****"

There was little explanation as to what most of the people had to do with one another outside of Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.  Most of the rest, just at the end, were suddenly all lifelong friends.

","Going beyond the typical love story and the dreaded ""chic flick"" label is always tough. Essentially, there has to be a certain amount of ""feel-good"" cheesy stuff that makes these movies sappy and lovable. I was happily surprised to see this film, what may be wrongly classed as a ""chic flick"", having equal parts of comedy/drama and a great balance of ""cheese"" and reality to make it thoroughly enjoyable. <br/><br/>The visual tie-in of the Airport arrivals and the line that ""Love is actually all around"" is really poignant. After that, each story represents a piece of the spectrum of how powerful this love can be. What you end up with is a lot of fun, and hardly any opportunities for the story to drag; it clips along and entertains throughout. <br/><br/>If this movie was filmed in the US, they would have plucked one story out of it and cast Sandra Bullock and the dude of the month, and it would have been total garbage.

"likop","10","0","2","14 November 2003"," A bus load of characters!
","Watching this film felt getting on a crowded bus and having talk to everyone on it! Too many stories, each one of which felt like the initial draft of the first and last chapters of separate screenplays which had been stitched together, using the general idea of ""Christmas"" as a unifying theme and to coincidentally (I'm sure) goose holiday box office revenues. The way that many of the actors involved have been circulating on talk shows, en masse, to promote the movie makes me suspect that each was given a percentage of the gate receipts in return for their participation and promotion. The movie provided a few smirks and smiles but I never really got to care much what happened to any of the characters. The story line with Firth and his Portugese cleaning lady had potential but then Colin goes back to London, learns passable Portugese in just one week, which is typical of the flaws in just about every storyline. While the stories are all light confections, the only jarring notes came when the auther/ director introduces a little anti-American left wing cant by portraying the President as a cartoonish caricature combining a groping Bill Clinton and a bullying George Bush. If I was American I would have also been insulted by the typical ""middle America"" (Idaho, I think) girls who are portrayed as attractive but empty headed bimbos always eager for a shag or orgy with anyone at anytime, anywhere. Americans don't come off looking good in this movie which is a surprise considering that the US will be it's greatest market. But then, I guess the participants are smug in the belief that the average American theatre goer isn't sophisticated enough ""to get"" the inside joke. It's always more satisfying when you can take their money AND insult them at the same time."

","Love Actually is a hybrid of every romantic comedy that has been made. Each story is good enough that they could stand alone as good films but put together and they just don't make you care enough about the characters to really get to like or hate them.<br/><br/>The focus is more on the famous names in the film (almost all the main characters are recognisable) rather than on the characters themselves although they do put in some great performances.<br/><br/>Each of the stories focuses on a different aspect of love: unrequited love, puppy love, losing love and new loves. The characters are likeable enough but for some of the stories there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered.<br/><br/>Love Actually is a film that does what a romantic comedy should do. There's romance and there's comedy. Some hilarious moments mainly provided by the brilliant Bill Nighy as a washed-up singer and watch out for Hugh's dancing. Slightly too sentimental for me but all in all a good film with something for everyone 7/10."

","This movie is enjoyable but also tries way too hard to make sure the audience feels good. The music swells with timely lyrics at certain points to make sure you ""GET IT"" - it's like an annoying friend sitting next to you, jabbing you in the ribs to make sure you ""get it"". Feeling good, feeling teary, feeling bittersweet??? Huh?? Are you?? The film doesnt trust it's material so it throws in the whole kitchen sink - while their are wonderful scenes and performances, there are also parts of the film that feel so cloying, so manipulative, so sappy, you want to scream. Richard Curtis is a very funny writer - both on TV (Blackadder) and in film (Bridget Jones, 4 Weddings...)but as a first time director his work was rather flat and stale. Maybe that is why he felt the need for almost wall to wall music. Plus it does seem like he had all these scraps of paper in a drawer with dozens of ideas written down for scripts and he decided to throw ALL of them into ONE movie. SPOILERS########SPOILERS: I could have cared less about the best friend secretly in love with his buddy's wife and the storyline of the stand-ins (nude)was predictable and one-note and the goofy Brit going to America to get hot chicks was stupid and seemed to belong in another teen movie but there was passion and fire in Emma Thompson's story, Hugh Grant was quite funny and the little boy with the crush on the girl singer was fantastic. And even though I liked the work of Colin Firth and the cleaning woman - I mean, please, he is going to just MARRY her???? Not maybe go out on a few dates first - gauge the HUGE cultural differences they might have- let alone the language barrier. But, yes, you would have to be a corpse not to FEEL something as certain stories wrapped up but Curtis needs to not be so heavy-handed and pushy with the message. Yes, yes, we get it. Love - Good.

"lawprof","7","0","1","12 November 2003"," Richard Curtis Actually Isn't a Cockeyed Optimist
","""Love Actually"" deserves a good review.  It's a fine example of ensemble acting directed by a master of the winsome/wistful genre of romantic comedy. Comedy with a dash, and a strong one at that, of drama centering on issues of commitment that are strongly played amid the sometimes madcap humor.<br/><br/>Director Richard Curtis may not own the Hugh Grant franchise in boyish innocence hitched to almost palpable virility but the two of them have done rather well together on the screen.  Here, a fine cast (too many for me to list-check the film's page on IMDb) play characters loosely or closely related in one way or another, all sharing a need for love with commitment. Whether they realize that or not.<br/><br/>Fantasy abounds.  Grant plays a young British prime minister who reviewers seem to feel is tenuously modeled on George W. Bush's loyal servitor, Tony Blair.  For the record, it's nonsense.  Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about English history will recognize Grant's portrayal as based on his solid study of William Ewart Gladstone.  Putting that aside he is a prime minister with more of a personal than an official life and it's all in good fun.<br/><br/>Comments on both sides of the pond have ascribed a political message in the P.M.'s strong stand when bullied by the U.S. president played by Billy Bob Thornton (he's everywhere these days, isn't he?).  Some folks can't see a joke when it's on the big screen in front of them.  Curtis has created a fantasy character - can anyone imagine a lecherous president going after a prime minister's lovely but slightly plump house maid on two minutes acquaintance?  And on a STATE VISIT? Please.<br/><br/>Some of the characters are more finely developed than others, especially the roles inhabited by Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson.  All contribute to a fairly well put together story.<br/><br/>In Curtis's ""Love Absolutely"" not everyone finds even ""Love Marginally."" Decisions are made, risks are taken, happiness is doled out and its permanence isn't assured.<br/><br/>I don't doubt the director's genuine belief that he was making a positive statement in the first minute with Grant, in a voice over, characterizing the last, terribly tragic phone calls from trapped victims in the World Trade Center but, frankly, it's an unnecessary and jarring comment.<br/><br/>
So just enjoy it and await, I'm sure, Hugh Grant's next exasperated trolling for love under Mr. Curtis's benevolent but not Pollyannish direction.<br/><br/>7/10."
"christophaskell","9","0","2","17 November 2003"," ...perhaps the greatest romantic comedy of this young millenium
","Love, as a word, contains a hundred different meanings. Loving someone covers many situations, depending on the context it's used in and your relationship with that person. Even though certain love might be hard to understand, and even harder to express, Christmas generally is the one time a year where you're allowed to make said expressions, where you're allowed to say how you really feel. Especially in the world Richard Curtis creates in Love Actually'. By using the trendy technique of telling a billion stories at once and having their interdependence gradually revealed, he has crafted perhaps the greatest romantic comedy of this young millennium. With Love Actually' Curtis raises the bar at what we're allowed to laugh at (by showing us what would have previously been considered too risqué), challenges us to keep our eyes open for love (it might be in the place you least expect it), and most importantly challenges the studio system by redefining the romantic comedy market (up until now being monopolized by teens or young twenty-somethings). My hope is that everybody gets to see this movie: it has a wide release over here in the states and it's currently on at least two screens in all those big multiplexes. If you have loved on any level, from a friend to a spouse to your young child, you will find someone to relate to herein. And in a wonderful surprise, someone finally separates the genres romantic comedy' and chick flick', Curtis making a film that's just as side-splittingly funny as it is saccharin and romantic. Cancel plans if you must, but make sure you get out and support this movie in the theaters. If you're reading this after the movie has left the theaters then make sure you go rent it soon, you'll be very happy you did. Rating: 32/40"

Hopefully they will cut them out and make another version when the movie comes out in DVD. What was the director and writer thinking?

","I hardly know where to begin in reviewing this film. It is possibly one of my favourite romantic comedies, and i have seen a lot of them; it is one of the perils of having a movie loving girlfriend.<br/><br/>A movie that has so many main characters who are central to the narrative usually finds it difficult to immerse the audience within it. Black Hawk Down was a prize example. Ridley Scott produced a great visualisation of the attrocities of war, yet because he had over 30 characters to associate with, we lost interest in them. Love Actually managed to keep us interested in all the little tales that go on. Some of the scenes, or should i say sketches, touch on the borderline of decency, but sometimes decency can be sacrificed for cheap humour, if done cleverly. Key characters that i enjoyed watching were the aging rock star, who reminded me of people such as Ozzy Osbourne and Johny Rotten, and Hugh Grant's Prime Minister, who was such a likable character, that we can not help but want him to fall in love with Martine McCutcheon.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is wasted in such a small two dimensional role, but it does add something for the young lad, as once again she looks stunning. Liam Neeson plays a funny father teaching his son about love and sex. The film does boast a very good cast, although a lot of them are left scrounging over small roles, or playing cameo roles, which fortunately do not detract from the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Possibly if the film had centred on less characters, and concentrated more on the endearing ones, then i would be telling everyone to go and see it.

","Just knowing that Colin Firth was in this movie was enough to make me go and watch this film.  There were some storylines that I could have done without (e.g. the going to America story and body double) but overall it was a great movie.<br/><br/>My favorite storyline was the Colin Firth one.  It was really cute although I know it's unrealistic.  It was cute how they didn't understand what each other was saying yet thinking the same thing.  Jamie: ""It's my favorite part of the day driving you home."" Aurelia (in Portuguese): ""It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you.""  And how cute was it seeing Colin Firth speaking broken Portuguese.  It was much better than having him speak perfect Portuguese after only a few weeks.  And he was so cute in the beginning of the film saying ""I love you"" to his wife three times... only to come back and learned she's cheating on him with his brother!  I don't think I was the only one in the theatre going ""how can you cheat on him?!""!  AND Colin Firth is in a pond again... <br/><br/>My other favorite storyline was the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman one and Liam Neeson son.  Emma Thompson truly astounded me with her performance.  The scene where she is so excited about opening up her Christmas present only to find out it was a Joni Mitchell CD instead of the necklace was heart-breaking.  I was hoping that Alan Rickman's character had come to his senses and decided to give her the necklace instad.  Then when she goes inside the room and cries while listening to the CD broke my heart.  She didn't want to break her children's heart during Christmas but her heart was breaking.  Then the scene where she embraces Hugh Grant's character at the Christmas pageant was so sad.  She was obviously hurting (you can tell by how hard she hugged him) but trying to put on a good face for the children. The storyline was kind of unresolved at the end leaving it up to speculation and that drove me a little crazy.  They need to make a whole movie just on this one storyline!  The Liam Neeson storyline was cute too and the little boy was too precious for words.  Yea the whole running through the airport scene and learning how to play the drums in 5 weeks was unrealistic but how cute was it?!<br/><br/>The Hugh Grant storyline was okay but was anyone else confused by all the fat jokes about Natalie?  It was enough coming from her ex-boyfriend but from the other office assistant and her dad. She was not fat at all!  I'm glad they took out the ""fatso"" card for Keira Knightley character too because if you're calling Keira Knightley fat, then that is just wrong!  I was kinda of ""eh"" about the Keira Knightley storyline because while it was cute; I felt sorry for her new husband who was totally oblivious to what was going on.<br/><br/>The singing guy was HILARIOUS.  Loved him.  The Laura Linney storyline was good too although unresolved at the end.  The guy that she liked was HOT! (the bedroom scene... wow!)<br/><br/>The body double storyline I could have done without and the useless nudity. However all in all great movie!"

What a terrific cast...all of my favorites; Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman! The rest of the cast is quite strong, too. I was a bit worried that the cast was too large and that the stories would be hard to follow, but since most of the actors are quite well known, I didn't have any trouble at all. The story lines were smart and witty, touching held my interest! Hugh Grant is improving with age, too. There was a time that I would rather not see a movie with him in it, but he has redeemed himself in this movie as well as ""Bridget Jones"" and ""About a Boy!"" He was excellent in this, although his storyline was the most unbelievable, and his big speech made me roll my eyes, but I guess that's just the conservative in me. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, at any rate. My favorite of the stories was probably the one with Liam Neeson and the child who played his stepson. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were absolutely brilliant, as usual.<br/><br/>I will say that the nude scenes did make me a bit uncomfortable. (Probably this was because 3 older women behind me were screeching about how it ""ruined the whole movie""...yet they didn't get up and leave! hmmmm.) I almost wish those scenes had been left out of the movie as without them, it would be a fun movie that my daughters would like... I did appreciate the incongruity of the situation which has movie star stand-ins having simulated sex. The two of them are quite shy and reserved,just getting to know each other. Perhaps more creative people could have created another incongruous situation that would have been just as amusing and that would have made this a movie that young teens could enjoy as well. I don't think I'll let my 12 and 15 year old daughters see this for a few more years. It's too bad, because I thought the movie was well made and had some good messages. I plan to see this again with some friends soon. This was one definitely of my favorites this year.

         There was a few nice surprises here though and it is a good date movie. Annoyingly, some of the plot threads go unresolved at the end - but overall an enjoyable flick. Curtis & Co. are perfecting this British romantic comedy thing, and I thought that the idea of making American president a bully was great -<br/><br/>ballsy too. I liked that a lot.

","Very few times does a little film have a big message. LOVE ACTUALLY actually does. The meaning behind this film is that love is all around. It may be hard to find sometimes but it is out there in its many forms. The beginning of the film starts out like a documentary, with the voice of Huge Grant talking about love. He speaks about how even in the saddest of times love is there in full bloom. Love is a very powerful word, but in this film it seems to go above and beyond its normal principles. Here, love is a simple word that overtakes the lives of the characters in the film. As hard as love is to understand lovers around the world still seem to wish and hope about one day finding that special person. The characters in LOVE are very interesting. The ranges of personalities that make the characters come to life are excellent. An outstanding cast that includes, Huge Grant, in his usually comic timing, pitch perfect performance. He plays David, a man who is in love but doesn't express his feelings right away. Although it seems like we have met Grant's character before in any of his films, here he is very fresh and funny. Colin Firth turns in another fine performance as Jamie, the loveable writer. One of the finest living actresses of today is Emma Thompson; here she only justifies this statement.  She is very funny in a role that could have been upstaged by the other actors. She plays Karen, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She is exceptional in this film and deserves some type of recognition. Keira Knightley plays Juliet. Although she has a very simple part in the film, she plays it very well. The love triangle that she is in also makes the even better. The scene where her admirer comes to the door is actually one of the most romantic film scenes in a while. Bill Nighy turns in one of the funniest performance of the year. Bill as Billy Mack is actually one of the best aspects of the film. His comic timing is genius. He is in fact the scene-stealer. Every time he appeared on screen the audience started to laugh. Liam Neeson plays Daniel, a man deeply involved with his son after the death of his wife. The relationship between the too is very strong. He does a very good job; it's nice to see Neeson playing someone likeable. Laura Linney plays Sarah, another complicated woman. She is one of the best up and coming actresses today. She is very funny in this role, but also delivers a very soft character that is in love with one of her co-workers. The thing that makes her life so complicated is that she has to care for her brother who is sick. It's a decision that plagues her love life as well as her every day life for that matter. Linney plays Sarah the way not too many actresses could; she is complex, soft, and likeable. Alan Rickman plays Harry, a man who many may find hard to like. He does a very good job balancing a mean character with a likable personality. Martine McCutcheon plays Natalie. She is very funny in this role. A pretty new face in the film business, she looks to have a bright future. And last but not least another major player in this film is the always-funny Rowan Atkinsin. Even though he is only in the film for a few minutes he still turns in one of the funniest performances as Rufus. The film has a great supporting cast and includes a few top-notch cameos. There is a great sound track that accompanies. All in all, it's a feel good, funny as hell film that will leave you rolling in your seat. Love Actually is actually one of the best films of the year! 4.6 out of 5: A-"

While ""Love..."" does ask it's viewers to suspend some reality (e.g. with all due respect, can you actually envision ANY head of government, let alone the Prime Minister, being as relatively young AND good-looking as Hugh Grant, remaining completely unattached, much less the party's leader?), the viewer never has to make a conscience attempt to do so; (s)he is emotionally involved with the characters, and the willingness to see their respective scenarios to conclusion is not laborious.<br/><br/>In addition to my admiration of the film I must compliment the creative forces that be on two particular aspects of plot which, had this been a typical Hollywood production, would have made an unnecessary dive into socio-political commentary: 1. The ""makeup"" of two of the couples, although one of them is not paired until the end of the film (to reveal more would require spoilers, so see the film to find out). Suffice it to say that a great deal of stereotyping and/or additional social commentary concerning these individuals could have been made, and in the US this would have been the entire focus of the film, despite its multi-faceted plot line. The fact that we see all of these people as ""regular"" individuals, without any agenda to promote, allows the film to be jovial and keeps true to its theme. 2. The now-infamous ""leftist"" tirade from Hugh Grant's Prime Minister. Having just seen the film, and in reading several commentaries from other sources about it, I'm compelled to ask, ""What 'leftist' tirade?"" While political philosophies may differ, nothing mentioned in that scene could be considered anti-American, unless you're a DEVOTED Bush disciple. The message, while definitely pro-British, could not be viewed as anything but unless one is already disposed to viewing anything except the Star Spangled Banner as unpatriotic.<br/><br/>Overall, while not a masterpiece, it is one of the best romantic comedies of all time, and definitely the best one this year. Can't wait for the DVD..."

","My daughter and I went to see this today and we both laughed and cried so much we cried our makeup off.  The movie does have a few too many story lines going for it.  I would have preferred they spend more time on the Rickman-Thompson story, the Colin Firth story and the Hugh Grant story. All the actors were wonderful in their roles and the little boy who played Liam's son was adorable.  The aging rocker story was hilarious (but a little sad too).  We both left wanting to see it again and anxiously awaiting the DVD release.  We went straight to a record store and bought the soundtrack which is OK but left out some of the songs they used in the movie.  They did a great job matching the songs to the stories on screen.  See it with someone you love!!"

","Every single story line would have made a wonderful movie in and of itself. I thought the criss crossing of the various plots and characters would be confusing, but I felt it was very clever the way the stories were woven together.  The movie flowed - very much like watching a dance.  Every cast member has been a favorite of mine for years so that was an added bonus to see them all together in the same film.  I am expecting many more wonderful movies from the cast and Richard Curtis.  Well done! Bravo!"

","(Synopsis-Spoiler?) `Love Actually,' a romantic comedy, is a series of love stories of several people from the Prime Minister to a rock star, an actor stand-in, a housemaid, and others.  It takes place in England and France during the Christmas season.  Hugh Grant plays the unmarried Prime Minister of the UK, who falls in love with Martine McCutcheon.  All of the love stories show the serious and foolish sides of love.  The movie has the dry sense of British humor in places, but there are some hilarious parts.  The movie is a little hard to follow, because it jumps around showing a small scene of one love story then another. Do not take your kids to this `R' rated movie, because there are some nude scenes.

","First, before I forget, I want to address the comment that someone made that this movie is not for children (""not under 12 at least"") Do you not understand the concept of an R (AS IN RESTRICTED NOT MEANT FOR UNDER 17) Rating?<br/><br/>Then I have to address the fact that it was R. WHY?! Why did they feel they had to do that??! As a rule, I don't watch R films but I disobeyed my conscience on this one because I am a sucker for romance movies. (Plus I know it is an English film and what we consider curse words they do not - and I understand that. I was expecting some foul language) ... It was really over the top though, and the simulated sex scenes were just ... UNNECESSARY!(It didn't add anything to the movie and I found it disgusting) Notting Hill wasn't rated R and it still manages to be an EXCELLENT movie!!<br/><br/>Then there is the plot(S) Some of the stories were so enjoyable (I could have watched the one with Jaime and Aurelia as a movie by itself!) but call my old fashioned. I like stories with beginnings, middles and ends and I found these stories way to loose and without much end. (What EXACTLY happened to Mia and her boss?) AND we all know that this movie is the type that is supposed to be a ""feel good"" (Some romances are and some aren't ... but it isn't fair to pretend a movie is going to be sunshine and happy endings and then not only NOT give us a happy ending but forget to give us an ending at all (Karl and Sarah) ... Maybe I just need to see it again on DVD. (The airport scene at the end was so fast paced I missed a lot of what was actually happening)<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I wish they would have edited out some of the nonsence (Kid who goes to USA ... what a bunch of RUBBISH!!!!) and devote more time to the stories that have real potential."
"taylorann1","10","0","1","11 November 2003"," Better than advertised.
","I am a ""gut feeling"" person on movies.  Therefore viewing the trailers and TV ads for ""Love Actually"" didn't quite resonate with this self-proclaimed pessimist.  But like George Constanza, the title kept singing out to me: ""By...Mennen.""  (""Seinfeld"" fans will know what I'm talking about.) Forgive me as I digress, but after the week I had, I needed some fluff to get my spirits up.  This movie absolutely did the trick.<br/><br/>I like movies with pace.  However, multiple storylines can sometimes slow things down.  ""Love Actually"" kept paced with each plot point and there were no ""throw-away"" scenes.  (ATTENTION: PLOT POINTS REVEALED!!)I would like to have seen some resolution between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's characters.  Confronting infidelity is always tough.  And Laura Linney's romance needed to play out more of the awkwardness that can develop from a failed office fling.  But overall, I could take something, albeit light and airy, from each story.<br/><br/>As stated previously, I am a pessimist.  But a movie like this makes me hopeful that people can find that special someone even if it is in an unconventional way.  This movie was worth the eight bucks, I'll probably see it again, and I will definitely buy the DVD.  Have an open mind and see the movie for what it is: an escapist's dream.<br/><br/>Metrosexuals unite!! (Yes, I am a heterosexual male who loved a chick flick!)"

"ddmulholland","Null","0","1","9 November 2003"," Very funny and very unique romantic comedy ...the best of this year
","Richard Curtis effectively shows the inner workings of the relationships of at least ten people in London, England including the Prime Minister.  The stories are quick and covers nearly every type of love-relationship - whether married, single, unrequited or non-sexual.  The movie is superbly acted with nearly every decent English actor and a smattering of Americans as well.  Richard Curtis is probably the finest screenwriter of this genre and does an impressive job for his first directorial debut.  It is an experiment in romantic comedies and I think that he pulls it off."
"Alikasan","Null","0","1","10 November 2003"," Laughed and cried throughout this gem
","This movie made me feel like it was Christmas when I saw it yesterday, November 10. I left the theater actually looking around for snow and Christmas trees, and I live in Florida.<br/><br/>My favorite genre is romantic comedies and writer director Richard Curtis is, without a doubt, the master of the smart romantic comedy genre. He has been a genius with ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and now this one.<br/><br/>
The cast is also excellent. Hugh Grant is, as usual, impeccable in this genre. He is perfect in this movie and doesn't disappoint for a second. He has that ability to seem bemused by his own charm, and has so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the job to be a good sport.<br/><br/>The movie is about love. Actually, about all kinds of love, happening to all kinds of people, of all ages and classes. It's too bad the movie couldn't be longer so that the three people, who ended up with unresolved love issues, could find their soul mates as well.<br/><br/>Don't miss it. It's not a chick flick, or a guy's flick, it's an all around feel good flick.<br/><br/>I give this movie 8 stars out of 10."
"nikeswim17","9","0","1","10 November 2003"," I'm in Love, actually...
","This movie was outstanding. Along the lines of Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and A Funeral--Love Actually is quirky and humorous with a touching emotional side. You leave the theater feeling floaty and wishing you were in love, especially with Hugh Grant or Colin Firth. The only bad thing about this movie is that some of the plot lines are never resolved or are only touched upon briefly. We never see much of the turnout of Laura Linney's character etc. The appearances by Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thorton were humorous and charming, and the movie contained the kind of humor I enjoy--quirky and off-beat, filled with the awkwardness of every-day situations. Perhaps the best part about this movie is that though it is dubbed a ""romantic comedy"" it is actually much deeper. It isn't simply ""cute"" it is about bigger things, it isn't just about ""love,"" it is about the imperfections of love and the humor, sadness and often times unfulfillment that all relationships bring. I would say this is one of the best romantic comedies of all-time, on par with About a Boy. Definitely worth a watch."

People should know that though this is a movie of Love and of Christmas it is also R rated..there are moments of nudity, sex talk and sex-sort of-scenes. don't try to bring little kids.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this one..you won't be sorry. even the casting of many English stars was awesome....what a great one this is!!"
"maxernst7","10","0","1","8 November 2003"," The audience laughed, cried and applauded at the end
","Richard Curtis's best movie. There's so much in this film, you have to see it a few times to get the full impact. Most of all it's extremely funny, touching and filled with an unusual mixture of cleverness, sappiness and unabashed joy set in both realistic and farcical scenarios. It works so well because beneath it all we feel that Curtis and his cast are sincere about showing us that ""love is actually all around."" We don't see it because we're not looking for it in this very serious world after 9/11. The second time I went to see the film it was even better. This isn't one to wait for the DVD. Make sure you see it in a theater with other people. It's a cathartic experience, all the hilarity, sappiness and profundity wrapped up in a strange mixture that's hard to explain. All I know is, both times everybody in the theater, including myself, was crying and laughing throughout like unashamed idiots. Curtis and his British cast are just the best. The few American actors have juicy parts, however, including a sly role by Billy Bob Thornton as the American President, and the 12 year old ""dream girl"" Olivia Olson who sings like an angel, and bursts out of nowhere like a young superstar at the end of the film, in a scene which ties many of the love stories together. (Olson, a phenomenal talent discovered by Curtis and flown to England to sing in the film, also belts out one of my favorite cuts on the soundtrack album, Mariah's ""All I Want For Christmas."")<br/><br/>It's hard to analyze why this film succeeds so well, because in the telling it might sound like just an ambitious Christmas chick flick. But I think it transcends its manipulativeness and crassness because, at its core, the film shows the reality that love, ultimately, is the most important thing to all of us.<br/><br/>This is also probably the greatest date flick ever made. Simply a beautiful, uplifting, weird, hilarious, magnificent movie."

","Some call it sugar shock, some will definitly tag it as a chick flick and some as great script. Over all it rocks. Must agree that it isnt exactly the biggest opportunity for people to act.. basic acting will do .. but the timing is perfect, emotions are poignant and what wins the crowd is that everyone can identify (or will want to identify) with parts of the movie.. the crush, the unpoken love, the 'making the institution work' concept amongst others. Over all humour, nudity, the brash blunt honesty  will keep the audience engaged. Must see.. definitly a couples 'big nite' movie! I hadnt read the reviews before going in.. just saw the promos...people actually applauded at the end of the movie!! Tell me how you like it!"
"pk_bone","10","0","2","9 November 2003"," Well written, well executed. Uplifting, not too sappy.
","Love Actually follows the painful, joyous and silly course of loves lost and found among disparate characters in London during the five weeks leading up to Christmas.  In the tradition of Four Weddings and a Funeral, this film portrays falling in love as an anxiety ridden, painful, horrifying event which somehow mutates into ultimate bliss when that love is returned.  The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls for an underling.  A widower (Liam Neeson) encourages his young stepson to attract the attention of the girl he pines for.  A pair of body doubles fall for one another while simulating sex acts for the camera.  Loves lost and wasted also figure less prominently in the picture.  Overall a funny and surprisingly moving film.  Don't expect realism but do expect to hear the ladies in the audience sigh in pleasure at the many beautiful men in the film.  There's no shortage of lovely ladies either.  One small warning - at 128 minutes this movie outlasts the usual romantic comedy.  And many bladders.  Go for the smaller size soda if you don't want to missing something."

","This movie embodied all aspects of love, from puppy love on up, and it could not have done a better job at doing so.  You will laugh, and you will cry. The stories weaved into the movie captured the way people feel towards one another, and how love can take over people's emotions for the best, or how it can feel when one is betrayed.   It was by far one of the better movies that has been put out in quite some time.  It can make even the most cold hearted person believe in love again."
"ZweiBlumen","8","0","1","11 November 2003"," Much better than expected
","I walked into this film thinking it would be a typical, sappy, holiday romantic comedy. I was not entirely wrong, but to my surprised I actually enjoyed this movie a lot. It follows the interconnected lives and misadventures of several couples around London, in an attempt to show that love exists everywhere. An impressive cast gives an equally impressive performance, the dialogue is well-written and funny (though there's a lot more profanity than you'd find in the typical Hollywood holiday fare), and the movie itself ranges from hilarious to heartwarming to sad. Strangely enough, this last fact is what has made my enjoyment of the movie less than complete; it seems that it doesn't quite know which direction to take. One moment it's a fairly standard romantic comedy (the Prime Minister's love interest), the next it's an oddball teen comedy (Colin's trip to America and the results thereof), and just when you're laughing and enjoying yourself, it turns all sad and serious with Emma Thompson's character confronting her adulterous husband, and Laura Linney's life being controlled by her mentally challenged brother. Some would argue that this adds depth, but I believe the movie would have worked better if it were more consistent in its genre and atmosphere. Still, this is one of the more enjoyable films I've seen recently, and it does end on a pleasant note, making it a perfect ""feel-good"" title for the holidays."

"RJBose","8","0","2","11 November 2003"," Quite Good, Actually
","This fairly-tale land of upper-class London has by now become a friendly and familiar venue to American viewers of such movies as ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridgit Jones' Diary"" and ""About a Boy"" (all featuring Hugh Grant in simple variations of his one character, as a matter of fact).  The pervasive nature of American Culture in the very fabric of British life is quite an interesting phenomenon, and it plays quite a significant role in ""Love, Actually"", though perhaps without intending to. ""Love, Actually"" is a series of vingnettes strung together about a dozen or so characters whose lives are somehow all connected, which makes for easy transitions from the individual characters and their separate stories.  It is quite entertaining, and sometimes touching, though sometimes also very familiar from previous films of the genre (a climactic scene at an English school student production, for example). America features quite prominently directly as well as indirectly, which may explain a rather awkward and unnecessary scene in which Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister of England) loudly proclaims Britain's independence from the United States of America, to the apparent adulation of his staff, and the British public.  I am unaware of the English feeling repressed by the US, but the scene struck me as one of those contrived sequences in ""The West Wing"" (an American TV show alluded to in the movie, ironically) in which the Left-Wing script writers have a character spout off about some pet issue-of-the-week (gun control, global warming, ad nauseum) to put everything right in their fantasy world where Martin Sheen is President, and the Democrats always win.  This American President (played by Billy Bob Thornton) is a leering, smug Bill Clinton-like weasel whom Grant's character spots hitting on the housemaid to whom Grant himself has taken a fancy; British international policy thus dictated by the hurt feelings of an English PM, who puts America promptly and coldly in its place at a Press Conference, while Thornton looks on in surprise and dismay. America is described as a land of opportunity (of a certain sort) for a buffoonish would-be casannova who flies to Milwaukee, lands up in a random bar, and has all of his dreams remarkably come true (as in a beer commercial).  It's quite funny, but also rather a meanspirited swipe at the women of America's heartland.  A little boy pines for a classmate, who will soon be returning home to (guess where?) and one of the main characters is herself apparently American (and doomed to one of the only segments without a happy ending).  Movies, music expressions and customs all imported from West of the Atlantic punctuate and permeate the film; and of course, most of the film's profits will be generated from the spending of American movie goers. Politics and sociology aside, ""Love Actually"" is really a rather entertaining and pleasant film.  The segments dealing with the two characters who are stand-ins for the lighting and staging of a pornographic film have elicited many comments from other viewers, but the innocence of their burgeoning romance, juxtaposed with their increasingly intimate postures was also clever. It's really worth seeing, actually."
"finnigan2","Null","0","1","8 November 2003"," Disappointing Actually
","Too many stories, each one of which felt like the initial draft of the first and last chapters of separate screenplays which had been stitched together, using the general idea of ""Christmas"" as a unifying theme and to coincidentally (I'm sure) goose holiday box office revenues. The way that many of the actors involved have been circulating on talk shows, en masse, to promote the movie makes me suspect that each was given a percentage of the gate receipts in return for their participation and promotion. The movie provided a few smirks and smiles but I never really got to care much what happened to any of the characters. The story line with Firth and his Portugese cleaning lady had potential but then Colin goes back to London, learns passable Portugese in just one week, which is typical of the flaws in just about every storyline. While the stories are all light confections, the only jarring notes came when the auther/ director introduces a little anti-American left wing cant by portraying the President as a cartoonish caricature combining a groping Bill Clinton and a bullying George Bush. If I was American I would have also been insulted by the typical ""middle America"" (Idaho, I think) girls who are portrayed as attractive but empty headed bimbos always eager for a shag or orgy with anyone at anytime, anywhere. Americans don't come off looking good in this movie which is a surprise considering that the US will be it's greatest market. But then, I guess the participants are smug in the belief that the average American theatre goer isn't sophisticated enough ""to get"" the inside joke. It's always more satisfying when you can take their money AND insult them at the same time."

","The wife and I were lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of this movie.  Then we got another pass for the next week, I guess it was a test by the studio to see how many would return again.  We returned and watched it the second time, enjoyed it just as much or more the second time since we could pay more attention to some of the details we might have missed the first go around.<br/><br/>During the 2nd viewing, we talked the studio rep out of eight more passes. Yup, eight of them!  But instead of being greedy, we gave them away to some of our friends and customers.  This morning (day after 3rd screening), one of those customers called me up to thank me for sending him, his wife and two neighbors, to this movie.  He said he agreed with me that Love Actually was one of the best romantic comedy movies he had seen all year!  I liked the way the director stitched all those seemingly unrelated stories together into a single story blanket.  Such a small world, eh?  Wife of one character, was sister to another?<br/><br/>I liked Hugh Grant's dance down the stairs, stopping only when he realizes he had a witness.   I thought ""Just Judy"" had a natural innocence that belied her role as a porn star (or was that a fill-in actor) and the chemistry between her and her co-actor was great.<br/><br/>Especially liked the part toward the end where ""Mr. Prime Minister"" was looking for ""Natalie"" door to door, and the various actors from previous scenes were answering the door (good reuse of actors) and his response about ""trying to visit everyone by New Year's Eve."" made me laugh out loud!  And then the end of the kid's show where they pulled the curtins to show the two of them kissing?<br/><br/>And the part about the kid who was in love with the girl from America, enough to learn (quickly) to play the drums in the Christmas Pagent?  I don't have enough space here to tell you about it, so go see it yourself.<br/><br/>But if you don't like romantic movies, then skip this one.  If you want to laugh and cry with the actors, you can't miss this one.  I'll be looking forward to buy the DVD for my (very small) collection when available in the US."

","I read about some negatives comments before I saw the movie.  Sure, some of the lines may be cheesy and the plot not very realistic, but those things do not break a movie.  After all, do we need to go to a movie to get our daily dose of reality?  It is nice to take a break from violence, which is the major constitution of many films nowadays, and just indulge for a moment in brighter side of human nature.  I came out of the theater quite happy, and to me, that is a good movie going experience.  The movie has many mini-plots.  Each plot gets only a share of the time.  Some may say that the characters weren't given enough time to fully develop.  I wasn't really bothered by that.  The movie isn't scripted to deal in depth of human nature.

Billy Bob was a real snake!<br/><br/>The only thing we were disappointed in is that Laura Linney's (Sarah) story line did not get wrapped up like the others. Which might have been on purpose - not every problem is solved at Christmas. The other problem is -and it wasn't for us- but this is not a movie for young children. I would say not under 12, though it does depend on the child. There is one running theme with nudity (both male and female) that would not be appropriate for children.<br/><br/>I did end up a bit sniffly at the end, for which I was ridiculed, but I didn't care.

","What a lovely film! Very hilarious, sexy (Colin Firth in a lake, a la Mr. Darcy? Mmm.), heartwarming, heartbreaking... The various storylines blended together nicely. It may be confusing/bothersome to a few, what with all the jumping around from couple to couple; but we see not too much/just enough of each to get a sense of what they're about and to genuinely care for them. Warning: this film is not for you if you're not a total sap/romantic-at-heart. If you don't have a boy-/girlfriend to see it with, it's okay; take a friend or family member with you. It's all about love, all kinds of love, and you'll want to give a big hug to the person you came with (or the stranger sitting next to you...). You'll definitely leave the theatre with a stupid grin on your face. It's a definite must-see, perfect to watch during the Christmas holidays, Valentine's Day, or any other day of the year."

","Hugh Grant can charmingly double take in any situation and make you believe he is an unwitting and innocent victim of unbearable cultural demands. In first-time director Richard Curtis's `Love Actually,' Grant is a naïve British Prime minister, a combination of Tony Blair and Jimmy Carter, with lust in his boyish heart but a value system in tact and ready to defy his urges and the president of the US, played by a randy Bill Bob Thornton, a combination of Bill Clinton and `W' Bush.<br/><br/>This delightfully fluffy Christmas story about the pervasiveness of love in a cynical age cuts among several separate stories of people looking for love, among them a middle-aged Emma Thompson dealing with an errant husband, a loving Laura Linney in unrequited love with a co-worker hunk, and Grant attracted to a servant in his new digs at 10 Downing St.<br/><br/>The funniest segment is Bill Nighy as aging rocker Billy Mack, pulling out all the stops for his cynical Christmas take on a national scale.<br/><br/>But it is Grant's prime minister who finally proves to the world that `love is all around.'"

","LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) **** Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Rowan Atkinson, Andrew Lincoln, Martine McCutcheon, Thomas Sangster, Olivia Olson, Rodrigo Santoro, Lucia Moniz, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Billy Bob Thornton, Denise Richards, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Shannon Elizabeth, Claudia Schiffer. Utterly charming valentine to romantic comedies, romance and love – not necessarily in that order – from acclaimed genre screenwriter Richard Curtis (in his directorial debut) as a valentine of sorts to hopeless romantics and those who don't know better. Interweaving several plot points amongst a dozen or so characters including Grant as the British Prime Minister who is falling fast for his tea&crumpet server McCutcheon; his sister Thompson who is in a possibly rocky marriage with Rickman who is mulling over having an affair; Linney as Rickman's associate who is pining for fellow co-worker Santoro; Neeson as Grant and Thompson's recently widowed brother and stepfather to the young Sangster who is experiencing his first pangs of true love in the form of coed Olson; porno stand-ins Freeman and Page courting one another shyly; Nighy as a fading rock star trying to cash in on an oldie but a goody for a holiday comeback; and lastly Firth as a writer recovering from a troubled break-up falling in love with his comely assistant, the lovely Moniz. Set during the holidays Curtis wisely milks the emotions of the season with his crackerjack cast, sharply witty and surprisingly poignant screenplay and an effortless ease with the back and forth of each vignette perfectly paced and skillfully observed. An instant classic and one of the very few movies I actually felt good about myself for seeing immediately after – truly enlightening and uplifting. A choice soundtrack including Dido, The Pointer Sisters and The Beach Boys sure doesn't hurt either. Very funny, romantic and altogether perfect! One of the year's best films."

Then there is that remark by the Prime Minister that he would eliminate the ex-boyfriend of his love interest (a la Tony Blair and his WMD top scientist?). Finally too much of a good thing is not necessarily good.  Exploiting the old Pop star, Billy, for all its worth; the Colin character who goes to Wisconsin to find love; and the couple who find love doing simulated sex.

","*Pros:<br/><br/>-Performances<br/><br/>-Good overall message<br/><br/>-Stories are individually well written<br/><br/>-Some sweet romantic moments <br/><br/>
*Cons:<br/><br/>-Some stories are neglected and feel unresolved.<br/><br/>-Fairly full of itself.<br/><br/>-Brief political subplot<br/><br/>******************************************<br/><br/>From Richard Curtis, the cinematic genius who brought you ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", comes a film so perfect, so well done, and indeed so long awaited, that you'd have to be a completely heartless, uncultured arsehole to not enjoy it.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't really think that, but the filmmaker seemed to, given the overall tone of the trailer for this self-proclaimed ""Ultimate Romantic Comedy""... It was because of this very pretentious tone that I approached this film with a bit of hostility; but really just increased expectations. To me, if they're going to tout their brilliance as a marketing tool for this film, they'd better live up to the higher standard they claim as their own.<br/><br/>The good news is, they mostly do. I mean, how can you dislike a film that announces that its purpose is to point out that love is actually all around you?<br/><br/>Sadly, a few different ways. <br/><br/>A brief subplot involving Grant's character and the President of the US offered some very unspecific but generally anti-American political rhetoric. Don't get me wrong here I don't mind the stereotyping of Americans, since we dish that out at other countries all the time. Likewise, I can accept anti-American sentiment, as long as it's expressed in the form of a valid argument rather than vague generalization. In any case, I think the former, and not the latter, is the only of the two that has any place in a romantic comedy. It was in fact a scene of the stereotyping of Americans that was one of the most enjoyable scenes in the film, while the other scene seemed to be almost a deliberate sucker-punch for every American watching, followed by an immediate retreat by the person who dealt it. It was in poor taste, to say the least.<br/><br/>Beyond that The musical score, while very pleasing to the ear, was a bit intrusive at times The overall mood of certain scenes was apparently lacking, so the score tried to make up for it. Granted, it's a difficult line to place, but the score crossed it more than once.<br/><br/>Most of the stories worked very well. Unfortunately, as a consequence of such a multi-threaded narrative, some of them felt unresolved at the film's end. The pacing was good overall, although there were times in which a story would be in limbo for a bit too long, leaving the audience wondering if the characters decided to take an early holiday (to borrow a British expression). <br/><br/>But clearly, this is also a difficult line to measure, and for the most part, Curtis pulls it off. And in the end, in spite of its flaws, he leaves us with a delightful film to remember for this season.<br/><br/>6/10"
"rancidlover","10","0","1","9 November 2003"," A Love Story... with a heart
","I like watching romance comedies, but haven't been able to find one in the recent years that make me laugh and make me want to cry.  Well, I hit the nail on the head when I bought a ticket to see Love Actually. Love Actually is such a unique movie, with a unique script, cast, and even the way it is filmed.  Richard Curtis did an excellent job in both writing this movie and directing it. Hugh Grant is the man I hate to love.  In this movie he was on target as the lovable and down to earth prime minister.  This is one of Hugh's strongest roles in the past few years.  I think the thing that made this such a strong role was that he had such amazing chemistry with Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  That was the love story in this movie that I most looked forward to seeing.  I wasn't that interested in the love story between the two porn star stand ins or the young man who travels to America to find girls.  But there were some really strong performances and plots in this movie I just fell in love with. For one --- I loved Daniel (Liam Neeson) with his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster).  Also the relationship between Sam and Joanna (Oliva Olson) was cute.  Oliva Olson also had such a great singing voice for such a young girl too. Secondly --- the cameos in this movie are great without being shoved down your throat... like Denise Richards and Shannon Elizabeth's cameos. <br/><br/>Third --- great acting from Grant, McCutcheon, Neeson, Sangster, Olson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and a few others.  Keira Knightley fans may be disappointed because she doesn't get much screen time for this movie. Overall, this film was just a great romantic comedy.  Yes, it's long, but it is worth checking out.  A chick flick, uh huh.  But even my guy friend told me ""this was one of my all time favorite movies"" and he wasn't being sarcastic.  He really really liked it."

Throughout the film, there is loud ""soft rock"" music from the 70's and 80's.  If you like that sort of music, it won't bother you.  I don't like that sort of music so I found it detracting from the stories.<br/><br/>If they had cut about 30 minutes from the film it would have been better. There is quite a bit of good stuff here but also a lot of junk. Overall, I gave it a 6/10."
"kwongers","8","0","1","9 November 2003"," Flawed, but still highly entertaining
","I loved this movie.  The movie's premise was great; we were going to follow the blooming and flowering of eight different relationships in the 5 weeks before Christmas.  Suffice to say, some of the movie made me cry and some made me laugh and all of it gave me a warm, tingly feeling inside. <br/><br/>
The acting is really superb and MOST of the characters interesting.  The best story involves Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister who falls in love with his secretary.  I admit I've been in love with Hugh Grant for ages and ages, but he is really a great comedic actor.  His timing is right on.  Most of the other stories were very interesting and we end up really liking the characters.  However, naturally, because there are so many stories, we don't see as much of our favorite story as we'd like to.  I wish we could have seen more of the stories featuring the prime minister (Hugh Grant), a couple facing a marriage crisis (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), a man teaching his son about love (Liam Neeson), and a man falling in love with his housekeeper (Colin Firth), probably just because their acting sucks you in. I also wish they cut three stories (the porn one, the coworkers one, and the British guy going to America one) that, to me, were incredibly unnecessary, didn't go anywhere, and took screen time away from the better stories. <br/><br/>
But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie.  The music is wonderful and you'll find yourself humming that `horrible' tune Bill Nighy sings through the movie.  `Love Actually' is far from Richard Curtis's best, but a winsome British cast, a really witty script, and a shot of Hugh Grant dancing and singing down the stairs will make this movie incredibly enjoyable.  Love is actually all around!  <br/><br/>9/10"

","Actually. I truly enjoyed only a few romances, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant and Liam Nesson. (In that order) The others I found boring, rather normal and odd. I know it's more true to heart, but it's a movie, do we really want to see that? I wouldn't. <br/><br/>Colin Firth, Jamie, was excellent. Sad, heavy but excellent. Throughout the moving, we see him practicing Protugeuse(sp?). Very funny, the whole language barrier between Aurelia and Jamie. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, Prime Minister, like always is a joy to watch. Funny, cute and positively radiant in his own way. He has two expressions (in my mind) 1) Sad 2) Happy. Unlike his friendly adversary: Colin Firth (who has been stated to have all kinds of emotions shown on his face). His chemistry was amazing, very romantic and loving.<br/><br/>Liam Nesson, I say it is more the young boy, Sam. So funny how the boy says he's in love. When I often see young boys hating girls at that age, but I guess times have changed :). <br/><br/>The entire movie was fantastic, I would love to see it again. Hopefully, I can and shall. A story, about the true meaning of Christmas. Be with the ones you love."

","Review: Movie: Love Actually<br/><br/>Date: 06 November 03<br/><br/>Venue: DVD = ""Definitive Love Actually DVD"" - pre-release<br/><br/>====================== Watching this DVD was more revealing than I had imagined it would be.  But<br/><br/>what it revealed was distinctly not what was intended.  That in itself is a trouble sign to me, because of what was revealed.<br/><br/>This is portrayed to be a really disjointed pastiche of stories, where the viewers will only get short snippets of each story. Richard Curtis has written and directed this contender for the all-time Christmas feel-good film.  The cast is large, but it cannot be said that it appears to have been an ensemble piece by any stretch. The cast does not all play together, or even get involved in action that relates to a single story line.<br/><br/>Instead, they play to a theme in small groups, that being: that we all need, are susceptible to, and even strive for love.  Of course, love is a good thing, but when the idea that we shall all fall in love is the only unifying factor in a feature film with a starring cast of ten, and a speaking cast of 20 or more, it risks being less than loving for the audience.<br/><br/>The purpose of making a movie is to entertain, and I think it will be very<br/><br/>entertaining to see the all-star cast actually make this jigsaw puzzle of cameos gel into an entertaining piece of cinema.  It's said to be a comedy, and I only hope that the full-length version is funny where it intends to be, and not funny for any of the wrong reasons.  But based on the DVD, with the extended preview,<br/><br/>two trailers, the making-of documentary, and the character introductions, what's funny is that the producers expect that England and America will dutifully troop to their local multiplexes and pay to watch a bouquet of unrelated stories on a theme, with famous faces trooping across their screens in dizzying profusion.<br/><br/>The marketing DVD established the fact that the producers are banking on the<br/><br/>appeal of Hugh Grant.  This is collaborated by the article printed in the same paper's weekly entertainment magazine, which had included the disk.  I<br/><br/>sincerely hope that Grant is on screen for enough time to glue this film together by giving continuity to the story-line.  I hope his part gives a unifying thread to the movie, because I appreciate there's alot of talent that's on show here, and wish the producers well.<br/><br/>But on the other hand I wish that the producers had used a subsidiary to make the film, as it is not an ensemble piece of the sort that ""Welcome to LA"", ""The Big Chill"", or ""Day for Night"" were.  Here, the disparate stories are not likely to do anything other than distract the viewer and detract from each other."

My only complainant was that there were so many stories, and I wanted to see more of some.  I especially liked the one involving the new widower and his stepson, the rockers comeback, the one about the porn stand-ins, the one about the long-time marrieds facing a crisis in their marriage, and the impossibly-handsome PM.  even some of the smaller parts were real standouts. The jewelry clerk who blocked for the kid at the airport, and Claudia Schiffer's cameo were charming touches.

"KyleTheGent","9","0","1","4 November 2003"," Love Actually is ever so bittersweet...
","What a magnificent triumph this movie is.  In fact, it is so delightful and splendid that it requires your attention immediately.  As each holiday season approaches, blockbuster movies come with their gigantic budgets in attempt to dazzle the audience with groundbreaking special effects.  No CGI present here, this captivating movie is 100% entertainment with its wondrous dialogue.<br/><br/>It is five weeks before Christmas in Great Britain, and love actually is all around, especially for ten or so citizens. Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is a washed up cynical musician editing lyrics to his one hit song for Christmastime, hoping for success.  He appears on talk shows not only badmouthing boy wonder band `Blue', but himself and his manager Joe (Gregor Fisher).  Enter Jamie (Colin Firth) who admiringly tells his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) he loves her three times before he leaves work, comes home early, only to see her cheating on him with his brother. Only in Amer.err.England.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Daniel (Liam Neeson) is struggling ever much so with the loss of his wife, and is trying to make a connection to his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Helping him cope is Karen (Emma Thompson) who fears that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) might be having an affair with his secretary Mia (Heike Makatsch).  Karen's brother, the newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) has seemingly fallen for his maiden Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  Wedding Bells are ringing for Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) which crushes Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln), because Juliet is his deepest desire.  I couldn't possibly forget Colin Frissel (Kris Marshall) who proclaims he is a sex god but is stuck on the wrong continent, and embarks on a voyage to America.<br/><br/>The romances and twists in this movie are just as unpredictable as the human heart. The movie seems to have the right amount of relationships that intertwine, as it never rushes itself and is easily understood.  It is thoughtful and romantic, and hilarious at the same time.  Perhaps it is the movie's ability to never actually sympathize with any one character, allowing each person to stand out. You'll be surprised at how the movie goes the opposite direction at times, always keeping the audience wondering.  Mark seems to be infatuated with Peter for a good portion of the movie, and we relieving laugh when Daniel's dread turns out to be that little 9-year old Sam is tortured by the agony of love (what else?). Richard Curtis deserves much appraisal not only for writing the script, but for his directing debut. Whatever ends up happening in Love Actually might not be exactly as you had hoped for. It closes most of the doors, but leaves some open. One character in the film states, `Life is full of complications and interruptions.' However, after you see this film, it will help you realize what is truly important, even though it tells you in the title.<br/><br/>(4 out of 5)"

","Interestingly enough, I enjoyed this movie more than my wife did! She is an ardent fan of Colin Firth, with Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant only slightly behind. Both of us enjoyed ""Four Weddings"" immensely, so our expectations were high. This movie fell short of the mark, but it's still worth a look while it's still in the theaters.<br/><br/>The ""R"" rating is, unfortunately, well deserved. The sad part is that most of the nudity and intentionally simulated sex scenes could easily have been cut without hurting the movie. Indeed, the additional time could have been used to further develop the other story lines that left one hungry for more! There are only a few such scenes -- this is not a porno film, but... Well you'll see.<br/><br/>There are many hilarious moments in this film, blended with other scenes that make it more than just a comedy. As usual, this production company has delivered a film that tells stories that, for the most part, buck the Hollywood tradition of overly shallow and one dimensional stories.<br/><br/>Reasons to see this film: The stars and acting company are fabulous (as you would expect! In addition to the above, Emma Thompson was fabulous as usual as well), some great laughs coupled with thought provoking depth, wonderful story-telling technique (less the process gimmick at the end -- you'll know what I mean). A little subtle magic worked in as well...<br/><br/>Detractors: Perhaps too ambitious re: the number of stories? More magic would have been nice (and you'll know who I mean...).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this film's fantasy aspects seem to be more from a male perspective rather than neutral or female. Good news -- this isn't a ""Chick Flick"" (although marketing almost makes it appear to be one). Bad news -- female viewers may find themselves a bit offended and embarrassed from time to time.<br/><br/>Still and all, don't wait for DVD/Video for this one. See it on the big screen first, then you can make the decision to rent or buy later."

I'm not sure this movie has either the emotional resources or the 'endless re-watchability' of ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" ""Notting Hill,"" or ""Four Weddings,"" but once around was certainly fine, and I might try it again.  Not all the storylines in his multi-story lovefest were equally sustainable; one might have wished for half the number of stories and significantly more time devoted to the better ones, but the truth is, one never quite gets as much of Hugh Grant or Colin Firth or Emma Thompson as one wants, so perhaps it didn't really matter that their characters' screen time was diluted by some lesser adventures.  In any event, the ride was fun, several funny moments were quite memorable, and it was particularly enjoyable to see Bill Nighy let loose again in his patented, unchained, not-dead-yet persona.  The adorable little kid is Hugh Grant's cousin, who already has many film credits to his name.  Look out, next generation!  He's a heartbreaker-in-waiting."
"jlhp0405","10","0","1","3 November 2003"," Actually in love with Love Actually
","Once in a while, a movie comes along and restores faith in love.  Love Actually does it so well.  It tickles the soul, and like the feeling of being in love, the movie makes you fall in love.  You feel the rush of a first kiss, the anger of being made a fool of by a spouse, and the joy of discovering that you've fallen in love.  You also realize that love is just love--between man and woman, father and son, friends, siblings, etc.  The cast of actors in this movie make you feel these emotions.  You forget the Colin Firth of Pride and Prejudice and instead see a bumbling writer falling into the trap of love. Each actor owns his or her role wonderfully.  And this results in perfect comic timing and depth in acting.  Richard Curtis as the writer and director of this movie has given the audience nine vignettes that show different aspects of love.  And it is not necessarily ideal love--some it is unrequited, and some of it is sinful.  The dialogue is witty and clever.  Together, the acting, the writing and the directing have created a movie as complex and as heady as love itself.<br/><br/>My only disappointment is in the lack of closure for two vignettes.  But maybe that is intentional.  Watch Love Actually and be prepared to smile for days."

"moviebuffed99","Null","0","1","3 November 2003"," `Love Actually': The Boogie Nights Christmas Special We've All Been Waiting For?
","`Love Actually' is a movie with an excellent cast and a dynamic basis for a story, but it doesn't seem to know if it's a soft-porn movie or the next box office hit (and maybe even a classic like It's Wonderful Life). The opening scene in the studio sort of sets a tone of a happy yet slightly cheeky movie. The wedding in the beginning had some clever and smart scenes with the couple (bride is Keira Knightley) and the groom's best friend throughout the film, but everything suddenly hits a thud though when Liam Neeson enters--if they cut out the first few boring scenes of Liam Neeson, everyone will get the point he's a single step father that misses his wife. The constant references to sex by him to his young stepson make him sound like a pervert. And it doesn't help that in one scene he has his big heavy legs over the boys lap on a couch. After, you get past the boring scenes with him, that barely make sense, then you have to cope with graphic images of this porn couple, that get worse and worse each time the film cuts in.<br/><br/>
Simply put, porno Pete and Pat have absolutely nothing to do with any of the characters in the story or the story itself. Its bizarre and it really cuts down on screen time of the other main characters that are more interesting. We can now say `good bye' to continuity here. Along with that, there's frequent gigantic butt art that shows up in the film that does a good job of overshadowing the characters performing the story, because it's such a distraction. What were they talking about?<br/><br/>----Minor Spoiler Below---- Then there's a lady who's in love with some guy named Karl at the office, who is shocked that he wants to sleep with her. That's laughable. The bedroom scene is drawn out and boring. The lady's brother could be a very cool situation of `love actually,' if the guy didn't try to strike her while she was visiting him. Why are we supposed to feel empathy for him? The rock star (Bill Nighy) is dynamic and funny, but the movie makers ought to give the audience something more than the star stripping naked when he finally makes it. Alluding to it with a brief shot of him removing his shirt would have been sufficient.  There is also another really unnecessary scene earlier in the film where for some reason he strips down and thrusts himself in the face of brit tv talk show host Michael Parkinson.<br/><br/>
There are lots of kids in the movie, the previews look good, so kids will want to go and parents will want to take them, but they'll be disappointed because it's not that kind of film. And how many parents are going to want to take their kids to see a woman going down on a man for a Christmas film? The kids are great actors and add a lot of life to the film. The stories involving, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and Alan Rickman make the movie, a real story worth telling. Hugh Grant blows you away with his character and his romance. Truly brilliant. And his dance at Downing Street is awesome! Colin Firth is awesome as well. His story is also very inspiring, very romantic and exciting. Mr. Darcy is back! They never disappoint. The way these characters are developed is spectacular. The movie picks up and ends with a great finish, which makes you almost forget for a minute about the rest of the cr*p that should be cut, the running time is too long anyway. If they don't, it's a shame for the brilliant actors who invested their time in this film."

","This works best as a comedy: don't go looking for more, just go for a good laugh. If you liked 4 Weddings and a Funeral or About A  Boy, then this is way funnier. If you didn't see any humour in those, then this might not work for you. The vignette approach puts it almost in the style of the Monty Python films. Defintely of a similar standard: this is the crew that did 4 Weddings and  a Funeral, Notting Hill, About A Boy and they've clearly progressed on from that and made a film with world class production values, a tight script and above all screamingly funny.<br/><br/>John M"

","I loved Colin Firth's character and Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister was wonderful.  Of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman were superb as well. If the two film stand-in characters, and the entire film making series, as well as the kid that goes off to America had been eliminated, so we could see more of Colin and Emma's characters that would have made it a better film.  I also wish we could have seen more of Liam Neeson's character<br/><br/>Inspite of those faults it is an enjoyable two hours and I would recommend it.

"Pasafist","Null","0","1","3 November 2003"," The Best (and Frustrating)Romantic Comedy I've Seen In Years
","When I think back on the genres that consistently let me down romantic comedies and teen flicks are at the top of the list.  Why do I still go and see them? That's easy, one cinematic gem out of 50 flops is why I, you're humble (or egomaniacal, you pick) reviewer, likes movies in the first place. I love to wallow in the muck until I find the small treasures of cinema.  I love movies that transform their genre. Films that are above average in quality and that are not at all conventional.  Movies like that make me joyful again.  <br/><br/>That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me. This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated.<br/><br/>
Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that. We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society. <br/><br/>The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen `desperately' in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.<br/><br/>Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.<br/><br/>The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.<br/><br/>It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.<br/><br/>I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.<br/><br/>In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film. It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching. <br/><br/>
I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.<br/><br/>Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.<br/><br/>****1/2 (out of 5)"

"Lulu10","10","0","2","22 October 2003"," pleasantly surprised because I thought it might be too sappy
","When I read the cast list I knew I wanted to see the film, but the title put me off a bit. It seemed like it would be too sappy or sugary.<br/><br/> I liked Notting Hill, but didnt LOVE it. I liked Bridgett Jones quite a bit, but this sounded too commercial and middle of the road for my tastes. I am glad we went to see the sneak, because my husband and I both LOVED the film. We don't often agree on films either.<br/><br/> I do have some small complaints which I will get to next, but the good is way above the bad. The characters are wonderfully expressed and played, and the storylines are very unique and even sometimes surprising. It moves fast so you are never bored, but there is meat to it as well. I really cared about the characters I was seeing. [ except for 1 or 2] I felt as if I knew them for the most part.<br/><br/> Liam Neeson and Thomas Sangster are incredible in this film. They were so funny and moving. That kid is going to be a big star soon. He is so realistic and endearing without being smarmy.<br/><br/> And speaking of smarmy,  Bill Nighy is a fantastic character in this film. He got and deserved most of the real laughs here. I would see it again just for his scenes.<br/><br/> Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman moved me to tears and my criticism would be that I would have liked to see more of them. There are a few characters that are so briefly seen , just for quick laughs basicly, and they take the time from ones like Colin Firth and Alan Rickman, whom I would want more of.<br/><br/> I would say to people, do not let the title or the boring trailer keep you away from this fantasticly funny and moving film. It almost kept my husband away and he ended up loving the movie afterall."
"belovedfreak","Null","0","2","22 October 2003"," A dashing film about many variations of Love...
","I saw this movie at an Advance Screening last night, and couldn't have been more delighted.<br/><br/>Honestly. This film is funny, touching, comforting, goofy, poignant and full of ""Yeah, I've been there"" moments. It tells the tale of numerous characters and their experiences of love. It is set up as batch of (slightly intermingling) short films. Each tale is part cliche, but all have really brilliant moments and delightful (often-surprising) twists.<br/><br/>Granted, with so many characters, many could be called flat - except that this cast (overall) is so talented and so truly magnificent that they breathe a real life into these characters! Emma Thompson was my favorite. I hate spoilers and so will not explain, but she handles her whole arch magnificently. Alan Rickman is subtle and wonderful, and I can't think of an actor who can say so much with a silent mouth! Colin Firth is darling, though underused I felt. Hugh Grant is comical but does very well. I wasn't thrilled with Laura Linney, but I've never really liked her style of acting. And as for the rest of the cast, really they were all so delightful! There were actors whose names I didn't know before this film, but will be keeping an eye out for. And some known actors who just prove how great they really are. This script is fast and the stories terse, but all the actors seem to get it and the whole things is just wonderful.<br/><br/>The emotional flow of the film just has me spinning. So positive, but not all sugar! Also, the shots (for those looking for more) were sometimes so clever or so beautiful I caught myself gasping.<br/><br/>The music is very well used and very reminiscent of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" in method. The comedy is a British style, but I don't think it'll isolate an American audience (even despite one scene where our ""President"" doesn't come off well...to say the least). What else can I say..?<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I felt for nearly every character. I thought the cinematography was clever without drawing too much attention to itself. I thought it was slightly risky without being offensive, which didn't bother me because this film isn't about controversy - it's about love. It's just such a good intentioned film. So good for Christmas or even if you're just having a bad week. I liked so much about this film, but my favorite element of it were those, ""Yeah, I've been there moments."" Those film moments were you remember being in exactly that place, emotionally. There were a lot of those in the film. Those ""I did it"" moments, those ""I can't believe this is happening!"" moments, those ""My heart is going to burst moments"" is both ways each of these phrases can be taken.<br/><br/>This film is just the definition of ""Good."" I really hope cynical critics don't attack it for this. I hope they can allow a film to be without malice. Some films should be this good. Let others be dark and isolating. This film absolutely embraces. It's good. Really and honestly good."
"silver_star_tears","9","0","1","18 October 2003"," Interesting Tapestry...
","Just saw this at the Cork Film Festival. Definitely a good shot for 9/10. Very interesting film, all about the different types of human love. I thought that a lot of the actors were given definite space to work their magic in (especially Hugh Grant's character), though some spaces were small, it is amazing to see so much talent in one film and therefore one has to have a realistic idea of limitations.<br/><br/>Some of the stories are not first class, but then you try to put together ten different stories in reality which are highly stimulating. Ultimately the weaker stories do their work by showing off the better chapters of the film. I do feel that perhaps one of the story lines was imperfect, you wonder if a couple of scenes were left on the editing table.<br/><br/>
The film is very touching and if you just think the plot is too unachievable, go for the comedy (brilliant job by Bill Nighy) or the feel-good factor (perfected by Liam Neeson). All in all, not a film for breaking barriers but maybe thats its success. 'Love Actually' is a human film, and at this it is worth its weight in gold."
"janyeap","Null","0","2","20 October 2003"," Love as defined in many, many forms...
","Love is actually all around you', as the lyrics keep bursting out through many lips and channels.  How true! Yep, this film brings out the concept of what, when and how love exists - in all walks of life. Richard Curtis' love comes in many forms. He also highlights the human goodness in people during crucial times. At the beginning a voice reminds the audience of the love and support given in response to the most devastating of 9/11. The abstractness of love is best captured with the first airport scene and at finale  people, just people, from all walks of life and ethnicity in their acts of love  basically undeterminable love or friendship. The film also suggests that those willing to travel far can find love. Love flourishes in office and work environment, in community gathering, and even at snobbish No. 10 Downing Street. People find love  from strangers, from co-workers, from classmates, between different living classes of individuals, between family members and from different backgrounds. Even language, failing health serves no barrier. It's like getting a learning lesson on love without the concepts being pushed forward in a condescending fashion. <br/><br/>With constant repeats of the lyrics of 'Love Is All Around', this film is fun-filled with characters portrayed by a lovely cast of stellar actors. Each in their unique way allows the audience to look at love in different variations - silent love, body-language love, parental love; foolish love; puppy love, a love fling; friendship, companionship, forgiving love, infatuation, et. al. It's, in reality, just the sort of movie the world needs right now.  Hugh Grant clowns his way through this film to offer some very funny moments.  He actually boogies away at No. 10! Who says a nation's leader couldn't juggle entertainment talent with his official duties? If he should choose to make a political statement, blurting out the British virtues to Billy Bob Thorton's over-bearing US president for bullying Britain, can't we at least take the humor with a little giggle? Colin Firth is immaculately stunning in his role. Laura Linney and Emma Thompson bring nice touching sides to their love story. Bill Nighy's cranky and senescent character is incredibly corny.  The two scenarios, given by Rowan Atkinson's character, drives home the idea that the intentions of a Good Samaritan can often be weighed as positive or negative.    <br/><br/>Treated in a portmanteau fashion, this film carries nine sets of loosely linked characters and storylines cutting back and forth five weeks before Christmas (ah, the day to celebrate love and forgiveness?)<br/><br/>
A very entertaining film with a fabulous insight to the meaning of love...<br/><br/>My rating: A"

Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson and Hugh Grant in the same movie! An Kiera Knightley, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and all the others did a terrific job.
