"MR_Heraclius","8","60","67","24 February 2020"," Not as good as the first 2
","Definitely not my favorite of the 3 but it's hard when the first 2 were just that good. It still portrays well, from my historical knowledge, much of the struggle of the mob families to legitimize their business dealings and try to enjoy life in the later age of the mafia in America. Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films."
"tfrizzell","Null","501","633","13 October 2001"," Outstanding, But Sadly Forgotten and Somewhat Misunderstood by Many
","Many believed that the series was complete in 1974. Even Francis Ford Coppola thought that another installment was unlikely. However in 1990, some 16 years later, ""The Godfather, Part III"" was released with results that few could have perceived. The film was not very successful at the box office and many who did see the movie said ""ho-hum"". The critics were also indifferent to an extent. A Christmas release would create enough steam for the film to achieve a best picture nomination and seven nominations in all from the Academy (it failed to win any though). Of course ""Dances With Wolves"" dominated the night and that film along with ""GoodFellas"" are considered the class acts of that year. Why has ""The Godfather, Part III"" failed to achieve a following like its two predecessors (parts I & II)? I am not sure I can answer that question. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is becoming an old man and his health is slowly worsening. He wants the family to become 100% legitimate and even makes a deal to link his finances to the Vatican. However Michael has become a bit naive and everyone double-crosses him. Now it appears that the only answer is to get back to the old ways. Younger sister Connie (Talia Shire) believes that Michael has grown soft and that Santino's (James Caan from the first film) illegitimate son should take control (Andy Garcia, in his Oscar-nominated performanece). He is ambitious and has the short fuse that his late father had and this is going to lead to fireworks for the family. He also starts seeing Michael's teenaged daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis Ford's real-life daughter) and a romance blossoms. Meanwhile crime bosses Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna pose threats to the Corleones. Kaye (Diane Keaton) has divorced herself from Michael and their son (Franc D'Ambrosio) has somewhat sided with her. Michael's health takes a turn for the worse as he actually goes into a diabetic coma for a time during the film and when he does recover (not completely though) he starts to reflect on a life of loss. The ordering of Fredo's death (John Cazale) in the second installment and his Sicilian wife's murder in the original haunt Michael and he tries to come to terms with his life, but learns from a Catholic cardinal while in Sicily that he deserves all the suffering he experiences and realizes that his suffering will be even greater in the future. In fact there will be a finale that will be the ""fatal nail in the coffin"" for Michael. ""The Godfather, Part III"" is focused on Michael and that is why it is unique to the series. The first two sported so many rich characters that it was impossible to focus on just one. This film could be best described as ""Reflections of a Life of Loss"". The film is excellent and even though it is likely the weakest of the three when you compare them, it is somewhat unfair to put the three ""Godfather"" movies together because they can all stand on their own. Great movies stand on their own and ""The Godfather, Part III"" does just that. 5 stars out of 5."

","Having heard the endless amount of critique and insults that the last part of the Godfather saga carries.. I have to disagree. Although people seem to love to hate Sophie Coppola and say she ruined the film, I think her part alone wasn't that frail it'd ruin the entire cinematic experience. Saying that is just humorous. Also, the absence of Tom Hagen played by Robert Duvall is really a loss and even I think this film would've been a lot better if there was him in it.. but he got too greedy and couldn't make it into the movie, and that's that. I'm not going to judge a movie by what it could have been, but what it is and how good it ends up being.<br/><br/>Despite some shortcomings, Godfather Part 3 is a decent ending to the trilogy. While it may have been an attempt to cash off the audience, they still have Coppola bring us his finest directing. I found Al Pacino's performance extremely satisfying and even terrifyingly so. He embodies the mistakes and losses of his life with excellent skill, showing us a don that has lost his health, the loved ones of his life and even the respect for himself. While I never found Diane Keaton's performances in the saga that good, she still fills the spot required, same goes for Talia Shire, whose role in the ending finale of the film really came as a surprise to me - which was a good thing. I didn't find her role in Part 2 too appealing but in this one she has more character, more importance. Sophie Coppola was OK, like I said a lot of people have complained about her acting skills and I gotta admit she was a little ""stiff"" or sorts in some scenes but it's not notable all the time and it didn't spoil any moods for me. Andy Carcia was just excellent, my favorite add to the saga cast, playing the son of his father with excellence.<br/><br/>So, umm.. this film is perfectly fine. The ending finale was tremendously well shot and very climatic, filled with a lot of excitement. I'm telling you this movie is a great ending to the saga even because of that one particular scene so just go see it, despite what a lot of people have said about, badmouthing it for faulty reasons.. it brought a tear into my eye. It did."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","283","382","6 January 2006"," Unjustily Criticized
","I stayed away from this film for a long time, doing a dumb thing: listening to the well-known film critics.<br/><br/>When I finally got around to it, I was very surprised. It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.<br/><br/>Many people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn't it find that way. Yes, the ""Vatican bank,"" whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino's character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, ""What good is confession if it isn't followed by repentance?""<br/><br/>Anyway, Pacino's acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn't that much action but when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.<br/><br/>Finally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized."

Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, the motion picture reflects Coppola's masterful film-making... <br/><br/>Fascinating threads of continuity support this illusion: The bridesmaid (Jeannie Linero) who had a hurried meeting with Sonny in the first film, now makes a significant appearance as the mother of a vibrant new character, a suitable successor of Michael, the Godfather of the future Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia).<br/><br/>Vincent, strong, focused and loyal, shares his father's hot temper...

"BigDog-18","Null","38","48","5 October 1999"," No Comparison
","I recently watched all three Godfather films again in sequence and was surprised at how bad GF III is when closely compared to the other two fims. There are characters in the film whose presence is never made clear (i.e. George Hamilton, Brigette Fonda and Don Novello - Father Guido Sarducci??) The major characters bear little resemblance to themselves from the previous films. Connie Corleone is now a major supporter of Michael even though she knows he had her husband killed? Michael now has a change of heart and tries to go ""legit"" even though he so eagerly immersed himself into the power and control of the Corleone family. And Kay continues to ""hang around"" even though she dreads Michael and all that he stands for. Why?? The movie drags on in parts and never really gains it's true identity untill the end of the film during the opera scene. Not even Winona Ryder who was scheduled to be cast in the part of Mary could have helped. It only serves to give us an appetite for the earlier two films. Both of which I consider masterpieces."
"bob the moo","Null","129","178","25 July 2002"," Not as bad as everyone says  but suffers from the pressure of the first two
","Michael Corleone has sold his illegal business in an attempt to win back his family.  However he must still contend with up and coming mobsters such as Vincent, who wants to work for him and Joey Zasa, who wants to fully take over the Corleone family's territory.  When the Corleone family begin to deal with the Vatican and plan to buy out their share of an multinational corporation he finds that the Vatican is just as corrupt as his illegal operations were.  Despite his best efforts he finds himself sucked back into the world he has tried to leave behind.<br/><br/>Easily one of the most hated films ever made  or at least you'd think it was by the critical mauling it got for a raft of reasons.  However watching it now it isn't that bad and really it only suffers from comparison with the two films before it.  But lets be fair, Coppola has made 3 or 4 of the best films ever made  did we really expect another one from him?<br/><br/>The film has a reasonable plot and brings the trilogy to a logical end.  The plot however does have it's weaknesses  for example it starts well with Michael's attempt to `get out' being hampered by other families on their way up.  But when it starts to get involved with money laundering through the Vatican and the corruption therein, it starts to lose it's way and it's focus on Michael.<br/><br/>The main weakness comes in the characters.  Would Michael really go straight just to get his family back  and how come he managed to do it so easily up till the time of the film?  Worse still is Connie who seems to have become some sort of Mafia widow when that was not part of her character in the previous films  would she really have got that twisted or influential? Little problems like these just bugged me and they also fed into the performances.<br/><br/>For such a great cast the acting was very average.  Pacino is good but I sensed he didn't see Michael turning out this way and he didn't convince occasionally.  Keaton has little to do and again I felt that her approach to Michael was too forgiving, although maybe I'm not allowing for time.  As I Siad before Shire was doing some sort of `Bride of Frankenstein' act as Connie and I didn't buy it for a moment.  Garcia was OK and faces like Wallach, Hamilton and the like helped.  The two worst performances were sadly two of the main ones.  First Joe Mantegna..now it wasn't that it was bad  it was more that I've seen him do so much better.  Here all I could think of when I watched him was how his character and his acting was very like his Simpsons' character of ` Fat Tony'.  Bare in mind Fat Tony is meant to be a spoof of the Mafioso characters and you'll see why I didn't like it.<br/><br/>The worse performance was Sofia Coppola.  Now she was vilified at the time for her role  a bit unfairly and cruelly but she was still bad.  She has this strange scowl on her face for most of the film and she acts like a spoil little girl.  She also has no realism in her voice and speaks in the same constant tone  that Vincent would fall for her was just a leap of faith too far to accept.  The cast does have others who are unused or underused  Fonda being the best example.  Why did she bother with that role!?<br/><br/>Overall, this is miles behind the other two Godfathers and it has plenty of weaknesses.  However at it's heart it's a good try as the concluding part and the story is watchable.  It's not bad, it just is average and it feels like the director and large sections of the cast felt they just had to turn up to make a third classic film."
"Brunokid","10","114","161","4 January 2004"," This movie is greatly misunderstood and it has become popular opinion to say it is bad.
","The Godfather Part three is a great movie but many would contest. This final installment of the greatest trilogy ever made is misunderstood by most because they do not see what this film is really about. G3 is  not about hits and gangland killings, but rather, G3 is about the end of Michael Corleone's legacy of crime in America. This movie shows him stepping out of the gambling and the other rackets because they have hurt him so badly. This movie is a masterpiece because it shows the conclusion to an incredible story. There had to be an end to this trilogy and this thoughtful way to do it exemplified the trilogy as an unbeatable one. Just because it doesn't end with a violent scene like the murder of the heads of the 5 families does not make it a bad movie, but in this case, a beautiful one. Please, don't feel you have to agree with the common view by proxy, but think on your own about what this movie really means and how it concludes and consequences the first two."

","I finally saw it ! As a total devotee of the two previous installments, I avoided seeing the third one, on purpose, people I respect had told me about the disappointment and, quite honestly, I didn't go there. Last night I did and surprise, surprise, it moved me no end. Maybe because I haven't seen the other two in four years. Yes at times is more Ken Russell than Francis Ford Coppola and in my book that's not a bad thing. I was, however, a bit taken aback by the healing in Pacino's Michael as far as Keaton's Kay is concerned. As it nothing had ever happened, while in Diane Keaton the memory of that pain is always present. Talia Shire is a lot of fun as a sort of Madame Sin. Raf Vallone, superb as the doomed Pope John Paul I and then a bit puzzling casting choices that I think they me code for something. George Hamilton, for instance, takes over from where Rubert Duvall left off. Helmut Berger plays the head of the Vatican Bank. Helmut Berger! Just as curious as to find Troy Donahue in The Godfather Part II - All in all, I'm really glad I've seen it and I'm sure I'll see it again."
"revival05","6","56","77","23 December 2011"," It simply doesn't work very well
","Being an optimistic fellow I wanted to enjoy The Godfather Part III the first time I saw it - this was easy, since its a competent piece of film making, generally well paced, acted, it's coherent, Al Pacino's in it, Coppola has made this film from A to Z and on its own terms the film doesn't have any inexcusable flaws. (Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she's bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she's playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going ""Hey, Godfather part III isn't as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are!"" Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I'd recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn't hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)<br/><br/>I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not 'bad', certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do ""they"" really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he's Pacino I don't think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He's a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he's made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil's Advocate, you name it, he's right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she's not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn't the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film's best scenes were the one's she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.<br/><br/>Much of everything else simply doesn't work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael's son, played by Franc D'Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael's marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn't interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; ""I remember this"" he smiles, though I'm not sure if we are to understand this as ""I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night""; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.<br/><br/>There's no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there's really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don't see why the film's few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It's not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn't work very well."
"BrandtSponseller","9","72","105","16 May 2005"," Bucking the conventional wisdom
","Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather, Part II (1974) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.<br/><br/>I suppose that if I do not love being a contrarian, I do not love anything, but it's not that I set out to be contrarian for its own sake. It just happens when I'm honest about my tastes and views. My latest flourish of contrarianism is that I think The Godfather, Part III is just as good as The Godfather, Part II, even though it's a quite different film, loaded with conspicuously different messages. And although most of Part III's scenes, except the extended climax, never quite reach the sublime excellence of much of Part II, Part III doesn't have near the flaws, either. Both films ended up being a 9 out of 10 for me, or a low ""A"".<br/><br/>Part III is all about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) seeking redemption and forgiveness. We see him haunted by one of the stronger, more shocking moments from Part II. And so he has decided to sincerely go ""legit"", while getting back to his roots, trying to regain what he has lost and maybe even ""redo"" the mistakes he has made. Thus he heads back to New York and eventually back to Sicily. In the opening party scene we see him even trying to make amends with his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton). The most important plot points all have to do with Michael learning to compromise and even let go of some control. The most tragic elements of the film are rooted in the things for which he has difficulty relinquishing control, and we feel a much more ""real"" threat to Michael's safety because of the unintentional losses of control that he experiences.<br/><br/>Of course, the irony ends up being that the ""legit"" world is just as corrupt, if not more so, as the world he's trying to redeem himself from. Michael is ""forced"" to resort to his old modus operandi if he wants to participate, survive and succeed. Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo thus create something of a classical tragedy, with a pessimistic message about human relations; one that also suggests a reinterpretation of the previous two Godfather films as metaphors for socio-economic machinations in general--not just a soap-operatic tale of a powerful Mafia family.<br/><br/>Unlike The Godfather and Part II, Coppola remains tightly focused on his principal themes here. Even though the film seems almost as sprawling as the previous two on first glance, and it suffers slightly from also having a bloated cast, in retrospect, there is nothing present in Part III that isn't meant to be tied in with the subtexts. Even seemingly inconsequential scenes, such as Michael and Kay encountering the marionette show, provide artistic, literary connections to significant plot points. In this case the scene provides both foreshadowing and metaphor for the most substantial element of the climax.<br/><br/>By the way, it's interesting to note that Coppola introduces somewhat erotic (though very tame) scenes for the first time here (that's not to say that past Godfather films didn't suggest romances or sex, but they weren't really erotic). Surprisingly, perhaps, the chief erotic scenes involve his daughter, Sofia, who is shown in a relationship as close to incestuous as possible without being incestuous, and who also has an unpleasant fate in the film. When we also remind ourselves of the filmic treatment that director Dario Argento subjected his daughter, Asia, and his significant other, Daria Nicolodi, to over the years, it might make us want to psychoanalyze Italian filmmakers, but it's helpful to remember that initially, Sofia Coppola's role was to be played by Winona Ryder, who was too sick at the time to begin shooting.<br/><br/>The cast in Part III is sometimes cited as one of the reasons for its inferiority, but despite the relative shortage of megastars, I think the cast, including Sofia, is fantastic here. Godfather newcomer Andy Garcia was particularly impressive.<br/><br/>Coppola again uses Part I for a structural template, just as he did in Part II, but he tries to throw in subtle variations and even red herrings. Like its predecessors, Part III begins with a party celebrating an important familial event related to religious ceremonies wherein we meet the principal players, the middle section deals with similar business dilemmas mixed with betrayals, double crossings and their consequences, and the ending parallels a major shakedown involving multiple parties with some other important familial event imbued with ritual/ceremony (the parallel was slightly different in Part II).<br/><br/>The subtle variations here involve what could be called ""tags"". For example, the beginning puts us in a more formal religious ceremony before we move to the party, and the ending has a tag that could be one of the most ingenious transitions/scenes that Coppola has written. We move from a profoundly tragic event to a point much later in time. Not one word of dialogue is spoken. Through mere appearance of character and setting, plus the final, sad event, there is as much ""said"" or implied in one elegant minute as there was in the entire film up to that point--although what preceded was necessary for the pithy implicature.<br/><br/>The technical elements, though good here, cannot quite match those of Parts I and II. This may be more surprising when we realize that the same people worked on both films in many capacities, but it just underscores that elements such as the intense, unusual, deeply lit scenes of Part II, for example, happened as much by a ""magic"" confluence of events as they happened intentionally, which may be why no one has quite been able to capture that look again, including here. On the other hand, even though the music is excellent in all three films, for my money, it might be best integrated in Part III, especially the melancholy theme that periodically recurs."

","""The Godfather Part III"" isn't really a necessary sequel, and to be truthful it's not really one of the best sequels in recent memory, but is it a bad film? No. In fact, had it not been for the extraordinary first two films, I firmly believe this movie would have been hailed as an epic; but due to such a broad expanse of years from the second film (1974) to this one (1990), audiences were given too much time to work up extreme expectations, especially with the major success of the first sequel. Many people just expected another equal sequel. It's just a good sequel.<br/><br/>Al Pacino returns to his role of Don Michael Corleone, much older since we last saw him and with a daughter (Sofia Coppola, Francis' daughter). He is still split from his (ex)-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) has since passed to the other side, though rumors have it his character was originally in Ford and Mario Puzo's script, only to be dumped when Duvall turned down the script because he believed Pacino was getting too much attention. (Though I have my doubts over the accuracy of that rumor.)<br/><br/>Michael wants out of the Mafia. He wants to work legitimate. He's been trying to turn his business into legit dealings for a while now, and he realizes that the sins of his past will never completely go away. He decides to hand the reigns of power over to his ex-brother Fredo's son (Andy Garcia), a young, eager soul with energy and excitement. But things do not go so well. Michael tries to be a mentor to his trainee but it is a difficult task. Michael goes through turbulent times, not to mention that he must deal with his daughter falling in love with the future head of the family (they're cousins, which, when you think about it, is just plain nasty).<br/><br/>Michael tries to get his son interested in becoming the head of the family, but he will have no part of it. He is bent on becoming an opera singer, to turn from his family's past and ignore his father's pleads. Michael is left with some difficult choices, and we see that all the power in the world can't control the inevitable.<br/><br/>""The Godfather Part III"" has its flaws. One of them is the casting of Michael's daughter with Coppola's daughter - she has, one might say, no acting ability whatsoever. Garcia is bright and talented, and fits the part he is playing. Pacino isn't quite as energetic and powerful as he was in the first two films, in fact he looks pretty tired here, but I believe that's the point.<br/><br/>Some people really hate this film. I thought it was quite good. It's a good continuation, though I do not hesitate to admit it could have been much better. The film seems a bit corny at times, and there are some bad casting choices, one of which I have already mentioned above. But it is an entertaining film, one that no ""Godfather"" fan should go without seeing. It's a worthy (hopefully) last installment, one that gives more of the same but still manages to hold the audience's interest.<br/><br/>There are rumors flying everywhere of yet another ""Godfather"" entry, but quite honestly I think it's a bad decision. They should leave the series as it is and move on to other projects. Puzo is dead. Coppola hasn't made a good film in years - heck, he hasn't even produced a good film in years. Al Pacino's character would be hard to bring back, and if you've seen this film you know what I'm talking about. A prequel would just be messy and unexplained, not to mention confusing. To follow Andy Garcia's character would seem pointless - some things should be left to our imagination. I doubt as to the importance of another sequel, as it would, at this point, just be a cash-in.<br/><br/>The script by Coppola and Puzo is interesting, but it seems too try a bit too hard to be an epic at times. It just serves as a reminder that this film was not needed as an intallment in the series. ""The Godfather Part"" was great, ""The Godfather Part II"" was superb, ""The Godfather Part III"" is probably the best film of 1990. Which, looking back at twenty years from now, probably won't amount to a hill of beans. But it's a start.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

","Coppola really didn't want to make this movie but the studio prodded him and provided a lavish budget so he took another stab at it. However, he was now unable to get the cast he wanted. Duvall asked for too much money, so the role of consiglieri was reduced to that of George Hamilton's infrequent appearance as a plain legal adviser. Coppola could now shoot on various locations without fear of being fired but it was no longer The Family he'd been so proud of.<br/><br/>I don't really have too much to say about this venture. It's a little sad. Coppola is a sensitive family man. He loves babies. And he blames critics for condemning the movie because he cast his daughter. I don't know whether he's right or not. She looks proper for the part of the virginal Italian girl, not exotic or spectacularly beautiful but innocent. Her performance is hard to judge from one role. She comes across as natural rather than as a seasoned actress. It fits her role but it's hard to tell what her range might be. Diane Keaton was available, probably because not many parts were coming her way, but there is no spark between her and Pacino, just a wan regret without moment.<br/><br/>But Coppola is wrong in believing that the movie failed because of Sofia. The movie failed because it was a watered-down and meandering story that seemed without point. The material -- Al Pacino, his family relationships and his intrigues -- is no longer fresh. There is no novelty in it.<br/><br/>And sometimes it seems as if the elements that are important to the director are more personal than portentous. He may find it shocking that a newly elected Pope could be assassinated. I doubt that most people care as much as he does, especially since we hardly get to know Raf Vallone. The whole Vatican provides not much more than a backdrop for colorfully robed figures having business meetings and enacting rituals.<br/><br/>I'm happy for Coppola that he was able to cast his father as the local band leader in Sicily. And I like Coppola's personality. He's growing wine now in Napa or somewhere. And when I lived in San Francisco he owned a small underground restaurant, Tomasso's, where the customers waiting for a table could tap the wine barrel in the dark, tiny room as often as they liked and get half lit during their wait. The wait was worth while. The clams cuscus were a rarely encountered treat.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend the movie as highly as the restaurant."
"franco-10","10","320","512","26 December 1998"," Underrated
","Godfather III is generally underrated because because it is more intellectual, subtle, and psychological than the first two.  There's lots more Italian language, operatic venues, references to subtleties like the P2 masonic lodge, and there is the inner revelation of Michael Corleone's soul. Pacino should have won an Oscar for his performance.  The movie would be a good staging point for a Godfather IV, with ""Vincenzo Corleone"" and Connie Corleone running things, while developing further the relationship between Michael, and his wife and son."
"rbarnes-1","3","69","103","4 July 2010"," Worst of the three. By far.
","Many of the reviews of this seem too positive. The movie was deeply flawed and love for the early Godfather films should not blind us to the fiasco that was number 3. <br/><br/>Casting problems: Diane Keaton said all she needed to say in part 2. Her presence in the part 3 added nothing whatsoever. We learn from her dialog that she will always love Michael but that she will never accept his gangster ways. Yeah. We learned that in part 2. George Hamilton as the lawyer/confident. Lame. Sophia Coppola as Mary. She comes across like a dull-witted 16-year-old that doesn't know a thing about acting but thinks it is fun to be able to stand in front of a camera. (spoiler alert) the primary dramatic event of the movie involved her death. By that time I was hoping that she would be killed off (or at least get no more screen time), so my ability to feel any emotional impact at the death of this air-headed monstrosity.<br/><br/>Dialog problems: The dialog in Michael's study in the initial scene is painful to hear. The movie gets better, but very awkward dialog pops up every 20 minutes or so throughout the movie. Part of the problem is the screen play and part of the problem is that at times the actors don't know how to effectively deliver their lines.<br/><br/>Plot problems: Awkward casting & dialog aside, I think this is the biggest problem. when you get to be one of the wealthiest business men in the world, wacking people no longer makes any sense. When you have untold millions at your disposal, you find that you a wide range of tools to accomplish your aims, and most of these tools work better than bullets (anyone remember the last time a Fortune 500 CEO was taken out in a mob hit?). (spoiler alert) There is a scene in which one of the baddies flies a helicopter outside a penthouse ballroom in a high rise building and then occupants of the helicopter riddle the ballroom with machine gun fire killing dozens of wealthy business men. This would be par for the course in the Matrix, or True Lies, or Commando, but this type of violence is not part of the real world we live in. It's cartoonishness is at odds with the other Godfather films and makes it difficult to take this film seriously. As well paced and tense as the final opera house scene was, it was also in the category of cartooney violence. Did the best assassin in all of Italy really think the cleverest way to kill one of the richest men on the planet was to slip into a well guarded public place, kill off a bunch of hired body guards and then shoot a man in front of 1000 witnesses? Well, I guess the screenwriter thought so. The end result was a complete mess. The narrative flow of the final film was a train wreck. The plot elements went back from somewhat believable to overblown Hollywood insanity and back again."

","Near the beginning of ""The Godfather: Part III,"" Michael Corleone's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician. Michael Corleone does not want this. But his estranged ex-wife, Kay, manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes. So he does.<br/><br/>That seems like an odd way to start a review, as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action. Just bear with me here; you'll see where I'm going with this eventually. Now let me tell you about the major plot. It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good (he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business). But then along comes Vincent Mancini, an illegitimate nephew, who is involved in a feud. So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff. Meanwhile, Vincent has a semi-incestuous affair with Michael's daughter Mary. Oh, and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.<br/><br/>It is like a soap opera. One horrid, awful, 169-minute soap opera. Gone is any sort of the sophistication, romance, and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard. After a 16-year break in the franchise, Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films, once again proving his last great work was ""Apocalypse Now"" back in the 1970's.<br/><br/>What's worse, ""The Godfather: Part III"" isn't even a logical follow-up of ""The Godfather: Part II."" Michael is a completely different person. He hasn't just gone to seed (which might be legitimate, even if it'd be no fun to watch). He's become a goody-goody that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough, but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating. He also gets back together with Kay! For heaven's sakes, there is absolutely no way that should happen, as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear! She aborted his baby, and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it. Didn't Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on Mary and Vincent's affair! For a romance so forbidden, it was shockingly unengaging. Sofia Coppola's acting did nothing to help. She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it, because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee. Every line she delivered was painfully memorized, and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities, all she elicited was inappropriate giggles. In the climactic scene--I won't go into detail, but you'll know which scene I'm talking about when/if you watch it--she looks at Michael and says, ""......Daddy?"" I think I was meant to cry, but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long, loud laughter!<br/><br/>Now we get to the climax, and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone's musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances, Anthony Corleone returns... with an opera! So Michael, Kay, Mary, and Vincent go to see it, and for about 10-15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael. About this climactic sequence, I must say one thing: It was really good! But not because of the killers--they were pretty boring. I just really liked the opera. It had some great music and real great set pieces. And, from what little it showed us, it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family's origin. I'll bet it was one swell opera, and I'll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.<br/><br/>My biggest wish is this: that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama. Better yet, I wish he hadn't made ""The Godfather: Part III"" at all. Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was self-indulgent and unnecessary.<br/><br/>P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film. I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago (though I was rewatching the first one). Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III weren't screwed (in fact, I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard), but it also means I've had a good time to think about all three films. While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first, the more I thought about it, the better it seemed. But with Part III, it was bad to begin with, then got worse the more I thought about it. The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I, but if they watch Part II as well, they will most likely go on to Part III. If you have the will, watch Parts I & II and pretend like Part III never existed."

By the end I was wishing Mary Corleone had been killed at the beginning.<br/><br/>Suggestion for those who loved the first movie: read the book and then go watch the first movie again.

"gsoares","Null","15","19","10 May 2002"," As Al Pacino has said, ""part III was a mistake"".
","Attention: if you have not seen the movie, do not read on. I don´t suppose I put spoilers in, but I might for this is such a classic.<br/><br/>
I spent heavy bucks on the recent DVD box and I´m proud of it. But there´s no way to avoid noticing the gap between second and third parts. Not the time gap, because that was of course well taken care of by the brilliant producing and directing. The same cast is there, and with the great addition of 15 years. That makes Michael and Kay controversial, loveXhate relationship even more appealing and dramatic, for now they are mature and have all the wrinkles to prove.<br/><br/>But as Al Pacino said in a recent interview, the attempt for redemption doesn´t fit with Don Corleone. That is a fact. That may be a flaw in Mario Puzo´s story, but that is greatly expectable. As long as you have read ""Omerttà"" or ""The Last Don"" you do understand me: not all of his stories are as perfect as the Godfather.<br/><br/>Think of the cold stare Michael gave the Cop that punched him on part one just before and moments after killing him point blank. And also of the look in his face when he shows up unexpectedly at the house and finds Kay secretly visiting their children: he never says a word. Walks towards her, gets real close and, when she starts wondering ""is this forgiving time?"" he closes the door - we glance at the desperate look Diane Keaton throws at him for a second, but he doesn´t. To me this shot is specially revealing of how cold and stone hearted a Don has to be. The woman aborted his son on purpose. She is let to live, but to him she is dead.<br/><br/>And, as part three goes on, he befriends her again after what, fifteen years? Too human for a Don. Specially Michael, who got appointed by Vitto as the greatest Don ever. What about the scene beside the coffin? That is lame, and is the only part I don´t like in the whole series. Even Pacino did not pull that one off, and the extra disc on the DVD Edition shows it clearly: Coppola tries to guide him through the dialog and the sobbing. It just doesn´t work.<br/><br/>And on a final note, I stick with the majority regarding Sofia Coppola: she is terrible. The theater scene is the climax of the film and she could easily have made it flop. Still, as a director, she has proven herself worthy of the Coppola name. Good thing Nicholas Cage did not stick to it."
"nuferjer","1","124","205","14 June 2001"," This cliched film corrupts the meaning of the first two Godfather films
","The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of. The Godfather Part II shows that young man's acceptance of his new role, his desensitization of character, as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors, but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michael's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies. Michael's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in: protecting his family.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows: having his own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him: family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed."
"smerph","Null","7","8","5 July 2002"," Part three : The Anti- Climax
","You wouldn't think it was possible to make a three hour film in which very little happens, but Francis Ford Coppola succeeded with this decidedly average and woeful anti-climax to his Mafia saga. <br/><br/>The flaws are glaringly obvious : a lack of characters from the first two parts (Robert Duvall being a prime example) looses the whole family feel of the trilogy. Andy Garcia (as Vincenzo) is brought in to bolster up the development of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) but the character never develops past an awkward romantic sub-plot involving his cousin... ..which brings us onto Sofia Coppola. Much has been written about her acting ability, or lack of, and this reviewer will only comment that if you don't know what she looks like - or which character she plays, you'll be able to work it out pretty quickly.   <br/><br/>The film starts promisingly enough, but loses it's way in the middle, which is overly-complicated. However it is the finale that lets the film - and the trilogy down. The murder of a principal character would be effective, but for the fact that the principal character is only principal to THIS film, and not parts 1 or 2<br/><br/>Seemingly aware of this, Coppola jumps several years into the future for the supposedly dramatic death of Michael. But, there is little spectacle surrounding this either. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you have sat through Parts 1 and 2, this is pretty essential viewing. Just don't get your hopes up."

I know the two shouldn't be compared, but the fact that they are both gangster films begs some sort of comparison.<br/><br/>Does Godfather III ""complete"" Coppola's Godfather series? Only in the sense that we see what happens to Michael when he is an old man.  In my opinion, we didn't really need to know that.  To me, the Godfather films ended with Michael Corleone as a shell of a man after losing his wife and murdering his brother.<br/><br/>Besides, I'm of the view that the best American films of the 20th century were made in the 1970s."
"GusF","Null","9","11","30 May 2015"," A dull and pointless sequel
","After its two excellent predecessors, this is bitterly disappointing. None of the various story lines are terribly interesting and I think that the kissing cousins plot was a dreadful idea. The best parts of the film are the scenes between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, who play the tense relationship between Michael and Kay very well, but their performances are not on the same level as in the first two films. This would not have been a major problem if the film had been better but it places far too much reliance on the previous films to the point that it is difficult to fully understand or even care about the characters and events if you are not familiar with them. <br/><br/>I wasn't very interested in the idea of Michael's quest for redemption but could have been handled far better. The film was nominated for Best Picture but I don't think that it deserved to be. It felt more like someone else trying to emulate the ""Godfather"" films than a true ""Godfather"" film itself. For instance, the intertwining of the killings with the opera performance was a failed attempt to recreate the brilliant baptism scene of the first film. At 2 hours and 50 minutes, it was far too long and very badly paced. Honestly, my favourite line in the film is when Joey Zasa says, ""And we got Don Ameche, who played the guy that invented the telephone"" since Ameche is one of my all time favourite actors.<br/><br/>The best newcomers are the always brilliant Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna and Donal Donnelly. George Hamilton and Bridget Fonda are wasted. Robert Duvall's absence is extremely noticeable and Andy Garcia, who is not a very good actor, is just forgettable as Vincent. Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone is pretty horrific but much of the blame has to be attributed to her father Francis Ford Coppola for casting her. He should have been able to see that she could not act to save her life. One of her lines - delivered atrociously - is ""Dad, why are you doing this to me?"" I'd have said the same thing in real life if I were her. Coppola's well known propensity for nepotism proved successful in the casting of his sister Talia Shire in this trilogy - she has more screen time in this film than the first two combined but far less interesting material, incidentally - and his nephew Nicolas Cage in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"". However, after Winona Ryder dropped out of this film, it would have probably been a good idea if he looked for an actress outside of his immediate family to replace her. <br/><br/>Overall, this is not a dreadful or even a particularly bad one. It's just dull. However, I don't think that this is a film that needed to be made. This is the weakest final entry in a film trilogy that I have ever seen. It's certainly for the best that ""The Godfather Part IV"" was never made."
"bkoganbing","10","51","81","22 March 2008"," Mother Of Mercy, Is This The End Of The Corleones?
","The Godfather Trilogy may have reached its end with The Godfather: Part III. But was there enough room to allow for yet another film based on another generation of the Corleones? Time and public demand will only tell.<br/><br/>I liked The Godfather: Part III right up to and including Sofia Coppola's much maligned performance as Mary Corleone daughter of Don Michael Corleone, the one and only Al Pacino. I think she was unjustly criticized. In her performance she set out to play one of the innocent children of Al Pacino. <br/><br/>There's a moving scene in The Godfather where we saw Al Pacino and Marlon Brando talking for the last time. Brando's hopes were for his son to become Governor Corleone, Senator Corleone to attain that level of respectability that was out of the Don's reach. Pacino tells him, maybe the next generation.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the late seventies where Pacino has slowly divested himself of the illegal interests of the Corleone family. But the other crime bosses don't like the idea of him going completely legitimate. He also has some opposition within his own family. His surviving sibling Talia Shire thinks he ought to keep a hand in and his illegitimate nephew, Andy Garcia is having a running feud with another family head, Joe Mantegna.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia got the only acting nomination for The Godfather: Part III as Sonny's son out of wedlock. And he's every bit as wild and hot tempered as Sonny was from The Godfather. Garcia brings a lot of passion to the part. But he does prove able to learn from his uncle and eventually not repeat the mistakes of his father. Garcia lost to another hoodlum portrayal, Joe Pesci for Goodfellas for Best Suppporting Actor.<br/><br/>Probably Al Pacino has gotten all he could out of the character of Michael Corleone. He's gotten real respectability now, he's been conferred with a Papal Knightship for the good works of the Corleone Foundation now. He's high up the criminal world too. But people and circumstances won't let those worlds mix and as he ruefully remarks, ""just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in again.""<br/><br/>Only four characters made it through the three Godfather films, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Richard Bright as Al Neri. All except Neri seem to grow in character, Neri is still button man in chief since Lucabrazzi started sleeping with the fishes in The Godfather. Keaton's character is still the outsider. Separated from Pacino in The Godfather: Part II, she still loves him and regrets as much as he has the outside forces that caused their separation.<br/><br/>Although Talia Shire got an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress in The Godfather: Part II, I think she really comes into her own in this one. Had it not been for male chauvinism implicit in the Sicilian culture, she'd be taking over the family business from Pacino. She's changed so dramatically over the course of the three films. In The Godfather she's the innocent daughter about to embark on marriage to a wife beater. In The Godfather: Part II, she's now entering middle age, overindulging in excesses, unhappy as a many time married widow, her first husband being killed in the original Godfather. She lives on the sufferance and tolerance of her brother. Now in The Godfather: Part III she takes an active interest in the family business and the family legacy. She realizes more than Pacino there's no escaping the Corleone roots. She champions Garcia as the new Don, she knows he's got the chops for the job, she hopes he can develop the smarts as does Pacino.<br/><br/>Eli Wallach contributes a fine performance as another aging crime Don who's got a lot more to him than when we first meet him. Raf Vallone plays Pope John Paul I and the urban legend of his sudden demise after a one month papacy is woven into the Corleone story. As is Joe Mantegna who plays an undisguised version of Brooklyn mob boss Joe Columbo.<br/><br/>I'm sure if the money's right and a workable screenplay is developed we may not have seen the last of the Corleones. There was one talked about a few years ago. Still if it never develops, The Godfather: Part III is a fine film to end the saga."

It completely ruined what was before the best film series ever, Robert Duvall was right to have gotten out of this film as was Winona Rider, I still can't believe Al Pacino didn't join them. Not to mention Francis Ford Coppola who should have also known better than the make this. I must say this may not be one of the worst movies I have ever seen but it is for sure one of the most disappointing films ever, and also the biggest drop from one film to it's sequel, there usually big but from the second best film ever to this piece of crap? Not usually that big. The story and script are heavy handed and filled with clichés and bad dialogue. The performances are good by Talia Shire and Diane Keaton, and great by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia, but Soffia Coppola is amazingly horrible, she should have gone straight to directing. The direction is horrible what was Francis Ford Coppola asleep? Or did he just let the actors direct themselves? The visual effects are crap and just don't work, they are even worse than the other films made twenty years before.

","This is my third time watching GF3, with about 8-9 years between each viewing. I probably won't watch it again. It's not just that it pales in comparison to the first two movies. Watching it now, completely separated from its predecessors, makes that clear. In fact, for a while I was thinking ""eh, this isn't so bad"". But it really is. Slow and boring, with a complicated web of Vatican blah blah that is too hard to follow, and yet all the major emotional themes are presented in a wretchedly blunt fashion. Everyone pretty much blurts out exactly what they're feeling. I think Eli Wallach and Talia Shire might be the only decent performances in the movie. And speaking of performances... you know where I'm going with this. Sofia Coppola has taken a lot of crap for her role in this film (and Francis for casting her), and deserves every bit of it. She's awful, awful, awful. There are a few lyrical sequences and intriguing elements, but overall it's a dull, muddled, heavy-handed mess."
"ntvnyr30","4","29","46","8 May 2006"," Embarrassingly bad in some respects
","The flaws in this picture are well-known but I'll start with some other noticeable, less mentioned incongruities: why does Talia Shire's character Connie all of a sudden has a heavy Brooklyn accent in contrast to the first 2 films? Her accent sounded terribly out of place and was a distraction. Coppola should have corrected this. Also, I noticed a lot of double-breasted suits and longish hair on some male characters. I don't remember this style as being popular in the late 70's---more like the time around when the film was made. One more: the gratuitously violent ""hit"" scene in Atlantic City. That was something more akin to an B-movie action director rather than a great auteur like Coppola who I consider to be a modern-day Orson Welles in many respects. Coppola's body of work (i.e. ""Tucker"" and ""The Cotton Club"") will one day be appreciated just like Welles' work is finally getting its recognition. Unfortunately the appreciation usually happens when you're dead. Another misstep, in my opinion, were the constant flashback scenes from the previous films. I mean--everyone knows these by heart by now. There was no need to show these flashbacks--unless they were meant as filler.<br/><br/>Now for the major mistakes: Robert Duvall's absence hurt badly. Duvall allegedly told Coppola: ""Let's be honest, this is not about art. It's about money,"" which was obviously true. Why didn't they just pay Duvall the money? Because of Duvall's absence, the script was overhauled. I am curious what the film would have been like had Duvall accepted. Despite his absence, George Hamilton did a very nice job as the Corleone's WASP lawyer (an interesting side note: maybe Coppola thought that the final product would be better since Robert Castellano was supposed to be in Part II, but asked for too much money and was written out of the script. A fascinating tidbit was that Castellano was the highest paid actor in ""The Godfather"").<br/><br/>My apologies to Coppola about the flack he tolerated about his daughter's inclusion in this film and her ""performance."" But let's be real, Andy Garcia falling for her? And speaking of bad acting, Eli Wallach should be tried in court for the most egregious crime of overacting. I think the long layoff after Godfather Part II made Coppola's casting skills atrophy a bit, not unlike George Lucas's casting mistakes a few years later in the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>Even more painful than Soffia's addition was the lousy dialogue, especially between Michael and Kay. Every attempt was made to ""hit the home run"" and give her the one-line zingers that were quite frankly painfully embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>I think it's a shame because the nucleus of the film--about corruption in the Vatican and the possible murder of a pope was very intriguing and done properly, this could have been a great film. Unfortunately it could only be called fair at best."

From the vanity casting of Sophia Coppola, to the stupefyingly boring subplot of the Vatican banking scandal, to the all-sunshiney cinematography, to the sophomoric references to King Lear, it is on a much lower plane than Coppola's earlier films.  The boxed set is like getting Citizen Kane, Chinatown and Porky's III as a trilogy.  Not to mention the fact that the beginning of Godfather III is inconsistent with the ending of Godfather II.

If it was all about revealing Michael's wounded mind, and ensuring that he was 'punished for his sins', that was done (quite well, and in a much less graphic way) in Part II: You could tell he was undone in the very last scene.  Part III was just overkill.<br/><br/>There were a few casting problems, as well.  Sofia Coppola was just terrible, absolutely painful to watch.  George Hamilton made the film look like a made-for-TV movie every time he appeared: What was he doing there?? I sure did miss Robert Duvall!  The saving graces were Talia Shire as Connie getting her chance to dominate.  Andy Garcia, though he didn't have the opportunity to really take off, was a lot of fun to watch."

","I was so excited to watch the third installment of The Godfather after watching the first two. I was horribly disappointed. The first two Godfathers were truly works of art. The acting and directing were excellent. Pacino and DeNiro were wonderful. The writers and directors wisely kept Keaton to a minimum in the first two. The first two were intriguing and really told the story of the Corleone family well. However, The Godfather III should not have been made. The acting was terrible. Even Pacino (i am a huge fan) came off as forced acting. Sofia Coppola was absolutely awful. Keaton was such a drag throughout the entire movie. The plot was weak and did not hold my attention. It also seemed like such a ""recycled"" movie from material from the first two. The first 15 minutes of the movie were clips from the first two (and definitely the highlight of III). There was too much Italian opera singing and repetition of the first soundtrack of The Godfather. This movie reminded me of the new Star Wars movies that came out in the 90's and later. Both The Godfather and Star Wars were created in the 1970's were classics and should not have sequels or prequels added to them. Really, if you enjoyed the first two Godfathers, don't watch the third one...it will spoil the experience for you."
"smaybee","1","94","171","27 November 2001"," If you enjoyed the first two, spare yourself the agony of this one
","-This movie is awful on two counts: as a finale to the trilogy and as a stand-alone film. This shows in the poor character development, the abundance of meaningless shots, and lastly, and most importantly in my mind, the meaninglessness of the dialogue. -All of the integrity of the characters from the first two Godfathers is completely done away with in the first sequence. -Michael, a taciturn, introverted, calculating megalomaniac in the first two films is lavish, loose-lipped, pathetic in his control over his family, and careless as he never was and never would have been by the first two movies. -Constanza is all of a sudden involved in the family affairs. Joe Mantegna plays a terribly thin enemy of the family, Joey Zasa, but can't be blamed as an actor with such a flimsy script. Andy Garcia overacts every one of Vincent Corleone's lines and every step--he practically goosesteps. Tom Hagan is missing and leaves a giant hole. It doesn't matter that Sofia Coppola can't act, because she had nothing to work with anyway--she plays a whinging, incestuous brat poorly, but convincingly (!). -The first dramatic sequence involves a conflict between Joey Zasa and Vincent mediated by Michael, who is trying to go legit, but can't seem to do it. Vincent tries to convince Michael that Zasa is ""an enemy"" in a very un-Godfatherly manner: a) he does it right in front of Zasa, b) he does so simply because Zasa supposedly says, ""F*ck Michael Corleone,"" behind his back, and c) he disobeys Michael right in the room by biting Zasa's ear off. -This is juvenile drama. There is no tension that lasts longer than a sequence. There is no reason motivating the characters. There is no real respect for anything--all the subtleties of the family traditions are stomped on, which makes the highly visual sequences, loaded with symbols, cheap because the symbols mean nothing to the characters. -The haughty diction is only pretension void of any understanding of respect and the values that drive the family and Michael in particular. Michael, a very chiseled character in the first two movies, becomes paper thin, with no real idea that is central to his action. All his actions in the first movie and the facades he puts on as Don in the second movie show an aspiration to an ideal or, at least, an aspiration to appear as this ideal. He has none of this in the third film and this change of character doesn't happen on screen, nor is it explained. We're left only to believe that Coppola and Puzo tore this one off in a frenzied weekend when the purse got light. -The story lacks direction, focus, has nothing in particular to say, but that's not condemnable unto itself. The dialogue, however, is worthy of a pair of misguided high school kids who watched the first two movies and figured they knew what respect was because they saw one guy shoot another and a bunch of people get scared. None of the dialogue is loaded with the layers of meaning and subtlety that exist in the first two. All the characters are brash and stereotypical, or, in the case of a few, like Enzo the Baker and Bridget Fonda's character, tokens and a waste of celluloid. -Though Godfather III isn't worth its score in Scrabble, it is, however, a testament to Pacino as an actor, that with such flimsy stuff he still manages to act compellingly."

","I watched The Godfather Part 2 again after not having seen it for a number of years. I fell in love with it for the first time, especially the acting and the cinematography. I felt compelled to see 3 right after that, mainly because I was feeling the glow of the excellence of 2. I was hoping that that 3 was actually better than I had remembered from past viewing, and I was wrong. I've read lots of reviews about the plot and Sophia Coppola's wooden acting and still my major complaint from the get-go is the god-awful acting. Every one in the movie appears false! I just couldn't get beyond how forced each line appeared. Maybe the story was effective yet I couldn't get through enough of the film to understand the plot because of how painful it was to watch each actor deliver his/her lines. It's so excruciatingly obvious that Francis Ford Coppola was not inspired nor were his actors. All in all, the message this film conveys to me is that it was made under duress. It has no artistic connection whatsoever to the previous masterpieces of the same name."

","This movie is way too facile in the way it attempts to resurrect Michael . The whole thing felt like a giant backpedal, and it was just a self serving tour guide with some pretty scenes. In my view, the glossing over of difficult or destroyed relationships actually undoes (not in plot but in spirit) the entire second movie. The acting is second rate, and by the time the plot got rolling, I didn't care. <br/><br/>The love scenes were awkward. Andy Garcia seemed plastic and unbelievable, and Sophia should have stayed behind the camera.<br/><br/>There was some suffering all right, but no Godfather could ever undo the movie goers agony at having to sit through this mess, not even at a daughter''s wedding."

","Part III is dead in the water in every way. It's derivative in plot outline from the first two films; it has some awful acting stints by Pacino, Sophia Coppola, & Talia Shire, among others; and it insults the Catholic Church by positing as truth the murder of a pope. Critics have been way too indulgent with this dog! The Godfather saga seemed appropriately concluded at the end of Part II, when we're left with a heartless Michael aging alone in his blustery Tahoe home. That haunting scene is jettisoned in Part III when we're re-introduced to a redeemed, conscience-stricken Michael. Also, Pacino was the master of understatement in the first two films, so that when he exploded, you took notice. In Part III, alas, he's still stuck in his shouting, out-of-control acting schtick (see ""Heat"" for more of that).<br/><br/>Supposedly the future shoplifting Winona Ryder bowed out of III: but why, oh why would Coppola replace her with his talentless daughter? It's a key role, and her non-performance further taints the film. Stick to the first two!"

The amber lighting...people sitting around eating cannoli...the raspy voices...""Joey ZAZA"", really??, etc. And how many times can the cast say the name Joey Zaza? It should be a drinking game. The dialogue most often borders on absurd. After Michael's ""confession"" to the priest, why is Connie bringing up 'Fredo? Where did that even come from except for a cheap gratuitous explanation of her understanding of his death.<br/><br/>Why does the movie end with the same music used throughout Raging Bull?<br/><br/>Why is GEORGE HAMILTON in this movie? <br/><br/>Why did Coppola insist on using his daughter then dubbing in someone else's voice?

"cruvinel","3","20","32","17 February 2001"," Should not have been made
","I dislike this movie a lot. If you've read the Puzo's books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies (specially the first one), you're going to agree with me.<br/><br/>Compared with the Corleone's saga presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends up reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.<br/><br/>It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone's saga in the 90's, and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before. But, in the other hand, I don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts when they didn't fit. Why this? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities.<br/><br/>What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written this. How come? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo's novel ""The Last Don"" is a 90's story about the mob, and it is great. We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III."

","Okay, so I've just finished yet another Godfather trilogy marathon.<br/><br/>Part I and Part II are cinematic masterpieces that rightly deserve high praise heaped upon them from now until forever - but Part III simply doesn't hold a candle to either of its predecessors.<br/><br/>I suspect that the only reason this movie got the green light was because studio execs. thought that the renewed public interest in the American Mafia in the late 1980's would translate into box office gold for a Godfather sequel.<br/><br/>The problem is that this movie is not the same type of film as its predecessors - which are powerful character-driven tragedies that happen to centre around a crime family, whereas this is a gangster/political conspiracy movie that happens to feature Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>The fact that the plot of this movie features a (now discredited) conspiracy theory about papal assassination lifted straight from the pages of another book should tell you everything you need to know about its originality.<br/><br/>Sofia Coppola's acting was simply not up to the standard of the previous films, or of the other cast members in this film, and as a result there is a major audience disconnect with her character - which all but destroys the impact of her 'romance' with Vincent, and her eventual death, both of which are supposed to be central to the emotional heart and climax of this movie.<br/><br/>While the previous two films featured intricate storytelling involving an ensemble cast, this one felt like a patchwork that was thrown together and ran far too long - the final assassination scenes are so convoluted that it's no longer even clear who is killing who... and to make matters worse, as an audience member, and Godfather fan, I no longer even cared anyway.<br/><br/>The emotional depth of the first two films is missing from this one, and instead it is replaced with contrived sentimentality and clichéd dialogue that often doesn't even make any sense in light of the previous character development (like when Kay tells Michael that she has always loved him, and always will - yet her actions in Part II, and even the start of this film are completely at odds with such a suggestion).<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this feels like little more than hollow cinematic reminiscing (consider the way that Sicily is forcefully thrown into the plot of this movie, compared to the natural and obvious way that it features in the first two films - it's almost like this film is being made to a formula, where the filmmakers are adding concepts and plot developments based on what they think the audience liked in the first two films).<br/><br/>Godfather III simply did not need to be made, as all it does is rehash the plot of the first two films, except in a far less convincing and skillful way - the movie even ends the same as Part II does: with Michael all alone, having attained all he fought so hard to achieve, but also forced to accept all of the unforeseen and tragic consequences that go along with the life he has embraced."

Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep and Glenda Jackson in their prime would have failed in this part as the daughter of Michael Corleone...so give Francis Ford's kid a break...Also, I loved Andy Garcia, but alas, even he could not save this sequel.

"ElMaruecan82","8","12","18","20 May 2011"," The ""Fredo"" of the Godfather Trilogy ...
","It's funny how some personal circumstances are the key elements that influence our judgment. In my case, ""The Godfather Part III"", was not the last opus of a magnificent saga, but the first film I watched from the trilogy, my first encounter with the Corleone Family, a cinematic love story that would never end.<br/><br/>Speaking of love, I always wondered how a movie like ""The Godfather Part III"" had crystallized so much hatred and disdain. The unforgettable ""Never hate your enemies, because it clouds your judgment"" is like a self-defense cry, from a film that wanted so much to be respected like its glorious predecessors, but apparently failed to, for even the fans will always concede after they say how the movie is great  ""but not as great as the two others"" <br/><br/>So, as a fourteen-year old kid, I loved ""The Godfather Part III"", I couldn't complain about the absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. I wasn't mature enough to judge Sofia Coppola's acting abilities though I found something physically odd in her. From Michael's relationship with Kay to his haircut, ""Part III"" was my reference. And I guess I loved the movie for what it was: a great story with an unforgettable climax.<br/><br/>Till now, I can't watch the ending, even the clip, without crying, it broke my heart the first time, and it always does, even after so many viewings. It was like I felt the devastation of a man whose life's only meaning was incarnated by his children, his only inspiration in his quest of redemption. And it's ironically the very part that kind of redeems the film, even for the non fans. The others deserving to be mentioned are Michael Corleone's sadness while hearing the 'Brucia La Terra' song played by his son, and his heart-breaking confession of Fredo's murder  <br/><br/>The film is about the redemption of a man who sinned so many times. Many would argue that his sins were necessary because they were the only ways to maintain the interests of his family, but hell is paved with many good intentions, and the way Michael ended at ""The Godfather Part II"", a ruthless cold-blooded zombie-like figure was demanding a sequel. The last shot of him, sitting alone in the park plunged viewers in a lot of interrogations and interpretations. What was he thinking? Probably, how he got in such a situation, and how this would end. And it's like Coppola, tortured by his own demons, felt there was more to do with Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>And the character's arc was concluded, with nothing I would reproach in Michael's portrayal, he's tired, sick as he had carried the weight of a lifelong guilt that ravaged his soul. He may be too pathetic, too different from the Michael we know,his use of profanity was quite out-of character, but who knows how killing his own brother could affect someone. Michael is still respected and feared, but is more melancholic, explaining how the movie needed to be driven by more active supporting characters. And after I finally watched the two other films, one year later  my opinions were mixed.<br/><br/>First, I was fascinated by the sight of young War hero, Michael Corleone, in Connie's wedding, it was so contrasting with the pitiful diabetic Mike of the third opus, watching Part I was an extraordinary discovery, a refreshing experience. Besides, the gallery of new characters, Sonny, Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, enriched the film and made it even more entertaining, Part II confirmed my fascination. And step by step, when I started to watch the first two a little more and while I was sharing my opinions on the Net and learning about Part III's reputation, flaws were becoming more visible: Sofia, Duvall's absence and replacement by that Hamilton guy who was certainly not to Hagen what Pentangelli was to Clemenza, the helicopter scene etc. And the reading of the book made me wonder why they chose as the successor, Sonny's illegitimate son.<br/><br/>But if the film could have been better, it also could have been worse. And when I watch it, I'm more generous, as I see the tragic ending of one of the most fascinating character's story, a man who's always been ""pulled back in"". The movie respects the spirit of Part I, with a succession on the Corleone's throne, true historical events as back-stories, and so many unforgettable lines. In fact, we can make a parallel between the trilogy and the Corleone brothers: <br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather is like Sonny : fierce, brutal, yet tender and good-hearted, it's entertaining and deep in the same time. And we all just love 'Sonny' ...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather Part II is Michael : deeper, darker, smoother, yes, even 'boring' sometimes, but it's more implacable and ruthless ... we can't love it with the same intensity as the first opus, but we respect the cinematic achievement, and it leaves us with an extraordinary feeling. It's not the most entertaining, but certainly the most fascinating.</li></ul><br/><br/>And of course ...<br/><br/><ul><li>The Godfather Part III is Fredo : it tries too much, it has a good heart but it's weak and even sometimes 'stupid' but hey, it's still a blood brother of the first two films, we still feel Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola's touch and it features some heartbreaking moments, like Michael's silent scream that will haunt me forever. Some magnetism was lacking from the very start, but can we really hate 'Fredo'? </li></ul><br/><br/>I'm sure those who prefer the first film also appreciate the last one and those who love the second film and think it's the best one, identify so much with Michael that they hate ""Part III"", with the same intensity and severity Michael expressed towards Fredo. They don't forgive any mistake ... and consider the last film a disgrace for the trilogy, and symbolically disown it."

An average Sopranos episode gives a far more interesting and realistic Cosa Nostra portrayal. <br/><br/>And the performances only made it worse. Sophia Coppola was justifiably panned for being dreadful--it looked as if she was reading her lines for the 1st time off cue-cards. But even Pacino seems to have lost track of his character. Michael was so compelling in I and II because of the introverted, extraordinarily controlled, always-calculating way he conducted the ""family business"", but none of that was apparent in Pacino's III overacted portrayal of an almost-whiny Michael prone to regular emotional outbursts. <br/><br/>You get the idea, I didn't like it.

","This movie is not in the same class as the first two, and this is not because of poor Sophia Coppola, who actually does a decent job as a naive Mafia princess in denial.  One of the strengths of the first two movies is that they stuck to events that actually could have happened.  The helicopter machine-gunning of the penthouse meeting of Dons would never happen. Especially in Atlantic, where mobsters are at pains to be inconspicuous. The very public struggle of Michael for control of the Vatican-owned conglomerate would have been carried out by WASPy proxies, not a Corleone.<br/><br/>George Hamilton is surprisingly good as the mob mouthpiece.  Diane Keaton is surprisingly irritating as the liberated Kay.  Eli Wallach is absolutely awful as the deceitfully fawning Don Altobello.  Coppola ought to be horse-whipped for allowing this veteran character actor to become a huge and unbelievable HAM in this picture.  <br/><br/>Had there not been a I and II, this movie would have been mildly tolerable, but even the great performance by Pacino here cannot save this film from suffering severely by comparison to its two excellent ancestor films."

Garcia is brilliant and carries the same vigor and power as Caan before him. Pacino still has that touch as Michael, now in his later years. The film moves along briskly and features great support from Mantegna, Wallach and a surprisingly well used George Hamilton.

","Castigate me if you will for saying this, but I believe part 3 to be the best of the series.  It's a very close run thing, with each film receiving the same rating from me (8), but it benefits from being a more intense study of ONE character rather than trying to divide its time between several, as the other two did.  That character of course is Michael Corleone; and when he's played by an actor of such class as Pacino, the movie can't fail. Michael has always been the most interesting character of the series for me, and is the fulcrum around which the entire series revolves; more so than Marlon Brando, who was nevertheless the first to essay the character of 'the Don'.  It's fascinating to watch events unfold now that he is finally a willing head of the 'family', trying to emulate his father.<br/><br/>I did as is recommended and watched all 3 consecutively, so my ultimate preference for this one can't be explained by having forgotten how good the other two were.  IMO, this is a superior film on its own merits, which have nothing to do with the 15yr (I think) gap between sequels.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast as the cocksure Vincent, and Sophia Coppola, despite what you may have heard, is fine here too as Mary.<br/><br/>She is also very beautiful.<br/><br/>The entire trilogy is a series which demands to be seen by all those who call themselves film fans, and the third is not a blight on the other two, but rather a quality addition that enriches far more than it detracts."

","The Godfather: Part III continues the theme of Family from the first two movies. In The Godfather, Michael had undergone an internal arc to go from outsider to Don of the family, dropping most of his morals along the way in order to protect the family. In The Godfather: Part II, this idea of the ends justify the means is taken to its logical extreme as Michael tears the family apart in order to protect it.<br/><br/>In Part III, Michael tries to make the family legitimate in order to redeem himself. Unlike the first movie, where Michael's internal change happens on screen, and unlike the second movie, where Michael's does not change at all, this movie has Michael shifting gears to try to pay for his past sins. But this change does not take place on screen. Michael starts the movie regretting his distance from his children and spends the whole movie trying to make up, his internal compass does not change through the movie.<br/><br/>So all we are left are two external plot lines: Michael's efforts to legitimize being constantly thwarted and his failure to protect his family because of his past sins keep catching up to him.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be about something like ""Crime will never let you escape"". But the movie doesn't really prove this because so much of what Michael is paying for is offscreen and in the past two movies. The whole movie just feels like a confession for past sins and the filmmakers showing us that bad deeds will always catch up to us. The idea is not proved by action and choice of the characters on screen. This movie is a necessary but not a worthy tribute to the first two films, it probably shouldn't have been made at all.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca."

","Like, I suspect, many others, I saw this when it came out and years later rewatched it thinking "" it's a probably better film than I remember. I was probably expecting too much"" .<br/><br/>Indeed, many great films would suffer by comparison to the Godfather. It is sad then, that a sequel to what is generally lauded as one of the 5 best films of all time, should suffer by comparison to Adam Sandler movies.<br/><br/>And don't believe the popular myth that Sofia Coppola ruins this movie, it's so bad on so many levels that her performance is irrelevant. So bad is it, that like the Matrix sequels, it seeks to infect its illustrious predecessors with its shiteness. <br/><br/>Mostly the problem seems to be the writing, I double checked to see if Puzo was involved, unbelievably, he was. Here's an example:<br/><br/>Do you remember the ""you'll never take my children"" scene in II? Did you want to know that shortly after the credits have rolled, Michael has a rethink and sends the kids off with mummy?<br/><br/>Oh the horror! This, and so many other torments lie in store for you should you watch this movie.<br/><br/>But, maybe it's not all bad, Pacino shows amazing versatility by looking, sounding and acting nothing like the Michael. And, if you're the kind of person who thought the first two lacked exploding helicopters, horseback gangsters and martial arts, then you may find it a welcome improvement on the originals."

I think only for money!And is sad to watch the creators of a masterpiece you loved and inspired,not to respect their selfs,you and their creation. Al Pacino said that:Godfather 3 was a big mistake.As an honest man he told the truth! <br/><br/>I wish never watched that film.If you are a fun of the Godfather don't watch that film or even you do just tell your self that the real end was Godfather 2."

","Godfather III, like so many sequels, simply fails to deliver on the promise of the series. Godfather I & II, while essentially soap operas, both deliver brilliantly.  They are well acted, well written beautifully filmed and engaging.  But why else would they package III in the Godfather box set and with a bonus DVD?  On its own it wouldn't sell.  I found myself wanting to fast forward through scenes and wishing I would have rented instead of bought.  Many situations (the parties, parades, disguised cop etc.,) are copied from the first two episodes, but just don't seem as convincing. Why did Joey Zasa have the helicopter wipe out the mob bosses before he knew the outcome of the meeting?  Many actors are cardboard and George Hamilton is positively wooden.  Is he an actor?  I thought he was just on Hollywood squares?  Diane Keaton seems out of place, like she walked in from the set of a Woody Allen film and landed in a gangster picture.  Despite its 2&1/2 hours, you don't `feel' the relationship between Vinnie and Michael.  How did he grow or `learn' the ropes to become a Godfather?  He just changes from a leather jacket to a suit.  Many scenes and dialog are laughable or cliché,  The spinning newspaper that freezes on the headline, the assassin lurking in front of the opera poster etc., The only reason to watch this film is to see Andy Garcia steal scenes (he's the only actor who seems he really wants to be in the film) and a few good one liners.  Otherwise the movie falls off the chair like the aged Al Pacino at the end of the movie, a dead, dried up shell of its former self."

But what is this incest stuff? In one scene, he's in bed with an incredibly hot chick. Then, we see him go ga-ga for his first cousin, Mary Corleone, played by Sofia Coppola. Gee, I wonder how she got the role. How can any man look at her twice? I'm sorry, but she has features that would render Viagra useless, even if you swallowed the whole bottle. I'm straight, but I'd rather make out with Al Pacino. And she's his first cousin??!! Andy Garcia is that hard up? I've heard of taking your cousin to the prom, but ----NOOO!!! Now, if my cousin was Charlese Therone, I just might go for it and get my birth certificate changed...but Sofia Coppola??? The Pope thing was a little weird. So was the big Knights of Malta Cross on Michael Corleone's cake. And once again -Andy- if you're gonna go the incest route, hit on your Aunt, played by Talia Shire. She may be older, but she's much hotter. Close knit Italian families don't tolerate incest anyway, except maybe the West Virginia Corleones."

","Just saw it again without seeing the first two in years, and it's even worse than I remember. I don't feel any connection to the characters, some scenes are nonsensical, and I leave with a taste of ""what was the point of that."" Compare Al Pacino here with Al Pacino in DONNIE BRASCO, and you can see he wasn't crappy here because he got old. It's not his fault. The whole project is simply a massive failure.<br/><br/>All the dialogue that seemed so slick and smart in the first two films has disappeared, replaced with monotonous 3-liners. Don't even get me started about assassination by glasses. You don't have to compare this movie with its namesakes either. Just see how it matches up with GOODFELLAS, a movie released around the same time.<br/><br/>So in essence, what makes this movie good? Is it the worn out tried and tested formula being (mis)used? Is it the complete lack of wit? Is it the amateur quality flashback methods? Is it the fact that none of the actors really seem interested? Is it Sofia Coppola? None of those are part of my good movie criteria.<br/><br/>The film does work better than it should, and it's all because of the help it gets from the previous two.

You'll get a very deep thought and emotion provoking experience.<br/><br/>All three films are very good and I don't see why the third one has been discredited as the weaker one. In my opinion it is as strong and valiant as the first two. Perhaps people who had seen the first two films made in short proximity of 72' and 74', after 16 years of waiting had their expectations lifted to almost unattainable levels? Another mystery for me is the assault of critic's attacks Sofia Coppola received for her portrayal of the part of Mary Corleone. I thought she was excellent. I thought her casting in the role has been a brilliant idea. She comes across as a young, innocent, well-protected girl- just right for the part she is playing.<br/><br/>Watch this film and judge it for yourselves."

","What is wrong with some people?This is without a doubt the most underrated movie of all time no question.Al Pacino's performance alone makes this an unforgettable classic but for some reason the movie was quickly forgotten and overlooked.In my opinion Pacino was stunning and did an incredible job portraying a tormented and tortured soul bearing the weight of his many sins mainly the killing of his brother Fredo.Michael Corleone in this movie confesses for all his crimes and the viewer feels for him despite all he has done.The supporting cast is also most impressive.Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa is a memorable villain who proves to be danger for the Corleone family and wants to be in charge of business himself.Andy Garcia as the Don's nephew and Sonny Corleone's son gives an awesome performance and shows the audience he is indeed a kid of wild Sonny played with a passion by James Caan in the original.Many people considered that director Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sofia was wrongly cast as Michael's daughter in the film but I think she did great and added dept to her character.The movie is amazing and powerful all the way but nothing tops the final scene in which Mary is shot and dies in her father's arms.It is truly magical and is sure to put a tear in your eye or at least grab you for a while.The way Pacino and Diane Keaton act during the scene alone makes it phenomenal.In conclusion I advice you not to ignore this wonderful piece of film-making.Be sure to watch it.It is worthy of being the final chapter in the Godfather saga and will impress you I'm sure."

"t_atzmueller","3","8","13","14 December 2011"," An open letter to Francis Ford Coppola
","""Dear Francis, The two of us go way back. Back as far as ""The Terror"" and ""Dementia 13"". Then, ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Cotton Club"" – the term cult-movies must have been invented for those two! ""The Ousiders"" is still one of my wife's' favourite films and the underrated ""Finian's Rainbow"" remains one of my childhood favourites. I even went and watched ""Captain EO"" – not because I'm a Michael Jackson fan but because I was a believer in the Coppola magic. And of course ""The Godfather"", part 1 and 2, that defined not only the mafia-genre but cinema as we know it today.<br/><br/>But then, one night while watching ""The Sopranos"", having Chianti and homemade cannelloni, I had to think about something that I had tried to suppress for years: the time when I went to the cinema to watch ""Godfather 3"". Didn't even bother to watch the trailer, didn't noticing that there was no Robert Duval; I just ran off and bought a ticket. Sure, there was no way you could have cast John Cazale, him being as dead as the character Fredo; but replacing the Tom Hagen character with George Hamilton, now that ads insult to injury. Was neither Ed O'Neill nor Ted Danson available? You could have just cast Pee-Vee Herman and make it obvious that this is a farce! <br/><br/>Perhaps you wanted to teach us something about ""famiglia italiani"" (and/or the structure of the mafia); perhaps you wanted to teach us a lesson about nepotism. There most have been a reason for casting your daughter Sophia in one of the leading roles but I just could never figure out what it was. If anything, her presence excuses Andy Garcia's ham-acting – nothing but silent-movie grimacing could have prevailed against Sophia's proboscis that constantly permeates the picture.<br/><br/>""Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"", like they say and I'm not so hard-hearted as to call your daughter ugly like a blind horse – nor would I dare to compare her lips to overcooked blood-sausage or her nose to a bulbous potato but I dare say that her acting stinks to high heaven. What made you put her next to actors like Al Pacino or Eli Wallach and couldn't you have rather made them wear red clown noses? Perhaps you had a point about incest and cousin-relationships – however, I never got them since a) I didn't care, expecting the third part of ""Godfather"" and not an incestuous soap-opera and b) well, like I said: Sophia's performance made me think about many things – a stacked ham-sandwich was among them but sex wasn't.<br/><br/>Here, now I've said it: it wasn't only general miscasting or dour, convoluted and essentially boring story lines that killed the movie beyond hope for resurrection – it was Sophia! You went on to direct ""Dracula"" and like a dying bull in Pamplona, you seemed to have risen one final, forceful time – yes, ""Dracula"" would remain one of the last good vampire flicks until today. Then came films like ""Jack"" (best left uncommented) and ""Supernova"", which you wanted to direct under the moniker 'Alan Smithee' but Walter Hill had already adopted it for the same pile of manure.<br/><br/>Francis, I'd like to thank you for all the great movies prior to ""Godfather 3"" and wish you a long, happy life. May the Californian sun help you produce the choicest Cabernet Sauvignon that will forever keep your table filled with Italian delicacies.<br/><br/>Just please, Francis, stop directing movies!"" Three noses  excuse me, I meant three points from ten."
"Pan-12","2","8","13","2 March 2000"," They screwed up the whole series with this installment
","I believe that this movie is bordering on disgraceful. Sometimes when you make a movie that is meant to be tragic, metaphorical, profound and/or moving, it only makes it worse when the movie is a failure. To be honest, while I quite like the first two movies in the series I think they're somewhat overrated. Trying to glorify the mob is an immoral and futile cause. The good thing about the first two movies is that they manage to encompass all of the sins humans are commonly affiliated with- anger, pride,greed etc, and put them in an emphatically harsh context. Namely, that of a life and death situation. Sins that are normally unimportant domestically, ironically become a major problem because of domesticity - ""the family."" This particular installment attempts to recreate this sentiment, but gets it all wrong. I actually laughed at the ending. It was a poor attempt at trying to move the audience and blatantly duplicates the endings of the last two movies for the sake of it(i.e. all the enemies being wiped out). The difference being, this time perhaps karma has brought about the emotional downfall of Michael, then, it is exemplified in a physical context-that of the accidental assassination of his daughter. My biggest gripe outside of the ending is quite simply the build up. It is somewhat confused and misdirected yet almost lacking in complexity. You feel nothing at all by the time we reach the climax which is then a rampant anti climax in itself. I can't believe they focused also, on an incestuous relationship as the chief romance. There is something very unnatural about the whole film. All due respect should go to the actors who give a reasonable performance despite the poor script. I think though, that it was a matter of misinterpretation of how good the script really was for actors such as Pacino and Keaton which is why they were forced to be associated with this movie. As well as this the dialogue is very ordinary. Coppola has misfired here, but of course we can't forget some of his other achievements and as such can afford to forgive."
"sit_UBU_sit","1","14","26","3 January 2005"," One of the worst films ever made
","Let me preface by saying 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather Part II' are two of the greatest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola had a lot to live up to when he made 'The Godfather Part III.' First off, I fault the casting department for casting Sofia ""the only reason I'm here is cause daddy's the director"" Coppola. Baby, stick to screen writing. YOU CANNOT ACT!!! Her performance as Connie and Carlo's baby in 'The Godfather' was more convincing than her performance in this rubbish-fest as Michael and Kay's daughter. Secondly, Andy Garcia was terrible in this. What was he supposed to be? Italian or Mexican? He couldn't get an accent down to save his life. This simply does not have the magic or the fire of the first two films. It has poor writing and very poor acting. Even the great Al Pacino or Tuco from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' (Eli Wallach) could not save this pile of rubbish. These reasons are why I deny the existence of 'The Godfather Part III.' The Godfather saga ends with Michael Corleone sitting in his chair of his Lake Tahoe home contemplating why he just had his brother murdered. End of story."

"D8Player","4","7","11","26 January 2007"," Bolted on sequels rarely work
","This is another in a long line of after the event sequels that seemed to be made purely to capitalize on the success of the original versions rather than from any desire to further the story. Godfather 2 was made because Puzo and Coppola felt they had much more to do with the character of Michael. When it was done so were they and it should have been left so. Like the ""Color of Money"" did to ""The Hustler"", Godfather 3 harms rather than helps the legacy of the original.<br/><br/>I am, like many, a huge fan of the first two films. The true masterpiece of them was the brilliant character of Michael Corleone, brilliantly written and brilliantly portrayed. This was the first place where #3 goes wrong. In this part Michael is a shadow of his former self. He is weak and indecisive, a character who lets events overtake him. Little is given in the way of explanation as to what happened to change him. Pacino himself seems to be only half interested in the role.<br/><br/>Furthermore the cast of surrounding characters are much weaker this time out. Talia Shire's performance is pure embarrassment. She shrieks and hollers her way thru the film like a day time soap actress. Andy Garcia who showed such promise early in his career is good but nothing extraordinary. Sophia Coppola should never have been added to the film, she is not an actress and was really dropped in it by her Dad. Bridget Fonda too is weak as is Joe Matenga. Eli Wallach's character is woefully under developed. Compare this with the character of ""Hyman Roth"" in part 2.<br/><br/>If this film really wanted to be judged on its own merits and not look pale in comparison to parts one and two it should not have used the word Godfather in its title. In reality it should never have been made."
"helltopo","3","7","11","3 January 2003"," It shouldn't have been titled 'Godfather'
","Though the unbelievably bad Sofia Coppola received the bulk of the criticism, the main fault with this hugely disappointing epic is the plot. The concept of a known gangster being embraced by the Vatican just didn't seem plausible & the direction compared to the previous two instalments is lifeless and formulaic. Coppola states in the DVD commentary from the first movie, that it's strength came from the quality of the cast - not just the big names like Marlon Brando & James Caan, but also people like Abe Vigoda in smaller roles. In Godfather 3, that kind of ensemble performance is missing as the whole enterprise degenerates into a tacky star vehicle for Al Pacino & Andy Garcia. I personally thought Garcia was dreadful, but again it wasn't all his own fault. At the start of the movie he's an uncontrollable psycho who chomps off ears - a trait which he miraculously loses by the end of the movie. Bridget Fonda makes a fleeting appearance and one wonders why she could not have been cast in the role of Mary instead of Sofia Coppola. In terms of talent, Sofia is obviously the 'Fredo' of the family and Don Coppola should have made her an offer she couldn't refuse!. Even when levelled against other lesser films of this genre I feel Godfather 3 is a poor movie, but compared to the previous two it's an unforgivable disaster."
"ericolsen1953","3","13","24","2 January 2005"," About as necessary as diarrhea
","And, finally, old, old Michael Corleone falls over and goes 'THUMP!' Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga? Probably the same staff who does ""As the World Turns."" This flick doesn't deserve the title ""Godfather"" at all. Let's call this one ""The Cosas of Our Nostras"" or ""All My Capos"". As someone who's encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life, I can say without exception, that I've never met any mobster as inwardly-conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone. Let's face it, these guys are in the Mafia solely because they're greedy, nothing more. In this film, Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future, perhaps even the Afterlife, then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is, deep down. Then, there's his failed marriage. After the break-up scenes in G2, we may hope that Michael & Kay will reunite as man and wife, but here they seem to just become very good, platonic friends who can laugh & cry & share intimate thoughts about their lives. It's as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman. It's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years. There's some miscasting here and there, or perhaps they're sins of authorship. Poor, old-country-beautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role, with too many short lines in the film that don't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations - was given ""remarks"" rather than ""lines"" to emote. Her 'passionate' lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open-mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes...scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, but it's just laughable here. Then, there's Andy's character, Vinnie Mancini, who's also given a difficult & thankless role to play. He's expected, I guess, to be the new, new Don Corleone, but he's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position, unlike Michael's simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1. This hand-me-down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family, but why is so much made of this boring routine? Certainly, Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday, but there's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man, sadly. Puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing Michael's character in G1. But, G3 has no economy in it's story-telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze. Thirdly, George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task, in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen. George wisely underplayed his role, so it came off without damage to the actor. The development of Connie Corleone's character is interesting, but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands (she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos, if this were the real world). But, it's not all bad. The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty! Also, ""they keep pulling me back in"" or words to that effect is a great line. And, we recover some old-country feel as we get to go back to Sicily, even if it's all done in 1989 and they've got modern cars & haircuts. The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting, since it's based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980's, but it's brought too far, again, with the too-spectacular death scenes, etc. The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed. But, the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional-manipulation, at best. All screenwriters need to learn that we don't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion. You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead, she plays her grief so well, but Michael's reaction is hammy, hammy, hammy. Then, Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century, in Sicily, alone on a grand estate, of heart-failure...no grandson to play with before his demise, no wife to grieve for him. What SHOULD have happened in the last 1/2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani, put on trial, all his dirty family's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day, Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life...then he can keel over dead from heart-failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH. That's how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80's and early 90's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved."

"one9eighty","9","2","2","31 January 2019"," Completing the trilogy of the best family films made
","In the final instalment of the Godfather trilogy, Michael Corleone is trying to legitimize the family business - but the past dealings and history of the family business keep pulling him back into the shadows of the crime world. It's about 22 years since what happened in Godfather 2; Michael is older, and as are the people around him, and his kids. In fact, its children from the generations of the films past that play a major part in this film, almost making them as important an entity as children were in the first Godfather film which saw Michael emerge from the shadows.<br/><br/>Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) has a feud with Joey Zasa who's now the face of the Corleone business in New York, while at the same time falling in love with Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), the face of Michael's charity business. Michael is less than impressed with Mancini, especially the fact that he has his eye on Michael's daughter, but he begrudgingly takes him under his wing - Michael also sees Sonny's traits in Mancini and feels he could be moulded. Unfortunately life has taken a toll on Michael and we see a frail side to him as his health slowly deteriorates. After a diabetic coma, Michael has plenty of time to reflect on life - in fact reflection becomes a major part of the film - Reflection of moments and people lost, of the finality of death and the legacy that is left when the body is no longer there. I think the misconception about this film, and possibly the reason for mixed reviews and low ratings is this - it isn't truly and out-and-out gangster movie like the previous two instalments have been. This film is about the conclusion of a character that, despite being a young man in the first film, wasn't really born until his father was attacked. We see the birth of Michael's darker side in Godfather 1, we see what he has the power to become in Godfather 2, and we see the results and conclusion of Michael in Godfather 3. This is more a fictional biopic than a gangster film. Sure it has Mafioso and Gangsters in it, but there is an underlying and unspoken narrative driving it forward, and when that clicks into place it's all about stories and reflections.<br/><br/>Another reason why this film was panned in comparison to its predecessors is the casting choice and some of the dialogue - I don't see a massive problem myself though. Some of the dialogue when the issue was to do with the crime family were cliché and expectable - but that's because the other films set it up. The dialogue to do with Michael's real character, that's what was more unexpected - with how Michael built himself up in the first two, you wouldn't expect the frailty from him. At the final conclusion, it could be argued that a broken heart is what ultimately kills him - not bullets, not words - loss, unspoken emotion, feelings.<br/><br/>My rating for this will match the previous two Godfather films. The other films were more obvious, this is more subtle and clever. I have read the books by Mario Puzo, I have read the books in-between the books (Mark Winegardner) and in-between the movies. I still can't not like this film - it's feels like a tragic opera, almost like it's a commentary of itself and the legacies that are paved the way for it. My rating for this, like the previous Godfather films is 9 out of 10."

Unfortunately,he is kept back by the ambitions of the young namely Joey Zaza and hungrier gangsters. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster in both Don Licio Lucchesi and Don Altobello,who are seeking to upset the existing mob order.Aside from that,it also involves Vincent Mancini,a young protégé of Michael who gets involved with a love affair with his daughter,Mary.The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events—the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–1982—and links them with each other.<br/><br/>Director Francis Ford Copolla said the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. In his audio commentary for Part II, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of New York Stories compelled him to take up Paramount's long-standing offer to make a third installment.Coppola and Mario Puzo,author of The Godfather, requested six months to complete a first draft of the script with a release date of Easter 1991. Paramount agreed to give them six weeks for the script and, lacking a holiday movie, a release date of Christmas Day 1990. Given the conditions together with the casting of neophyte actress and the director's daughter,Sofia Copolla,whom many fans have vehemently criticized for her poor portrayal of Mary Corleone,I still believe that Part III is still a great film. <br/><br/>Part III still has great acting from the cast except from Sofia Copolla,whom I must really say deserved the Razzies he got from this film.Worthy of mention is of course,Al Pacino,Andy Garcia and Eli Wallach.Also,the movie's story still works despite missing Robert Duvall and his character,Tom Hagen,whom I believe was really essential in story as he plays an important role in the family. The screenplay was also good BUT one cannot fully comprehend this movie without watching the first two.And of course,other great features from the previous Godfather movies are still present in this movie like the great writing of Copolla and Puzo,the music of Carmine Copolla and Nino Rota and the direction of Copolla.Overall,it is still a great movie although not a masterpiece as compared to the first two.<br/><br/>After viewing The Godfather Part III once again after so many years before writing this review,I would say that if The Godfather is the greatest film ever made and The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made,this movie is definitely the greatest underrated film ever made.It is a great movie although it may not be comparable to the first two in terms of critical and commercial success.The Academy Award nominations it got attest to that."

","... and OBVIOUSLY, also third best of the trilogy.<br/><br/>******** SPOILER AHEAD ***********<br/><br/>Those who say this is a terrible movie, should never have been done etc etc are just exaggerating.  I Think that the plot for this movie is excellent and I also really liked how a real life event like the death of the Pope just after a month in 1979 is linked to the story.<br/><br/>The plot and the acting of Al Pacino and Andy Garcia are in my opinion the three great plus's in the movie.  What fails to upgrade this from a 'very good' to an 'excellent' movie is one main element:  The atmosphere, the set and 'fashion' surrounding the actors did not look like 1979 at all!  It looked more like the present day or at least the early 90's.  This is a big shame, when considering how 'devoted', Coppola was to such details in the first two movies.<br/><br/>Another thing that could have been improved was the music to the movie. Not that it wasn't good, but I feel that in this department, this movie is more detached from the other two.  More use of the main Godfather Theme could have given it a more 'familiar' touch.<br/><br/>My Opinion about why many people are OVER-Critical about this movie is because their brain works inversely proportional after seeing the first two movies.  Let me explain myself - The first two movies simply cannot be more perfect and after seeing them it is like having a cup, filled to the brim with water.  This makes the slightest imperfection in the third movie 'spill a lot of water'.<br/><br/>Continuing on this analogy, I think that a forth movie would simply 'Empty the cup'!"

"kenvandenbussche-2","10","11","22","15 October 2007"," The perfect end to the perfect trilogy ...
","16 years after the last of two brilliant godfather-films, director Francis Ford Coppola returns to complete his thus far unfinished mafia saga. Despite rumours that the final godfather-film is a blemish on an otherwise magnificent tale of organized crime, it is in fact one of the most beautiful films ever made and a story that's just as riveting as any of its predecessors. It once again deals with familiar themes such as corruption, misuse of power, love, respect, remorse and of course the most inevitable of all  death! The endless amount of critique and insults that this film received must have something to do with the many years dividing part II and part III. In those many years the face of American cinema has changed radically. Back in the '70s method-actors like Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were the true kings of the movie industry, but after a couple of years special effects started playing a bigger role in cinema and fantasy figures such as Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, aliens, terminators, gremlins and horror icon Freddy Krueger all became immensely popular and just as important.<br/><br/>Amazing is that ""The godfather part III"" didn't change one bit amidst this massive update of modern cinema. Surely: it takes place a few dozen years later, but it seems as though time has stood still. Even so: there are some significant changes to be had. The biggest change of all is how Michael Corleone has transformed from a strong and confident leader to a weak and aging Don desperately trying to deal with his tragic past. At the same time he wants to legitimize his crime family's interests and remove himself from the violent underworld. Method-actor Al Pacino does exceptionally well at acting out emotions with his voice in this final instalment. The last time I watched this film, I actually cried on two different occasions. That's how powerful and genuine his acting really is. The first moment that got to me was the confession of Al Pacino to a priest. Having never shown repent for any of his sins, he suddenly realizes the vast magnitude of his wrong-doings and ultimately breaks down in tears. Even more compelling is the ending of the godfather-trilogy.<br/><br/>But Al Pacino isn't the only great actor in this film. Andy Garcia plays his role of a lifetime as Vincent Mancini  the ferocious son of Michael's oldest brother Sonny and unfortunately for anyone involved he shares his father's hot temper. Especially small-time enforcer Joey Zasa seems to enrage him beyond all reason. This character is played by actor Joe Mantegna and he does a very good job. Mantegna would still get the chance to play an actual mob boss but only as the voice of Fat Tony in the highly successful television series ""The Simpsons.""<br/><br/>The one person who was attacked the most for her performance was Sofia Coppola; daughter of director Francis Ford. She evidently plays the part of the daughter of Michael Corleone. I have to agree that Sofia is much better behind the camera than in front of it, but to say that her acting was terrible is an overstatement. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are still around playing their eminent characters, but not everybody returns for this third film. Robert Duvall got a little too greedy on his part and that's why his character consigliere Tom Hagen does not return. This is a real pity, but the film has found a very clever way to work around it  so this change is more than satisfactory; I think. Bridget Fonda is also present as a reporter but her role is of no real consequence. Suffice to say, ""The godfather: part III"" has a fabulous cast.<br/><br/>In short: Sequels simply don't get any better than this! This masterpiece is just as grand as part I and part II ... everything falls into place - from its wonderful actors to the delightful cinematography - ""The godfather part III"" truly is ... the perfect end to the perfect trilogy!!"
"tostinati","Null","11","22","19 September 2005"," Exquisite Coppola
","It is in Coppola that I think we see the direction and spin Welles put on American cinema in it's most vivid survival. The multi-layering, the richness of texture. What Welles says about his films could go for Coppola's too. When someone called Welles' films 'baroque', he explained that for him when the texture of film becomes too thin, it becomes dead. Coppola must feel this way too. And when the still moments occur in Coppola, and there are many treasurable moments of stillness and reflection, there is still much going on in the frame, much to watch, subtexts and contexts to let wash over you. In other words, stillness, but not emptiness.<br/><br/>I think they are all wrong about Sofia Coppola's part in this. If she had played her character in a higher key, a more ""real life"" key, she would have been written off as a stridently irritating valley girl. She plays a self-conscious young woman in development somewhere between awkward wall-flower and blossoming social butterfly, and she plays it to a T, I believe. Low key. Why not? I guarantee you, three hours of anything else would have been too much. Her performance may have come out of talks with the director, or it may have been her good-sense intuitive playing. But whichever, I think the word ""shrewd"" can be applied accurately to the way she acts and is used here.<br/><br/>I prefer this third installment to the second, by the way. The third film achieves and sustains an overwhelming crescendo and haunting coda for the series. Taken as a unit, these 3 films form one of the stunning achievements of the American cinema. 10 stars for each Godfather film, this one no exception."
"eric262003","6","5","8","20 July 2015"," A Sequel That was Not Needed
","I'm not going to say it was an entire awful movie, but after the success of the first two ""Godfather"" franchises, there was no necessity in making a third sequel. Even director Francis Ford Coppola admitted that the sagas come from ""Parts I and II"" and that ""The Godfather Part III"" was nothing more than a glorified epilogue. The only purpose as to why he made this third installment was because his bravado was going down plus he was in a financial crunch and was lured in by Paramount to make a third movie as a key to his financial comeback. He could've resisted the temptation, but he decided to give it the old college try. I just wished that he made another flop than to make ""The Godfather III"". At least with the flop it would've been an honest one and less manipulative. <br/><br/>The flaws in this movie are by the bundles, where to begin we can say that the plot does not have the same bite that its predecessor's have in their grasp. Even though at 2 hours and 42 minutes long it feels a lot longer and some scenes tend to drag on for too long, especially the scenes that take place in Sicily. Michael and Kay's (Al Pacino and Diane Keaton) quiet time together should have been axed out entirely. This movie is not a romantic tale, so therefore Coppola unless he was trying to get more female audience members to see this film, there was no need for any kind of dragged out romantic interludes to this story. <br/><br/>For those who wish to use Sofia Coppola as the main poison to this this film may have crossed the line a bit here. Yes I agree she couldn't act worth a nickel, but she was only on for a very short time and her contribution to the film is quite minimal. Granted if they would've casted either Julia Roberts of Winona Ryder for the part of Mary Corleone, they could've made the character all the more compelling. But Mary is only very minor role so it really would not have made much of a difference. <br/><br/>Another key factor to why this film is inferior to the other two ""Godfathers"" is the absence of Robert Duvall's character Tom Hagen. Duvall was interested in reprising his role and demanded to Mr. Coppola an equal salary like Pacino, but he was rebuffed at his request and backed out of the project. With that in mind Coppola edited out that Hagen died and that George Hamilton's B.J. Harrison was cast as the new attorney to the Corleone's estate. The only living relative to the Hagen name was Father Andrew Hagen played by John Savage whose role was absolutely useless. <br/><br/>If there was any newbie that holds any kind of interest was Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Corleone, the son of James Caan's character the late Sonny Corleone and Michael's nephew. The first of the trilogy had young Michael trying to take over the family empire after Sonny and Fredo were not eligible for such as task. Michael wanted legitimacy within his family's legacy. It would've been better if Vincent became the successor and to bring the family back to conducting illegal tactics to bring back their old ways again. The script gets within those parameters, but the distractions are way too abundant.<br/><br/>Another note to point out is that the change in Michael is way to obvious and at time can be unnatural. After the second film Michael was raging force to be reckoned with, but now a lot older and more gravely ill, he is now begging for forgiveness for all the things he's done. I understand that as you get older you look back and think of all the things you've done. In Michael's case, he's like he's been resurrected from the first film, feeling a bit ashamed he's from a Mafia family and wants no part of it, but in family honour, he'll attack when his family needs him when no one else will intervene. I have no problem with this change, but the process is never fully clarified due to the lacklustre script. It just gives me the impression he's scared of dying and just wants one last breath of redemption before the coffin closes. <br/><br/>I did like what they did with script by adding some real events that happened in the Roman Catholic Church during the late 1970's when the majority of the film takes place. Such events like the banking scandal of the Vatican and the unfortunate mysterious death of the Pope John Paul I after becoming the pope 33 days before. <br/><br/>It wasn't an awful movie, but with a much tighter editing job and a more revised script, then ""The Godfather Part III"" would have been a much better film. And sure people have panned this film horribly, it doesn't deserve that much lambasting. However, it was very poorly executed and it still stands as a very inferior film from the other two chapters."

I do feel however waiting 16 years to finally finish the trilogy was bit excessive, if I had to speculate, I believe Francis Ford Coppola never intended to make a third Godfather movie, also casting his daughter Sofia as Mary, Michael Corleone's daughter was a travesty, Sofia Coppola cannot act or for that matter direct, the only reason she has gotten as far as she has is because she is Coppola's daughter.

","Why did Coppolla make this film? What possessed him to, sixteen years later, ""conclude"" the greatest movie saga ever told? It's a shame that this film will always be attatched to the first two masterpieces. Kind of like how Yoko will always be attatched to John, Debbie Matanoupolis to The View and Roseanne Barr to the human race. Although, while watching it, it can at select times, be engrossing, looking back however, chunks start to rise in your throat. What are the problem with this? Here goes:<br/><br/>1) A lack of atmosphere. The Godfather II was also a bit weak in this department, but Godfather III tops the cake. Transporting it to a modern setting simply doesn't work. It gives the film a lack of identity. Sure, Corleone is pretty to look at, but it looks like the Corleone we knew in I after some mysterious force came down with a needle and sucked the beauty out of it. Part I used reds and blues to give the film a rare beauty and sense of the time in which it took place. It seemed lik an epic, brilliant comic book. Part II was shot depressively in dark colors (not a flaw it all, it matched the sad story of the film). I guess that since III doesn't have a theme, there's no way for a cinematographer to bring one out. Which leads me to the next flaw<br/><br/>2) Part I is Michaels ascention to the top. Is the mob glorified? To a point. Part II, the mob is anything but glorified, as Michael, loses and/or kills almost all that is dear to him. Part III is SUPPOSED to be about redemption, but unless I fell asleep during the film, I didn't seen any taking place (Perhaps I just found the answere my problem). He dies a miserable man, even more lonely than he was after II.<br/><br/>3) The plot is too muddled. Godfather II was successful in telling two stories because they were completely isolated from eachother. In this case, they aren't. The Vatican, and the troubles inside the F(f)amily don't mesh-at all. The characters from these two different tales never interact and I didn't feel like I got to know any of the new cast members (except for Vincent).  This leads to a heinous, confusing and overblown finale where, to be honest, I didn't know who was being killed or where the killing was taking place AT ALL.<br/><br/>As for the good parts...Well, of course there were some. The performances by Pacino, Keaton and especially Garcia were top-notch. Sofia Coppolla has taken enough abuse here, so I won't complain. As I said before, the film is watchable. At points, when you actually DO understand what's going on, it can get very interesting. But the characters provoking you interest don't last long enough. Overall, an alright film in it's own right (with several flaws) fails to follow the example of it's two flawless counterparts."

I should have taken their advice.<br/><br/>Pacino should have been forced to watch the original Godfather films 100 times each to remind him what he was like when he was a real actor. The original Michael Corleone was scary because he was so controlled and introverted. His rage boiled inside. In Part III, Michael is a mugging scenary chewer who wears his emotions on his sleeves and screams at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>And the Francis Ford Coppola directing Part III isn't the visionary of the 70's, but instead the bored hack of the 80's and 90's. The script is a lazy B-movie script with large chunks of unnecessary expository dialogue. The actors seem to be left to their own devices, especially Sofia who seems to be either reading off cue cards or merely reciting her lines. She's so bad. I honestly think her performance her might be the worst acting I've ever seen, and I'm including school plays and community theater I've seen over the years. Diane Keaton looks like she just dropped in from her real daughter's PTA meeting (which isn't so terrible considering the role she has in the film) and Talia Shire shows the rust of a woman who really hasn't acted much outside her thankless turns in the later Rocky flicks.<br/><br/>This film could have used a fresh idea or two, another couple of passes at the screenplay and whole lot less of the Coppola family.

Does anyone really care about these people, or would you rather send them to a therapist and save yourself three hours? Since only three of the original cast has made it to the last installment, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire, the movie banks on audiences caring about all the new faces and plot points. Instead of all the old faithfuls from the 1970s, there's Andy Garcia, Sofia Coppola, George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, and Eli Wallach. It doesn't really feel like as much of a classic, does it?<br/><br/>In this one, you can look forward to tons of violence, lots of new faces, old grudges, and the infamous-and once again, continually spoofed-silent scream from Al Pacino.

","I liked it. Yes, it's a slightly different tone to the first two, but then it is set 25 years into the future, so if it had exactly the same feel as the first two it would have seemed false. However, it still has the deception, music, style and dialogue of the first two. Those things make it pretty special in my opinion.<br/><br/>Yes, Sofia Coppola seems out of place even moreso in scenes with Garcia who is so good in this it makes Coppola look even more amateurish. It makes me wonder how good it could have been with a better actress playing Mary.<br/><br/>The final hour or so of the film from where Michael speaks to the soon to be Pope is just superb though and matches anything that has gone before. As I said, the ending fits the whole theme of the Godfather movies perfectly. They're all about power, deception, loss, regret and family and in that sense I was ultimately content at the outcome."

","Watchable, but ridiculous. The whole saga should have been stopped at just one movie.<br/><br/>It kept getting more annoying and less believable. Pacino was overacting at times, the whole incestuous plot is superficial and unnecessary. The dying scene at the end was the only memorable one. <br/><br/>If you wanna see action, watch ""Mission Impossible"". For drama, watch ""Times of endearment"". For a decent picture of mobster life, ""Goodfellas"" or even ""Bugsy"". <br/><br/>In Part I he killed an enemy. In the second, his own brother. In this part, he allegedly killed Pope. Thanks god Corleone died in part III, otherwise he would have to kill Mother Teresa or Dalai Lama to make Part IV meaningful."
"MattD12027","10","8","17","15 February 2006"," Highly Underrated and Under-appreciated.
","Whenever conversations about the Godfather movies come up, most people are so surprised that I regard this, the third of the trilogy, the best of them all. They all automatically assume that anyone who has seen the entire trilogy likes the first one the best. The first one is spectacular film-making, there's no denying that, but the Godfather Part III is not only more epic, but also more emotional, more resonating, and more poignant.<br/><br/>The entire Godfather saga, in my mind, is not about crime or the Mafia - at the heart of these movies lies one major conflict: Michael Corleone is trying desperately to keep his family from disintegrating around him. At some points, he perpetuates it out of some misplaced pride (such as with Fredo), and at other points, he does in fact hold it together, such as with his children. The first movie is all about how he's drawn into the web of lies and corruption, and how he sees that his family is slowly dying because of it. He enters the business because he feels like he has to in order to preserve the sacred honor of his family. The second movie is perhaps the worst (if any of them could be called 'worst'), simply because it meanders when it should be propelling the story along. The second movie is about how, over everything that he's done, he still can't stop the ball from rolling over his family. The end of Part II - that single shot of Michael sitting in the chair - is one of the best single shots in film history.<br/><br/>That brings me to Godfather, Part III, which probably has some immediate (and rather shallow) detractors because from the outset it feels like an epilogue. That's just the initial impression, though, and then we, the moviegoers, realize that a lot has happened since we last saw Michael. He's guilty over what he's done, especially how he's been unable to save his most precious possessions, and he's trying to change his ways. This Michael is older, more mature, and not as naive about the machinations of worldly men. The fact that the setting changes so much in this film is showing that he has sins to atone for all over the world, and that subconsciously he's maybe reaching out to these past grievances and trying for some closure.<br/><br/>What makes Part III so good, though, is that underlying all of that is a sense of desperation. He knows his time is running out - we all know it as well. It's with morbid fascination that one looks at the running time, especially toward the end, because he hasn't achieved his personal atonement yet. And then...and then the final twenty minutes comes, and we see what Michael's life has been leading up to. All of it - all of his greed, murders, passion - have been futile. His atonement is naught but a passing gesture, because it comes back and haunts him at the end of it all. His family, or what's left of it, is shattered and fragmented in the final scenes.<br/><br/>And where does that leave him? Alone. Absolutely alone. The final scene, in which Michael simply falls over, dead, is the perfect post-script to a brilliant movie, and the end of a truly exquisite saga. Part's I and II are excellent, but they feel incomplete without Part III, and that is because the entire story hasn't been told.<br/><br/>10/10 - Most underrated movie of the 90's."
"roland-27","Null","8","17","5 September 1999"," An Inspiring Film
","This film is often shadowed by the other two classics, Part 1 and 2, but this movie is, in its own right, an amazing film with incredible performances by Al Pacino and Andy Garcia in particular.<br/><br/> Francis Ford Coppola directs this underrated film with family member Sofia putting in a worthy performance as Mary, daughter of Pacino and lover/cousin of Garcia.<br/><br/> Having watched all three, I have to say this is the one that hits me the most. The other two were fine, but they were too cheery. The end two scenes of Part 3 are both touching, and memorable. The one flaw about this great film is the inconclusive end to Sonny Corleone's(James Caan) son Vinnie(Garcia). We neither see whether he lives or not. He disappears near the end with no indication about what happens to him.<br/><br/> Despite this one flaw, Part 3 is a superb conclusion to one of Hollywood's greatest trilogies. But with talk of Leonardo Di Caprio taking on a prequel, I think Ford Coppola should quit while he is ahead.<br/><br/> The Godfather Series has made stars of James Caan(Godfather Part 1), Andy Garcia(Part 3), Sofia Coppola(Parts 1,2,3), John Savage(Part 3), Robert DuVall(Parts 1,2), Joe Mategna(Part 3) and, of course, Al Pacino(Parts 1,2,3). They will never be forgotten by all who have watched any of them. Rating=5/5"
"mark_joy","9","6","12","15 April 2008"," A worthy and fitting conclusion
","Not a perfect movie like the first two, but a worthy and appropriate conclusion to the saga. Sophia Coppola's performance is not the disaster that many people have proclaimed it to be, but it diminishes the impact of the character she plays. Part III serves to underscore and complete the great theme of the trilogy: Michael's fatal flaw in not being able to escape the criminal world into which he was born. The women are stronger presences in Part III, compared to the other two, and a more accomplished actress in the role of Mary would have made those presences have even more of an impact. Andy Garcia does a great job, combining the strength of Vito and Michael with the rage of Sonny."

Watching Part 3 now is almost a documentary on all the things they were up to. It's a decent end to a great series of films. A shame that Duvall was not given a decent salary to appear as he was the counter to Michael and I think the film would have been even better."

","No, it's not as good as the other two by any stretch, and some scenes are downright strange. It suffers seriously from a lack of DUvall/Hagen.

But the relationships between the core characters and young lovers feel like a natural evolution from where we left them, and that quotable line, ""JUST WHEN I THINK IM OUT, THEY PULL ME BACK IN"" is from this one, and don't you forget it. Coppola wanted to call this ""the death of michael corleone"" and sell it as an EPILOGUE to the first two masterpieces. Viewed with that understanding, its faults are much more forgivable and its pace appropriate. And listen, I am just not here for Sofia-bashing. She was young and inexperienced. She gave a somewhat stiff but in many scenes quite lovely performance. She talks and acts like a real rich teenager, not like a trained actress. And she never did anything to hurt you, so don't be mean."

","After 26 years people were waiting for another ""Godfather"" film. In Late 1988 people were celebrating that the Saga of The Corleone was to continue when Paramount Pictures Announced ""The Godfather Part III"" was coming in 1990. <br/><br/>Now when ""The Godfather Part 2"" was released at first that was a head scratchier for many people because the film was told in two different time periods. It was the rise of the the father (Told in flashbacks) and the fall of the son. Then the reviews turned around quickly and :The Godfather Part 2"" went on to win Best Picture of the year just like its predecessor. When Francis Ford Coppola decided to make ""The Godfather II"" he told this story in much different way as he did the other two films however this time he failed. However the casting of Sofia Coppola wan't the films on flaw. The story itself is confusing and not well told. <br/><br/>Another Problem is the character of Michael Corleone. By the time ""The Godfather II"" he was cold & alone. In this film he is trying to redeem himself. The other story is about the Vatican bank. This is really poorly told. I am sure most of the audience could not really tell you what really happened! By the end of the movie nobody could tell you what exactly what the story was and what was the point? <br/><br/>A major problem also with the film is that of Connie. She has new become vicious! It was established at the end of ""Godfather II"" that she was now ""Taking Care"" of her brother. <br/><br/>This film would of have been more better served if Connie had orchestrated the assassination of her brother Michael. After all he ordered her husbands death and their own brother. Her seeking revenge would of been a better story. <br/><br/>What we got here was a huge mess.

"petra_ste","7","4","7","23 March 2014"," Never hate your enemies
","Much of the blame for The Godfather: Part III not being on par with previous chapters is usually laid on the shoulders of poor Sofia Coppola, whose scowling, blatantly inadequate performance (her father cast her after the last minute departure of Winona Ryder) weakens the movie and stands out in a trilogy otherwise enriched by sublime acting.<br/><br/>Still, the original sin of Part III lies in its concept: having Michael Corleone ""pay for his sins"". Guess what? It had already happened. That particular brand of Pyrrhic villainy had been masterfully explored in the last act of Part II, with Michael, previously all about family, ordering the murder of his brother, and with his wife choosing an abortion rather than having another son by him, an utter display of hatred and distance if ever there was one. The whole point of Part II was Michael emerging triumphant in his power struggle but utterly alone on his throne, his hands soaked in blood - something which was executed so perfectly, this sequel was essentially born redundant.<br/><br/>This isn't to say Part III is worthless. Pacino brings a world-weary desperation to the part, while Garcia and Wallach convince in significant roles. Robert Duvall is sorely missed as Tom Hagen - his character was originally supposed to play a key role, but was cut because his monetary requests were deemed excessive by the studio. His absence leaves an obvious void, the calm and collected legal consigliere providing balance to the more emotional world of the Corleones. <br/><br/>The last act set in Sicily lacks urgency and focus but, Coppola being who he is, Part III still provides moments of exhilarating cinematic craft, culminating with a superb set-piece in an opera theater and a bitter coda sealing off Michael's saga.<br/><br/>7/10"
"SenseiSeagal77","8","4","7","28 November 2011"," An Underrated Film (Review May Contain Spoilers)
","I recently saw The Godfather Trilogy back-to-back for the umpteenth time in years. Mostly everyone agrees that parts I and II are a couple of the best films ever made, but part III always gets dumped on. Why? With the exception of Robert Duvall's absence (watching it, you get the sense that something is missing, it's Duvall), Sofia Coppola's acting (she is a far better director) and George Hamilton looking like he took a wrong turn and got lost going to the tanning salon (what the eff was he doing in this film?), this is actually a great film that happens to be an emotional conclusion to the Godfather epic.<br/><br/>The Godfather films are about Michael Corleone. They show us the evolution of his character, and by part III Michael is full of regret for all of the sins he has committed over the years that were covered in parts I and II. With Al Pacino's excellent performance, you feel sorry for him as he suffers over what he did to his brother Fredo, then how he desperately tries to salvage anything he can with Kay, and watching him trying to rebuild a relationship with his son, who wants no part of the family business.<br/><br/>The critics crapped on The Godfather Part III and everyone else jumped on the bandwagon. Watch it with the other two films. It's not in the same league as the first two, but it's a great film nevertheless."
"inkslave","4","4","7","3 July 2001"," Francis hasn't been the same since he crawled out of the Philippine jungle
","What the hell happened to Francis Coppola? How could the man who made I and II be the same guy who dropped this stinkbomb? Every movie he's made since Apocalypse Now has reeked of a guy who has lost his grip on reality and who is so powerful, and surrounded by so many people who kiss his butt all day, that he is doomed. It's the same thing that happened to Oliver Stone and George Lucas.<br/><br/>I hate this movie, because it tries to change the way we think about characters from the first two films, because it resorts to weird '90s crap like the helicopter attack, because the ending plays like it was written in 15 minutes and filmed in 20, and because, worst of all, it's boring.<br/><br/>So much could have been done with this. Michael's son an opera star, who berates his dad with corny speeches? C'mon, in II the kid was practically a clone of Vito, the sins of the father being visited on the son. George Hamilton? Puh-leeze. The pope? Who exactly was Coppola trying to impress?<br/><br/>Almost the only thing I like about this movie is Sofia Coppola. She can't act, but she's gorgeous. And Andy Garcia proving whose son he is by wiping out the two hit men, that's at least entertaining. Otherwise, as Roger Ebert once said about another clunker, this film should be cut up and distributed to the poor for use as ukelele picks."

"insomniac_rod","10","5","10","16 August 2009"," Redemption is the only way... but crime never pays.
","The most popular in terms of quality film trilogy ever made ends in such a haunting, unforgettable manner.<br/><br/>""The Godfather"" films are that good that make you comment about it's most important scenes and makes you forget about the production values which are perfect anyways.<br/><br/>In this last chapter of the trilogy, we find a more mature but ill Michael who finally decides to take the family's direction into legality. But crime never pays. The consequences are deadly and now Michael, who always tried to protect his family, will understand too late about crime's consequences.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction does it again. He creates a parallel world filled with beautiful Italian exteriors, classy camera angles such as in the infamous helicopter attack, and the never tensing opera climax. His directing skills never went away and he gives a unique looking style to the trilogy. The soundtrack is as beautiful, haunting, and dark at the same time. It's just as good as in the previous movies.<br/><br/>The acting is glorious. Al Pacino delivers a dramatic performance and takes Michael to a whole new level that we didn't see in previous films. He displays regret, sadness, fury, and even a diabetes attack. All his emotions are powerful and demonstrates why he is the spinal cord of the trilogy. I will never forget the scene where he gets a first diabetes attack and curses against his enemies, and figures out what was going on. Also, when he is in the need to eat a candy or drink orange juice; that's acting. Also, it broke my heart his last crying and how he screamed after his daughter's murder. Diane Keaton is just fine but do not add anything special to the movie, that's my take. Andy García is one good looking guy and delivers a brave performance in the likes of James Caan's Sonny in the original. Joe Mantegna is an actor you have to love, he's charming and plays his part perfectly. I didn't care for Talia Shire's acting, it was wooden in my opinion. The same goes for Sofia Coppola who delivers an extremely wooden performance. She didn't display the most powerful feelings correctly. I always wonder, ""how would Winona Ryder be in that part?"". Richard Bright plays Neri in such a class act that you just don't forget him. The rest of the cast is excellent.<br/><br/>The cinematography and art direction is just fine and displays the early 90's artistic techniques.<br/><br/>The plot is complex but easy to follow and deals with politics, religious authorities immersed with crime, betrayal, loyalty, power, but in the end, everything is summed up with a single word ""business"".<br/><br/>But getting out crime has it's deadly consequences. Crime never pays. The consequences derive in assassinations, conspiracies, church's dark interests, and more.<br/><br/>The addition of Vincenzo Corleone added fresh air to the series mainly because he is very different from Michael. It was like bringing back Sonny but in a younger and more clever version. It was also a manner to connect the last chapter with the previous films.<br/><br/>Important events from previous films play an important part in Michael's fate. He feels guilty and regrets for Fredo's murder. Anytime he listens to a Hail Mary, dark memories invade his mind. Also, he knows how to deal with Vincent because he perfectly handled Sonny's impulses and raging reactions. It was nice for the fans to hear constantly the name of Vito Corleone, Sonny, and more. Plus, it's always a pleasure to see Al Neri and the rest of the Corleone allies such as Don Tomassino, Calo, and more. Heck, even Johnny Fontaine returns for a last singing! Plus, Michael's children now grown up play an important and vital part. Anthony and Mary are Michael's most appreciated treasure. Special mention for Bridget Fonda's super sexy appearance. I love blondes with long legs and beautiful face.<br/><br/>This time, the Corleone's enemies do not represent such a big menace in terms of menacing looks or violent ways. The new enemies are more clever and cold blooded. Except for the thrilling and spectacular helicopter attack; we don't get much shootings as in previous films. That's when we learn that crime is more dangerous through briefcases, tables, and church. Don Altobello was the perfect nemesis for Michael; he is wise, knows who to convince, and pulls the strings masterfully. Joey Zasa is a regular gangster in the likes of Don Fanucci and do not represent a threat for the Corleones. The Vatican Bishop and Lucchetti, a strict-right moralist who is against the Corleone's immersion into ""religious business"". He's by far the most menacing enemy. But we also need to remember about Mosca, a Sicilian capo that is widely known for not failing an attack.<br/><br/>There are memorable scenes in this movie, beautiful, haunting moments. The family photo at the beginning of the movie displays that family means union and it's Michael's treasure. Michael dancing with Mary, Vincent counterattacking an assassination attempt, the infamous and sad opera attack, the helicopter attack, the filling of Zasa, Tommassino's sad murder, Mary's murder, Al Neri's final display of his skills, Vito's childhood home visit, and of course, the top three Godfather moments: Michael's last thoughts that deal with the important women of his life, then, he dies alone. It's just as haunting as the flashback in part II which features him eating alone, thinking, planning his future.<br/><br/>The last Godfather finds death in such a sad but poetic manner."

A clap-deserving performance as Santino Corleone's son. Nice temper and nice acting...he really is convincing as a good nephew to Michael. <br/><br/>Finally, bind together the talents of Diane Keaton and Talia Shire...good women actresses.

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>It is the late 1970s and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now the aging head of the Corleone empire. All is flowing smoothly until a younger relative of his, Vincent (Andy Garcia) arrives on the scene. Vincent is hot-headed, acting without thinking and Michael can see this as a problem that may affect the Corleone family. Then he decides to buy a major corporation's share in the church, cutting off his ties with the casinos and soforth. This rubs some other prominent gangsters up the wrong way and from here we watch Michael's dramatic fall from power in a devastating event of power games.<br/><br/>In 1990, Martin Scorsese brought us a gangster movie to herald a new era in the shape of Goodfellas that many, both artistically and casually, would want to emulate. One can only get the impression Francis Ford Coppola wanted to cling to his title as the maker of the most memorable gangster epic of all time by reminding us of it by dealing us The Godfather Part III, which can hold claim to being possibly the most unnecessary and even damaging prequel of all time.<br/><br/>Right from the very beginning, it is clear how transparent the film is, as possibly without even realizing it, it is copying the first film by having a long family gathering sequence where Pacino (stepping in for Brando) cuts away to have some behind the scenes discussions right up to the scene where his character is rushed to hospital, again like the original. This may well have been the mark of Coppola's career freefall, starting the chart of a sad decline in a once brilliant director.<br/><br/>You've lost interest in the story long before the ending, leaving it to just ramble on towards it's eventual conclusion. The story's fairly interesting and there is one scene of brilliant emotional acting by Pacino (even with this sort of material, you gotta admire the guy!) but the whole film cannot help but feel like a big, embarrassing dirty stain on the two unforgettable films made two decades earlier. With the flashy, trend-setting new film Goodfellas on the scene, I can't imagine cinema-goers in 1990 would have much time for this unneeded drag. **"

Instead of depositing $600,000,000 in the Vatican bank, he could have upped his offer by $600,000,000. Michael threw an awful lot of money around, but that bothered me.

","In giving a wrap-up, a conclusion to two of the most powerful crime and family stories to come out of the seventies, Francis Ford Coppola took a risk that many feel didn't pay off. I almost wish I didn't know what criticisms people had before viewing it again recently (I had seen the film when I was in my early teens, but forgot most of it). Some of them, such as the mis-casting of Sofia Coppola, the long, drawn-out scenes, the heavy-handed dialog, are not entirely un-founded. And I would agree that this is my least favorite of the trilogy. But I do not feel that it is a failure, or a mis-calculation by Coppola and co-author Mario Puzo. <br/><br/>In fact, right from the get-go and throughout the film, I was very intrigued by the direction of the story that was being taken, as well as with the characters. At the core, Coppola cares deeply about the Corleone family, in particular Michael (Al Pacino, his most infamous crime performance alongside Tony Montana), despite the sins that have been committed. It's a tale of redemption, of loss, and of what matters in a life dominated by greed and corruption in the legitimate as well as illegitimate places. Coppola understands this world, or at least the dynamics of it, and that's what makes Godfather 3 at the least a fascinating character study.<br/><br/>Not to mention, much of the assembled cast (with the loss of Robert Duvall being the only set-back) is still highly dependable- Pacino is great at being tragic, and his subtleties in some scenes rank with his best work (one scene that stuck with me was his confession to the priest about Fredo). Keaton, for her scenes, is alright considering her dialog. Andy Garcia makes an impression fast in one of his early performances. Eli Wallach is an interesting choice for the Don (once again, like with Tuco, an effective take on a clichéd character). And Sofia Coppola, while understandably forced in some of her emotions (or, indeed, under-cooked), is not as bad as some have made her out to be. After all, she is supposed to be just a regular girl, not within the overly dramatic landscape of the criminals and politicians. <br/><br/>And the story, which follows Michael's chances at achieving legitimacy at the turn of the end of the seventies while his nephew tries to find the line of a ""good"" made guy, keeps a viewer on edge with the style too. To put it as such, Gordon Willis keeps a consistency with his masterful work in the first two films (at least, all three in the trilogies are masterpieces of lighting and compositions, and Willis was reportedly more responsible for the look of the films than Coppola, who focused on the actors and theatrics). And such a wonderful, operatic music score by Carmine Coppola is a fitting swan song, if missing the Nina Rota touch. For me, The Godfather: part 3 (a.k.a. The Death of Michael Corleone, Coppola's original title) is only a disappointment in how there isn't (arguably) the level of ambition in regards to the others. And the violent content, although original in its tactics, may not pack the wallop one might expect.

","Although it does have notible flaws, The Godfather Part III is an incredible film. It continues the story of Michael Corleone and takes it to an all time high. Al Pacino is brilliant. It might be his best performance. The problems this film has are really just pacing issues in the first half of the film, and some dialogue that isn't great. Especially between Vincent and Mary. But these problems don't take a lot away from the movie. Now, is it as good as the first two films? No. Heck no. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.

","The Godfather part III as a stand alone movie was great. I enjoyed it immensely. Not as great as the first two movies but definitely very watchable and a fitting ending to the trilogy.<br/><br/>One reason why it's ratings are not as high as the first two is in my opinion due to the 16 year gap between the making of the first two movies and this one. That's a generation skip. You can see the same ratings decline with the Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>Movie audiences crave something new all the time and movie studios try to make what they believe the audience want. You can plainly see the cycle of the genres. Right now we're in the middle of super hero cycle, but when was the last time you saw a Western blockbuster? In my opinion it hasn't been since 1992 with Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.<br/><br/>If Godfather III was made a few years after the first two while the buzz of the first two was still strong and in the zeitgeist of the populace I believe it would be scoring much higher in IMDb as it does now."

","Sadly the third Godfather film is very detached from the two greatest films probably ever made. It suffers in comparison to The Godfather and The Godfather II. That being said, it's still a very well made film If you ignore the roman catholic scenes that slightly plague the film. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest fault of the making of this film was the time it took them to find an idea for the film. The detachment from the originals came down to time... the characters have inevitably aged in the 16 years between the films. The story has moved on considerably, many things we've missed, that needed explaining in a subtle but continuous manor.<br/><br/>Al Pacino perhaps for the first time was the stand alone actor that gripped my interest in this film. The first and second films had Brando and De Niro respectively. An ageing Michael has been The Don of the family for nearly 20 years, following in his fathers footsteps. Although my review may sound mainly negative, I can assure you it's only because i'm focusing on the comparison. The first 2 films are a perfect 10/10, the third is in my opinion an 8/10 at best. it works well as a stand alone film but in regards to its place in the trilogy it lets the side down."
"grantss","6","3","5","29 May 2016"," Unnecessary and overwrought but reasonably interesting and entertaining
","It is 1979, about 22 years since the events of The Godfather II. For Michael Corleone, the move to legitimacy is complete: the New York crime business has been handed over to Joey Zasa and all elements of the Corleone business empire are legal, non-criminal enterprises. Michael, approaching 60, is now thinking about his legacy. His charity, run by his daughter Mary, has just handed over $100 million to the Catholic Church. Michael also intends buying a large stake in International Immobiliari, a Vatican-run property company. Things are peaceful and stable but then Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, starts a feud with Joey Zasa. This has far- reaching, deadly consequences, including for Michael's deal with the Vatican.<br/><br/>Unnecessary, as The Godfather II didn't need a sequel. Francis Ford Coppola has stated that he only did it for the money. <br/><br/>The product itself is a bit hit-and-miss. Plot has some intrigue, with a Robert Ludlum-like Vatican conspiracy woven into a more conventional mafia story. This does mean a departure from the feel of the first two movies, and I'm note sure it's a good departure. The plot becomes unnecessarily complex and overwrought, making it less tight than the first two movies. Coppola also unnecessarily draws out the movie - every scene gets stretched to the limit and there's a lot of padding. He could easily have lopped 40 minutes (at least) off the movie without us losing any information or engagement.<br/><br/>Then there's the performances, which are mostly good, with two notable exceptions. The old guard - Al Pacino, Dianne Keaton, Talia Shire - put in solid performances. The change in Connie, from passive to assertive and decisive, was one of the positive features of this movie and Talia Shire is great in that role.<br/><br/>The new faces include some pretty big names: Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Andy Garcia, George Hamilton, John Savage, Bridget Fonda. Andy Garcia is great as Vincent Mancini, a worthy (potential) successor to Michael. Bridget Fonda is great but criminally underused, especially as it appeared that she would have a bigger role. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna are solid as Don Altobello and Joey Zasa, respectively, and John Savage has little screen time. <br/><br/>George Hamilton is badly miscast as BJ Harrison, Michael's attorney. He really didn't fit the part and comes off as somewhat unconvincing. He was stepping into Robert Duvall's shoes - Tom Hagen was meant to continue into The Godfather III but the character was dropped when Robert Duvall pulled out over a pay dispute - so he does suffer due to the comparison with Duvall.<br/><br/>Then we have the performance which almost single-handedly wrecks this movie: Sofia Coppola. She is absolutely atrocious as Mary Corleone, well deserving her 1991 Razzie wins for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star. Her dialogue delivery is incredibly flat and unconvincing and even when she has no dialogue she seems awkward, like she doesn't know what to do with herself when she's on camera. <br/><br/>Her flat delivery results in lack of engagement with her character, and this ruins the climax of the movie. So, there are greater consequences to her terrible performance.<br/><br/>It's a good thing she took up directing - she's clearly better at that.<br/><br/>Apparently she wasn't first choice for the part, as Julia Roberts and then Winona Ryder were cast for the role but then had to pull out. So at least Francis Ford Coppola could say she was hired more out of desperation than being his daughter. Still, he really should have kept looking... <br/><br/>(Aside: Winona Ryder as Mary - how awesome would that have been? The mind boggles. And yes, I am a big Winona Ryder fan.)<br/><br/>Overall: not bad, but not that good either."
"jackasstrange","8","3","5","10 January 2014"," The weakest of the trilogy, but still good
","I came to watch this film with the lowest expectations. I knew beforehand that it wasn't as good as the previous(masterpieces) installments, and some said it wasn't even a good film at all. Well, I enjoyed it. Not as much as the first two, much less actually, but still a good film. I admit, I don't think it was necessary at all, but hey, neither the second installment was necessary after all. The Godfather could've been finished in the way the first film ended, because after all, it was an excellent ending. But the second still turned to be a masterpiece, so why not right? And anyways, no film is necessary by this logic. <br/><br/>But lets go back to the main subject. The Godfather part III is a good film, that shows the old stage of Michael Corleone's life. Well, there is a fundamental difference in this film. Michael has much less screen time than in the previous The Godfather film, and almost as much screen time as the first Installment (that was no much more than one hour or so). His 'bastard' son, interpreted by Andy Garcia, is the one who shares screen time with Pacino. Unfortunately I don't find his character charismatic at all, what seems to be the intention. I just find him harmlessmy opinion, obviously. Those who watched The Godfather will find that his behavior looks a lot like Sonny, no wonder, is his son, so the behavior must be something hereditaryyeah, it wasn't impactive at all. <br/><br/>And anyways, it shows much more about the tragic side of being in the mob than anything else. Michael in that film is not the same Michael as the previous installments, worthy noting. He is full penitence here, and is a totally different person. Not the cold gangster that we met. He don't wants to be a 'sinner' anymore. Well, I do understand why some fans of the first two film wont like it at all. It basically kills the irony that was all around the story.<br/><br/>Technically, it's a great film, almost on par with the other films. Story wise, nowhere near. 7.8/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","5","21 October 2009"," Definitely the least one out of the series but still a more than great movie.
","It all isn't quite good enough to considering this movie a true classic, especially when you compare this one to its previous two predecessors. Out of the Godfather-trilogy this movie is also definitely the least great one but that of course really does not mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it of course really.<br/><br/>I still see ""The Godfather: Part III"" as a great movie to end the saga. It ties up the loose ends and shows how the characters from the first two movies end up eventually, in the more modern world and age of the late '70's.<br/><br/>It's quite amazing that this movie got made 14 years after the previous Godfather movie but it still manages to maintain the same type of atmosphere and overall cinematic style, even when this movie is set in an entirely different time frame as well, as from the previous two movies. I think that's also way there is simply no way hating this movie when you've already loved watching the previous two movies, even though when this still remains a much hated and criticized movie, which just seems to be simply because of the fact that this movie isn't quite as good as the previous two masterpieces out of the series.<br/><br/>It was also great to see that after 14 years basically every actor was willing to reprise his role again from the previous- or the first two movies. Even persons who played some very small roles return in this movie again, except for Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who was demanding too much to reprise his role again. His character is being replaced by a new one, played by George Hamilton. Hamilton is of course not the only new big name in this movie. Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna and Eli Wallach are all some welcomed new additions to the cast. Garcia even earned his, so far, only Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. And yes well about Sofia Coppola. She simply is no actress and there should had been no way that she should had been in this movie but her character and her plot line with the Garcia character all play a fairly small part, considering that the story is build up out of many different story lines, which all brilliantly come together in the final sequence.<br/><br/>""The Godfather: Part III"" is well written and it has a great main premise of the Corleone family trying to legitimize their business. But just when they thought they were out, they get pulled back right in, when different characters from different corners try to take advantage of the situation, business and money-wise. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is the first Godfather movie that is not being based on a Mario Puzo novel but I feel that out of the three Godfather movies the story in this one works out the best, from a cinematic perspective. It's definitely really a movie written for the screen, which had still Mario Puzo involved as the writer of the screenplay, along with the director Francis Ford Coppola.<br/><br/>Just like the previous the previous two movies, this movie as well as some great memorable sequences in it, which not in the least are due thanks to the great acting in the movie. It's a movie that got nominated for 7 Oscar's, including best picture, but eventually it won none. It was up against movies like ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Ghost"" and ""Awekenings"" that year, so it's no big shame that it won none. It at least says nothing about the great qualities of this movie.<br/><br/>A great fitting movie to end the Godfather trilogy.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"laursene","Null","3","5","26 October 2004"," Yes, a travesty
","Critics cut this movie a lot of slack when it came out, because of its pedigree. The other commentators here are doing it the same favor, I think. In fact, Godfather III is a complete travesty. All the crime family saga clichés that the first two movies sidestepped, but that subsequently became encrusted on the genre, are sadly present in this misguided cash-in.<br/><br/>The greatest shame of all is Al Pacino's performance. Watching the first two movies today, it's hard to imagine how the powerfully subtle, minimal Michael Corleone he created in the early '70s could turn into the garrulous, scenery-chewing troll of 1990. His ""tour guide"" scene with Keaton in Sicily is the worst: Pacino seems to have completely forgotten what kind of a person he had played 16 years earlier. Andy Garcia does an OK job of channeling the young James Caan, but that's about it for acting honors. The rest of the cast come across as an over-the-hill ensemble of Acting 101 rejects, including Wallach, Keaton, Shire, Hamilton (no surprise), etc.<br/><br/>SPOILER: Even worse: As proud Italian Americans, how could Coppola and Puzo descend to concocting a plot that climaxes with the eating of a poison canole? The whole mishmash ends with a church-steps death scene that's like a parody of the most over-the-top-operatic Puccini rip-off you ever saw. The first two Godfathers were a milestone in depicting the American ethnic experience on screen, in all its ambiguities. The third turns it all to grotesque self-parody.<br/><br/>For relief, I suggest picking up The Freshman with the late Marlon Brando. Brando's slyly humorous take on Don Corleone in Andrew Bergman's film is a gentle send-up that respects its point of reference and even adds some grace notes to it. The scene of Brando, in pin-striped suit, just strolling through the streets of 1990s Little Italy is the closest we'll get to a real Godfather III."

","Let me be a bit more precise: If you were to see this movie without having seen or known much about the first two (and why would you do that, pray tell?), you might find it a mildly entertaining Hollywood production, marred by ham acting, a script that covers a lot of ground to no good effect, and egregious Italianamerican stereotypes. Coming to it with a knowledge of the first two films, what I saw was a travesty - a totally unnecessary film that unintentionally parodied most of what was great about its predecessors.<br/><br/>The critics were pretty kind to Godfather III when it came out, no doubt out of the respect for I and II. But the truth is quite dismal.<br/><br/>Where to even begin? In place of the powerfully minimal, understated performances he gave in I and II, Al Pacino gives yet another of the scenery-chewing exhibitions he's been prone to of late. The part where he chauffeurs Diane Keaton around Sicily looks like it was accidentally thrown in from a bad cable-TV travelogue. Talia Shire's performance is a kitsch-fest of Italianamerican cliches. Although perversely entertaining, it has nothing to do with the character she created in the first two films. George Hamilton as the consigliere instead of Robert Duvall? What were they thinking??? The only reason Sofia Coppola isn't laughed off the screen is because all the other performances here are so broadly awful that she actually comes across as somewhat understated (although her Valley Girl intonations are pretty hopeless).<br/><br/>One of the great things about Godfathers I and II was the way they avoided cliches and gave dignity to Italian American characters in a setting that's usually been used to stereotype them, and in fact used them to comment not on mafia corruption but on the corruption of America itself. Not here! The penultimate scenes with the poison canoli at the opera are Italianamerican kitsch to the Nth, and the killing on the opera house steps that follows is just bad Verdi.<br/><br/>It's clear this movie was made entirely for the bucks. Coppola and Puzo had nothing left to say about these characters. Let's just pretend it doesn't exist, shall we?"
"EW-3","Null","3","5","26 January 1999"," The word ""bomb"" is an understatement.
","This was one of the biggest disappointments ever to hit the silver screen, and please don't blame Sofia - she was the least of its troubles. It was almost like the creators intentionally set out to make this movie bad, for a number of reasons:<br/><br/>1) No plot: What exactly was this film about? Something to do with the Vatican banking scandal, I think. (Yawn) Wake me when it's over.<br/><br/>2) Lack of continuity with the first two films: Parts I and II told interesting and believable stories. I have no idea what this film was trying to say. Even though you had all the familiar faces, the story didn't really fit with the last images we saw of Michael sitting on the shores of Lake Tahoe in the 1974 film. There were a few places in which this film looked like it was trying to make a weak attempt at borrowing from Goodfellas - which came out the same year. Why? Goodfellas was a completely different kind of film. There was no need to steal from it (and no pun intended).<br/><br/>3) Spending all that money to get back Diane Keaton: Again, why? Her character was basically written out in Part II. A rekindling of their romance, however mild, was not only a distraction but also not credible.<br/><br/>4) Not spending the money to get back Robert Duvall: On the other hand, the Tom Hagen character was still important to the saga, and could have been used in interesting ways (e.g., suppose Tom had betrayed Michael as well, only in a more complex manner?). Duvall should have been in this film. Instead, they used...<br/><br/>5) George Hamilton: They had to be kidding on this one.<br/><br/>6) Changes to the Talia Shire character: Connie as a Sicilian Ma Barker was an even bigger joke. By the way, if she was so sinister, wouldn't she have had enough brains to figure out what really happened to Fredo?<br/><br/>7) Underdeveloped Andy Garcia, Joe Mantegna, Eli Wallach, and  John Savage characters: Especially Savage as Tom Hagen's son, whose brief appearances were a total mystery (was his character originally conceived as having a more critical role in the story?). All around, there was just too much wasted talent in this film.<br/><br/>8) Lack of original music - It borrowed too much from the first two films. The stroll down ""Michael's Memory Lane"" while the son performed a rendition of ""Speak Softly, Love"" almost made me want to stroll out of the theater. The use of the Intermezzo during the credits was stolen (pun intended this time) from Raging Bull, which further suggests that Coppola had Scorsese on his mind.<br/><br/>9) The End: The creators should have had the ""guts"" to kill off Michael by means of a climactic ambush, not an anticlimactic stroke or heart attack (that last scene reminded me of Artie Johnson's routine in Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In). The death of the daughter meant nothing to the audience.<br/><br/>10) Laying the seeds for Godfather IV - Lord help us; I think I would be more intrigued by Rocky XVIII.<br/><br/>*  *  *<br/><br/>When they were making this film, I remember reading somewhere that its plot was supposed to be a modern-day, organized crime version of the Cataline Conspiracy. That, intertwined perhaps with the story of the fall of a real-life mobster for Pacino's character, would have made for a fascinating film, even better than the first two. Instead, we were left with a movie so bad, it even tarnishes the reputation of the first two films to some degree. Alas, whatever Coppolla had back in the 70s, he no longer had it when he made this film."

In no point in this movie does Michael actually look like a Don.  This is a far cry from the strong character he was in the second movie.  This may well be showing the fall of organized crime, but I don't think that was Coppola's intention, and if it was he did a bad job of conveying that message.  Also, Connie is suddenly a powerful character.  Apparently all of Coppola's strong characters were dead so he had to take the only recognizable character that was left and make her some sort of family business matriarch.  In the first two movies she had nothing to do with the family business.  The plot in this movie is also disjointed and confusing.  At the beginning of the movie it seems like Michael barely recognizes Vincent Mancini, but throughout the film Vincent is his right hand man.

","Many have thrashed ""The Godfather Part III"" with one familiar quote from the first two ""The Godfather"" films by saying that this movie is ""An offer you can refuse"".No question that many movie fans have shown lack of respect and appreciation for this film by saying that it ruined the legacy of the two film which many - including myself - considered as both classics and each one a masterpiece.But the question remains,""Is The Godfather Part III an offer you can refuse?"" <br/><br/>The Godfather Part III was released 16 years after the sequel - The Godfather Part II - was show in theaters.It acts as the epilogue of the story of Don Michael Corleone,portrayed by Al Pacino, after he reluctantly replaced his father - Don Vito - into becoming the Godfather or primary leader of the Corleone organized crime family in the first part and how he turned into a ruthless and soulless Don during his protection of the business interests of the Corleone family in casinos and gambling after an attempt was made on his life in the second part.<br/><br/>In the third part,we get to see Michael finally closing into his objective of the finally making the Corleone criminal empire into becoming a legitimate business operation with the participation of the Catholic Church particularly the Vatican Bank.In addition to that,we also get to witness the succession of the Godfather from Michael to the illegitimate son of his brother Sonny in Vincent Mancini,portrayed by Andy Garcia.Finally,we also get to see how Michael has to overcome the obstacles presented by the other gangsters like Joey Zaza as well as Don Licio Lucchesi and Don Altobello,both whom want to take part in Michael's legitimate business and to upset his goal of leaving the mob for good. <br/><br/>No question that the third part still presents a great story.The plot was based on Pope John Paul I,who was only pope for 33 days, and the Papal banking scandal that occurred back in the early 1980's.The obstacles presented by the other members of the mob to Michael's legitimacy remains interesting as well as the corruption that the members of the clergy of the Catholic Church that could be capable of doing.In addition to the great story,there was a lot of great performances like Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Andy García, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna.Too bad that many saw the poor and much maligned performance of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter,Sofia Coppola.<br/><br/>Despite of these great qualities that I have mentioned,I still must admit that it is not at level with the first two films.No question that the reunion of ex-spouses Kay and Michael as well as the romance between first cousins - Vincent Mancini and Mary Corleone - were somewhat not given much thought and I felt that these romantic stories proved as a distraction.Also,the sudden change of Michael from a ruthless and soulless character into becoming a benevolent person lacked better development. Added to that,familiar elements from the first two films remain present in this film.Finally,one must be really familiar with the first two parts of ""The Godfather"" to have better appreciation of this film.Evidently,it will not be a good stand alone film for one should watch the other films.<br/><br/>But nevertheless,I must conclude that the third film remains ""an offer one cannot refuse"" for it is a great film despite being far from being a classic and a masterpiece unlike the first two films."
"n-mo","9","4","8","8 October 2008"," Worthy of its place
","Detractors of The Godfather part III have two main gripes: the most obvious is Sofia Coppola's acting skills as Mary Corleone, and the second is the character of Michael Corleone, who bears less resemblance to the cold, calculating criminal mastermind of the first two films. Regarding the first point, I have to agree that Sofia Coppola is insufferable in this film. Thankfully, she had little screen time. However, she looked wonderful: she was convincing enough as a ""cute little lovestruck innocent daughter"" that I could believe she meant a lot to her family and her father in particular.<br/><br/>As to the second point, some things need to be born in mind. The Michael Corleone of the first two films had descended into the lowest possible place, yes, murdering his own brother (among others) by the end. He had become everything he did not want to be and worse: his reign over his family's criminal empire was Machiavellian on a level his father had never dreamed of nor would ever have allowed.<br/><br/>But by the beginning of this film, a decade and a half had passed since he had crossed the terrible trough of fratricide. Michael's parents and brothers were all dead during this time, Tom Hagan passed away (although the loss of the character was a tragedy, it served the story very well to accent Michael's sense of isolation) and Connie was clearly far too unstable and too much of a yes-woman to ever provide true companionship. Michael was not a man easily resigned to being alone and he had a fierce protective instinct--even if it could be overrode by his jealous vengeful nature--for ""his own."" Remember that in Part I, he always hoped to return to the States as soon as possible and when this seemed a tenebrous goal, he sought a marriage and a new life in Sicily. Throughout Part II, he lost two more members of his family and his wife left him. It is not hard to imagine that the murder of Freddo would in fact be his moral trough, that the pent-up guilt could have spilt over into guilt at having deprived his young children of their mother and perhaps even a fear that they would grow up in his shadow, so he gave them up, even though he knew it meant further isolation.<br/><br/>But he knew all along that his cold, calculating criminality had taken him to this horrible place, and so he has spent the years since sloughing through the long marsh out while yet keeping his own person intact and out of prison. Obviously, given how much he aged from Part II to Part III, such a task has taken its toll, both physically and psychologically, and this is portrayed brilliantly. And what of Michael's sudden lavishness? I can tell you from personal experience that when you experience extreme isolation from those you love, you often cling as never before to the greatest treasures of your ethnic and religious heritage, cultivating them with the utmost sincerity partly because these are reminders that you are a real human connected with others and that you belong somewhere. The need to belong somewhere and to something and someone more concrete than the ""global citizenry"" is universal, and I don't know how either Puzo or Coppola could have known about this, but they did an amazing job.<br/><br/>""What good is Confession if you don't repent?"" Good question. Michael longs for redemption and forgiveness, but almost to the end he seeks legitimacy on his own terms, a quiet retirement from the Mafia. The result is a subtle illustration of the observation of the Curé d'Ambricourt in Robert Bresson's Le journal d'un Curé de campagne: ""You can't bargain with God. You must give yourself up to Him, all at once, as you are."" Michael's sins live on apart from him, and by the end are visited full circle on the people he loves.<br/><br/>But the ending is cryptic enough that we have to ask: was Michael redeemed? Did truth and justice ultimately prevail at the Vatican? Will they ever prevail anywhere, even imperfectly, before the next life?<br/><br/>When Anthony Corleone asks of Sicily, ""Why is such a beautiful country so violent?"" he opens up yet another flood of mysteries. How to resign ourselves to living in a world of so much beautiful treasure and yet so much of it born in great crime (think, for example, of the great Deicide, of Christ redeeming mankind, nailed to the Cross)--and how and in what circumstances can they be ours for the legitimate taking and cherishing? The Godfather part III provokes such difficult questions in all those willing to see and ponder them.<br/><br/>If the acting and cinematography are not as polished as in the second installment, a film set anywhere in Italy needs little visual embellishment, and the music sets the mood for each scene perfectly. The Godfather part III reminds us of the world ever-present outside the closed sphere of Cosa Nostra and captures the struggle of one man teetering on the high-current edge. If you are unwilling to expand your mind beyond criminal exploits and into the personal anguish of their effects on real human beings, stay away. If, however, you have even a slight appreciation for psychology and/or Roman Catholic moral theology, you will welcome this rounding out of one of the greatest sagas ever invented."
"tom-darwin","5","4","8","5 April 2006"," Overlong, overblown, overwrought, over-hyped
","While the first two films were allegories of the development of modern organized crime in New York, Las Vegas and Sicily, ""Godfather III"" moves into the realm of spy thrillers while at the same time being a sort of reunion, comeback effort for the old Godfather band. The once cool and assured Michael Corleone, now humanized by age and the torment of his guilty memories, contrasts with over-the-top violence that would have fitted into a ""Die Hard"" movie. Perhaps Pacino should have played two roles, like Peter Sellers--one as Michael, the other reprising Tony Montana from ""Scarface."" Still, if anyone makes this film work it is the always-fine Pacino, as well as the overlooked Joe Mantegna. Diane Keaton, who so effectively gave us an ""average American"" perspective of the Mafia in the first two films, has little to do in this film except accompany us on a tour of Sicily--which we already had in the second film. A striking, effective surprise ending didn't quite pick me up because I had pretty much lost interest a half hour earlier."

Look at every positive or even vaguely positive review for this film.<br/><br/>Despite what anyone says, this is a long, annoying, silly film, with nothing to say. Yes, Sofia Coppola wasn't up to playing the lead role, but Al Pacino was just as uninteresting, due to his character's poor conception.<br/><br/>Hell, even the boys at the Bada Bing club in ""The Sopranos"" know that part III is crap.

"Predator-11","7","4","8","7 January 2002"," Not even close to the first two, but probably not as bad as you've heard.
","I recently picked up The Godfather DVD Collection, having seen (and loved) the first two films. I proceeded to watch the first two over again, enjoying every minute almost as much as the first time around. Then I watched the third one, which I had never seen before. I'd heard how bad it was, and how Coppola ruined the series with Part III, so my hopes were less than high, even though the brilliance of the first two films was still fresh in my mind. So I watched it all the way through, trying to keep an unbiased oppinion.<br/><br/>Well, it's not great, that's for sure. But I wouldn't call it horrible either. It certainly lacks the wonderful mood and appeal of the first two films, and it doesn't hold together nearly as well. The first two are so masterful that it takes a very keen eye and many repeated viewings to find even the most minute flaws in them. In Part III, there's plenty of cheesy scenes, forced acting and hammy lines. On the other hand, a lot of the scenes were really good. I liked most of the time spent in Rome, especially the confession scene with Michael and the soon-to-be Pope. The construction of the story itself was pretty decent as well, although it's ruined a little bit by some bad acting. <br/><br/>The main problem with the story of Part III was that it wasn't about anything the audience really cared about, and it certainly wasn't anything new. Part I gave us the story of an aging Mafia crime boss, who's family goes into chaos when he's shot. And Michael, the moral son who doesn't want to get involved with his families business, but feels it's his duty when he sees the corruption in the law and the government. Part II gave us the continuing story of Michael Corleone, trying to vanquish his enemies, and it also had the side story of Vito Corleone as a young man coming to America and his rise to power. To me the scenes with De Niro as Vito was the best part of Part II, and I don't think the film would've been nearly as great without them. Part III was the story of the aging Michael Corleone, but we'd already seen the same type of thing in Part I. So we start looking for parallels between Parts I and III, but they're just not there. So we start looking for originality and redeeming qualities of Part III on it's own, but we have a hard time looking past some of the flaws.<br/><br/>Frankly I just didn't really give a damn about any of the characters in Part III. Michael was an old man, and I could guess he would be dead by the end of the film. Connie had suddenly turned into this hard Mafia consultant, which didn't seem to fit her character from the originals at all. Vincent was basically James Caan's character, Sonny, from the original, only Andy Garcia isn't as good an actor and didn't pull it off as believably. Also it seems hard to believe that Michael would leave the family in the hands of someone so brash and forward as Vincent. The character we were really supposed to care about, Mary, was completely blown by a terrible acting performance by Sofia Coppola, that has to be one of the worst casting calls I've ever seen. I literally laughed at the end (you all know what scene I'm talking about), her acting was just so canned and cheesy it was really pathetic.<br/><br/>On an up note, the cinematography was great once again. Although the film didn't have the same play on light and shadowing that the first two had, it did have some amazing shots of Rome and Sicily. The film was very pleasent to look at throughout. The music was also very good, although I think they used Nino Rota's original theme a bit too much.<br/><br/>Of course, if you compare Part III to the first two films, your going to come up with tons of problems with it and probably won't like it very much. But on it's own it's a pretty decent movie, there have been tons of better Mafia films (Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco etc..) but it's still alright. What's so disappointing is that the first two are amazing, and the third one is just pretty good. But it says a lot about a series when the worst of the bunch is still a good movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give The Godfather Part III, 6 stars."
"eszynaka","1","6","14","4 June 2008"," Not up to par
","I only have one comment. Sofia Copalla is the worst actor ever. The movie is ruined by her performance. The story line is sadly more like a TV soap opera. This could have been a great sequel but it is just a formula film bound to make lots of money. This clearly ends the Godfather legend. For viewers accustom to good character development you will be very sad for paying good money to see this film. Goodfellers is much better. Francis Ford Copalla can do much better. I suggest that a alternative plot paced around the character of Tom Hagan or his son would have been interesting. Another possibility would have been in the area of the other five families. Or perhaps it would have been interesting to go even further backward to the start of the Mafia. But most of all the romance in the movie serves no purpose."

","The first Godfather was absolutely world class.

There was barely any of it, hardly like the original masterpiece that dominated the box office and still is the best-selling UK movie! This movie is rubbish and I regret seeing it, I knew the reviews were bad but they said that about the Godfather 2 and it was amazing so I saw it and it was terrible.

","I think the problem here is that the direction of the movie is all over the place. At times the music seems to be right on point, and others it's underutilized. New characters are introduced, and the story is a little confusing. Al Pacino wasn't given enough dramatic scenes that showcase his acting ability. Scenes are short and kinda jump around a lot. No character in the movie is given a lot of screen time, so you don't get to like them or hate them, they're just kind of there. That said, the story is fairly straightforward even if it is a little confusing you can still guess and will probably be right in who's trying to do what in the movie. Some of the actors don't have the acting chops to do their character right, so that's a little annoying. The scenes in Italy are beautiful and capture that Godfather 1 and 2 feel. I do recommend you watch this one if you're a Godfather fan just to close out the series. The movie is entertaining enough and there are even a couple really good shocking scenes. If you've got an afternoon, why not?"

","Honestly, I am baffled with all the negative reviews that I have read for the final part of this timeless classic. The story picks up couple of years later after the second part ended. Michael's kids are all grown up now and they have different visions and ambitions for their lives that not necessarily correspond with their father's plan. Michael is doing everything in his power to finally turn a new page in his family's life and leave the dark past behind, but soon figures out that things are not as simple as he wishes them to be. We are introduced to a new character, Vincent (Sonny's illegitimate son), who has his father's temper but still menages to find the patience to listen to his wise uncle. The only thing that i really missed in this movie was Robert Duvall's character. Also i have to say that i strongly disagree with the critics who argue that Francis Coppola made a wrong decision by casting his daughter as Michael Corleone's daughter. I think Sofia Coppola played her role perfectly. And when it comes to the ending.. i never cried to any movie's ending (I was really close while watching the ending of One flew over the Cuckoo's nest) but man this ending left me speechless. <br/><br/>If you are a movie fan do yourself a favor and watch all three movies because they are a piece of movie history that will be remembered for generations."

But still, I've seen a lot of issues with how this film became a crushing disappointment to the Godfather trilogy. I've seen a lot of good and bad actors, but damn, when I saw Sofia Coppola acts in a role of Mary Corleone. That is one of the worst I've seen, I'm not hating on her or whatsoever, but obviously she's pretty damn nervous the whole time. I love the cast and the whole characterization. All I see is an old Al Pacino, who tries hard this time around. He is a brilliant actor that's for sure. The Godfather part lll. Undoubtedly falling short of its predecessors, the conclusion to this beautiful trilogy still ends on a well written note. No blame is given though since the role this film played was crucial and judged with such intensity that it may have been impossible to reach.

"connmoore","4","2","3","10 December 2008"," Boring, pointless sequel to movie greatness
","If ever you need proof that Francis Ford Coppola lost his ability to make great movies sometime back in the 1970's, here is the living proof.<br/><br/>Coppola decides to create a movie centered around family, by using way too many members of his own, woefully untalented family.<br/><br/>Talia Shire, a minor character in the first two movies, is now brought front and center in this film. The fact that she is Coppola's sister cannot overcome her weakness as an actress. For a serious drama like this, her complete lack of gravity and presence weakens the film.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with the actors in the film, is Coppola's own daughter, Sofia Coppola, in the part of Mary Corleone. A large part of the movie centers around her character, and the younger Coppola is completely out of her league trying to act the part. Never once do you believe the character she tries to create.<br/><br/>Other lightweight actors populate the film. Instead of the WASPish Robert Duval, as the family adviser, we instead get the even more WASPish George Hamilton, the very definition of lightweight actor.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie that is in any way compelling, is the relationship between Micheal Corleone, played by Al Pacino, and his illegitimate nephew Vincent, played by a very good Andy Garcia. Unfortunately this aspect of the film is not the centerpiece of it, and everything around it is pointless. overlong, and poorly written.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, but have enjoyed the first two films, do yourself a favor and just skip it."

","This movie is definitely underrated and criticized harshly. I can empathize with people who expected more action, thriller especially after watching the first two members of the sequel. But the viewers need to understand one thing: ""Bigger crimes are political by nature"".<br/><br/>The ending could not be pictured better than this. If you climb the criminal ladder, you eventually hit the rock of the politics and you have to deal with it. Given the fact that Michelle Corleone had a great power, he was a big threat to the political mafia, and he had to deal with it. If the main character is the big player himself, why bother showing small crimes in a limited time? It would be a waste of time. Also no matter who you are, no matter how powerful you are, there is always battle inside you aside from your external ones and this battle inside you is harder than any other external battle.

","Okay it's the weakest of the Godfather films as Mario Puzo died before it would be produced, but I am also againist all those who claim that it's bad.
It's a nice epilogue to Michael Corleone's story, paying tribute to his character who finally understands Vito's teachings.
But the film itself proves that the soul of the Godfather was Mario Puzo. They were his characters and only he himself could trully understand them. Coppola created a fine third installment, but I believe that if Puzo was around to write the film and not only contribute the story, scenes like the love scenes or Michael's turn of character would have been done in a better, more fitting to the Godfather's atmosphere themes.
Finally, even though I watched the film with an open mind, it is true that Sofia Coppola being cast was a terrible move...

","As many other people have mentioned, the 3rd part of the Godfather saga falls short in comparison to what it follows, but as the concluding chapter, it does fairly well. The worst thing about it is that it feels rushed. It lacks the extremely meticulous workmanship of Coppola in the first two chapters.<br/><br/>Money was a big issue during production (in Hollywood, when isn't it?) which ended in Robert Duvall not being in part 3. His replacement, George Hamilton (not the same character, of course) does a good job, but his role is rather limited here. Apparently, an even bigger issue was time, which may be why the film feels rushed in certain aspects.<br/><br/>The plot involves Michael Corleone in his 60s, trying to completely legitimize his work and retire. Problem is, he doesn't have anyone to pass on the torch. His son isn't the least bit interested in following his footsteps, but his nephew, Sonny's son (who has the same anger issues as his father) catches his attention. He also has to deal with the corrupt Vatican businessmen who, at the last minute, backtrack from their mega business deal.<br/><br/>The usual elements of the Godfather saga are all here: Masterful visuals, costumes and sets, a grand opening scene of celebration, a great score, and wonderful performances by all the cast... well, almost all the cast. And no, my issue is not with Sophia Coppola, who accepted and performed her role under pressure. She does what she can. No, my issue is with Andy Garcia'a character, Vince. Or rather, the way the character is written: He is like a poor caricature of an Italian mob guy. Did they think making him angry and yelling all the time would resemble Sonny? He looks like he was transferred from the set of another film. There is no way Michael Corleone would pass on his empire to this kind of guy. Not because he's a hothead, but because he lacks any kind of brains and judgment.<br/><br/>The centerpiece is once again Al Pacino, who masterfully portrays an old man slowly beginning to crush under the weight of his past. The supporting cast is equally great: Eli Wallach is chillingly scary behind his sweet old man exterior, and Talia Shire (who plays a very different Conny), Joe Mantegna, Diane Keaton, Richard Bright, Don Novello and Enzo Robutti all give wonderful performances. The great Raf Vallone's role is small but memorable, as always.<br/><br/>If only the studio heads had given enough time to work on the story and the script, and a few bucks to retain the original cast, this would've been a much more memorable film. As it is, it stands on its own very well. But if you watch the three movies back to back, this is the one that sticks out like a sore thumb (mainly because of the love story between Michael's daughter and Vince, which bogs down the story, and the haphazard way the Vince character is written). It's still a good movie, but not great like its predecessors. Although quite clearly, it could've been."

","The first two films were for most part, historical in nature. They did not place as many demands on the viewer to be aware of anything beyond basic common knowledge of the eras in which the stories took place. The stories told in these first two films are interwoven around the reality of their respective time periods; many American immigrants received new names at Ellis Island, that little desert town in Nevada truly evolved out of vice and corruption, the drug trade began in earnest after WWII and so on...
Part three, at the time of its release required an understanding of real world recent events as the story was set in the time of its release and weaved the plot though some very real and controversial events of the time. Lest you forgot, Roberto Calvi, a banker with close Vatican ties, truly was found hanging under Blackfriar's Bridge in London England in 1982.
The only real fault one could claim was that the story could not be told in one film if it had to spend extra effort explaining the links between recent events and the ""family business"".
Personally, I enjoy being challenged by a film in this manner and found the continuation of the story and its conclusion very effective and satisfying."

","The Godfather Part III was a huge disappointment. The film has major flaws. The story is very convoluted. There is a comic vibe to some of the mafia names. Joey Zaza sounds like a stand-up. As for other problems.<br/><br/>Kay becoming friendly with Michael was very stupid. Michael was a monster by the time ""The Godfather II"" was over. <br/><br/>Connie becoming ""Michael's Protector"" and somewhat a low lever boss.

After all Michael had her husband and brother killed. Connie finally getting revenge would have been a much better angle to pursue. <br/><br/>As for the casting of Sofia Coppola! She was so bad that she never recovered as an actress! She has gone on to write and direct films. However I have a feeling that the Oscar she won for Best Screenplay for ""Lost in Translation"" should have been given to her husband (at the time) Spike Jonze.

"prudhoeboy","10","4","9","20 May 2010"," Casting Coup
","I've read a lot of the bad reviews about this film and couldn't disagree more. In my opinion, this is a brilliant film that relies mainly on casting for its success. While the plot is a bit disjointed in places, the gaps make the viewer think more. I thought the Vatican scenes were a bit of a yawn and seemed to stray a bit from the main Hamlet-like theme (i.e., torment, guilt from the past). (Too bad, could have been a perfect setting to spook Michael with Fredo's ghost or Jesus on the cross or something. I could have seen him do a collapse routine overcome with guilt.) Michael's carefully chosen words clearly speak louder than the violent actions of his younger days as an ambitious mobster. Likewise, his restraint in dealing with enemies contrast with the hubris of his younger days. All the other characters revolve in his world and react to him. Everyone in the film looked Sicilian or Italian and were very believable. Eli The Ugly did not disappoint, reprising his role as the villainous worm he was in the spaghetti western genre. Perhaps he represents the mobster in grotesque, what Michael could have become if he did not have his family. I'm also amazed that Sofia Coppola was so good in this film! I think the criticism of her was off base and maybe just a little envious that a director's daughter could step in and do so well. I guess sometimes talent does run in the family. This movie is all about the journey of life and fragility of human existence, where a life can end in an instant and a tough guy can be brought to tears. It is a classic film evoking primal elements not unlike 2001. Part III completes the trilogy in a big way. It is a must see film."
"mafioso67","10","4","9","16 April 2008"," excellent godfather movie, just in a different way
","I see that many people have posted comments admitting their dislike of this film, with the most common reason being the manner in which it derives from the former two. I too agree in part with this statement, for the story does differ in the way it is told, but I feel that this is for the better. In the previous two films, whilst fantastic in their storyline too, they were exactly that; a story being told to us, where we merely observe the series of events and part of the manipulation and thought process that goes into creating them. There is no deep emotional connection between audience and character, where sure, on occasion we may feel sorry for a character, but it is short lived, and in reality, we are not that deeply engaged, because our attention is stretched and focused upon the complexity of these events. The third Godfather admittedly strays from this; however I would argue that this is for the better, for that connection between character and audience is so much stronger, and if you are seriously watching it, you can do no more that empathise and feel for Michael, and the pain his life has caused to both him and the others around him. Yes, in part, the story is a little clichéd, and a little thinner, but this is not at the loss of the film, it merely changes the nature of the film, from one of action and thought, to one of an emotional exploration of the character of Michael Corleone. Furthermore, to the argument that it strays too far from the original two, overall, it does in fact fit in with the general story. It is a story about Michael's going legitimate, a goal that he has outlined and carried right from the earliest scenes of Connie's wedding, where he courts Kay. I ask, to close such a trilogy, where else should one go with the story? It needed closure, and this film achieves it. <br/><br/>I must further advocate the brilliance of the final scenes, in the montage of Michael's life, and death. I feel that these are the most powerful scenes of the entire trilogy, for they encapsulate the meaning of the story; 'that crime is wrong doesn't pay'. Although subtle in the first two films, it can be seen through the paradoxical transformation of Michael as a character, where he commits crime for good, not evil. His nobility in going into the criminal business, is maintained by his motivations, first in protecting his family, and secondly, in turning his family away from crime, into the legitimate world. In the final scenes of the third movie, the power shows where we can do nothing but feel for Michael, for he is a martyr. He does the right thing, in trying to protect and save his family, and yet, as shown in the montage, of his loss of Appolina, Kay, his daughter, his brothers, and nearly his father, crime, the one thing he has been forced into to do good, has cost him everything he has ever held dear to him. This price he has paid is further accentuated by his modest, sad and lonely death, where, despite being in Sicily, the country he loves, he is alone, and dies without any grandeur - which I guess in part is also symbolic of his character's nature; modest and quiet - I understand that this is somewhat open to interpretation, however, I myself, have not yet seen a scene or moment of such power and meaning in either of the two previous films, and I challenge those who argue that the third Godfather is a poor film compared to the other two, to find me a moment of such concentrated greatness and gravity, because not only do these final scenes encapsulate the entire meaning, motivation, and central idea of the Godfather trilogy, the clever writing of this scene also changes the entire contextual nature of this 9 hour journey, from one where we believe that we, as the audience are sitting in the present, watching the turn of events as they occur, to one where we realise that we were actually witnessing and privy to Michael's reminiscence, of his life, crime, what it has cost him, and subsequently the cruelty of the world before him. Again, I understand that this is somewhat opinion based, however, I feel that this shows the true value and power of the film, where it, in effect, despite being about 9 hours into the story, the scene actually changes the entire meaning of all that precedes it (i.e. both the Godfather part 1 and 2). To reiterate my point, I would argue that the third godfather is just as great if not greater than the former two, the only thing is that it is written differently, so that the greatness of it, is aimed at a more academic, and inquisitive audience, rather than the general populus, because lets face it, as fantastic as the movies are, the storyline of 1 and 2 is nothing overly spectacular; and it primarily gains its status as a 'modern classic' from the performances within it. This is because at least in my eyes, there is no underlying theme, or hidden message or motif; it is just a straightforward story, (and there is nothing wrong with that), but the third does have a little more of this intellectuality behind it, and so for the audiences that are, shall we say more accustomed to the simplistic structure, they find themselves unable to be stimulated by the subverted themes, thus I argue that the third Godfather is worth a 10, if not something very close to it, because it is an excellent Godfather movie, just in a different way."

","""The Godfather Part III"" tells the epilogue of the story of Don Michael Corleone as he moves his criminal empire into legitimate business operations with an international real estate company known as Internazionale Immobiliare together with the involvement of the Catholic Church and its business enterprise known as the Vatican Bank. Al Pacino returns for the third film to reprise his role as Michael together with Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García as Vincent Mancini,who is going to replace Michael as the new Don, together with Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.Francis Ford Coppola returns as director and the co- screenwriter of the film that was based on the story of Pope John Paul I,who became pope for only 33 days,and the Papal Bank scandal that occurred in the 1980's, together with novel's author Mario Puzo.<br/><br/>No question that it provides us an interesting story of how Don Michael Corleone moves away from the mob with his involvement in legitimate business operations as well as the corruption in the Catholic Church after we have seen a reluctant son assume leadership of the Corleone crime family in the after his father - Don Vito Corleone - died in first film and how he expanded his criminal empire that ultimately cost his family and become more of a ruthless person in the second film. <br/><br/>We are also treated to great performances from the cast particularly Al Pacino,Diane Keaton,Talia Shire,Eli Wallach and Andy Garcia,who received an Oscar nomination.Too bad that many saw the poor performance of the director's daughter Sophia Coppola,who obviously isn't at par with the talent of the rest of the cast members.That somehow hurt the film a lot and somehow Sofia's terrible acting overshadowed the great acting performances of the cast.<br/><br/>Another thing working against it is the fact that the viewer should have seen the first two films to have better appreciation of the third film.It is definitely not a stand-alone film for it is a continuation of the first two films.<br/><br/>Other elements working against it are the familiar plots used in the first two films do exist in the third film like upsetting the mob order and succession of the mob leadership from Michael to his nephew,Vincent. Also,the film misses Robert Duvall as Michael's lawyer Tom Hagen,who could have been a strong presence for Michael in the decisions that he makes.Finally,we also see interesting character developments that lack explanations like Michael's sister Connie,who develops from being a weak woman into becoming a member of the mob that is involved in killing; and that of Michael,who became benevolent after attaining a high degree of ruthlessness after the second film.I felt that these character developments should have been made and explained in the third film instead of just happening in the story.<br/><br/>But in spite of these things I have mentioned,I still see it as a great film despite not being a classic unlike the first two films.It was still a nice conclusion to the story of Michael Corleone."
"oldgoldtop","3","3","6","27 January 2014"," Unnecessary Sequel
","There was a Godfather Marathon on TV this weekend so I finally had a chance to see the final sequel. I give this a 3 because it seemed a pointless addition to the first two films that were so good. I really had expected something more. I am surprised this disappointing screenplay was selected. <br/><br/>Michael's search for redemption seems conflicted, insincere and ultimately unsuccessful. He continues to choose revenge and wreak destruction that damages his family and his soul. So why bother except maybe to cash in? The ending to GF2 was sufficient. There really is nothing new...except he dies (physically). The final shot in GF2 says it all. Perhaps that is how the final shot in GF3 should be interpreted. It almost is as if the last shot of Michael from GF2 could have dissolved into the last shot from GF3 and we would not have to have GF3 at all!<br/><br/>We all have choices on how to live our lives. Michael could have easily changed but instead chose to involve himself in an underhanded business deal with the Church. It makes his claim of seeking redemption and protecting his family seem insincere when contrasted with his desire to profit via the tainted Imobilare deal.<br/><br/>The scene where the bosses are killed in Atlanta is ridiculous and illogical. Don Altobelo's poisoning seemed comical and far fetched as do the Arch Bishops and Leichesi's murders. ""I need to whisper in your ear."" LOL!!! Many scenes seem stiff and forced. The plot involving the Church complicates viewing and seems a contrived attempt to incorporate real events. It seems cliché to bring in stereotypes of big business/religion and equate them to organized crime and murder. We are left seeing Michael die alone in Sicily yet he had finally opened a connection to Kay and had taken steps to remove their daughter from the former family business. It seems they should have been able to find some common ground and comfort. The ending implies otherwise. Perhaps some things are too unforgivable to ever escape. Here I am referring especially to Fredo's murder in GF2. Mary's death was indirect and is one more nail in his coffin. Nothing in this film really adds anything of substance to the first two.<br/><br/>It almost seems fitting that Coppalas daughter plays Mary. Mafia type nepotism and destruction to the ones you love. Just kidding!"

Right from the start of III i couldn't believe how bad this film was - the acting, almost comedic at times, the settings, the clothes - the film is supposed to be 1979, yet it looks 1990 to me when the film is made.

Pacino should have been at least nominated by the Academy. I don't care how many people bash Sofie's performance, but I liked her. Also just to see Connie Corelone played beautifully by Talia Shire turn into the scheming sister really made my day.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the score were just amazing.

"Steffi_P","5","3","6","3 May 2011"," ""Beyond redemption""
","Any series of movies, no matter how excellent it's beginnings, can easily descend into mediocre sequel hell. This is even the case when many of the original cast and crew members remain the same. The first Godfather movie was an exemplary classic, the second a little weaker but still largely deserving of the honours it received. Their director Francis Ford Coppola became a respected and influential man about Hollywood, although he was never quite able to recapture that success. It was almost inevitable that, after a series of disappointing features in the 1980s, he would begin flogging dead horses' heads again.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's 80s career had been somewhat paltry as well. Not that he lost his touch - there just simply hadn't been the right roles available to him. And sadly a return to the character he portrayed in two of his finest performances isn't the much-needed booster one might expect. Aged up somewhat, he piles on the weary, decrepit mannerisms just a little too thickly. It basically looks as if Michael Corleone has got a bit of a bad back, and sounds like he has a cough. Fortunately his younger co-stars are a little more up to the game. Andy Garcia plays a hot-headed mafia scion with a degree of subtlety not normally seen in such parts. Sofia Coppola, the directors daughter, received a lot of bad press for her performance (including a Razzie), but she is really not that bad.<br/><br/>And her father is still showing all his usual prowess as a director. Those early scenes after the award ceremony show Coppola's superb handling of mood and rhythm. His camera typically hangs back from the action – a passive observer. There are few movements or close-ups and the editing all soft cuts from one similar shot to another. Even business within the frame is fairly restrained, carefully orchestrated bits of movement, no character too animated. Eventually it becomes apparent that the whole thing is set to the languid pace of the aging Pacino. Compare this to scenes where Andy Garcia is in control, in which the action is far more jumpy, the dialogue snapped out and the players closer to the camera. The rhythmic control is carried through in the neat sequencing of events to the music of Cavalleria Rusticana and the final revenge sequence, which is almost as good as the one in The Godfather, even if it is no longer original.<br/><br/>And a lack of originality is really what brings this movie down. Coppola's motivation for re-opening the Godfather series - supposedly he felt Michael Corleone hadn't suffered enough - is itself rather a dubious reason to make a motion picture. The Godfather Part III doesn't really make much sense if you aren't familiar with the previous instalments, and is filled with blunt references to the original that don't really add much except nod to fans of the series. This even carries as far as the shot compositions and staging. For example Pacino's meeting with the corrupt cardinal is an obvious redoing of The Godfather's famous opening. It seems Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo were so intent on working in this sort of business, they forgot to put in the intriguing plot and strong characterisation that made the originals what they are. And by sacrificing his real-life daughter in the role of Mary Corleone it even looks as if Coppola is trying to make some dreary statement about his ""art"". Coppola's formal style may be modest and tasteful, but his symbolic point-making isn't."
"lylewins","5","3","6","11 January 2011"," Feels largely like a made-for-TV sequel
","This film is without any of the magic of the first two installments in the series. Where the first two Godfather films are absolutely brilliant in their understatement, this film is exaggeratedly bold, over the top, and often just plain ridiculous. <br/><br/>My reasoning:<br/><br/>1. The film exhibits far too much reliance on melodrama. <br/><br/>Clear examples include much of Pacino's representation of regret, the entire episode where Kay and Michael travel together through Sicily, Vincent and Mary's whole relationship, Michael's diabetic attack and hospitalization, etc. The first films are dramatic, but they were never melodramatic. Even the most over the top emotional scene of the first films (Kay confronting Michael with her intention to leave him) never feels as cheesy or unnecessary as all of the romance does in this film. The texture and tone of the first films was created in their subtle communication of a deep love for family, an ubiquitous and totally seamless presentation of a world that revolves around respect, and both Michael and Vito's hidden mastery in every moment, and extreme astuteness for observation, reason and judgement. All of this is lost here, and traded in for bad, often very forced-feeling, dramatics.<br/><br/>2. There is a lack of the same brilliant cinematography. <br/><br/>The entire palette here is too brightly coloured, there are no equivalent remarkable or truly memorable compositions of frame, and overall the look of the film (not the sets, or the costumes, but the film itself) feels quite low (like it was shot for TV or something). <br/><br/>3. There are very uneven performances.<br/><br/>Examples include parts of Andy Garcia's and Pacino's, almost all of Sophia Coppola's, Talia Shire's, etc. The first two films, on the other, portray some of the most memorable ensemble casting of any film ever made.<br/><br/>4. Several scenes feel weak and altogether unnecessary. <br/><br/>Take as an example any of the melodrama mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>5. Many aspects of the plot are exceptionally far-fetched.<br/><br/>I could have used a little more exposition on how these gangsters got their hands on a military issue helicopter, not to mention how in the hell they managed to fly it around US airspace unimpeded. The whole centralization of the plot around a Papal-Vatican Bank conspiracy is a little much too. As political as the previous Godfather's were, they nonetheless felt grounded in realism. This story- line ends up feeling less historical, and more just crack pot (which I would consider to be true even if this telling of the premature death of John Paul 1 turned out to be more historically accurate than the official version.)<br/><br/>6. The score is redundant and far less powerful.<br/><br/>Thinking of it now, all I can remember of the score is the repetition of the same themes from the previous two movies. (And to none of the same powerful effect.)<br/><br/>In summation:<br/><br/>This movie does have some good qualities, though I haven't bothered to list them. Mainly that's because all of the top reviews I've read seem to try way too hard to justify how this isn't a terrible film.<br/><br/>Everything that made the original installments in the series so remarkable is left out here. Mostly this is due to the inclusion of far too much melo-drama, and generally what feels to me like fairly uninspired film making."
"zofos","3","3","6","30 August 2008"," An Offer You CAN Refuse
","While this movie is called ""Part III,"" it's really not on a par with the first two movies which are awesome cinematic achievements and among the best movies ever made. ""The Godfather Part III"" is a major disappointment. It was really only made because writer/director/producer Francis Ford Coppola went bankrupt in the 1980s and so, he cashed in the chip of the Godfather sequel that he'd been holding onto since 1974. The result is this movie.<br/><br/>The main problem is that it's a movie with nothing to say. If you look at the ""Making Of"" documentary on the DVD, you see Coppola struggling to figure out what the movie is about and he never really does. He just wanted the money from it to get himself out of financial difficulties, it would never have been made otherwise and some think it never should have been.<br/><br/>In ""The Godfather Part III,"" we're expected to believe that Michael Corleone, a vicious Mafia boss who has broken every law there is and had dozens of people executed, is suddenly wracked with guilt about what he's done. We know from real-life gangsters that that just isn't so. Real gangsters have no conscience to begin with and they certainly don't develop one by murdering over and over again. They will kill anyone to stay in power until the end and will sell out anyone to avoid prison. Not only is Michael's sudden turn to goodness not believable, it's just not very interesting either. We're not watching a Godfather movie to see righteousness, we want to see the ruthless dark side of power. Michael should have gone out like Hitler in his bunker, the problem is that Pacino had already done that ending in ""Scarface."" <br/><br/>Andy Garcia is the best thing about this film, he's excellent in it as Sonny Corleone's (James Caan's) illegitimate son and he rightly got an Oscar nomination for his part. He brings the passion and commitment that the other performances lack here, especially Sofia Coppola's (Coppola's daughter). She was a last-minute replacement for Winona Ryder, but even if Ryder had been in this, it wouldn't have made much difference. The script is the problem. (Coppola wanted six months to write the script with Mario Puzo, the studio gave him six weeks and it shows. Ironically, Andy Garcia was suggested to Coppola by Paramount and he immediately agreed, a far cry from the first film where everything great about it was a result of Coppola fighting the studio tooth and nail every step of the way, even down to the casting of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino)<br/><br/>It's well shot by Gordon Willis, but it does fall back on a formula that had been established in the first two movies (party at the start, finish off enemies at end).<br/><br/>Pacino is given way too much dialogue to say. It's all sentimental, mumbling meanderings. Where are the silences and shark-like stare that Michael used with such menacing effect in the first movies? His thunderous silences spoke volumes, far more than the lumps of text he speaks here. He's an old, sick man in this one and it was a mistake to do that as, again, that's just not very interesting compared to the brutal, paranoid demagogue he had become in ""The Godfather Part II."" Pacino wasn't that old in 1989/90 when this was being made, Coppola could have set it when Michael was still healthy and it would have been better.<br/><br/>You might enjoy this if you haven't seen Parts I and II, but it was a major disappointment for me when I saw it in the cinema and it still is. There has been a revisionist attempt to say it's not a bad movie, but it's flaws far outweigh the good things in it. This is one for completists only."

","In the saga of ""The Godfather"" it became unimaginable to believe Coppola could top his two previous achievements. Part I and Part II shine because of their terrific performances, but the films as a whole needed some serious editing, and there were problems with the pacing. Most of those aspects were fixed in the third installment, and the performances continued to be pretty flawless, with the exception of Sofia Coppola, a last minute replacement for the I wonder what she could have done with the role Winona Ryder. Coppola is not bad, but she can't match the sterling work by Paccino, Hamilton, Keaton, a magnificent supporting cast, and especially the dark turn by Talia Shire, who takes a role that would have made Lady Macbeth a serious attack of paranoia.<br/><br/>This film is a visual stunner, and it brings together the best of the previous two movies, as musical themes are revived, key plot points are revisited in order to explore the dynamics of the present time drama. The audience knows Michael Corleone will never be able to achieve respectability because of his previous dealings. It is impossible to him to repair the familial bonds as Kate (Keaton) returns in a dashing performance to advocate for the future of her son against the will of her ex-husband. She still hesitates and fears him, but she is willing to confront him. To add an explosive touch to the mix, enter Andy Garcia, the soon to be heir to the Corleone empire, and whose ties to the family are already problematic to begin with.<br/><br/>""III"" shines in more ways than one, with its traditional first act, presenting the players, the series of turning points in the middle that set up the grandiose last act, where dialog is kept to a minimum and events keep unfolding to the tragic end, a scene that will break more than a few hearts in the audience, as Michael, an ruthless icon of power discovers that his world has been shattered in a way he will be unable to manipulate.<br/><br/>""Godfather III"" is just the right way to end a great story."

But it seems like a lot of my favorites get slammed on here.<br/><br/>I love ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part 2,"" but part 3 is really something to behold...<br/><br/>As many times as I've watched this film, I can't get over the fact that Michael Corleone has disappeared. In fact, he morphed into a mix between himself and Lt. Colonel Frank Slade from ""Scent of a Woman."" I kept waiting for him to stand up and say 'HOO-AHH!'... Yes, I think Pacino overacted this one.

They should have let the story of the Corleone family end with the second installment of this series. The Godfather part one and two, had a great a intrigue about them. The stories unfolded like crisp linen. There was a great mastery at work with these two films. Each character played an integral part in the progression of the stories. The Godfather part three lacks in this great story telling. The omission of key characters; namely Robert Duvall, hinders the story. Without Duvall there really is nothing to tie Michael Corleone to the past and the Corleone legacy. He was the family's conscience. The film seemed to have been made in a rush, to appease studio heads, perhaps. In the end all it did was cripple the allure and legacy of The Godfather."

","While I loved the first, thought the second was equally as good, though a bit redundant and unnecessary(apart from Vito's back-story, and possibly the further development of Kay and Michael's relationship), this one just didn't reach the high level of the first two. It obviously tries, but I don't really think there was that much left to tell of the Corleone family. The cast members who were in the previous two films(that don't appear in this one) are sorely missed; the first had Marlon Brando himself, the second had Robert De Niro... what does this one have going for it, really? Only a few new characters, none of them particularly memorable, and only a few of them well-acted. I'll say it right now; I do not consider Sofia Coppola an actress. I've heard she did a great job directing Lost in Translation(which I haven't seen yet, but will see as soon as possible), but she can't act. Luckily, there aren't that many scenes that require her to, but still, the ones that do require her to put some emotion into it she totally screws up with her lack of acting capability. The few actors who reprise their old roles give as great performances as they did in the first two, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Richard Bright; all great. I liked the addition of Andy Garcia, he did a great job as well. So did Bridget Fonda, but she didn't have very much screen time to prove her talent. The script is decent enough, I just found myself questioning it a little too much; it seemed like they were running out of ideas for starting mob wars, and just figured they'd put a lot of characters in the film, have them interact, and finally kill them off. I'm not saying it's downright bad, the script(or the film, for that matter), I'm just saying it's not at all as good as the scripts of the first two parts. The plot is decent, but it halted too much, especially the last half hour; I had almost entirely lost interest by then, and the climax was just slightly anti-climactic, at best. The actual end was good, but the entire climax sequence was far too long and confusing to be genuinely exciting or thrilling. The acting was mostly good, with the four leads being great(Pacino, Keaton, Shire and Garcia). The characters were reasonably well-written. All in all, the film is worth watching, I guess, but only for those who want closure to the Godfather story. I recommend it pretty much only to the biggest fans of Godfather, as it can be easily ignored with no big loss. Also, you could watch it and just consider it a stand-alone film, with no relation to the far superior first two parts. 8/10"

","Most of what you can say about the previous instalments in the trilogy, apply here. It's generally well acted - with one exception - and looks nice. This time there's the theme of striving for redemption, as Michael Corleone looks to atone with others, and - most importantly - with himself, for the crimes he has committed in the past. All well and grand then - we're having a more character-focused movie here. There's one extremely low bit to this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned it too - the dreaded performance of Sofia Coppola, as Michael's daughter. And yes, it is that bad. Her scenes, especially put against her peers, are liking having a drill boring into your brain - they're flat, with poor delivery, and no emotional resonance. However I can overlook it and focus on the movie, which should otherwise please fans of the series (which I am not particularly). The story does have a fairly fitting sense of resolution, and believable with what has gone before. It's a fine enough piece of film making but again fails to fully engage me. So therefore a 6/10."

I really like how Pacino's voice is sounding heaps more like Marlon Brando did in Part I. He most likely did that on purpose, but I can't be sure, because his voice is naturally like that. Andy Garcia was the perfect choice for Sonny's illegitimate son, because he acts exactly like Sonny did - self confident, acting without thinking of the repercussions, and taking everything personally. I particularly like the scene that flashes back to when Michael decided to enlist in the marines.<br/><br/>I gave this 8/10, taking off 2 because Sophia Coppolla can't act.

Of course he didn't care if they were lacking talent, he only wanted to make it a Coppola family business.<br/><br/>His sister Talia was bad in the first movie, but she got better in the next films. In Part III his daughter Sophia was the worst actress ever. How did he do this to her and to the movie! Just to make himself feel better, by knowing that he does the story of his family.<br/><br/>I have no respect for Coppola's work in the 90's (his Dracula was the worst Dracula interpretation ever) and Part III is no gem either. It's got the new over-the-top Al Pacino though, that makes the movie's ending shine, so I give him that.<br/><br/>Robert Duvall made a smart move and refused to play in the last film, but Coppola had the nerve to put the blame on him for the disaster of the movie.<br/><br/>'The Godfather, Part III' isn't a lot worse than the first 2 movies, instead of what others seem to believe.

","What's the problem? The imagery is excellent, and the continuity flows well with the previous two in the series. I think it would have been better if both the church characters and assassins would have been better developed or more integral to the overall workings. The musical score could have been stronger, which I think greatly influenced the previous two. Still overall, a very moving story and solid ending to the trilogy."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","3","7","15 April 2011"," Yes, it does feel more like a coda to a big orchestra rather than a third act to one of the grandest stories ever told, but ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a whole
","What definitely personifies best the separation of the first two films in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" trilogy and the third and final entry is the Hollywood Greed Syndrome, which was spawned in 1977 following the release of ""Star Wars."" The first two movies were made before this event, in which Hollywood allowed ambitious directors to go after making the next big American movie. But ""The Godfather: Part III"" was released post-""Star Wars,"" from which the movie industry has yet to escape, in which the sole concern is making the next big American hit. Nevertheless, even though it is a lackluster companion piece to its predecessors, ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a crime drama. Its dicey and uneven, but it does work.<br/><br/>Quite some time has passed since the end of the second movie. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, still great) is now an old man, his family's empire has lost a lot of power, many of his old friends have gone, and a lot of his own family has distanced themselves from him. As he attempts to mend fences in his personal life, Michael also tries to control his temperamental nephew (Andy Garcia) and prevent another mafia war from erupting.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of ""The Godfather: Part III,"" I think its general function as a nostalgia trip. It almost seems as if Coppola realized that he wasn't going to be able to make a third masterpiece and the best way to preserve as much of the original power is to remind us of the first two movies, but in a way that isn't shoddy or consumed by (too many) flashbacks. It is fascinating to see how the remaining principal characters have changed since the last two movies. How Michael has become worn down by his age and personal life. How his sister Connie (Talia Shire, very good in this movie) is still attempting to maintain a good relationship with the brother she once hated. We see some of the supporting faces, such as Al Neri (Richard Bright) and it becomes very fascinating, even though it is really more of like a history lesson than a character study.<br/><br/>There are also some good story elements, too. For example, the relationship between Michael and his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton). First of all, seeing how they've changed physically and psychically is fascinating and uncovering the fact that they still love each other is a powerful element. Most interesting however is the doomed relationship between Andy Garcia as the aspiring new don and Sofia Coppola as Michael's spunky, independent daughter. Director Coppola and his two young performers take a relationship that is, without giving too much away, sort of taboo or unnerving, and makes it quite moving in its own unique way. They are interesting. Much more interesting than the villains.<br/><br/>That is the core flaw of this movie, I think. There are no interesting antagonists. Nobody here is quite menacing or developed enough to really leave an impact. Great as Eli Wallach is in the movie (and let's admit, he was destined to be in one of the Godfather movies sooner or later) he frankly doesn't have much material to work with. Joe Mantegna, who overacts his part, is also dull. It does sound paradoxical for a movie that clocks around three hours in length to seem rushed. But it does. There is even a moment where Coppola's craft breaks in a scene where Michael suffers a stroke and we get a horrendous jump cut that stands out quite painfully, like a sore thumb. And a massacre scene in the middle of the story only reminds us how much better the climaxes of the first two movies were. Whereas those seemed brutal and terrifying, this one really seems staged with an overuse of cartoonishly-lit blood and rapid cuts between camera angles.<br/><br/>And then there comes the problem with the ending. The emotional climax of the movie works quite well. Without giving it away, I'll just say it reminded me of a great scene from an Alfred Hitchcock movie from 1956 in terms of dramatic tension and suspense. At this point, I was almost willing to forgive the movie for all of its flaws. It was going to be a great ending to a magnificent saga. Then came those two final, unforgivably awful shots and a poor decision to finalize the story with a cut to black as opposed to a slow, dramatic fade.<br/><br/>Yes, it does feel more like a coda to a big musical orchestra rather than a third act to one of the grandest stories ever told, but ""The Godfather: Part III"" does work as a whole. There are some great dynamics here, even if they aren't fully realized, and the movie does, again work primarily as a nostalgia trip. No, lightning did not strike a third time. This time it just brushed it and some sparks made contact. Well, those sparks were strong enough. ""The Godfather: Part III"" takes a while to get started, but it did leave me satisfied, if a little empty."
"downtown_pony","10","3","7","11 May 2009"," totally underrated
","To be honest the only reason i watched the final part was because i bought the DVD box-set,if i were to buy the individuals i would have stopped after part 2, as I've heard the hype and apparently its generally accepted that the first 2 are brilliant and this basically ties up loose ends. In truth it does that, but in a memorable way, Al Pacino is astonishing, it is truly tragic how the character just disintegrates from this youthful prodigy into this withered and battered old man, whose soul is in constant torment. I do feel that this is the best of the three, but that doesn't disregard the other two, they were influential, but i do feel that is a shame that this isn't spoken about in the same way. I have never really been a fan of gangster films, i feel there samely and overrated, but i do respect the quality of the first two, but this final part i feel is truly remarkable, and every time you watch it it gets better. The psychology of the characters is so well played and the ending, is similar to the first two with its killing montage but it plays on your emotion so much more, and it may sound a little ""girly"", but I've always felt that is the point of cinema, to play on ones emotions and i feel this film does it perfectly, so in short, and this may to many be controversial, but i feel this film is head and shoulders above the first two and to not be in the top 250 is a shame."
"custserv-3","2","3","7","18 May 2008"," Feels very detached from the first 2
","Upon me recently buying the DVD box set of the Godfather Trilogy I enjoyed the first two very much so, but seeing Godfather Part 3 made me feel very disappointed. I have not read the book, but the third installment felt very detached from the first two. Like an add-on to a story that was already somewhat complete, where you made your own mind up on what happens. My issues with this movie are; it feels dated. Compared with the other two, which are set in the 40's and 50's this one is supposed to be set on the turn of the decade, but for some reason it feels like present day, in fact it feels like it was shot at some awful party in the 1993. The Acting; Diane Keaton's characters in G1 and G2 are very weak, which suits someone who cannot act, in G3 she is supposed to be 'strong' against Michael but Keaton cannot pull this off, it also looks like she has been dressed by Celine Dion and had her done by Barbra Streisand in a Star is Born. Garcia looks like he stepped off the set of Greece and acts like Julio Iglesias would in a movie, like god's gift to woman, but for no reason, and also where the hell did he come from? Despite a lot of complaints about Sofia, I don't think her acting is her fault, she is given terrible material. D'Ambrosio who plays Anthony is a joke, when he was saying he wants to be a musician not a lawyer I cringed at the way he acted. Pacino is fine, he usually is, but like in Oceans 13 give him some good material and you will get your actor! And I am not going to talk about Cage. I didn't have too many problems with the story, despite it feeling like a Citizen Kane rip-off, the acting and dated feel of the film detracted too much for me to take it seriously. It is a shame when sequels don't work; it detracts from the first good ones. You watch and you ask WHY?"
"j-f-coleman","8","3","7","12 April 2008"," Andy Garcia & Al Pacino are great
","A pity this film was so bashed this was the role of a lifetime for Andy Garcia, and he should have been critically acclaimed. He has all the best lines, he is electric whenever he is on the screen, like a young Al Pacino, he plays the role of a very dangerous man and he gets his head around the violence so well. He is not just committing violence on screen for no reason it seems to me as if he understands the reasons that his character is committing the violent acts. As good as Pesci in GoodFellas, he should have been in it even more I cant remember how long he is on screen for but regardless it is his best role in my opinion. <br/><br/>Another brilliant role for Al Pacino playing a character he must know inside out one of his more subtle roles. A man who is losing his grip, a lot less yelling than a lot of his roles. But it stands up at least in terms of Pacinos performance to the two previous godfathers. <br/><br/>One of the most underrated movies of all time with some outstanding performances. I can see though why it wouldn't have been well received at the time considering the other excellent gangster movies that were released around that time (Good Fellas, Casino although I cant remember the exact years now). It was an old school style of film, a lot different from what was being released at the time."
"ibsmiester","7","3","7","4 August 2006"," A disgrace to the series
","Is this is the worst movie ever? No, far from it. Is it unwatchable? No. But is it a worthy conclusion to the series? NO. I have been going through an watching all of the Godfather films, and this one just does not match the level of the other two. One could argue that it would be near impossible as those two are undoubtedly some of the best films ever made, period. BUT, in that case, it would have been better if this film was never made. Coppola made a drastic mistake in doing this.<br/><br/>There are some pros about this film. Al Pacino gives a mighty performance, arguably his best post-Scarface. Scratchy voice and all, he portrays and aging Michael Corleone with depth, sensitivity and emotion. When he calls out about how he ""murdered my father's son"" it is heartbreaking. Also, the final shot of this film is one of the most beautiful ever made. It's like a photograph that shows the aged Michael, the man once of so much power, weak, and finally, dead. It is the perfect ending for the series, capping off the movies as large tragedy they are, in the purist, classical sense. We see a great man go from being noble and brave, to being evil and blinded by ambition, then trying to regain his nobility and innocence, but ultimately succumbing to evil.<br/><br/>Here are the problems. Francis Ford Coppola, quite frankly, lost his touch after Apocalypse Now. Gone are all the stunning, moving crane shots, the stark, emotional canvases, and what we are left with is a bunch of cut up close ups, straight outta the late-80's/early-90's. Each shot is framed around a bunch people, and provides no feeling of grandeur, tragedy or affection that I always found in the first two. Then there's the acting, besides Pacino, everyone seems to overdo it. Especially Andy Garcia, an actor who I respect, who seems to be a caricature of James Caan's character from the first film. Diane Keaton (the only one I wasn't fond of in the first two) is as cold as ever, and even Talia Shire seems to be out of place. The venerable Eli Wallach tries, but he doesn't with the mood of the movie for me. Joe Mantegna is in typical Fat Tony form, over the top stereotypical mobster; he's an insult to mob movies. I won't say anything regarding Sofia Coppola, because I think enough has already been said apart from the fact that her scenes with Garcia make me cringe. Speaking of which, the whole 'kissing cousins' thing has to be one of the worst plot ideas I've ever heard. It tarnishes the entire film, which should have focused on the struggles of Michael trying to legitimize his family while retaining the honor of his father. Not this pathetic incestuous relationship and the whole Vatican thing.<br/><br/>This movie is worth 7/10, it is watchable, and it has its good points, but overall, it is very, very disappointing. I may be nitpicking here, but this is the Godfather we're talking about here. As Goethe said, ""In art the best is good enough."""
"Persia 27","10","3","7","17 September 2004"," The Best Film in the Series
","""The Godfather, Part III"" is clearly the best film in the trilogy, as well as a great and beautiful film on its own. It is brilliant both as a crime drama and a love story. It surpasses the first two films in both acting and directing, with a more interesting and touching story that finally endears Michael Corleone to the audience as a human being haunted by the sins of the past.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is haunting, indeed, as he delivers the best and most Oscar worthy performance of his career since ""Scarface."" This performance is far greater than anything accomplished by Brando and DeNiro, who both acted well, but failed to reach the audience emotionally. Pacino's portrayal of Michael as a regretful old man conveys so much more depth compared to the young wooden killer that no one could relate to in the first two films. Here, we literally feel his pain and guilt, as well as his desire to reconnect with those whom he loved and lost. (Possible Spoilers Follow).<br/><br/>In the opening, we see a reflective young Michael sitting at the old family residence, as Coppola left him at the end of the second film. We also hear an excerpt of Michael's voice, as an older man, explaining that he did what he felt necessary to protect his family. ""What could I do? ... And now I'm losing you. I've lost you anyway. You're gone ... and it was all for nothing. You must understand that I had a completely different destiny planned."" When Michael finally delivers these lines to Kay in Sicily so many years later, near the end of the film, we are brought to tears. The scene where Michael makes confession to the Cardinal in the garden is equally powerful and filmed beautifully. The audience comes to love this character in a special way, despite his evil doings in the past and this film had to be made to paint a complete picture of him.<br/><br/>Dianne Keaton, as an older Kay, has more chemistry with Pacino than in the previous films. Robert Duvale is missed, but his absence does not subtract from the story centered around Michael and his children. The side plot involving the Pope is historically significant and interesting in this context, probably explaining why some die hard Catholic fans were not very pleased when the film was released in those days.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia also delivers his career best performance as Vincent and exudes more charisma than Sonny (James Caan)and all the other prominent male characters in the trilogy. Vincent is so unique, as he embodies the most interesting traits of his relatives, including Sonny's temper and playboy appeal, Fredo's warmth and charm, and the calculating intelligence of both Vito and Michael. It is intriguing the way in which Vincent ascends from a hot tempered hood to a wise, calculating man after Michael intructs him to keep his mouth shut and his eyes open. A different epic film could be based on this character alone, with the handsome Garcia playing the role he was born to play.<br/><br/>With a genuine Italian look, Sophia Coppola graces the screen as Michael's daughter, Mary, and the romantic relationship between her and Garcia is moving. Casting a mega-star as Mary would have ruined this film and it is a shame that Sophia, who came across naturally, decided not to take on other acting roles.<br/><br/>Finally, the climax at the opera house in the last half hour stands out as the most suspenseful and brilliantly filmed sequence ever made. This film is literally beautiful from the first frame to the last and deserves the highest praise it was denied when first released, under the shadow of the other two films so many years prior. However, a modern classic in its own right that makes films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" look like cheap, ridiculous B pictures, ""The Godfather, Part III"" provides fulfilling closure to the trilogy while it leaves you wanting more. Its lone broadcast on AMC is vindication that its place has been reevaluated over time and that the first two films were made to precede this amazing final entry, in which Al Pacino and Francis Coppola are at their absolute best."
"susurrus-1","Null","3","7","8 September 2004"," Why Part III is the best episode
","Part III is the best episode of the Godfather trilogy in that it comes full circle and brings Michael Corleone to where his modus operandi has been leading him (Hell). Like Faust, Macbeth, and other great tragedies, it's about the price one pays for the life he has led. Al Pacino endows his character with Shakespearean awareness. The sinner is haunted but can no longer turn the tables. When he meets the Cardinal, and the Cardinal asks for his confession - what a crossroads between God and man. LOOKING FOR RICHARD III and THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE come to mind. I thought Sophia Coppola played what her character represented - the last shred of innocence and beauty to which her father clings."

However, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to finally watch it today. After sitting in my chair for 4 hours, I can conclude that this is one of the best movies I have seen. The score is taken almost note-for-note from the previous two films, but it fits the story perfectly. <br/><br/>I can see why some had criticized Sofia Coppola's acting, but that is completely overshadowed by the performances of the rest of the cast, especially that of Andy Garcia. I really have to admit that this is probably the best film in this trilogy. I regret the fact that I had not seen this film until today; I really missed out on what should be regarded as a classic."

In my view an unnecessary third chapter to what was a brilliant one-two punch, but never-the-less an interesting take on the familia Corleone with a faded Michael (Pacino {""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""} a decidedly Shakespearean turn on his iconic role) facing retribution, redemption and ultimately tragedy the likes the Greeks have never seen as he wheels and deals by trying to by salvation with The Vatican (!) Garcia (Best Supporting Actor nominee) breathes life into the series as the bastard son of Sonny Corleone, Vincent Mancini whose bloodthirst for family acceptance is the film's shining star. However there are indeed vital flaws, including perpetual sun-tan/skin cancer candidate Hamilton filling in for consigliere Tom Hayden(!) {incidently Robert Duvall wanted more dough; can't blame him} and what the hell is Novello, aka Father Guido Sarducci (!) doing in this film!! But two words best sums up the harsh reality : Sofia Coppola!!! Arguably the worst acting ever in recent history. {The sad fact is Winona Ryder was originally tapped but had to begrudgingly drop out when she passed out during a rehearsal from exhaustion and ordered by her doctor to rest} Best sequence: the homage to the first chapter's baptism of fire with similar results during the opera/Vatican killings at the film's climax (ok I admit I was glad Sofia gets killed off) and without a doubt the worst final scene in any film; Pacino old and alone doing a Benny Hill-ish death!

","Coppola is very gifted. That said, place some blame where it belongs and that's Paramount. Puzo took over 3 years to research and write The Godfather; then several months with Coppola to write the screenplay, ..it shows. In Godfather PART II, Coppola had only 3 months, but had obviously wanted to make some statements with the 1st movie, so some of those ideas had been simmering for 2 years (plus Puzo already had the background story written of Vito's rise to power) and that high quality shows too. Now Part III! Coppola and Puzo wanted 6 months to write, and release at the end of 1991. Paramount allowed only 6 WEEKS, and demanded a release for the 1990 year-end holiday season. So...the writing team had to take a ""if it ain't broke don't change it"" attitude, and THAT shows too.<br/><br/>One can only speculate (humorously) how that 1st script reading went when they gathered all the principles together: (SPOILERS from all 3 movies)<br/><br/>COPPOLA: ""Welcome everybody to our first reading of The Godfather Part III. (Applause) Now during this run-thru, I'd like everyone to stay in character, so I'll be referring to everyone by their character names. Ready???  This is how Part III will be fresh and different.  First off, this movie is going to begin...With a Celebration!""   MICHAEL: ""But I thought that's how we started 1 & 2? "" COPPOLA: ""That's right!

MICHAEL: ""So what's different?""  COPPOLA: ""Well this time we're going back to the warmth, cause last time it was cold.""  MICHAEL: ""Oh!""  COPPOLA: ""Then we're going to do a family portrait with everyone posing. And just before the photographer clicks...""  KAY: ""I know! I know! Michael's going to say 'Wait a minute', walk over to where I'm standing, grab me and walk me back so I can be in the photo too.""  COPPOLA: ""No-ooo... I said this was going to be different!

COPPOLA:  ""Because the orange is a symbol of evil and we need to show it to the audience."" VINCENT: ""So what do I do with it?""   COPPOLA: ""I don't know! Sniff it!""

Now Michael, I've been watching you rehearse your last scene. You're falling out of the chair okay, but you're not dropping the orange right.""

MICHAEL:  ""Who is he going to sing to this time?""<br/><br/>For me, the end of the story will always be the last scene in Godfather PART II that shows Michael contemplating the consequences of his actions. That haunting image says more in 10 seconds than anything that followed in Part III.<br/><br/>Conclusion: They tried! Vatican sequences was intriging. But you can't take a pint to fill a gallon container. The Godfather and The Godfather PART II will always be a milestone in movie history and Part III will never take that away.

Maybe I expected the worst reading people's reviews, but she did alright. She just had too much air time and lines. I felt pt.3 dumbed down everything down for the audience, like repeating so many times that Fredo was killed by Michael and how Enzo was the family baker. I liked the first two because they didn't have to talk so much; they left the viewer to fill in the gaps and make inferences. The thing about these movies is they always leave you wanting more. After pt.1 I was having Vito Corleone withdrawals. The second movie, I was longing for Sonny, Fredo and pre-Don Michael. This movie makes me long for the days before it existed.

","The Godfather Part III is a wonderful,underrated and overlooked finale to The Godfather Trilogy that is filled with great direction,terrific acting and a fine score. While it's not as good as the first two films,The Godfather Part III is a nice conclusion to The Godfather Saga.<br/><br/>Set twenty years after the events in Part II,The Godfather Part III depicts Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is now older and has finally made the Corleone Family legitimate and on the straight and narrow. But,unfortunately for Michael his past and thoughts of guilt have come back to haunt him and his enemies have lured but into the criminal world while worrying about his family including his nephew Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia)and daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola).<br/><br/>Released in 1990,The Godfather Part III is a sequel that despite being nominated for 7 Academy Awards and being a modest Box Office success sharply divided Godfather fans and movie critics. Some fans and movie critics felt the movie should not have been made and is a bad film compared to the first two films and disliked the casting of Sofia Coppola. Despite the film's flaws it's a really good film in my opinion and is a powerful conclusion to this great trilogy. I don't think Director Francis Coppola was trying to top the first two I think he just wanted to make a satisfying conclusion and he does so here. Francis Coppola has said that the first two films is the series and part III is the epilogue and that is very true with this film because what makes The Godfather Part III so effective is that we have seen what happen to some of the characters in the first two films and we see some of their fates which adds to the tragedy and sadness of this film because we see most of the characters haunted by their past demons and there is a sense of doom that hangs over the film and you will feel like there will be no happy outcome and Francis Coppola shows this to viewers in stylish way. The themes of violence,betrayal and death were in the first two films and it's also in Part III as well and with the Corleone family trying to distance themselves from the Gangster world but what GF III tells us is that while a person can get out of the Gangster world it never leaves any person no matter what they do. When we see the character Michael Corleone in Part III we see a man who has aged and that being the don and leader of the Corleone family has not only taken a mental toll on Michael but a physical toll as well. Where it was kind of tough to have sympathy for Michael in Part II,in this film we finally start to feel terrible for Michael because he is disturbed by his evil deeds and what he has done and realize he never wanted to be a the head of The Corleone family or be a gangster he felt like he had no choice. Throughout GF III we see Michael trying to reclaim his tortured soul that was pretty damaged after the events in Part II and it's not a sinner trying to become a saint but a man trying to bring some goodness into his life. The Godfather films are in their own way morality tales about people and the things that they do and the unfortunate consequences of people's Actions. The Godfather films are known for their violent scenes and Part III doesn't hold anything back giving viewers a few scenes that are shocking and horrific. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is good and memorable even though the script lacks the greatness of the first two films. The ending of The Godfather Part III is amazing and is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking endings in film history and no matter how many times I see the ending it still gets to me. A powerful and fitting end to The Godfather Trilogy.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone,with Pacino bringing emotion,power and depth to role. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Kay Adams,Michael's former wife. Talia Shire is terrific as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent Mancini,Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and Michael's nephew. Eli Wallach is amazing as Don Atobello,an old-time Gangster. Joe Mantegna is great and clever as Joey Zasa,a smooth talking Gangster. Sophia Coppola does an O.K job as Mary Corleone and is not as bad as everyone says. Richard bright is sensational as Al Neri,Michael's old bodyguard. Bridget Fonda(Grace Hamilton),George Hamilton(B.J Harrison)Donal Donnelly(Archbishop Gilday)and Franc D'Ambrosio(Anthony Vito Corleone) give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction Francis Coppola is fantastic and stylish,with Coppola a beautiful and amazing visual style to the film. Great direction,Coppola.<br/><br/>The score by Carmine Coppola is wonderful,epic and matches the tone of the film. Outstanding score,Carmine.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,the first two Godfather films,Gangster Films or Crime Dramas,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part III,a wonderful,underrated sequel that deserves a second chance. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10."

","Francis Ford Coppola returns as director to complete his crime saga of the Corleones. Film begins many years after Part II, where an aging Michael is determined to legitimize the family business, to finally remove it from the violent setting that has dogged them for so long, but unfortunately his dealings with the Vatican, and challenges from a rival Mafia family once again pull him back into that world, and his attempts to make amends for his past, and find a worthy successor, do not go according to plan.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, & Talia Shire return, joined by Andy Garcia(very good as Sonny's son) Eli Wallach, and Joe Mantegna. Not a masterpiece like the first two, this does feel overly-stylized and confusing, but nonetheless is still superbly acted, with an interesting story, and fine direction, all leading to a memorable end."

","It really didn't hold up. However, Al Pacino was very good as the aging Michael and I was glad to see Diane Keaton's role as Kay expanded a bit. Their scenes together were very touching. I am confused by all the negative comments about Sofia Coppola's role as Mary. I thought she did very well.<br/><br/>The movie was choppy in some parts and I was very dissatisfied with the ending. SPOILER AHEAD: After the massacre at the opera and after Michale's tormented screams...it then cut to an aged Michael before he dies. What happened between the death of Mary and his death of old age? What did Kay do? Anthony? Vincent? Connie? I guess I will never know the answers.<br/><br/>Talia Shire sure changed from the submissive Italian wife in Part I to a murderess in Part III.<br/><br/>Whoda thunk?"
"Alfriend","Null","2","4","12 March 2009"," Could Have Been as Good as the First Two Parts of the Trilogy
","The idea of basing Godfather III around the conspiracy of the assassination of a Pope was a powerful choice and one that would have brought the trilogy to an even more amazing close had all things worked out. This is especially exciting when given the long held real-life suspicions about the death of the ""30-day Pope"".<br/><br/>I'm assuming that the original storyline with Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) was more potent and up to the standards of the prior Godfather films. Apparently Coppola himself was not very happy with the last minute changes he had to make when Paramount refused Duvall's salary demands. The storyline as is moved quite slowly in parts. This was especially so with the scenes involving Michael's re-courting of Kay. Both Pacino and Keaton are amazing actors; but they suffered with rather trite dialogue and a difficult circumstance to make believable. It seemed like filler dialogue to me. The same scenes rewritten more believably might have worked with these two fine actors; but they came off like bad soap opera scenes. Also the scenes with Vincent (Andy Garcia)and Mary (Sofia Coppola)this was also in part due to writing but also because of Sofia's lack of experience as an actress. Being the daughter of the director, she was raked over the coals for her performance. This was a bit unfair as the final choice rested with her father, not her. I can't believe that there were not a large number of very good actresses out there known and unknown that could have pulled the part off. Sofia as we know is not without talent. She has become quite an amazing filmmaker herself. Bridget Fonda, who's part was pretty much gratuitous, would have made a fine Mary.<br/><br/>The other problem with the film are the lack of layers of excellent supporting players. Instead of the likes of actors of the caliber of Duvall, Sterling Hayden, Richard Castellano, Joe Spinell and Richard Conte in supporting roles, we have the likes of George Hamilton and Don Novello who are talented actors. who although were capable in their roles were not up to the gold standard of the previous films.<br/><br/>I think had more time been spent on the central plot of Michael Corleone's desire to finally go straight through the recognition and partnership with the church and the resulting conspiracies this would have made for a better film even with the existing cast and script changes. However such are the ways of Studio filmaking where deadlines ended up putting too much pressure on Coppola to come up with last minute changes that would have perhaps preserved the greatness of the film."
"jzappa","8","2","4","2 October 2008"," Coppola Must Run on Frantic Drama, Frustration, Violence and Seemingly Nothing Else In His Life To Make a Great Film
","The third chapter in this everlasting series of films is certainly the saddest of the trilogy, because as well as being an impression of characterizations and events from mob history, such as mob-related conspiracy behind the death of Pope John Paul I and Joey Zasa (played entertainingly by Joe Mantegna) being a creatively ironic amalgam of two real-life gangsters who hated each other, it is also a study of Michael Corleone, now a middle-aged man who did not foresee such regret and remorse for his ruthless conquests in the previous films. In his attempts to use the wealth and power he has gained from those bloody triumphs, he tries to cleanse his family name, under the quietly desperate delusion that it is not an exercise in futility. For if it were not, there would be no opposition for his extensive criminal history to the landmark international real estate deal he works to seal. Nor would his old New York partners want in on the deal, an affair that tips the first domino in a succession of violence, betrayal, and scandal amongst the highest of statuses (stati?).<br/><br/>Though there was great reluctance from Coppola to make a third installment, which was greenlit for the sake of understandably anticipated box office returns, it becomes an important part of the story of the Corleone family, even if it does not measure up to its two immortal predecessors. We see the modern effects of the conservation of the preceding generations. Michael suffers for his father's legacy, and Michael's stubbornness to preserve his own, though it has grown weather-beaten by the time during which the film takes place, has created a barrier of communication between himself and his wife and children, a classic senior having planned a much different future than he's received. Even Talia Shire's character, Connie, Michael's sister, is a completely different person in this movie than she was in the last. It is not a poor characterization but a very realistic one, as a woman from that generation who has resigned herself to the life into which she was born. There is no mention from her of Michael's order of her husband's death, for instance. She is not the meek, vulnerable soul she was before but astonishingly transformed into a highly competent adviser to her brother.<br/><br/>However, even despite Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana being a cherry on top of the most beautiful musical theme in the history of film, the movie is inarguably the weakest of the three Godfather films. There is hardly a way of defending the idea that it surpasses or even equals its predecessors, which in the case of both had such a distinctly powerful touch not only at the helm but in the case of all departments. Here, the dialogue is weak with typical final-chapter-in-American-trilogy visibly scripted wisdom. I also have a hard time understanding why Andy Garcia, a Cuban, was cast as an Italian when so many hot-blooded young Italian actors could have played that role just as well as he did. Those are flaws some can accept and others have a difficult time accepting, and one cannot complain directly about Garcia's performance. (Besides, his father Sonny was played by James Caan and his grandfather by Marlon Brando, neither of whom are Italian.) The inextricable misnomer is one of the most well-known in contemporary cinema history, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary, Michael's daughter. I will not plunge into criticism because I know the poor girl suffered quite enough at the time, what with the Razzie awards, countless notices, and other such humiliating things. I am glad she was able to redeem herself by becoming a director like her father, a completely different style all her own, not plainly influenced by Francis, an unaffected subtlety as opposed to his inherent need to outdo himself, which brings me to another thought on this film's weakness.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III, now that I've rewatched it as a grown person and refreshed my memory and understanding of it, has supplied me with a theory as to the striking inconsistency in Coppola's filmography. In the 1970s, he made the first two Godfathers and Apocalypse Now, showered with giant personal, political, and artistic obstacles that in some cases almost literally destroyed him. The Conversation was made entirely from scratch. These films are his great works. After Apocalypse Now, the quality of his films took a major nosedive and even now, as he has recently returned to the director's chair with Youth Without Youth, he cannot seem to regain his aim. Godfather III is very telling. In comparison to the danger, conflicts and drama throughout the first two productions, Part III was a walk in the park. He had to fight for those films and that passion is what made them so incredible. Part III was handed to him, and because it was the other way around entirely, he had a hard time committing to the project, thus the film is clearly made with much less ardor and feeling, though the set design and atmosphere are still not one ounce short of top-notch. Coppola must run on frantic drama, frustration, violence and seemingly nothing else to make a great film. However, considering the relatively peaceful circumstances of Part III's production, he succeeded to a good extent."
"najobskalf","10","2","4","30 December 2005"," An excellent film - Sofia Coppola played her part well.
","I have seen this film several times since its release, in the cinema and on DVD. I have also read numerous adverse comments from some film critics and cannot believe that they saw the same film. It was actually a worthy follow-up to the first two Godfather films and is still worth viewing after all these years: Al Pacino playing his part magnificently. Some critics poured out volumes of abuse about Sofia Coppola at the time and this has been repeated by others until it seems to be accepted generally - sadly, many critics are unoriginal and trot out others' clichés. I find myself totally unable to agree - she played her part well, in my estimation, and her character was believable - certainly did not merit the denigration she received from some. (I have even seen comments (on this site) disparaging her looks - I can only conjecture about the writers' gender preferences and/or stage of development.)

","This movie is somewhat an enigma to me. Theoretically, Copolla had the tools to make this a great film but instead, he messed up big time. The plot has potential, but the screenplay is not well constructed. It just keeps treading water without really giving the viewer a sense of narrative development. The directing isn't anywhere as good as it was in the first two films. The cast, aside from Al Pacino is not the way it should be. If they had a chance to bring in somebody like Robert Duval to play Tom Hagen why didn't they do it? Normally I wouldn't care, but if you can't make a proper third installment for a series as powerful and as cinematically significant as the godfather, it's better not to make it at all. The only reason I gave it a 5 and not less is because I still like seeing Al Pacino, but that's about it."

","No wonder this film is not in the top 250 of IMDb. It seems to do what most other trilogies do and never live up to the expectations of it's predecessors. Unlike the previous two films there are only two well known actors/actresses in Al Pacino and Talia Shire. Why could Francis Ford Coppola not pull other top notch personnel in as he did with Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall? Also the plot seems a mirror image to the first instalment. No spoilers here, see for yourself. It drags you along with no real conviction and nowhere to go apart from the predictable ending. No way to make millions of fans wait 16 years for a somewhat let down experience. To be honest, it would be difficult for anyone to reach the level of the first two films but it seems that Coppola instilled his own image in the form of Michael Corleone: a failing great.

","If you're a fan of Al Pacino's work as an actor, or fond of the first two installments of ""The Godfather"", this movie is worth seeing on either basis. Unfortunately for both the series and the actor this is not a GREAT movie. It suffers more by comparison to it's preceding chapters, but even as a stand alone film it would still be weak.  It seems ironic that this is the movie that Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola supposedly collaborated on the most closely; but being over 10+ years removed from the success of Part II ultimately has as much or more to do with why this film suffers.  A great cast is assembled, a great director is at work, and a great writer collaborated on it - and yet instead of being hot the film can only best be called tepid.  The one driving force that keeps it interesting is Pacino's dilemma as Michael - can he save his soul and his family at the same time? It serves as a rather poignant contrast to his role in ""The Devil's Advocate"" so if you've only seen one I recommend renting the other."

","With two absolute masterpieces behind, it was difficult to get a good result with a third and final part in the 'The Godfather' trilogy. Certainly this third installment does not go as expected, but it is still a remarkable film.
Through the almost three hours of footage we see how Michael Corleone tries to clear his family's name and deal with the ghosts of his past.
It's frustrating how much wasted potential this film has, which could have been the best in the trilogy or at least lived up to it. Seeing an elderly Michael carrying his sins is the best thing about the film and what was able to raise the film to the level of its predecessors. That is why the last act of the film is the best, because it falls squarely on this topic.
Although we must not neglect family relationships, which were an important part in the previous parts and here continues with a totally remarkable development.
Perhaps the legacy of this last part is the death of Michael Corleone, not physically, but totally and as Coppola shows it on screen in such a human and direct way. Perhaps the best this last part could deliver."

This movie is not in the ''elite'' category of its predecessors, however it deserves acknowledgment and appreciation. Centred on Michael Corleone, the film explores the cost his lifestyle has inflicted upon his own existence. We see that he has been weakened by the pressure and barbarism of being the ''Don'' of the Corleone family. This is shown throughout the film, as he comes to the heartbreaking and miserable conclusion that he has damaged everyone he was meant to care for. He is unable to escape the cold darkness of crime, and it eventually engulfs him in a fascinating, beautiful and emotional way. What truly is this films' saving grace, and what changes it from a good film to a great one, is the epic finale, in which Michael witnesses the death of his daughter, and reflects upon his life of misery. The ending is perhaps one of the most powerful in the history of cinema, as Michael, an old and decrepit man, due to the emotional agony he has been exposed to over his life, slowly and sadly passes away with not one loved one near him to witness his death. <br/><br/>Perhaps what let this movie down, and what lowers it below the standards of it's flawless predecessors is that the other characters displayed are either victims of poor acting (Mary Corleone), or under development. Certain scenes are victims of mediocre script writing, which is a disappointment for the higher standard displayed in the previous installments of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Despite these weaknesses, the Godfather Part 3 is a satisfying conclusion with areas of absolute perfection, but blatant weaknesses which remove it from it's flawless predecessors. <br/><br/>8.3/10"
"SnoopyStyle","7","0","0","27 December 2013"," Ghost of great movies past
","This starts with a recap of the previous two movies. It's an opening montage indicative of this movie. It's a shadow living off the ghosts of past greatness.<br/><br/>It's 1979, the new characters include Mary (Sofia Coppola) daughter of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone. Michael is trying to go legit, but the Corleone family crime partner Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) is disrespecting Michael. All out fighting breaks out between Vincent and Joey. ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in."" It is the only quote worth quoting.<br/><br/>The third generation doesn't have it. Only Andy Garcia has any acting prowess. He has the cockiness of a street punk. Sofia Coppola is just a symbol of the lack of depth in the cast. It's shocking since I would expect that all of Hollywood would be jumping through hoops to get a bit part or some background work in this iconic franchise. Francis Ford Coppola doesn't have anything left in this franchise. Even Pacino looks dried up. Instead of muscle and threats, Michael does business deals. It doesn't have the same power and menace."

","The first Godfather was absolutely world class. The second Godfather
wasn't as good but still very entertaining but like after every
successful film, the director gets the idea of a sequel and it all goes
horribly wrong. This is a classic example of this. First of all, the
movie is slow and boring, the plot is just pointless and don't get me
started on the violence. There was barely any of it, hardly like the
original masterpiece that dominated the box office and still is the
best-selling UK movie! This movie is rubbish and I regret seeing it, I
knew the reviews were bad but they said that about the Godfather 2 and
it was amazing so I saw it and it was terrible. I really thought the
director would have known it. Thank God the director took in the
criticism and did not make a sequel which he was planning to do. So
that's it, before you watch it DON'T WATCH IT"

","Well, I've read a lot of comments reacting to the initial bad reviews, but having watched the film on DVD last night I think I need to turn the tide back again. Right up until the end, the whole film plays out like some awful made-for-TV sequel, or even worse the pilot film for a new TV series ""based on the characters in The Godfather"". If you look closely you can even tell where the commercials will be! The acting is either wooden (not just Sofia Coppola, who had the unenviable task of filling in for Winona Ryder at the last minute, but even the marvelous Diane Keaton, who makes her single set-piece speech about how she is so frightened of Michael that it clouds her still-surviving love for him, then repeats it about ten times during the film) or alternatively entirely over the top (Andy Garcia), the same point is bludgeoned into the viewer over and over again (the ""legitimate"" business world is even more ruthless and dishonest than the Mob), and some of the plot lines are simply ludicrous (Andy Garcia, who has grown up in the city, can ride a police horse like a champion, and by the single act of killing a rival mobster and penetrating a rival gang has somehow metamorphosed from a street punk into a successor worthy of inheriting the mantle of Don Corleone).<br/><br/>And yet...and yet...the entire film is almost redeemed by the last five minutes or so and by a single actor. Al Pacino's silent scream on the steps of the opera house, and even more the final single minute of footage of him as a tired old man struggling to put his glasses on as he reminisces over his past life, then crumpling into death as he strokes one of the dogs who are probably his last compassionate companions on Earth : the film suddenly fast-forwards from the utterly ridiculous to the superbly sublime, triggering a groundswell of emotions. Pacino's performance at the end almost, just almost, saves the rest of the film."

","This third part of the trilogy just felt lazy, poorly slapped together and not believable.<br/><br/>The Michael Corleone we got to know in part 1 and 2 is not the same in part 3. Here you just get Al Pacino's lazy acting (just being himself) just shouting and raising his voice where it's not appropriate.
It just feels he went into this movie without any heart and soul and care for the character just to make a quick buck.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast too doesn't belong either. The girl who plays his daughter simply can't act (I know she got the part just because she is the daughter of the director. What a shame).<br/><br/>We also get some pretty silly action scenes that just looks stupid: Drive by on a horse? Come on.
Also the way they lured a gangster into the trap by calling him names just felt unbelievable: Nobody would have fell for that.<br/><br/>The movie is too long, too boring and have some pretty cringy moments here and there.
Compared to Godfather part 1, this one stinks."

"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","5","24 November 2010"," Disppointing, but not as bad as it made out to be
","First off, I adore the first two Godfather films. They were wonderfully made, scored, directed and acted with compelling elegiac stories. However, while I do not think it is as bad as it is made out to be, The Godfather Part III is a disappointment. I did like it in general, but in comparison to the first two it is like a distant relative.<br/><br/>Starting with the good things, it does look splendid. The cinematography is beautiful and the settings are superb. The music is also outstanding, and the direction is good. The acting is uneven, but not all of it is bad. Al Pacino does have a lot of fine moments as a more gentler Michael, while Andy Garcia is electrifying too.<br/><br/>However, I didn't like the story as much here. It lacked the elegiac feel of the first two, it has a lot of loose ends and there was a number of times I didn't know what was going on. The script isn't as thoughtful, intelligent or as sophisticated here, instead some of it is quite stilted. As much as I do love Diane Keaton I personally don't think she was necessary here, she served her purpose perfectly in the first two. Finally I have to concur about Sophia Coppola. She never convinces as the ""symbol of innocence"", and just comes across sometimes as embarrassing. Much has been said about the climax in the opera house, some loved it, others didn't. I think it was a mixed bag. I had no problem with Pacino, the way it was shot and the music but it did come across as very protracted.<br/><br/>So all in all, not awful, not great. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

It seems this film was just an attempt to capitalize on the success of the first two Godfathers. The acting is average at best, with Pacino putting in a decent performance and Sophie Coppola an atrociously terrible one. The plot is overcomplicated and at times illogical.

"emperor_bender","9","2","5","28 February 2008"," Different than the first 2 but deserves the same respect
","The Godfather Part III is, what I think; one of the most underrated movies ever made. It is definitely on my own personal ""Top 10 Most Underrated Movies"" list. My question is: why? The possible answer: It is too different than the first 2. And this is very true, as different as Part II was from the first, they were still in the same league. This movie is almost in an entirely different league. One reason could be that the first movie was made in 1972, the second in 1974, then this one waited until 1990. But I don't see why that's a problem. We have all of the basic (surviving) cast and crew: Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino starring as Michael Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie, Diane Keaton as Kay, Richard Bright as Al Neri the enforcer. We also have a number or more modern big name actors here, such as "" Andy Garcia (Vinnie Mancini), Eli Wallach (Altobello), Joe Mantegna (Joey Zasa), George Hamilton (BJ Harrison), Bridget Fonda (Grace Hamilton), Sophia Coppola (Mary Corleone, and John Savage (Father Andrew Hagen). The setting is back in New York, and also in Sicily (as in the original, we also see Don Tommasino from the first 2 here as an elderly man), and also the Vatican. The storyline here is very different than in the first 2 movies, here the Corleone family is a legitimate family with all the connections they need, and several foundations to their name. Michael is now an elderly man and therefore does not have the physical authority he had in the first 2 movies, but of course Al Neri, his senior enforcer is still with him. I liked this movie a lot. Very well written. The cast was well picked and everyone played their part well. I just hope that people will watch this movie before deciding to outcast it from the first 2. It's very different but still very good, you will like it. Maybe not as much as the first 2 but I guarantee it will be an enjoyable piece. I give this a 9/10, the only reasons it doesn't get a 10 is because of some plot holes left from the second movie that weren't carried to this one, and some things were left unanswered here. Also the ending was a little dry, but wasn't terrible. But fans will enjoy this film, I know I did."

","The Godfather Part 3 is for me the best in the trilogy. It is much more realistic and has religious issues attached. The new Pope is elected and dies...the Archbishop is murdered and Don Corleone's nephew Vinnie becomes Don when Michael suffers from a stroke.<br/><br/>This film has to have the greatest ending ever. Michael and his daughter Mary are walking down the steps of the Opera House in Sicily and are shot at. Mary is shot through the chest and dies on the scene. Michael is sobbing and crying and screaming and shouting. It then cuts to a scene of Michael Corleone many years later when he is very very old and sitting by himself in a chair outside. He put on his shades. His head drops into his chest and he falls out of the chair...he is dead. The End<br/><br/>Brilliant"
"theshadow908","6","2","5","31 May 2006"," What happened?
","After the immense success of the first two Godfather films, it was only right that there should be a third one. This entry takes place in New York during the 1970s. Michael Corleone is older now, and he's struggling to go legitimate and leave the Corleone crime empire to somebody else. Sonny Corleone's son Vincent is struggling to become the Don, but Michael doesn't trust him. As Michael tries to get out, a series of events causes him to be sucked back in. You'd think this entry would be just as good as the last two, but it's not. It's just not the same. You don't get the same feeling watching it.<br/><br/>It's a given that Al Pacino is older and Michael Corleone is older as well, but Al just doesn't play him the same. Michael Corleone had a certain style from the way he talked to the way he acted. In this movie, Al Pacino plays him differently, like a character from one of his more recent movies. All of the actors from the first film are gone except for Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, but they're not important enough for the audience to care. Sofia Coppola is in the role of Michael's daughter Mary showing some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The only new actor that deserves praise is Andy Garcia as the cocky Vincent Corleone.<br/><br/>This entry in the Godfather series has the obligatory 3 hour running length, but unlike the first two films, you'll be checking your watch to see when it ends. Even less happens in this movie than the first one. It's long and boring, and it doesn't even have the same style as the first two films. Overall, it's good to watch if you've seen the first two, and it's not terrible, but it just doesn't have the classic quality of the first two films.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"PhattyMatty42","8","2","5","26 March 2006"," Not bad at all...
","This isn't nearly as bad as people say it is. The acting is pretty good all around, though I wish we could of gotten more out of the newcomers... Andy Garcia is really the only one that makes them worthwhile while Sofia Coppola acts really stiff. I hate the whole Vatican angle, I don't see why this film needed it. Alas it does and the middle of this movie you tend to start to get bored. But Part 3 has such a good last 45 mins that the boring parts start to fade away fast.<br/><br/>Pacino's performance is everything it had to be and you really sense the loss he embodies the whole film. I did miss Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan, I do feel we could of gotten a much better movie with him in it (it would of been a great addition). But for all of the film's faults they're some great parts. Like I said the whole climax in the opera house, spilling out onto the steps, was tremendous. It was extremely well shot. Some very memorable lines: ""Just when I thought that I was out, they pull me back in."" and ending with one of the greatest scenes in film history.<br/><br/>Yes this movie isn't as good as it's predecessors, but when you boil down to it what film is?"
"Fedaykin324","10","2","5","16 June 2005"," The best of the three
","The Godfather Part III is, in my opinion, the best out of all three movies. The Godfather is my second favorite, and Part II a distant third.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely the most complex out of the three. It really details Michael's struggle for the legitimacy of the Corleone family and that he's definitely haunted by ordering the death of his brother Fredo. I think one of the reasons why his character is developed so well over the course of this movie is the fact that it's set in his older years, and he's doing a lot of reflecting on his life, especially after he suffers a diabetic stroke. He's hell-bent on jumping the gap and taking the Corleone family into legitimacy. You see that he really doesn't want to start another war, but in the end it's necessary.<br/><br/>However, Michael is not the one to actually plan everything out. That's taken care of by his nephew, Vincent Mancini (and later on Vincent Corleone). Vincent is the (illegitimate) son of Santino Corleone. In the end Vincent becomes ""Don Corleone"" and handles everything. At the beginning of the movie, Vincent was raucous, and rowdy like Sonny, but after he's appointed Don, he becomes much more like Michael: Quiet, reserved, and level-headed.<br/><br/>The outstanding storyline is topped only by the SUPERB acting of Al Pacino and the rest of the cast. Al Pacino is one of THE BEST actors of all time and definitely my favorite. He's just absolutely amazing to watch on screen. The final two scenes of this movie are probably the best scenes he's ever done."

","Imagine, if you will your oldest brother becomes Pope... your second oldest brother then cures cancer... and you, the baby, are an accountant.<br/><br/>
This is the fate of Godfather III.  It follows in the footsteps of what could be two of the greatest films of all time.  Add to that; casting, set and script problems, and you have your explanation why very few people acknowledge its existence.<br/><br/>Sophia Coppola belongs behind the camera and not in front of it, we all know that.  But you can't just write that off as a small detail.  She is supposed to be one of the driving forces in this film, and she is horrible. Imagine I & II with a young Chevy Chase trying to play Sonny ... (shivers!).  The spectacular supporting cast of mob characters is missing as well. Replaced with bland filler rolls.<br/><br/>Having just watched III, for the first time in a long time, I also find that this film, unlike the last two, lacks the charm and flavors of its supposed time period, 1979.  When you watch I & II you can't just tell the time period, you feel it.  It was a character, especially in II where we are jumping back and forth.  In III it could take place in the 70's, 80's even the 90's.  Coppola never places us in the era.  Lord knows the costumes are not circa '79.<br/><br/>Finally the script.  It has two great actors in Pacino and Garcia (who should be a huge star), but it lacks key aspects which make I & II great writing and cultural icons.  The classic one liners (`leave the gun, take the canolli's' or `I'll make him an offer he can't refuse') are gone.  All anyone remember is Pacino's pull me back in line. Also it strays too far from the gangster genre, instead getting buried in random acts of blasphemy and Catholic guilt.  It's one thing to walk in with a gun and knock off a few high placed gangsters, but the Vatican is probably a bit more strict on firearms.  And can you even really stab someone with plastic glasses.<br/><br/>Over all, Godfather III is a beautifully shot film, which provides and end to Michael's story.  And for fans of the first two, it was fun in a way to travel down memory lane.  But in the end that is what you are left with... a film trying to reminisce and rekindle the magic of the past, that winds up constantly reminding you that it is not as good, tight or original as its predecessors.  Godfather III is the bastard child, and deservedly so."
"tributarystu","7","2","5","11 January 2003"," If it only hadn't had that ""III""
","There are few movie series that were as successful as The Godfather series. Maybe, in the opinion of some, the 3 Lord of The Rings films will be better...anything can happen, and it is all a matter of opinion.<br/><br/>This here is the third and last movie in the series, I consider most successful(the series, not this film). A variety of great actors, great ideas and one great director made such a feast possible. When I hear the Godfather I can not think of only one movie...the Godfather means Francis Ford Coppola. It means Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, and most of all, it means Marlon Brando. You might well enough conclude, that I liked the first movie in the series most, as it probably is considered the best by most viewers. But this review is about the third part of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The whole movie is similarly structured as the first two. It really reminded me of the first part though, maybe a little too much. Probably, the, let's say, lack of success of this movie is also based on that. Most of the ideas that appear in the first movie, and in the second, can also be seen here. The family has it's part, business it's part and love it's part.<br/><br/>
Michael Corleone is the character we will follow through out this movie. I consider that some changes have taken place in time, and that Michael, as time passed by, desires to get rid of the life he actually never wanted, but then embraced. After his, what I consider, degeneration as a human being in the second movie, he tries to redeem himself in this one. Yet, we get to see a world that is shattered by the hatred of men, and consequently by evil. Many morals are being ignored in this world: forbidden love and terrible crimes take place. The meaning of ""family"" is actually being played with, by the two lovers who  ignore the fact that they are relatives. People can never be trusted in this world, and revenge is always bitter sweet...is it really our world? Well, not our whole world, but still part of it.<br/><br/>There are the scenes that are similar in the first and this movie: the films start with a party, ends as both the others, trusted people betray, nobody is safe, Michael(like his father) gets to the hospital and a new don appears. This don is none other, but Sonny's son, who, probably for the worst, is very alike his father...the short temper. Also he gets attached to Michael, and protects him when he is unable to protect himself, and he does have a strong will. Vincent, that is his name, falls in love though with Mary, his cousin and also Michaels daughter...Michael does not agree with this combination, and he succeeds to unbind them too, using the lust for power that Vincent feels. Sadly, few real stories have happy endings, and this one couldn't be one of these. The fact that we get to also see Michael die at the end underlines the idea that everyone has his turn...no one escapes.<br/><br/>The involvement of the church in this story is a little incredible...the fact that such things can happen at the Vatican is slightly disturbed. can people really do such terrible things? I hope not...still, what can you expect from those who have no other reason to live, but money? The Archbishop is an evil character...I considered him so from the beginning...I think the fact that he smoked was a sign. Still, I could not imagine that anyone would be so ill minded to kill the pope. Frightening story...<br/><br/>Kay and Michael rejoin through their children...partly at least, the relations between them get better. This was to be expected, as Michael's was was to be redeemed, and he was practically preparing himself for the end of his life. Some might think this is normal, that many people suddenly turn to God and start to regret, the wrong things they have done, at an old age. I'd tell them just to think of the 80 years old Altobello. He, the one who calls himself ""peace maker"" is actually the one who causes the death of a beautiful young lady...peace is rarely achieved through murders, and if it is, then I really would not trust such a ""cease-fire"".  Cardinal Lomberto is honest and good hearted...all that is good in that world of evil...well, maybe together with Anthony. But Lomberto is also going to show that goodness does not prevail in our world...honesty is not welcome in some places, and some personal interests are more important than the interest of the human race.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, more than other movies with higher marks...I stick to my idea, that if this had been a stand-alone movie it would've been more successful. Peace is hard to find on earth...and when you decide to do something you better think twice. Sometimes, you can not turn around.<br/><br/>The actors are good...yet, I really felt the missing of a Marlon Brando. I fear Al Pacion isn't enough...that might be why I considered the second Godfather part a small disappointment...but that's another story. Andy Garcia plays the role of Vincent smoothly, and he has also got the aspect I would think of for such a character. He is a useful addition, that did give this film a little more taste. I did miss though some of the great actors that appeared in the first two movies. I guess, as I said, Pacino wasn't enough for me...and Garcia could not complement for a Brando, or even for a De Niro. This movie is generally good and if there hadn't been the two things I mentioned earlier it would've been great. But in this case, an 8/10 are enough for the performance seen. Still think it's worthy for an applause."

"jedinite-9","6","2","5","17 February 2001"," A disgrace to the Godfather legacy.
","If you watched the first two movies, you will know that the story for part 3 is totally implausible and disgraceful. In the first two movies, the story revolved around the ""family"" and relationship between the father and his sons and then the brothers relationships. Why is Mary Corleone a central figure? Why is Anthony an opera singer??! In part 2, Michael never talked to Mary or acknowledged her existence. Michael comforts Anthony after the shooting incident but doesn't do anything for Mary. Mary just sort of ""appeared"" after the shooting incident in part2. Michael focused on his son in the first two movies, therefore, why does Michael pay all of his attention to Mary in part 3??!<br/><br/>The main reason this story flopped is that Anthony isn't a central character. Do you think Michael Corleone would allow his son to grow up to become an opera singer?!! The story should have been Michael introducing his son to the business and Anthony's refusal or acceptance or maybe his death. If you've seen the movie Donnie Brasco, the chemistry between Pacino and Johnny Depp was great. Why wasn't Depp cast as Anthony?<br/><br/>Another insane character development was that of Connie being involved in the family business. Connie wasn't involved in any way with the business in the first two movies. Why is she now giving orders to Michael's button men? How did Kay become so forgiving of Michael? How could she not now the ""truth"" behind Fredo's death??!<br/><br/>Lastly, Michael wasn't the same character as the end of part 2. No reason was given for his change. He was twisted and evil at the end of 2 and now he is like a kitten. The most insane moment was when Michael was hiding in the limousine and surprised Kay by being the limo driver. That was totally un-Corleone. Tom Hagen (Duvall) was greatly missed from this movie. He couldn't have saved it though. A great saga ending would have been Kay ending the Corleone curse by taking out Michael herself."
"JW-27","5","2","5","22 September 1999"," A painful disappointment
","It is impossible for me to believe that this movie was in the same hands of the director who gave us the near-flawless previous films of the GF trilogy--not that there was much of a script with which to work. Al Pacino is dry and mechanical as the exhausted Don and it is excruciatingly obvious that he is trying to mimic the exact mannerisms of his late father, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).  Fans of the first two will pick up on this immediately.  To end the saga with that foolish keeling over (hmmm, where have we seen that before?) was preposterous. The finale in the opera house was also tough to tolerate as it was clearly an (ineffective) attempt to recreate the breath-taking baptism sequence in Part I.<br/><br/>Andrew Garcia was good but a bit too flashy for his role.  The love affair he develops with Mary (Sofia Coppola) is an annoying distraction.  I have much preferred him in his subsequent roles (especially in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"").  Diane Keaton does her best as Kate Corleone, but, again, the script she had to work with left her character flat and shallow."
"glgioia","3","3","11","19 December 2001"," Vendetta!!!!
","-Hollywood editor is mysteriously whacked thereby allowing delusional self important director to run amok and release a completely bloated un-edited nightmare, that is nothing short of epic badness.<br/><br/>FF Coppola immortalized himself by making arguably 2 of the greatest films ever, Godfather and Godfather II. But like many of us, he then got old, fat and a lot less brilliant. The result was the release of this unsought and completely superfluous 3rd film, which is remarkable only as a testament to bad film-making, bad judgment and the fleeting quality of genius. Godfather 3 has indeed become nearly as famous for its badness as its 2 predecessors were for their excellence. What i will say on its behalf, is that it probably could have been salvaged and but for a horrible non-existent editing job, might have been OK. Much could be repaired by merely chopping the more idiotic dialog exchanges that infect nearly every scene. Only in some instances i think are the scenes themselves wholly idiotic enough to just be omitted completely. It would be challenging but interesting to re-edit, because the movie for all of its deserved bad press, has a lot of good stuff within and the story I have found after repeated viewings that the story is interesting. Its just weighed down utterly by too many scenes containing horrendous acting with actual laugh inducing moronic dialog, that never should have left the cutting room, if a cutting room actually existed. I think I finally see exactly what Coppola was trying to do, and the idea was a good one. Yet I also see how fine the line is between a good film maybe even a better than average film, and a joke like this one. We all know how many 'takes' go into each and every scene before one is selected for the final print. Now imagine taking all the Worst takes, and this is what you would get. Completely baffling."

","For years I heard legends about how awful this movie was, and then finally I bought all three GODFATHER movies on Blu Ray from TARGET.<br/><br/>This movie is bad, all right, but not that bad. People always knock the younger stars in the cast, Andy Garcia, Bridget Fonda, and especially Sophia Coppola, but really I thought they were all fairly attractive and sympathetic. The tragic love affair between Vincent and Mary would have been so much more powerful and moving if sexy, wisecracking modern girl Grace Hamilton hadn't just vanished without explanation half an hour into the picture! (Is that a spoiler? Trust me, you won't have to waste the next two and a half hours hoping to see Bridget again. That drove me nuts!)<br/><br/>So what kills the movie isn't the (weak) attempt to build new characters, but the horrifically ugly and stupid way the older characters are stripped of all human dignity, human emotion, and all reality. Al Pacino yells, he screams, he twitches, he drools, and instead of making Michael more human, he makes him less human every time he opens his mouth. And its just the same with the background characters. In the first two movies just a single shot of some old Sicilian's face would show you how dangerous he was and what kind of world he came from. Here even the minor dons are treated as clowns. (""My lucky coat!"" shouts an old Mustache Pete, caught in the middle of an inadvertently hilarious gangland massacre.)<br/><br/>People talk a lot about how the plot makes no sense in this movie. It doesn't. But there's a larger problem. The movie is set in 1979. A lot has happened in the world since the last Godfather ended. The Vietnam War, race riots, feminism, the total destruction of many old values and prejudices. But the Corleone family is still operating like the world has never changed. The plots about drug trafficking and corruption in the church are so unsatisfying precisely because they don't show the Corleone world being challenged or threatened by outsiders. We hear about blacks but we don't see them. We hear about Colombians but don't see them either. And Mary Corleone for all her headstrong passion seems to have no life outside the home.<br/><br/>In the first two movies, the outside world was a threat, but that threat was made credible and dramatic by the conflict with formidable outside villains -- Jack Woltz, the movie producer. Police Captain McCluskey, Hyman Roth. Fidel Castro! But this movie has a lifeless, incestuous feel -- even the villains are insiders, family members. Coppola hints at the venal corruption of the Vatican, but he settles for trivial stuff like embezzlement and fraud and never even hints at the real horrors -- and you know what I'm talking about!"
"heinigrunbaum-786-20424","4","2","6","23 April 2011"," How part III totally destroyed two masterpieces :(
","There are two outstanding scenes in Godfather II (which I think is better than the first Godfather) and they are both very melancholic. Francis Ford Coppola used to be ""THE"" master of creating melancholic scenes in many of his films! I wish he would go back to do that a few times more before he parts with us one day in the distant future. In Godfather Part II there is a FLASHBACK scene to Godfather part I. I don't know if this scene is a original ""cut out"" from Godfather part I, but even James Caan is in this one shot scene where the family is about to have dinner and James Caan starts having a fight with his little brother played by Al Pacino. The scene ends with Al Pacino sitting alone after announcing that he has joined the army during 2nd world war as the rest of the family has rushed off to greet the Godfather who OFF-SCREEN is coming home. Very melancholic scene. The second melancholic scene in Godfather II is the end shot of the film where Al Pacino, the new Godfather, is sitting alone in solitude on a bench in his garden. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT !!! I always loved that scene and it was the end scene of two fantastic masterpieces. HOWEVER, I maid the mistake of watching Godfather part III and that has totally destroyed the memory of that end shot in Godfather part II. So Mr. Coppola that was a dumb move making Godfather III - just my own personal honest opinion. Add to that Sofia Coppola who is not a great actor (a much better director if you ask me) especially in the end scene where she gets shot. It doesn't look real. She acts very badly in that scene. Another mistake by Coppola letting his own daughter act in his film. Would had been OKAY if she was a good actress!!! Over and out for the Godfather films!!!"
"macz","2","2","6","1 October 2010"," Lost the plot?
","Many people will ask why this franchise was resurrected after 16 years. The film displays none of the hallmarks of the original film such as a proper storyline, for example. Whereas the slow, unhurried pace of the character and plot development worked well in the original, here the story seems to constantly delve into unconnected cul-de-sacs, leaving an impression of unfinished business, of loose ends. The nonsense with the Pope and the obvious parallels the scriptwriters were trying to draw was a limp and ineffective contrivance. At times, one felt that Mr Pacino struggled to make the most out of some of the corniest lines I've ever hear him utter. And the overacting by both Mr Pacino and Miss Keaton in the final scene was truly awful. A great disappointment."

I think it would be very hard to make such a good movie that has all the actors and actresses that can peform the characters well and for the writers who try and come up with fantastic ideas to make a movie like this and others. I give this movie 10 out 10. I'm not right sure if i think that there should be a 4th godfather movie because i think the orignals are always the best, but some movies can do better but if the writers of the godfather movies decide to make a part 4 of the godfather, then i think they should work hard on this to come up with another fantastic lots of ideas."

"mr-moeeni10","9","1","2","16 April 2020"," WHY Coppola, WHY???
","This movie is one of the most underrated movies in IMDB I think, everything in this movie is high class, directing, acting, scenario, music and ... .
Al Pacino acting is masterpiece again in this role, music is phenomenal, Andy Garcia is like a new born star, even scenario is more fascinated than two previous Godfathers and Coppola's directing is the best again. Last episode of the movie in the theater was very well directed and breathtaking, and the whole story has a great meaning.
Any way I think there are some weaknesses about this movie that I should say (because of these its 9):
1. Although Pacino, Garcia and Keaton very well played in this movie, but other actors and actresses weren't good enough for this great movie, specially the Pope and Mary (Sofia Coppola) , I have to say Sofia Coppola ruined the character of Mary and I think if his father wasn't the director of the movie she never ever had any chance to get this job, her acting is the blind spot of the movie,
WHY Coppola, WHY???
2. Some point of the movie you understand that some characters didn't well defined and its a little hazy, I think it was better that director take more time to define some of the characters.
Totally I have to say this movie is a masterpiece and enjoyable but many people in IMDB because of comparing this one to two others rated it very bad such as 1 from 10, are you kidding me? If you don't like it as those 2 previous versions you have to rated 1? I think its very unfair."
"francobulgheoz","10","1","2","7 April 2020"," The Godfather: A Masterclass.
","This review is intended to go as a full closure to the 3 chapters that contain the story and history of The Godfather. This meaning, I asume if you went all the way to The Godfather Pt. III is because you've watched the two previous ones.<br/><br/>Anyways, how to describe a trilogy such as this one? Nevermind if it's the first, second, third or even fourth time you've watched, it always stays close in your mind for a few days. And every once in a while, a line or a scene pops-up from nowhere to my mind. That is the response to cleverly crafted cinema.<br/><br/>These are not just movies. These are lectures. The Godfather is incredibly crafted to show mainly, the essence of life above all; family.<br/><br/>It is amazing to see how many characters are explored, and in such depth, over the three movies. You feel so close or so real to their situations, you know everything and everyone around them, and that makes it possible for a clear judgement on their characters and further arcs or downfalls.<br/><br/>The Godfather can absolutely work as a lesson of how to be in this life. It teaches behaviour, when to talk, when not to. Who plays you a fool? Who is loyal? What matters. What does'nt.<br/><br/>Ultimately, wiping the cinematic exaggerations and the constant violence, these are situations and decissions that can happen and affect common lives of any common citizen, of course, within the boundaries of each ones own reality.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, not much casts follow up or pair The Godfather's. Al Pacino moved me to tears many times. Marlon Brando is so sincere and pure. Robert Duvall is amazingly beliavable and talented. Robert De Niro, the usual. Diane Keaton, John Cazale, Andy Garcia, etc... Only disappointed with two particular choices and that was both of Michael's grown-up children in TGIII.<br/><br/>Directing is explicit from FFC, leaving things very certain when they must, and dropping clues and mystery over time, only to recieve a closure in a near future. The constant swapping of contexts is so easily handled it clearly proves a tight connection between Director and Editor.<br/><br/>Anyways, I would finally like to comment on what I feel is the ultimate message of the film:<br/><br/>Lies don't go far. You can lie and feel relieved or saved for times, but lies kill you in the end. Be loyal to those who will always be loyal, family. But don't underestimate loyalty, family will always be loyal when they're expecting your loyalty back. Ultimately, no matter the money, the wipes, the tales, the legacy, that's nothing. Love and family should be the priority."

","I was a bit puzzled within the first hour of The Godfather Part III. Never mind the fact that the first hour could have been wrapped up in ten minutes tops, but they stretch it out to a full hour....the party itself is the entire first half hour, for crying out loud! I was puzzled by the behavior of, what was once, familiar characters. I get the sense that Part III was more interested in wrapping the trilogy up, but didn't know how to continue it. So let's use the story line of selling out to the banks of Vatican? And I was puzzled by the questions that had no answers. Why is Kay back with him after, well, after Part II? And tying The Pope into this story? While the entire movie is a snooze fest, I have to hand it to them, they put together one lushly detailed picture here. It's just too bad nothing else works here. The entire film is a huge disappointment, and I stand by my theory, if you wait fifteen years to crank out another installment to your film, its not going to bode well with the rest of your installments. It just doesn't work like that. That said, The Godfather Part III takes forever to take off, and when it finally does take off, certain parts of the film drag out entirely too long, It's almost as if they were deliberately trying to make an hour and a half movie stretch to as close to a three hour running time, just to match the running time of the first two films. Yes, I'm saying they didn't have jack for material here, I think it's obvious they didn't. This final film to The Godfather was promised to be satisfying, but I myself was let down.

","I enjoyed this movie the first time and every time I've watched it. There are some negatives, which I will get ride of first- Tom Hagen/Robert Duvall is missing, and George Hamilton is no Robert Duvall. Not greedy, but feeling underpaid, he chose to skip this one, and it hurts the finished product.And second- Sofia Coppola is awful.
That said- I loved Garcia as Sonny's son and the heir to the mafia throne. I liked Talia Shire's growth as a character into a true ""Corleone"". And I like how Michael Corleone's life of crime didn't end with a happy retirement. While I disagree with the cardinal's assessment (or at least, his blaming God) there are certainly consequences for actions, and Michael is certainly reaping his criminal harvest. It is dark and depressing, as his life of crime should be, and that is when he should seek redemption. But this shows that redemption isn't something you can earn, but is a gift from God. The scenery is beautiful, the interplays of the characters (minus Sofia) are well done, and though not up to the first 2 installments, very few movies are."

Yes, Sofia Coppola is not a good actress, and that aspect affects the film in comparison to its predecessors. But, come on, it still has other performances that are great (Al Pacino, Andy GarcÃ­a, Eli Wallach), great script, great cinematography, great soundtrack..... If we see it without focusing much in Sofia Coppola's performance, then we have a perfect movie, like the rest of the saga. I personally love how this movie shows us how the mafia interferes with the catholic church (and that happens in real life, I know it's hard to acknowledge but it is true), and I love how it also shows the last years of Michael Corleone.

It shows how a crime family don ages and become physically weaker, regret his past, try to bring his family back and try to be close to his children. You know everything can be achieved by power but not the love. You have to gain it. Michael Corleone is one of the victim of this. He abandoned his wife only for the power and even murdered his brother for his own safety though it was not necessary as Fredo was just like a kid and his immaturity was the reason for the hatred of Michael. We've seen he apologized in God father 2 to Michael and he was really unaware of what he did to kill Michael and it was just a complete set up where Fredo was just a victim. In god father part 3, finally aging Michael has already figured that he was wrong and did a terrible sin by killing Fredo. Not only fredo he also did so much crime in previous GoD Fathers that at the last stage of his life he is actually trying to be just a little bit better and this is the main Theme of God Father 3. One thing to mention, God father is a religious term and Michael Corleone was a god father of his sister's child. So it can be easily said that he was a religious person and every religious man atleast once in his life will try to make all his sins forgive and Michael Corleone is just the perfect character to show this in drama."

","Maybe it has some spoilers but let's agree, this is the godfather, so feel free to read without ruining your experience. I always thought Coppola made this one with a different intention from the first ones, that are as beautiful as this one by the way. If you check all the technical elements of this movie, you will see a tired, hopeless, and sad construction, all of it converging to Michael, who's already sick of the family business and can't wait to finish the illegal stuff, but it keeps coming towards him, creating an atmosphere of anger and anxiety. At the same time, softly rhyming with the first two ones, representing the part that will never come out of Michael, the Don he was and all the empire he kept from his father. A nice work Coppola does here is the relationship with religion, we see a more devoted, and supportive Don, creating a whole different mark. Altogether with the new rising member Vincent, whose actions remember a lot of his father Sonny, and Michael's relationship with Kay, that is treated in a trivial, but heavy way by Coppola. A touch that i always thought made people feel uncertain about this one, is the unattachment of everything with the first two ones, witch is the whole point of the movie, creating this feeling that is something different. For me this is certainly the best one from the trilogy, independent, all of them are great, the only thing is that this one feels for me like a redemption for all that happened in those years for Michael, brilliantly shaped, messing with all the feelings almost twenty years after the release of the last movie."

I loved how this film gave her a much bigger role. She is a fascinating character and seeing her gain more agency was brilliant to watch.

I only ever wanted to watch it after refreshing myself with the first two parts, but that's a long investment. You've seen over 6 hours worth of film before you get around to the third, usually I'm burnt out by then. However, this time I really came around on Part II. While I'm still hot and cold on Part I, mostly admiring it more than enjoying it, I found a deep and consistent appreciation of Part II that really spoke to me on a personal level. I'd finally found motivation for Part III and I don't intend to revisit it anytime soon. It's good, not great - but you can't take away the things it does right. <br/><br/>Most of the acting is stellar, the production is top notch as always and it closes arcs on poignant notes. It's at its best when it's low key. The weakest moments are when Coppola tries too hard. The violence is sudden, but unmeasured. It feels like he's just nudging you for your attention but moments like these fatally break the flow. I hate to agree with the consensus of hating Sofia Coppola, but yes, she is a dire sore thumb in need of a bandage. A surprisingly welcome addition to the saga is Andy Garcia, who's the one exception to the rule of the film's best moments being the low-key ones. It really needed Tom Hagen, his absence illustrates how this was just a film made for the money but the studio wasn't keen to spread that love.

According to him, he wanted $6 million, producer, director fee with six months work on the scriptwriting. The studio instead gave him only $1 million in fees and 6 weeks to work on the script in order to meet the Christmas 1990 release. Paramount did approve this movie with a $56 million budget under strict conditions that the final cut of the film must not be less than 140 minutes (to get more screenings per day in cinemas) and any additional expenses would not be covered by the studio.<br/><br/>Another problem that was the studio's fault was that the character of Tom Hagen had to be written out of the script because the studio refused to meet Robert Duvall's financial demands when Duvall asked for pay in line with what everyone else was getting. With Hagen gone, an essential character and counterpart for Michael Corleone was missing from the movie."
"JaydoDre","7","1","2","16 November 2014"," Underwhelming but not bad
","I can see why.<br/><br/>I can see why some people who watched the first 2 movies were severely disappointed after seeing this one.<br/><br/>Watching this third movie right after the first two felt like somebody had dug up bits and pieces of Godfather I and II at some archaeological site and then tried to create the third movie based on the style of the found artifacts. All the aging actors are now trying to remember whom they were playing in the original movies and the director is standing in the corner trying to remember how to direct and the writers got pens in their mouth and their eyes on the ceiling trying to recall how the story ended.<br/><br/>While the 2nd Godfather film had flown almost seamlessly out of the first, much about this third film is different. The tone has changed, with Al Pacino as Michael Corleone giving a much more subdued and humorous performance with those rising eyebrows that started dominating his later career. The people act contrary to their characters established by the first two movies. They try to make the gangster Michael Corleone some sort of anti-hero in this one, which is missing the point of the series.<br/><br/>But at the same time the creators expect you to have watched the first two, because right from the start references are made to characters from the first two films without much explanation.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is still good. But some of the other people are not as good. There is a certain Sofia Coppola who plays Corleone's daughter. Maybe the problem is that English was not her native language or she just had a bad year, but this lady really phones in her performance. Something goes wrong in the intonation at the end of every sentence she utters. And it doesn't help when the text she is given is not very good.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie takes a number of dips in the quality of the dialogue. I got flashbacks about Star Wars prequels while listening to some of it. It is trying to be dramatic or poetic but often comes off as fake. It's not all bad though.<br/><br/>The story centers on one of Corleone relatives played by Andy Garcia and that guy is always good, especially in gangster roles.<br/><br/>Godfather III has its good and its bad times. It is unfortunately overshadowed by the greatness of its predecessors. Therefore, the best I can suggest is to for the viewers to do the same as what the movies did: watch the first and the second movie and then wait a while. Watch the third movie a few weeks or even years later. That way the contrast will not be as startling."
"zetes","7","1","2","14 September 2014"," Not bad, but unnecessary third part of the series
","I've seen the first two parts a few times each, but never got around to the much-maligned third installment until now. Not that everyone hates it. It was well reviewed and was nominated for Best Picture. It's that one element that garners most of the hate. You know which one. And, I have to say, Ms. Coppola's performance deserves the derision. It's a rare performance - a supporting one, at that - that drags the whole film down a level. She just has no business being in front of a camera. The film after her is hardly perfect, either. Pacino has entered his hammy phase. Keaton is mostly a non-entity. Frankly, the reason to watch, acting-wise, is Andy Garcia, who was the only actor in the film who earned an Oscar nomination. He's usually a bore, but he's excellent here. Talia Shire and Eli Wallach are both pretty good, as well. The film also lacks the focus of the first two films. With all that, though, it's still pretty good. Beautifully produced, of course, and Coppola's directing talent had yet to leave him (by my account, he had one more great film in him, Dracula, before he became worthless)."
"GTeixeira","8","1","2","25 June 2014"," Weaker than the first two, but that's hardly a fault
","'The Godfather' and its first sequel, 'The Godfather: Part II', are both hailed as two of the best films ever made (with the first sometimes considered the very best). A couple decades after them, it was given a proper ending/'epilogue' with 'The Godfather: Part III'.<br/><br/>While the first two dealt with the rise of Michael Corleone, this deals with his fall. Wrecked by guilt at all his wrongdoings and his strained relationship with his ex-wife and children, he attempts to repent for his sins while also taking in his illegitimate nephew as his successor within the mafia business.<br/><br/>As one can expect, things don't go right. A tale of betrayal, murder and power hunger unfolds.<br/><br/>The movie retains much of the great cast of the first two. Al Pacino is great as ever playing Michael Corleone, now in a much more emotionally pained and fragile vision than the ruthless kingpin he was in the second. Diane Keaton and Talia Shire also return well (Keaton more so, while Shire does get annoying at times), and the entire supporting cast (where Eli Wallach in special shines) is great. Andy Garcia is also good, though he doesn't shine (which is made worse by the fact Robert Duvall didn't return).<br/><br/>The film also retains the sophisticated atmosphere of the first two. And their excellent soundtrack, excellent directing and pacing, and dialogues.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it still falls short of living up to the expectations. It ends up too continuity based; it is almost impossible to understand it well without knowledge of the first two films. A good deal of what made 'The Godfather: Part II' such a masterpiece was exactly the fact it didn't rely on the first; it could stand on its own.<br/><br/>'The Godfather: Part III' would be a mess if you take it for itself.<br/><br/>Another problem was Coppola's usual nepotistic tendencies. It is common of his to cast his relatives in his films, though usually in minor roles (he did that in the first two). This time he went overboard: rather than search for a new actress once Wynona Rider withdrew, he decided to cast his own daughter for the major role of Mary Corleone (Michael's daughter). She is an amateur, no wonder her acting career didn't pick up; she is still watchable, yes, but her scenes lose so much of intensity and believability she could have single-handedly sunk a lesser film.<br/><br/>So, despite not being the masterpiece 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II' were, 'The Godfather: Part III' is still a terrific film. It just suffers from the absurd expectations the first two generated."

","I was fortunate to have been given a copy of this film before its release so I knew the story beforehand. Like the two films that preceded it, the story is based on real events and people. In this case, the Vatican and the mysterious death of Pope John Paul I. At this point, Michael Corleone is striving for a clean life in business as a philanthropist but it seems that they pull him back in. Eli Wallach is a.competing Godfather who Connie wants to deal with personally, Michael suddenly gas a half brother with his own violent agenda who is the collegiate son of Sonny Corleone and just as hotheaded. On top of this, he has it in for Joey Zaza, played expertly by Joe Montegna. Unfortunately, Sofia Coppola is absolutely amateurish and dull as Michael's daughter. <br/><br/>The problems in this movie really.get in the way towards the end which.seems to go on forever. But, as I have mentioned, Eli Wallach (whom we just lost at 98) and Joe Mantegna make it all worth the price of admission. That, and a stunningly heartbreaking end scene are the high points of this epic.<br/><br/>Al Pacino actually gives a measured performance as well. So to those who say this film ""sucked"" your less than objective criticism is what sucks."

","THE GODFATHER: PART III may not be the best film in the world, but it does serve as a fitting conclusion to the Oscar-winning series. The story (as well as the director and actors) have now moved on 20 years, allowing the narrative a change to explore the differences that age and time have had upon them, making a story that in some aspects feels superior to the second film, which didn't really add much that we didn't know from the original.<br/><br/>Coppola's direction is assured as ever, and there are enough returning actors from the original series to make this a joy to watch. The newcomers are also pretty interesting, in particular Andy Garcia, who seems to be channelling Pacino's spirit from the first two movies. I didn't find Sofia Coppola to be distracting in the least, only that the camera is clearly in love with her, which you'd expect given that the director's her father.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most is that the film gets back to the series origins: this one's about corruption in high places, religion, betrayal and violent murder. The characters visit some dark places, which is what we the viewer wish to watch, and the extended opera set-piece works nicely along with the helicopter assault. It also doesn't feel as slow as the admittedly superior second part, which is also a point in its favour."

","Few sequels can match the charge of anticipation you feel before watching the third part of Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather series. The first two parts – released in 1972 and 1974 – won Oscars as Best Picture and rank as the twin peaks of Mob movies.<br/><br/>So when it sinks in that this nearly three-hour sequel is not up to the level of its predecessors, the disappointment runs deep. Is Part III worth your time? Of course. It's still The Godfather, and some of it is deeply affecting.<br/><br/>The positive aspects of the film is the acting (for the most part). Al Pacino gives some his greatest emotional ranges in this film, and Andy Garcia as newcomer Vincent is astounding. Everyone else is still very good, including Talia Shire and Diane Keaton and the new cast members of this movie.<br/><br/>The negative aspects are as follows: Sofia Coppola, though not as bad as everyone says, definitely needed to retake a few of her scenes because she wasn't giving her A+ material like everyone else. Also the editing in this film is not on par with the first two. It either fades into the next scene, or it fades to black. There is hardly any consistency in the editing.<br/><br/>However, I do think it's a very satisfying ending to the Godfather trilogy. It had an interesting story, a great and suspenseful climax, and Michael's story arc comes full circle in this film. Had they fixed the inconsistencies mentioned above, this could've been on par with the first two movies. But as is, it's a great movie."
"axel-koch","7","1","2","15 December 2013"," Clearly the worst film in the trilogy, but nevertheless very good!
","The last installment in the Godfather trilogy, The Godfather Part III, has some obvious flaws. Including real life events out of the time of the Vatican's crisis in the late 70's and early 80's, for one, let the whole plot seem a bit weird and didn't work all the time. Even more crucial, the casting of Sofia Coppola as Michael's grown-up daughter Mary. Although we've come to experience her directing qualities a decade later, she just didn't succeed in her role and was utterly unconvincing throughout the film. And, as in the two first films, it's also more than a tad too long, which makes for some rather dreary moments. Nevertheless, The Godfather Part III is a very good film and can very well compete with the rest of the series, despite being yet another step back from The Godfather's initial quality. Not only can the audience still enjoy fabulous cinematography, set design, and score work (all of these securing the film's respectable amount of Oscar nominations), but also some final 20 minutes that will keep The Godfather Part III in your memory. As we can relish in the insanely well-made shots of all the people that have just died under most unnatural circumstances, the crew concocts what are, in my opinion, the three best shots of all three films: Frederick Keinszig, hanging dead from a bridge, Calò stabbing Don Lucchesi with his own glasses, and Archbishop Gilday falling to his dead. It may be just a bit too little of everything to establish Part III's place on the same shelf as the first two films in the series, but it's still the great Francis Ford Coppola that directed it and made the most out of a story significantly less interesting than I had expected."

It certainly stands out on its own, Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone here, being his first time playing the character in 16 years, it is as if he never left the role. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is still on point, though the writing may not feel as passionate, he still manages to bring the world to life in s splendid manner, the only way he knows how. <br/><br/>The dialogue and overall story is far less inspired than the previous two, it never manages to make much of an impact. Having no Vito Corleone in this one was a big loss, I understand that his story came to a close in the second film, but he was the heart and soul, as well as the highlight, of these movies, there was a gaping whole without him. I was not a fan of Andy Garcia's character, merely a repeat of the same type of role Pacino had in the first Godfather, but never as effective. While its flawed and certainly not a pleasing finale to the trilogy, The Godfather: Part III is still a must watch for fans of the first two, you might as well form your own opinion of it. <br/><br/>Michael Corleone confesses his sins while trying to legitimize his business to keep his family safe as he ages. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Al Pacino / Worst Performance: Sofia Coppola"

","This film does NOT have the calm perfection of the first two parts. It doesn't flow effortlessly, and there are certain little hitches. That said, it's perfect. It validates the first two films by adding an emotional depth rarely seen. I like to look at it this way: the first film was the body of the trilogy. It set the precedent and built a cracking narrative. The second film was the brain and heart of the trilogy. It developed the intellectual intensity of the films, as well as inspiring true care for the characters on screen. The third film was the soul of the trilogy. In watching it, we understand and love the characters of the entire series. Some people would see the emotional additions as cliché, but I feel that they are intentional. Michael is an old man now, obsessed with his troubled past, trying to live his life legitimately. The three films together form the greatest trilogy in cinematic history, and to ignore this film is an utter tragedy. What rating should this have? I say at LEAST 8.5, because this is an integral part of the trilogy, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."

","Occasionally marred by certain technical imperfections (such as problematic dubbing or, at least in one instance, unacceptably bad editing) and an unfortunate casting choice, the third part of the Godfather saga is the ill masterpiece that never got the recognition it deserved. Few directors possess the Promethean touch to spark atmosphere in their master shot, the feel for historical detail, the breath for a period saga, the skill to narrate a layered plot or the demonic ability to translate the operatic passion to a crime story. Mr. Coppola is this Viscontian descendant and the Godfather is his three-part Gatopardo. Godfather III is a film of almost serene beauty, toned perfectly in its operatic fatalism, shot (surprisingly for such a fluid picture) in mainly steady shots, baptized in the blessed air of Sicily for the better half of it and forever haunted by the probably deserved but certainly emotionally devastating fall of its protagonist."

As usual, Pacino gives a great performance, Andy Garcia is a good touch to give the story a darker edge then it already has, and the directing by Cappola is stunning, beautiful images and cinematography. At times the writing seems strained, the dialogue, awkward to hear, and some of the characters stereotypical, where as the first two made them original characteristics. Now lets get to the part we have all been waiting for, Sophia Cappola. We all are not watching the film to see her, but I tell you, I would watch her a thousand times a day instead of Winona Ryder. Cappola isn't very good at acting, her directing is far better, however that works out, but she is at times watchable, maybe even humorous to see force out the lines. I'm sorry Sophie but I'm sure you've heard it all a thousand times, never the less, don't let her get in the way of seeing this picture. It's interesting, smart, and hey, it's the end, you can't close the book before reading that last chapter right? In my opinion, it's not the best of the three, but a fitting end to a great saga."

Except for the most moving scene in the film, Michael talking about his guilt over whacking Fredo with a priest–what do priests have to do with what's going on? Also stomach turning...It wasn't so much Sofia's amateurish acting but her smile. Every time seeing it why was I reminded of someone struggling keeping a big piece of snot in the nose?

But what shocked me most of all was Connie–Was she on drugs or booze or wanted have a relationship with only surviving brother Mike she didn't put two and two together about what happened to Fredo? She sure knew who was responsible for 1st hubby Carlo's getting whacked. Where was G1 and G2's character who was shrewish but smart when it came to being a woman in a mafia family. When she yapped about Fredo being drowned that started my down slide thinking this film muddled tripe. The incest subplot was icky but it and Michael remembering his first wife and guilt-ridden over Fredo half way made sense. The passing of mantle to Sonny's son was just not developed, the Zaza friction thing had one scene-one that was worth watching and like the Sonny's son story sloppily written.

If it had taken so long to make The Godfather Part II, it probably would have met with as little success. <br/><br/>I do not know if The Godfather Part III is the best of the trilogy- I think they are all three to different to compare them- but it is certainly the one that leaves me most satisfied. It is an elegant, nostalgic, operatic, Shakespearian epilogue to The Godfather. It possesses an irresistible, inexpressible, and personal charm. <br/><br/>One of the things I like best about The Godfather Part III is that it is an old man's film in every sense. It has the calm, relaxed feel of many films made by aging people- Bergman's Fanny and Alexander, Lean's A Passage to India, Renoir's Le Caporal Epingle. It is a meditation on the passage of times. Michael, Connie, and Kay have all changed but there remains a distant feel of how they were the last time we saw them. There are also these little moments that remind of us of ""the old days"" (Vincent's way of saying ""I'll take care of it"" like his grandfather Vito in the second Godfather, how Joey Zasa faintly reminds us of Don Michael in the first two film).

And a couple more of unforgivable licenses like the Terminator kind of hit-man going after Michael, or the silly lethal eyeglasses solution and the poor Anthony's lyric performance, well, they take away a lot of the oh-my-gosh so dramatic atmosphere that the whole saga had built over before this part.

There's also the convoluted and ultimately pointless Vatican subplot...Suffice it to say that there are a lot of both stupid and pointless things about this movie.<br/><br/>The only moment in the film which has any dramatic weight at all is the confession scene between Michael Corleone and Cardinal Lamberto.<br/><br/>Basically, I like to pretend that this movie doesn't exist. I've watched it once and I can guarantee I won't be watching it again."

","There has been a lot of nonsense written about this film. I think we can all agree that it doesn't compare to the original classics, which are really a complete work - from another time & place. They look down from a heady pedestal as the most perfect achievement in modern American film. So, there are lots of reasons why GF3 isn't as good as the first movies; NONE of those reasons have to do with Francis Coppola's talent. He's actually been rather dismissive of the film himself - just listen to the DVD commentary. But he made it because he needed the money. And he didn't have much luck in production, either. According to Al Pacino & Walter Murch, the original script was ""all there"". Again - it was about the death of a brother, Tom Hagen. When Duvall pulled out - it knocked the structure from underneath the piece. So he tried something different, improvising & revising on set. It didn't work. The scripts for the first two are world class. But he & Puzo had almost a year to write both of them - compared to the 6 weeks for GF3. Winona Ryder pulling out was a big blow. Choosing Sofia was stress induced folly - even then I don't think she is the main flaw. Eli Wallach's performance is quite frankly worse, wildly OTT. And by all accounts post-production was rushed & panicked. Why wasn't Walter Murch involved from the start, instead of being drafted in at the 11th hour? Coppola made some bad decisions and never quite managed to establish his rhythm or tone. But there is still so much to enjoy in this film. Brilliant sets from Dean Tavoularis, gorgeous autumnal photography & costume design from Gordon Willis & Milena Canonero. Pacino is once again magnificent - even if his characterisation seems a million miles from GF2. Also, Andy Garcia, given the confinements of the script is superb. And for all it's flaws, I have a lot of affection for this film. Francis Coppola is unable to make a film without genuine emotion - and compared to 90% of the crap we get forced fed today, GF3 is really rather good thanks. I always thought this film was the perfect metaphor for Coppola's career; flawed & brilliant in equal measure - unable to escape the shadow cast by his own initial burst of genius. A bit like Michael Corleone, really.<br/><br/>*** I've just finished watching the trilogy on the new re-mastered DVDs. Have to say the films look just incredibly beautiful. Not only the oily browns, blacks & yellows, but also the blues, greens & reds - my God - the REDS! Just glorious. Along with a brilliantly enhanced sound /score, Part 3 has benefited enormously. No kidding - the whole piece has been lifted - plays much better, with a lovely ""cathedral"" quality, I didn't appreciate before. Overall, the films look much more a like. Really, Gordon Willis should get a Noble Prize for photography. Paramount & Dreamworks - thank you - if the DVDs are this good, I can only imagine the eventual Blu-Ray release will be a miracle of image & sound. ***"

","For me this is not about the other Godfather movies. The first one was a great movie. The second one was even better but this last one was the one they should have never made. Some movies are better off not becoming a trilogy and this one for sure is one that fits the bill. It was so not needed that it is an insult to the Corleone name.<br/><br/>Why I dislike this movie so much was the way it was done. The second Godfather movie did not need to really tie into the first one at all and stood alone with its own story. This one insisted on leaching onto the second story and further explaining it like the audience that saw the second one was too stupid to figure out the plot. It had nonstop flash backs, explaining and so on over mainly the second movie that it really should not be called Godfather three rather Godfather Two and a half.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of this movie was Al Pacino. It seemed like he was the ONLY one who really showed up for this movie, which includes the directors and writing staff. I only recently saw the Godfather trilogy so I base this review on fresh eyes but the third one absolutely ruined the Godfather movies for me.<br/><br/>I only give it a 4 out of 10 because of Al Pacino. If no Al then it would be a 1 (probably -5 if it was possible)."

","Movie worth seeing if for no other reason than to close out the trilogy, the first two parts of which are among the greatest movies every made. This movie has its moments, but does not hang together real well. The highs include some of the early scenes, the Vatican scenes, and some of the scenes in Sicily, but the story is too inflated/overblown and unrealistic to fit with the other movies in the trilogy, which artfully walked a line between myth and reality. The helicopter assassination attempt treads into Bruce Willis terrain, Joe Mantegna (uncharacteristically) does not do well in this movie - his dialog is terrible at points (see the meeting of the commission), ditto Andy Garcia (blurting out ""I want Joey Zaza dead"" like someone suffering from Tourettes syndrome at various points). Talia Shire is uncharacteristically good in this movie, but her new found role in the family is jarringly out of place in the trilogy. Pacino does great with limited material. Overall worth seeing once, but if it weren't for its predecessors would stand out as one of Coppola's poorer efforts."
"rpniew","Null","1","2","4 November 2004"," The Problem
","The problem with the film is not with what is included; Michael's last attempt at salvation is certainly a worthwhile theme for the movie and a completely logical one. Personally (SPOILER) I believe he actually attains that salvation: Keeping in mind that the trilogy is immersed in Catholic imagery and doctrine, I will put my neck out and say that the death of his daughter is the penance he pays for his sins, and this is realized in the long, drawn out scream he gives at the end. It seems that even Kay realizes this as she watches him. I would also say that in the concluding scene of the film, with Michael in Sicily as an old man, there is a serene look on his face just before he dies. He has (in terms of the film) come to peace with himself and God. His daughter was the price he paid. I find this a fitting way to end the trilogy. (By the way, I don't think the choice of Sofia Coppola was a bad one. She has a waifish quality and an innocence that Winona Ryder would not have brought to the film.)<br/><br/>However, it is what goes on before that makes this film disjointed. We are to accept this as a continuation of the story, but there are too many things missing. First, and most obviously, the film suffers from Coppola's inability to snag Robert Duvall to play Tom Hagen. George Hamilton is a poor replacement, although to his credit he tries valiantly. Second, although much is made of Vinnie's claim to the family as Sonny's illegitimate son, what about Sonny's multitude of legitimate kids? His widow? What are their positions in the Corleone family? And if they have no positions in the family, at least mention it. Do not pretend that they don't exist. This leads into another problem: Why is Connie so much Vinnie's champion? What about her own kids, who again don't receive as much as a reference in the screenplay. In fact, it is Connie's own son who is the center of the baptism scene in the first film. Wouldn't the irony of her own son now being ""baptized"" as the new Don make for more interesting fodder? What happened to them? Basically, the film cuts too many ties with the first two films and suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Although it wouldn't happen, I would like to see Coppola treat this film as Pam Ewing's dream and start over."

","In ""The Godfather III"" we are once again treated to the workings of the Corleone family vis a vis Michael (Pacino). The setting is 1979, (although you wouldn't know it looking at the costumes and hairstyles) Michael, contemplating his past sins, is about to divest his interests in the illegal operations which have made him wealthy (and many enemies), by going into business with the vatican, as the owner of a church owned corporation. Its a bit of a stretch, to say the least. <br/><br/>The main problem with The Godfather III lies in the script. Written by Mario Puzo, and F. F. Coppola, it feels forced. The superb and iconic Godfather and Godfather 2 really gave us all we need to know about this perfectly evil man, Michael. At the end of GF 2 we see michael all alone, having just ordered the death of his brother Fredo. His wife is gone along with his children, his friends murdered, his family in ruins, Michael is left alone. The wages of sin as my father would say...GF 2 shows the end of this man without even getting into detail about his final years, we can safely assume that Michael led the rest of his life in solitude and dies a broken man, as the ending alludes. However, Paramount pictures, wanting to milk some more dough from this cash cow, had Coppola and Puzo resurrect the series with this wasted effort. Almost redundant in the fact that many of the scenes are rehashed from the prior godfather installments. Less than stellar acting performances from several key characters, not including the villified Sophia Coppola, who was not great, but of minor consequence. I doubt a bravura performances would have saved the script.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia was serviceable as Sonny's love child, but I didn't really care about him. Eli Wallach did not really strike me as an Italian mafioso, where Lee Strasberg really BECAME Jewish gangster Hyman Roth in GF 2. A missing Robert Duvall did not help the situation either. All told, GF3 is the weak link in this chain. Stick with GF and GF2."

But Ryder left because of illness and fatigue, and Duvall held out because he wanted as much money as Pacino( a fact that has always really bothered me, being that Coppola pretty much gave Robert Duvall a forty year career by casting him in I). I think they would have made this movie much better; think about it, no Sofia Coppola who sticks out like a soar thumb, and could have had a genuinely provocative relationship with Vincent, and no George Hamilton, fresh out of the Mark of Zorro.

","...""The Godfather: Part III"" is the last movie in one of the best (or the best) dramatic trilogies of all time.  As many already know, this one focuses solely on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his struggles for the Corleone family to become legitimate (he's been longing for so since the first film).  Many bad things happen, including a corrupt Archbishop (Donal Donelly) and hotshot enemy Joey Zasa (Joe Mentegna).  Helping Michael is Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia, in what may be his best performance) and sister Connie (Talia Shire).<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't on the same level as the first two.  There are many bad elements in the writing and some in the acting.  For one thing, Puzo and Coppola really seemed to love making references to the first two films, most of which are unnecessary.  Example: at one point Michael shows his son (Franc D'Ambrosio) the very same picture that he drew as a child in Part II. This had very little relevance to the plot, and put it this way, if this small part hadn't been included in Part II, do you think a similar scene would be written for III?  I think no.<br/><br/>The acting, well, it has it's ups and downs.  Pacino does well as always, but it's his worst performance of the trilogy.  As many say, Sophia Coppola is ""terrible"" and ""awful"".  Now, she's not by any means good, but I'd say the worst performance comes from both Mentegna (who never changes his facial expression or the tone of his voice) and D'Ambrosio.  What was with D'Ambrosio's song?  It was like ""The Godfather: The Music Video"".<br/><br/>There is some very good acting too though.  As I said, Garcia does incredibly well.  The way he acts, he sells the character perfectly.  Also, Donnelly does a creepily good job.  An underrated and very well-done performance is Eli Wallach's as the cunning Don Altobella.  The man was seventy-five when he did this film, and yet he has so much energy and life. If Strasberg and Gazzo can be nominated for Part II, Wallach sure as hell can be for this one (not to mention he's been deserving since ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"").<br/><br/>The direction is also fine.  Coppola's use of still cam and tan shading is admirable.  The ending shots are flawless.<br/><br/>So, not the greatest film of the trilogy, far from it, but still quite enjoyable, 8/10."
"emptypocketpictures","Null","1","2","1 March 2003"," So much wasted potential.
","It is worth noting that although I consider THE GODFATHER saga as the greatest film of all time (yes, I consider all three to be one film), this film made me wish at its worst moments that the whole project, from 1972 on, had been taken out of Francis Ford Coppola's hands (perhaps Martin Scorsese wouldn't have littered the trilogy with nepotist talent vacuums like Talia Shire) and that at its best make me wish he had been given the artistic freedom and time that he asked for to make the final installment. The film's many flaws begin with the script.  There are no less than five different stories within the world of the Corleones that are being told, and none of them are given the tender loving care that was so obvious in the effectiveness of the complexity of the two preceding epics.  Problems plague each individual plot enough that the glaring lack of integration is one of the least critical issues.  Had Puzo and Coppola been given the time they would have liked, I am confident their overhaul efforts likely would have been sufficient, and furthermore, Mary Corleone's character might have been tolerable played by a rested Winona Ryder rather than her wooden replacement Sofia Coppola.  While in this stage, both the studio and writers might have also considered that while the exclusion of Tom Hagen's character was a crucial mistake, the exclusion or reduction of Kay's character might not have been. While Paramount's impatience certainly rushed writing and casting decisions, the acting, from Al Pacino's tragic loss of subtlety to a performance by Eli Wallach so caricatured it bordered on the offensive, falls at the feet of Coppola and the performers themselves.  I wonder if the over-the-top rage and suffering displayed by Pacino is at all related to frustration over having to scramble to rise above material this mediocre. Production values for the most part are still solid -- Gordon Willis' cinematography is as beautiful as ever, and my only complaint is that while a superimposed title at the beginning of the film tells us it is 1979, it is next to impossible to tell from the production design.  It might have been better to use a period design, and lose the title, particularly since the Vatican events chronicled happened in 1978. Still, this film has fine moments -- the opening and closing sequences are memorable, if seemingly haphazard in comparison to the touch of the earlier films.  The sad truth, however is, that, as it was made, this film never should have been released to add a disappointing coda to in all likelihood the greatest American story ever told. A final thought on THE GODFATHER saga.  I have thought that the best format for the saga might have been a two-part sequential chronicle: 1) Vito's story, up to his abdication of power to Michael and 2) Michael's downward spiral from the top, with a lot of trimming from the second and third films involved.  No relatives allowed, cast Joe Pesci (Luca Brasi perhaps?), let Martin Scorsese direct the entire film, written by Paul Schrader, Coppola, and Puzo.  Just one fan's dream."

","I bought the box set not having seen any of the Godfather films. I must admit that I can't pick out an individual film in the series and say, that's the best ever. What I can do however is look at all three films and see that it is all three films together that makes it great. How anyone can say that 'The Godfather' for them is Brando rather than Pacino baffles me. I think some critics may be getting a little over excited when it comes to Marlon Brando. Al Pacino is so much better than Brando in this story that it can only be some kind of blind idolisation that is generating these ideas. The development of Pacino's character over the three films must be unique in cinema, and must therefore be the true greatness of 'The Godfather'. It's a shame that they waited so long before the third film was made, the time jump feels a little alienating, and it's also a great pity Robert Duvall wasn't able to be a part of it either. However, the story is Pacino's and his performance in the final film is so good that its lack of popularity is a shame. It may be that people are more interested in the gangster genre than in witnessing a moving performance of one of our finest actors."

This film just doesn't ""grab"" the viewer like the other two did. Francis Ford Coppola did a great job, as did the cast, but they couldn't make a story that is just a little bit weaker than the other Godfather stories into a great film. Thankfully, this was the last of the Godfather trilogy. Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie and Diane Keaton as Kay. Robert Duvall bailed out. Sofia Coppola (yes, his daughter!) is in this as Michael's daughter. She's a much better director than she is an actress. So the acting suffers just a little in this one also. Pacino's performance was OK but not up to his usual standards. Diane Keaton gets a deeper part in this than any of the other films. Andy Garcia joins the cast in this one and steals the show, in my opinion. As I said, standing on it's own, it would have been judged a better film. This film suffers from the company it keeps. I own it and will always own it. But I'll probably watch this one a bit less than the other two."

And that's what the whole movie is about. The other actors (Andy Garcia does a great job!) are just there to explain what Michael is worried about. Coppola's title for the movie was ""The death of Michael Corleone"" but Paramount changed the title. The original title explains what the movie is about, not about the family, it's about life, it's about things you did in your life and how you might think about them later. Michael doesn't care about the ""business"" anymore, he wants to be a good man. But in the end, there's no way out and for the first time, Michael is the victim. It's a fantastic movie.

","One of the great benefits of buying DVD is that in most cases you not only get the film itself but also loads of extras that can only add to the overall feel & premise of the movie itself.<br/><br/>I recently bought the DVD Collectors pack of The Godfather saga which not only included the three original cinema versions but also the usual extras such as picture galleries, the Corleone family tree, biographies and additional scenes that only appeared in the TV versions.<br/><br/>But the two best features of all were the Director's commentary overlaid for each film and also a separate documentary focusing on the rather difficult productions of all three Godfather films from inception in 1970 to the conclusion in 1990. <br/><br/>When I viewed the video version of GIII some years ago I was rather disappointed by the rather bloated & totally unbelievable story concerning corruption and murder within the Vatican by the Mafia.<br/><br/>Not only was a I disappointed by the story but also I felt the acting was weak compared to its two predecessors, with the film solely dependent on Al Pacino carrying the torch throughout the saga, while the supporting cast drifted in and out like passing ships in the night.<br/><br/>However, now that I have viewed the DVD version along with the behind-the-scenes documentary I can begin to appreciate some of the problems director Coppola faced during the making of GIII.<br/><br/>For years Paramount were very keen for GIII to be made, with or without Coppola behind the lens. So desperate were they that up to 15 initial drafts were put forward from different screenwriters but none ever saw the light of day. <br/><br/>But on top of this Paramount were not even bothered whether Coppola directed or not since they felt confident that nearly any competent director could carry on the Saga Coppola had so successfully conceived during the 70s with I and II. <br/><br/>There are many good directors who could have done this but when one reads that Sylvestor Stallone had been pencilled in by Paramount not only to direct but also to star, one has to consider the sanity of the studio execs at the time.<br/><br/>And even when Coppola & Puzo were roped in they had to rush the scripts through in weeks rather than in months so it is not wholly surprising the screenplay looks half-baked.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the inclusion of Coppola daughter Sofia as a last minute replacement to more accomplished actress Winona Ryder. It wouldn't have been so bad had her character been no more than a supporting role. But Sofia was asked to play Mary Corleone, daughter to Michael and heir to the entire Corleone business empire.<br/><br/>Regrettably the task was to great for someone so young and with so little major acting experience and as a consequence was one of the major faults within the film with poor Sofia panned by both critics and fans alike. It seems strange that Francis cast his daughter for such a major role at such short notice but cast her he did and I guess his decision will forever haunt him.<br/><br/>Another omission was that of Robert Duvell as Tom Hagen. GIII was in desperate need of some familiar faces from the previous movies to make the saga complete. However, with the exception of Pacino himself the only significant stars who reprised their roles were Diane Keaton & Talia Shire.<br/><br/>Both Keaton & Shire give good solid performances with the latter having a far more significant role than before. But all the same I felt Pacino was very much on his own now that Duvell had been left out due to contract disagreements. I felt the inclusion of Tom (at any cost) would have added more gravitas to the movie. Duvell's character was very prominent & stong in the previous two movies and this was emphasised all too clearly by his absence in III.<br/><br/>I liked the story; at least in part. Pacino was excellent as the elderly Don trying to shake off the ghosts & horrors of his past and his determination to go ""legit"" not only for himself but for his family (not his Mafia family on this occasion but his true family - his wife and children)<br/><br/>This part of the story was well done & very moving but was let down badly with the main storyline of corruption and murder within the Vatican by Mafia henchmen over big business dealings & power sharing. This was so unbelievable that any passion & feeling I had for Pacino's wish to be a decent man again went right out of the window by this overblown and frankly stupid premise.<br/><br/>However, putting this film in the context of what I have learnt from the documentary I have to say that Coppola shouldn't be blamed completely for this relative flop. The execs at Paramount should hang their heads in shame for trying to rush the screenplay through too quickly and not trusting Coppola's own judgement. I could understand their anxiety if they were dealing with an unknown director but to undermine Coppola with his own movie legacy is a disgrace.<br/><br/>GIII is not a bad film by any standards. If one takes a huge pinch of salt then the Vatican storyline can be tolerated. But for the Godfather purists GIII ended up as a wasted opportunity and will always be consigned as the weakest of the three films. In addition one has to feel sympathy for Sofia Coppola for no matter what she does now or in the future she will always be remembered for her rather poor performance in Godfather III.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** I loved the ending, it was so underplayed and yet so moving that for a moment I completely forgot about the utter farce that had gone on minutes before. But to see Pacino sitting in his orange grove an elderly man, crippled & blind and subsequently dying was well done and very open to suggestion. For we are not told whether he died a free man or whether the guilt of his past misdemeanours went with him. But it was very touching of Coppola to continue the ""orange fruit"" symbolism significant throughout the entire saga ***END OF SPOILER***<br/><br/>

In the pejorative sense in which the word is usually used of movies--i.e., something that was thought up later to cash in on the success of the first one--this is definitely not a sequel.<br/><br/>Godfather 3 is, instead, just what it says it is:  part three of a single, unified story.<br/><br/>I see the Godfather trilogy--stay with me now, stop rolling your eyes--as a tragedy along Greek or Elizabethan lines.  Remember how they taught you in high school about the structure of the Elizabethan 5-act tragedy?  The climax was in the third act, in the sense that in the middle the tragic hero did something that sealed his fate, and everything after that was just the relentless playing out of the consequences of that single deed.<br/><br/>Looked at in this way, Michael Corleone is the tragic hero of the Godfather movies.  And as a tragic hero he's up there with the best of them--just as archetypal in his own way as Oedipus or Hamlet.<br/><br/>Michael is the man who can't live down his heritage, the man who can't escape his upbringing, or, ultimately, himself.  Like all good tragic heroes, he has enough potential for good to make him a sympathetic figure--he wanted so badly to get out;  even in part three, decades into a life of crime, Michael can make you believe he has always wanted out.  But it's his own weaknesses, his own ambition--his own virtue, in a way--that ruins him.<br/><br/>His tragic act, the one which sealed his fate, was (SPOILER) ordering Fredo's death at the end of part two.  One might say that it came earlier, with the kiss of death he gave Fredo in Havana (""I know it was you, Fredo""), but still, up until the point that he actually ordered the execution, Michael could have turned back.  But after that point, his own fate was sealed.  He had destroyed, symbolically, the very thing that he had been fighting to protect all his life:  his family.<br/><br/>So why make part three?  Isn't this all understood at the end of part two?<br/><br/>Coppola had to make part three for the same reason the Elizabethans had to write the last two acts of their tragedies:  the cathartic, morally instructive, and dramatically satisfying part was in watching what came after the turning point.  You know, in act three, that the hero is doomed, but you have to watch his doom played out.  That's emotionally satisfying, it's morally necessary, it's artistically beautiful.<br/><br/>And that's what Godfather Part III is all about.  You know, if you paid attention to part two, that Michael is not going to live happily ever after. He can't: in the moral universe of the movie, but more importantly in the moral universe he has created for himself, he has committed an unforgivable sin, and he must pay.  But he doesn't know it yet:  being human, he can always convince himself that he'll be able to escape culpability for his actions--until, that is, his guilt is driven home to him.<br/><br/>Thus, when critics complain that Godfather 3 is anticlimactic, they're more right than they realize--it's not the climax of the trilogy.  It's the long, tragically necessary playing-out of Michael's doom.<br/><br/>We know how it will end, thematically at least:  but there's great beauty and pathos in watching Michael be utterly destroyed.  We watch his grandiose plans to save the Church!), knowing all the time that his hopes are in vain. He cannot be forgiven.  Just like the cardinal his confessor says (SPOILER): he could be forgiven, but he himself does not believe it.  This is great tragedy, folks.  It's entirely appropriate that the last third of the movie be acted out to the backdrop of an opera, because that's what this is.<br/><br/>And this is how the movie's climactic scene should be seen.<br/><br/>(SPOILER)  When Michael's daughter is killed, he suddenly loses that which is most precious to him--and he realizes, you can see it in his eyes, that it's all his fault.  This is a divine retribution upon him for killing Fredo.  He wanted to protect his family, and only ended up ensuring their destruction.  Michael's scream on the steps of the opera house is one of the great cathartic moments in movie history--moves me to tears every time I see it.  You can just see the man's whole life melt there into one sustained cry of anguish.  (A brilliant stroke of Coppola's directorial brush, the decision to make the first breath of his scream silent, only music-- it makes it that much more intense, and private.)<br/><br/>Performances:  uniformly excellent.  Pacino's style, in the intervening fifteen years, had become much more demonstrative, but it fits the character, as the steely control of the young Michael Corleone relaxes into the benign self-confidence of the older man.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton, as she did before, gives unbelievable depth to what is still a fairly minor role--somehow managing to conjure up the entire non-Sicilian world in the single character of Kaye.  Andy Garcia is fantastic as Sonny's son.  Everybody, in fact, gives perfectly nuanced performances, except, of course, poor Sophia, and hers is the most important role!<br/><br/>Perfect conclusion to the best movie ever made.  10/10"

","Godfather II and I are number I and II on my all-time movie list respectively. There are timeless, awesome, skillful films worthy of their Oscars and accolades. GIII does not make my top 25.<br/><br/>That's not to say it is a bad film. It is quite good. But take away these rich, wonderful characters and links to the previous classics and you have a long and confusing film.<br/><br/>The plot is well known - patriarch Michael Corleone's attempts to buy his way out of the criminal empire he built and ruthlessly ruled, thwarted by his enemies and his bloodthirsty, power-hungry nephew Vincent(brilliantly played by Andy Garcia), who is poised to take command of the family business. There is also the strong theme of Michael's guilt for his past offenses, most notably the murder of his brother.<br/><br/>It is a sad a grim tale, with what I thought was a very satisfying ending. Without spoiling, lets just ask this question - does a life long criminal and murderer deserve any better?<br/><br/>The movie's best scene takes place when Michael sees the wise and powerful Cardinal Lamberto and receives a reluctant absolution of his sins. I love this scene because the Cardinal understands him so well, and knows that he can be more than he is, but won't.<br/><br/>The movie has a flaw which comes very close to ruining it completely - and that is of course the infamous casting of Soffia Coppola in the pivotal role of Michael's daughter, Mary. A great deal of this plot revolves around the passionate, dangerous love of Vincent and Mary and it simply does not work. She lumbers around on the screen like an amateur and destroys every scene she has. I never bought in for a second that Vicent cared at all about her as anything more than a trick.<br/><br/>All that said, Diane Keaton, Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna all offer wonderful supporting roles. Talia Shire shines again as Connie. The script is great and the theme of the trilogy is very clear - don't take sides against the family. I value this film a great deal primarily because it does a great job of winding up the story of Michael. Do not see this first, see the three in order.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****."

","As a huge fan of the first 2 movies, I was disappointed with Francis Ford Coppola's final chapter. Events surrounding the production of the movie doomed this picture to be a letdown from the start. Director Francis Ford Coppola cast his own daughter, Sofia, to play the part of Michael Corleone's daughter since Winona Ryder had backed out due to an illness. Ms. Coppola's performance was laughable at best. You would think that Mr. Coppola would have at least paid for some acting lessons. My other problem with this movie is that Robert Duvall was missing in his role as Tom Hagen, family consigliere. Mr. Duvall wanted way too much money which was rightly deserved. I couldn't get used to seeing a sun-baked George Hamilton advise the family. It's a shame that all this overshadowed great performances by Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, and Joe Mantegna as Joey Zaza, but it did. I would've enjoyed seeing Andy Garcia reprise his role as Don Vincenzo Corleone in a fourth installment but now that screenwriter/author Mario Puzo has so dearly departed us, we may be stuck with this disappointing third and final picture as our only memory of his legacy."

Once the scene changes to Italy, the film picks up a bit, but not enough to save it entirely. Granted, the attempted assassination was intense (although stolen from the first film). The best part was the end, where Michael truly gets his."

","Though no fan of gangster movies, I find the Corleones keep pulling me back in.  The Godfather, of course, is the best free-standing movie of Coppola's series, and no sequels were necessary in Puzo's and Coppola's extremely well done near-parody, where a gangster story is raised to the levels of Shakespearean tragedy.  Once Part 2 was made, Part 3 was an eventual necessity, as a coda.  Taken together, the series raises the gangster story to Homeric proportions and makes all other mob flicks glitter like glass compared to Coppola's diamond.<br/><br/>Welcome in this movie were the Byzantine Vatican intrigues -- and the portrayal of at least one true man of faith (perhaps the last ever to appear in a mainstream movie).  Eli Wallach made a fine addition to the series. The cinematography, as always, was  gorgeous.<br/><br/> Less than welcome:  the fact that Robert Duvall turned it down (it would've been nice for him to have a respectable death scene), and the fact that, good though the film is, the typical bloodbath at the end is confusing.  The very very very end scene is cheapened the movie and the series. <br/><br/>
The major problem is focus.  There are simply too many loose strands in this yarn, and it was understandably difficult to tie the ragged ends together. Then, this movie is simply too dependent on what came before, which gives it nary a chance to stand on its own."

","This had nothing to do with his brilliant book. Most of the plot was taken right from Rupert Cornwell's ""God's Banker"", the true story of vatican banker Roberto Calvi (Frederick Keinszig in this movie), who helped sicilian mob leaders (including the sinister P-2 fraternal society) defraud the church of hundreds of millions of dollars (and was found hanging beneath Blackfriar's Bridge in London in 1982). The rest of the film was Francis Ford Copolla's hastily thrown-together distortion of Puzo's epic, one of the finest novels in history. I was so repulsed by the awful plot that I barely noticed the often cited incompetence of Sofia Copolla, Diane Keaton, and Al Pacino (as well as the incomprehensible casting of Bridget Fonda, Eli Wallach, and George Harrison). Connie, the weak, dimwitted housewife is now the Godmother???

For example, many references to Fredo's death, and Sonny, and Kay talking about the past with Michael. How many times did we even here Sonny's name in the Godfather part 2. I think Coppola knew he didn't have the same atmosphere as the previous ones so built this one around to remind the viewer of the past.<br/><br/>Why on earth did Coppola have his daughter play such a critical character. Her character grows on the audience like a thorn stinging you, she leaves you wishing that she never appears again in any of the scenes. Andy Garcia was good, and I swear I saw James Caan in Garcia's character more than once. Al Pacino was Al Pacino.

","This movie was acceptable over-all, but nowhere near the class of the first two, and somewhat tarnishes the series as a whole. The problem is mainly with casting. Obviously, Coppola casting his daughter was a huge mistake. Not only isn't she good, but she is less than amateurish. A good high-school actor could have played the part better. For that matter, I though George Hamilton was wrong for his part. I think his reputation is too light-weight for a serious movie like this. Even Joe Mantegna was too hammy for his part, and made the movie seem cartoonish. Having said that, I liked the intrigue concerning the Vatican. Mixing the evil of the Mafia with the Church creates an eerie setting. Overall, an engrossing movie that falls short."
"gdetroit","Null","1","2","30 August 1999"," Some flaws but better than most
","First off, I should probably say what I thought of Sofia.  She's not a very good actress but she fit.  Had she been a sophisticated character it wouldn't have worked.  But she wasn't and she did pretty good under the cirumstances - could you have imagined Julia Roberts (another choice)?  Be thankful for Sofia and leave her alone - she's getting enough crticism.<br/><br/>Now for the movie.  Al Pacino turns in another great performance in phase three of a familiar character and the most rounded in cinema history.  I won't dwell because at this point in his career it's assumed that he'll be good. Instead, there are two people who were a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The first is Diane Keaton.  Let's face it.  Her roles in the first two were not exactly a great step for women's lib which was bad because she was the strongest female character in those movies.  The third time around she is independent from the family and acts instead of reacting.  The best scenes in the movie are those between her and Pacino because they're both sweet and sad.  They show the Kay and Michael we saw at the beginning of the first movie plus a lifetime in between.  They are now closer than they've been since Michael's dad was shot.<br/><br/>The second surprise should be obvious.  Andy Garcia - he even LOOKS like Pacino.  His character is both charming and dangerous and that combination is the kind that audiences adore.  And he is absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>So, I liked the movie maybe even more than the other two because the relationship between Kay and Michael which I always thought was the center of the movie.  The first movie was the beginning of their deterioration, the second completely ended their marriage, and the third was a reconciliation. I have the feeling however, that I was the only one who saw the movie that way."

","The Godfather is a great movie. Truly great. I've given it 10/10, and I don't generally do that. The Godfather 2 is a very good movie. Yet The Godfather 3 goes beyond both its predecessors, and is easily the best of the three. It might well be the best movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It combines all the strengths of the past godfathers (great acting, great scenes, thrilling story, etcetera), but it adds something to it. What is new is subtlety and true tragedy. This last part has the main character really think about what he has done in his life - ethics finally catch up with him. This makes for interesting psychological and ethical questions not seen in the previous two movies. There is another storyline going through all this - the difficulty to get out of a criminal position once you are in it is demonstrated beautifully by the difficulties the Corleones have with becoming legal.<br/><br/>I won't spoilt the end of the movie by telling what happens, but this is another great point.

","I have watched all three Godfather films in a row, and this final installment leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  It's almost amazing how it fails to emulate and of the strengths of the first two films.  The biggest strength of the first two films has always, in my opinion, been the characters and their relationships with each other.  Michael and Kay's moral battle, Fredo's battered ego in relation to his family of strong individuals, Connie's innocence and awareness of her family's business, Sonny's passion and those effected by it, Tom's honor among thieves, and Vito's protection of his family.  <br/><br/>It was always intriguing to see how Michael reluctantly inherited his ""kingdom"" from his flawed but honorable father, and how he wanted so thoroughly to give Kay a life she could be proud of.  This was great stuff, a tale of a family to rival the greatest of stories.<br/><br/>Then Francis Ford Coppola moves on, forgets about his masterpieces, and so does everybody else.  Sure, we all wanted to know what happens after the somewhat ambiguous ending of the second film, so why not make a third? There's nothing wrong there.  Where Coppola, Puzo, and for that matter, Pacino, strayed was in the way they wrapped it up.<br/><br/>Despite what people will tell you, Sophia Coppola and Talia Shire are not talented actresses.  They were in this film for one reason; They're in F F Coppola's family.  Suddenly Connie has a more potent role than ever before. When once she was a smaller character poorly performed, she suddenly becomes her brother's Consigliere!  Connie almost ruins this movie.  So does Andy Garcia, despite his best efforts, his character makes no sense, and is not very intelligent.  Robert Duval is sorely missed, replaced by a lesser acter playing his priest son, who is a needless character only present in scenes where family members are gathering.  In fact, not one character makes sense or has any depth.  Even Kay and Michael have dummy dialogue and no wit.  The whole thing really stinks of too many writers trying and not succeeding to write a good follow up to two of the greatest films ever made."

The notable exception, as many have pointed out, was Sofia Coppola - she was definitely miscast for the central and crucial role of Maria. The woman just cannot act, at least in this film. A good film would have been a much better one had Winona Ryder stayed on.<br/><br/>Other shortcomings: the hit scene in Atlantic City was just not believable. More people would have fled that room than what was shown.  Also, the final scene in which Mary is killed is overly melodramatic, while it defies the law of physics.  I don't know of anyone who could take a shot in the chest from a 9mm at close range, then have enough strength to keep standing and say ""Daddy"" before collapsing (OK, maybe the guy from Halloween could).<br/><br/>Also, what happens to Connie, and Vinnie after the hit at the opera?

","I had spent a few years believing that this third film in the most famous gangster series and trilogy was one of the worst films I'd ever seen, so I had to confirm this with a second viewing, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula). Basically ageing Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) wants to settle family differences, having pretty much retired from the Mafia, putting all crime to rest and seemingly giving up the underworld for good. He is still doing business with close people, but he wants to concentrate more on spending time with his family, daughter Mary (twice Razzie winning Sofia Coppola), and a little bit of time in the Vatican. Obviously Michael still has his enemies who want to finish him for good so he cannot have any power, this includes an assassination attempt with some machine gun fire blasting through a building from a helicopter, killing many but him and Sonny's son Vincent Mancini (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Andy Garcia). At one point at the Vatican we see him finally confess his biggest sin to a holy man, that he has his own brother Fredo killed, and not long after this we see him suffer diabetic stroke putting him in hospital. Recuperated and covered Michael returns to spending time with all around him, family or not, business and non business, and he enjoys the debut of his son Anthony Vito (Franc D'Ambrosio) in the opera. Of course this is where we see the last assassination attempt, a rifle man is hiding in the box ready to fire, but he does not manage to shoot until afterwards on the stairs. Michael is hit with one of the bullets, but the one who actually dies is daughter Mary, and years later he is much older we see Michael die naturally in his chair and collapsing on the floor. Also starring Diane Keaton as Kay Adams Michelson, Rocky's Talia Shire as Connie Corleone Rizzi, Eli Wallach as Don Altobello, The Simpsons' Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa; I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! star George Hamilton as B.J. Harrison, Bridget Fonda as Grace Hamilton, Raf Vallone as Cardinal Lamberto and John Savage as Father Andrew Hagen. Pacino does get his many good scenes, and may of the supporting members, especially Garcia, do equally well too, there are some reasonably good moments, obviously standing out are the helicopter and opera scenes. The only embarrassment is indeed Coppola's daughter Sofia, who did much better as director of Lost in Translation, she replaced Winona Ryder who left to concentrate on Edward Scissorhands, I don't think it would have made any difference if she hadn't. It is obvious that all the years without a third instalment didn't do any favours as all the best ideas were used up, and it does seem like it was made purely to complete the trilogy, and not even the same feel as the two much superior predecessors, I do still think this follow up is a little dull and boring, but it's not an absolutely terrible crime drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Song for ""Promise Me You'll Remember"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for Carmine Coppola and Best Screenplay.

","There are some generous reviewers on here who claim that if not compared to the two ""Godfather"" movies that came before, this movie is not so bad. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Although the begining of the movie is promising, with Michael Corleone now a much older man with fully grown kids, the introduction of Vincent quickly brings the film downhill into a structureless plot full of nonsense conspiracies and assassinations, which unfortunately have very little connection to anything that made the first two ""Godfather"" movies great (and that's not even the main reason why it's bad).<br/><br/>As mentioned by numerous reviewers--even by those who gave this a high score--the acting is truly horrendous. But it's not just Sofia Coppola. Even though her scenes really stand as some of the most amateurish, even Al Pacino isn't good in this. Take the scene where he's repenting for all of his murders in the first two movies. There's really no indication in this scene that the real Al Pacino is thinking about anything else except his paycheck. I didn't believe for a second that this was the real Michael Corleone feeling bad for killing his brother. What's even more horrific is that I couldn't even believe that this was an actor trying to play Michael Corleone. I had no idea what was going through Pacino's head when he was doing this movie.<br/><br/>Coppola clearly needed the money, otherwise he wouldn't have agreed to make a third 'Godfather.' I think the historical context on which this was based would have made for a very interesting Vatican movie outside of the ""Godfather"" timeline. Coppola probably could have released this film with the same title, ""The Godfather: Part III,"" without Al Pacino, but then almost nobody would have went to see it.<br/><br/>The only reason this gets three stars is because we at least get a small insight into what could have happened to Michael Corleone years after the events of the second movie. Unfortunately, when he does finally tip over as an old man and dies, it's figuratively not the first time we see his death."

This just ruined the whole film for me and although everything else about the film was generally very good, this hideous performance just mars the whole thing.  I am unable to watch the film now and properly enjoy it as I am always waiting for the dreadful scene outside  the opera.

Too bad Robert Duvall declined to reprise his role as Tom Hagen but I thought George Hamilton was as good a replacement as possible. And Andy Garcia was also aces as the son of James Caan's role from the first one and deserved his eventual Oscar nom for the role. As for Sofia Coppola, well, at least her role didn't have too many scenes which meant whatever her deficiencies as an actress, her father didn't make her look too bad. I still was shocked by her final scene. And if I didn't know when the very last one is supposed to take place, I might have been puzzled by it.

"Wuchakk","7","1","3","20 September 2017"," Michael Corleone seeks redemption while a young buck takes over the shady business
","RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part III"" stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).<br/><br/>MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michael's ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michael's son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial adviser and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.<br/><br/>Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples. There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincent's abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and she's fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofia's performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life! <br/><br/>The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Life's hard enough without taking that foolish route.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesn't rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films it's almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but it's about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"
"IMDBcooper1971","7","1","3","16 April 2017"," ""When they come they come at what you love"": A Partial Defence of The Godfather Part III
","This review, while not glowing, comes somewhat to the defense of GFIII. I think it's a pretty good film that finds itself in the impossible position of living up to two legendary predecessors.<br/><br/>A few problems include the absence of Tom Hagen (Duvall wanted more money) and severe editing problems in the film's third act (it's impossible to know what's going on).<br/><br/>Another issue is Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter, Mary. While a talented director, her acting isn't great. She's received much grief already for her performance so I won't beat a dead horse; I'll just say that, for a character as important as Mary, this miscast is a terrible blow to the overall film.<br/><br/>However, I think there's lots good about the film, its main strength being Michael (played with dependable excellence by Al Pacino). Michael's chilled out a little in old age. Time's passed, making for an interesting dynamic between him and Kay. The passionate anger from GFII has faded away. They understand themselves a little better making for some sweet but melancholic exchanges:<br/><br/>Michael: I feel I'm getting wiser now.<br/><br/>Kay: The sicker you get, the wiser you get, huh?<br/><br/>Michael: When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart.<br/><br/>It's only as Michael's life deteriorates that he sees clearer, the terrible irony being by that stage it's too late to get back what's been lost. <br/><br/>The films most interesting dimension is the weird triangle between Michael and his heirs (one biological, one surrogate). His daughter, Mary, and his bastard nephew, Vincent, represent two different lives. In one, Michael is a family man, sustained by the love of his children, maybe even his wife again. The other sees Michael as a mentor, ready to pass on all the tricks he's learned over his long life, beginning the cycle of his existence anew. One is the end of the course of his life, the other is just the beginning. Like King Lear, he must choose between his children and what they represent. Unlike King Lear, he doesn't make the choice rashly. He spends most of the movie unsure of which path to take and, as the film nears its end, we realise he'd likely never have chosen, he'd try to have it all and both versions of himself would suffer.<br/><br/>A romantic relationship blossoms between Mary and Vincent, inciting Michael's disgust. Partly because Mary is his child and Vincent's cousin. But it's also due to what they both represent. One's his child, connoting family and affection, being a good person. The other represents Michael's youth: slick and violent with boundless (albeit illegitimate) opportunities ahead. They're two opposite worlds.<br/><br/>But who is Michael Corleone if not the physical embodiment of those two differing philosophies brought together? He's tried all his life to be both a family man and a gangster. However, the two don't go hand in hand and the union within Michael is an unnatural one, often coming with a price. Michael's now somewhat wiser; on some level he realises trying to be a husband/father as well as a Don is what has lost him his family. He realises he should've picked one life, keeping the two worlds separate. And yet now he's seeing it again. Vincent the mafia protégé and Mary the loving daughter. Crime and family in unholy matrimony. He despises the relationship between them for the obvious reasons, but also because he sees in it his own weakness, as well as the seeds for destruction and unhappiness. Michael is a something of a hypocrite; he keeps them from forming a relationship because he knows now it's wrong to have those two lifestyles together and yet he nurses the union within himself with his indecision to pick what sort of man he is. Michael can recognise these flaws externally in others but, unfortunately, not in himself.<br/><br/>The ending is another big strongpoint; everything comes to a head. An assassin's gun goes off. Michael checks himself for bullet wounds but somehow, remarkably, he's still standing. His fate was about to catch up with him, the natural end to the lifestyle he chose. If he had been shot as a result of his criminal dealings which stemmed from his insatiable hunger for the family business, it would have been a fitting end, a sad one, but the one he worked towards his whole life. There'd be a sense of narrative completeness, a neat little roof to be placed on top of the story that started way back with Michael's first kills. But here stands Michael Corleone, against all odds. Still alive. His fate seemingly avoided. But the audience, alongside Michael, quickly realise his fate wasn't actually avoided, just redirected. The bullet meant for Michael, the fate meant for Michael, sailed past him and instead inflicted his daughter. The sins of the father paid for in the daughter's blood.<br/><br/>When Michael lets out that horrible cry at the end, it's a lamentation for a lot more than Mary. It's a release, for the first time in his life, for all the pain. It's a wail in mourning for anything else he could have been had he had the strength and had fate not been so firmly against him. <br/><br/>Vito died in his home in the garden he tended, with his grandson present. Michael dies alone, in a relic of the old legend of the Sicily mafia. He worked so hard to sit on a throne, a seat of power, and now the final scene is him falling from that seat and onto the dirt. And, in the end, it's a very short journey. <br/><br/>The Godfather series chronicles what happens when these ""Men of Honour"" leave their native land and go out and make their fortunes in America, the land of opportunity. It's fitting that the trilogy concludes with Michael retreating to Sicily, the place where it all started, and now, where it ends."
"derekap","7","1","3","21 February 2017"," One of the best disappointments ever - only contains minor spoilers
","This movie is surprisingly flawed when compared to its predecessors. First off, there's the acting, which was once the staple of what made the series so great. Joe Mantegna gives a sub-par performance, Eli Wallach is just wrong for this movie, and Sofia Coppola is downright awful; had it not been for her performance alone I would have given it a 9/10. And when did the mafia start using helicopters for hits? But these flaws are, for the most part, saved by strong performances as usual from Al Pacino, Talia Shire, and Diane Keaton and an excellent addition of Andy Garcia as Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent. The greatest part of this movie is that it's still The Godfather, and as a result, the character depth, plot complexity, and sociopolitical analysis are all FANTASTIC. While the first movie dealt with a relatively minor war between mafia groups and the second expanded the plot to revolve around the politics of both the US Senate and the Batista regime in Cuba, the third expands the plot even further, now dealing with politics of the Catholic Church. The soul of this movie lies in its examination of Michael Corleone's final efforts to achieve redemption for his past crimes. This movie is arguably the edgiest - it includes a shockingly casual portrayal of incest to go along with all the bloody violence. Many people think that this movie wasn't necessary, that the first two movies told the full story of the Corleone Family, but I disagree. Part II still left much unresolved, and this movie is nearly as necessary of an addition to the story as the Godfather Part II was. And as one final plus, there's an unforgettable scene involving a bitten ear."

I am very impressed by Andy Garcia's performance as Vincent Mancini, the role fits him perfectly.

","Let's be honest: this movie wasn't needed. It doesn't detract from the first two movies but it wasn't something Coppola should have made. It's not a terrible movie but obviously in the shadow of the first two, it looks like a complete turd. It doesn't have any of the iconic scenes those movies did. There's really only one remotely memorable line and that's Pacino's ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"" line. The acting is mostly fine but nothing to write home about. The worst is Sofia Coppola, in a textbook case of nepotism in casting. She's terrible and doesn't ""look"" like she belongs. It's like taking somebody off the street and sticking them in a Hollywood production. Even if they are attractive, they just don't fit somehow. It's a watchable enough movie but not a great one by any stretch. Like I said, it didn't need to be made. Why was it?

","16 years after the second Godfather came out, finally the long awaited sequel arrived. And it was received well by the academy, when it comes to the nominations. It didn't win anything, but just the sheer amount of nominations are proof, that they must have done something right. And the movie is good. Al Pacino returning again and playing exceptional as he did in the other movies too. You do wonder why he never won an Oscar for the character of Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia is a welcome addition (even if he mirrors his father Sonny) and not the only thing that reminds or is supposed to be a throwback to the first Godfather. There are many hints at what Pacino does or where he goes that connect this movie to the other movies (even the second one, with the oil company mentioned by Garcias character). So if you have been following the movies, there are many treats for you to be found here.<br/><br/>It still concludes the sage that started with the first movie, for better or worse. So while people wanted another movie (and maybe still urge for that), I would tell them to watch the Sopranos. The fact that it's a TV show works for it, because it has more time to develop characters and show you stuff that is tough to put in a movie (even a long one as this here, with almost 3 hours running time). The ending might not be to everyones taste, but I think it suits the trilogy to go out like that ... Whatever that means to you"

"tonyenglish91","8","1","3","27 September 2011"," The Godfather part 3
","""this review may contain spoilers""<br/><br/>There is a bit of a story that led to the creation of this third film back in 1990.After the huge success of Godfathers 1 and 2,which both managed to win nine academy awards in total including best picture of 1972 and 1974, Coppola decided to call it a day.For 16 years Paramount pictures approached Coppola on numerous occasions with an offer to make a third chapter,but he always refused as he felt that the first two films had told the complete story of the Corleone family.It was for his delicate financial situation that compelled him to embark on a final trip with the mafioso family.So he accepted the offer.<br/><br/>the film is set in 1979 with an aging Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) now in his late 60's,wrecked with guilt for his past deeds,who is trying to legitimize the family.the movie sees Michaels involvement with the Vatican bank which has suffered a big loss of 700 million dollars.He decides to help by investing 600 million and by taking control of the Vaticans 25 percent interest in the Internazionale Immobiliare,the worlds biggest real estate company.Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia),Michaels nephew and son of the late Santino Corleone,is one of the main characters in the movie.He starts off being his uncles bodyguard,gets slowly involved with the family business and then eventually becomes the new Godfather.There is also a love affair that takes place between Vincent and Michaels daughter Mary(Sophia Coppola).<br/><br/>The film didn't do so well at the box office and was considered by many a failure and a massive disappointment.It has to be said it wasn't Coppolas fault on how this film turned out.For a start Coppola and Puzo,wanted six months to write the script,but Paramount refused by giving them only six WEEKS. Now that is not much time to write a proper story for this kind of FILM. Paramount,at every cost, wanted this movie to be released on Christmas day 1990,Coppola was forced to rush in to production without a complete script.. so that explains the immense pressure that He and Puzo had on their shoulders to bring this long-awaited film to the big screen.<br/><br/>Godfather part 3 is not a bad film but it is neither a great one, it's just a good film nothing more.One of the main issues that is quite frustrating is the excessive use of the "" black screen"" that appears quite often in the first half of the movie. The black screen is a technique used at the end of a long cinematic sequence to notify the viewer that we are moving to a new topic or ""better"" material. Here this technique brings away the power of the scene because they already don't last long and then when it starts to generate momentum the screen goes black. This is a result of what you call a rush job. <br/><br/>Secondly another main problem is the Editing!! Scenes don't flow naturally together and we often jump from one topic to another far to quickly. The viewer can never properly get engaged with the movie!!! <br/><br/>Finally the script., in the first two Godfather movies the plot primarily focused upon the businesses in which the characters were involved in and how they managed to find a way out through violence, set ups, betrayal and convincing smart dialog. But most importantly they were constructed upon the strong atmosphere and well written scenes that made the first two pictures monumental. Here in part 3 the Vatican affairs and corruption world play second fiddle to the main theme which is Michael's seek for Redemption for his past deeds.It's not really a problem but the slow pace and the not so convincing overlooked dealings of Michael with the dons drag the film down a little.<br/><br/>Though the movie is flawed it still has some strengths that are worth discussing, the music is very good and and is one of the strong points of the movie,the production design and photography are nice and can't be faulted , Michaels confession with cardinale Lamberto and the Atlantic city wipe out leave an impression, the climatic ending that leads to Michael's scream over his daughter's death a very emotional finale that manages to put a tear in your eye and definitely is worth watching.<br/><br/>Does the Godfather part 3 bring the hole story to a satisfactory conclusion? Yes and no. We see what happens to Michael as that is the most important thing because at the end of the day this is a one man's trilogy. It's Michaels story, about his rise and fall. On the other hand though we don't know what happens to all the other characters such as Kay,Conny, Anthony but most importantly to the new boss of the Corleone family don Vincenzo Corleone. What happens after that tragic night, what happens to the family under his guidance? Does he do good or not? Is he the right man for the job? In what kind of activities does he drag the family into? All these points mentioned remain unfortunately in complete mystery and left to the viewers imagination. A fourth movie is necessary because it would bring the story to a conclusion Once and for all.<br/><br/>The Godfather part 3 is weak in comparison to its big brothers no doubt, but in its own right it does deliver.the movie should of turned out better with the kind of ambitious script it had and If Coppola had more time It would of been certainly a ""Masterpiece"". (Don't blame Coppola, blame paramount that denied the movie From being a classic)!!!!<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it because despite its shortcomings it does feel a godfather movie plus there are periods when It touches moments of brilliance and mostly it's part of the best trilogy ever made in Cinematic history. <br/><br/>""Just when you thought you was out,they pull you back in"".<br/><br/>my vote:8/10"

By retaining the look, feel and cast -- while introducing strong new actors -- we have the ""Godfather"" story continued on even further.

"hall895","7","1","3","5 March 2011"," OK, so it's not as good as the first two
","Judged on its own merits The Godfather: Part III would probably be remembered as a pretty good film. But this film was never going to be judged on its own merits. It was always going to be compared to the first two Godfather films. And, not surprisingly considering the first two are among the most acclaimed and revered films of all time, Part III doesn't measure up. That doesn't make this a bad film though. Yes it has some notable flaws but there are certainly enough good things here to make this final journey into the world of the Corleone family worthwhile.<br/><br/>The most obvious and most often repeated criticism of Part III regards Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone. And the performance is indeed rather terrible. But all the criticism of Sofia Coppola is more than a bit overblown. She was bad but she didn't deserve all the vitriol she received. On a first viewing of the film she certainly sticks out like a sore thumb, especially considering all the quality performers around her. But when you go back and watch the film again you realize that while her character was an important one in the story she's really not on the screen all that much. She's certainly not front and center to the point her presence could possibly sink the whole film. The criticism she received is way out of proportion with her actual impact on the film. And while she has some truly terrible moments there are some times where she's at least passable. The legend of the awful Sofia Coppola Godfather: Part III performance has far outstripped reality.<br/><br/>Sofia Coppola's awkward performance may get the most attention but it is not the only flaw with the film, certainly not the most important one. The biggest flaws deal with the story which is rather convoluted. So many shadowy figures lurking in the background, so many different strands of the plot which need to be tied together. The first two Godfather films were grand and epic. That sense of grandeur is missing here. The story is big, director Francis Ford Coppola is clearly aiming for epic. But this film falls short of that mark. Where the first two films built momentum all the way through this film is saddled with a story which only moves forward in fits and starts. With so much going on some important characters are never really properly developed. Who exactly is Don Lucchesi anyway and what strings is he pulling in the Vatican? What exactly is Archbishop Gilday's role in all this? Not really sure. Don Altobello, with the Corleone family or against them? And why? By the time some of these questions are answered, and some of them are never really answered satisfactorily, it's too late. The story seems to have gotten away from Francis Ford Coppola a bit and when he tries to bring it all together in the end, as he did so well in the first two films, the payoff isn't nearly as great this time around.<br/><br/>Viewed through the prism of the first two films Part III is certainly a bit of a letdown. But rather than bemoan what it isn't, namely one of the greatest movies of all time like its predecessors, you can still enjoy and appreciate this film for what it is. If you can get your head around the story there are a lot of things to like about the film. Al Pacino is terrific as ever as a now beaten-down, worn-out Michael Corleone. Old reliables Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are back for another go although Robert Duvall is sorely missed, his replacement George Hamilton making no real impact at all. There are some good new characters. Andy Garcia does a very good job in portraying Sonny's hotheaded illegitimate son Vincent Mancini, newly welcomed into the Corleone family business. Eli Wallach is excellent as old Don Altobello even if the script doesn't provide us with much insight into the character. Donal Donnelly does very well with the role of the nervous Archbishop Gilday, a man with the weight of the Vatican bearing down on his shoulders. Unfortunately Gilday is another somewhat undeveloped character. Amongst other new characters Don Lucchesi is woefully undeveloped, Joey Zasa is an underwhelming antagonist and Mary Corleone has the aforementioned, if overblown, Sofia Coppola problem. The flaws with this film are plain to see. But the good outweighs the bad. This film was always going to be held to an impossible standard. It falls short of greatness but it still manages to pack quite a punch. Michael Corleone's journey is at an end, the saga is complete. History may deem The Godfather: Part III to be a disappointment. But that is really not fair. It is a good film and a worthy conclusion to one of film's most epic tales."

","first of all i didn't expect what i got in this movie. i had the feelings that after first two classics it wouldn't be a good decision to make another one. but boy they wronged me with wondrous movie. Francis Ford Coppola did a marvelous job in this movie to giving it a perfect end which it really deserved. Sofia and Garcia were two refreshing entries in this movie which really added to the movie. and who can dare to talk on AL PACIONO's acting he is just out of the world. after the the films end i felt like already missing the movie and its character. It was mesmerizing experience to watch this trilogy. and no wonder this is the greatest trilogy of all time. and AL Pacino is the greatest actor .<br/><br/>so those who haven't watched this go other wise you haven't seen anything called movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

","Awesome movie to take a great trilogy to a close. Excellent acting, excellent directing, and themes, motifs, and symbols that are really intriguing. (Look in the Godfathers for murder directly following the scenes of someone eating an orange- it foreshadows death) And in the Godfather III, it shows Michael being served OJ which displays the fact that Michael is having other people taking care of his problems because he is slowly breaking down. <br/><br/>Anyway plenty of people will go into great detail with movies like this so ill just say this: <br/><br/>The women in this one tick me off. Talia Shire. She's innocent, soft spoken, and angelic in both Godfathers 1 and 2. Not only that but she's always a very strongly against the family business. All of a sudden she's making hits and acting like a big shot in this cosa nostra. Talia, go back inside and come back out when you need one of your brothers to beat some culo. <br/><br/>And for the other one, Sonny's daughter, get off your cousin! I'm Italian your disgracing the family values here come on. You know why I really didn't like her though? Because Godfather to me is set in a generation that I link to the traditional Italian-American family values. Sonny's daughter is a more modern generation breed and I don't like the new generation mixed in with the old, it seems too...too..today. Kids are much more free these days and don't really place their family first. When i was a kid it was always Sundays with the family, pasta and meatballs from 2 till everyones done talking. And if i argued i got a smack. Granted, I'm 19, but i grew up in East Boston. Kids today suck which is why i didn't like her.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, still, needed to the collection to show Micheal's decline and still an instant classic."

","My three-week engagement with Francis Ford Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy came to a close this week, and, contrary to the prevailing public opinion, I find myself satisfied. 'The Godfather: Part III (1990)' has always been the Fredo of the 'Godfather' family  frequently disparaged, resented or otherwise ignored. Certainly, there was considerable risk in returning to the Corleone family after a sixteen-year absence, especially given the mixed critical and commercial reception towards much of Coppola's 1980s output {indeed, the director only accepted the studio offer to recoup his past financial losses}. Nevertheless, that a second sequel wasn't produced sooner demonstrates Coppola's dedication towards getting everything right, and the result is a picture that successfully expands upon the two previous instalments, respectfully and solemnly drawing the saga to a close. Any film is liable to suffer in comparison with two of the great gangster pictures of our time, but, despite a few issues  which I'll get to shortly  'The Godfather: Part III' is a more than worthy addition to the family.<br/><br/>Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has spent the last two decades trying to legitimise his operations, perhaps a last futile attempt at reconstructing his shattered family. However, still tormented by the memory of brother Fredo, Michael knows that he can never truly wash his hands of organised crime (""just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!""). Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent (Andy Garcia) offers his services to Michael, proving his dedication towards the family, even if he shares his father's recklessness. Michael's two children have since grown up. Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has defied his father's wishing by becoming an opera singer, and Mary (Sofia Coppola) begins a worrying incestuous relationship with Vincent. Meanwhile, in a further bid to improve his reputation and importance, Michael moves to purchase the Vatican's shares in real-estate company Immobiliare, a bid that ultimately reveals corruption and treachery in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church, a group traditionally regarded as pure and virtuous. Here, Coppola shows that policemen, judges, and even priests, can readily be bought.<br/><br/>For the most part, 'The Godfather: Part III' is a wonderful film. Gordon Willis' return as cinematographer ensured that the film remained aesthetically consistent with its predecessors, and Coppola's film-making is, for the most part, handsome and professional. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is just as convoluted as the original film, but I'm confident that a second viewing will substantially improve my understanding of each character and their motives. Though the first few dialogue scenes seem strained, as though the actors are easing into their roles, the performances are generally excellent. Only Sofia Coppola  and I don't want to labour the point, since she's been lambasted enough  fails to construct a well-defined screen persona. She wears a peculiar scowl for most of the film, and her role in the story is vague and superficial. Nevertheless, any of the picture's weaknesses are quickly forgotten in lieu of an unforgettable climax, set amid an operatic performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana,"" perhaps the finest instance of super-prolonged suspense since the Albert Hall sequence in 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).'"

","The movie shows the struggle of a man, the god father trying to get out of the dirty work... It is so well portrayed by Al Pacino.

Brando, Caan, Pacino, DeNiro have displayed the art of acting that is top notch. The trilogy shows that movies can also be a great display of art & life, and that it is not just in theater...

"agsconnolly","5","1","3","31 July 2007"," SPOILER: A two-part masterpiece sadly tarnished by the third instalment
","It is difficult to know where to start when commenting on this film, owing to its many points for discussion, but I will try to address the points in turn.<br/><br/>Firstly, the casting of this film, in contrast with the first two parts, is generally awful. Robert Duvall was sorely missed and Francis Ford Coppola and his cohorts must surely regret not meeting his pay demands. Talia Shire reprises her role, completely pointlessly, and is totally unconvincing as the matriarch of the family. Of the newcomers, George Hamilton appears not to have an actual character beyond reading the lines of Michael Corleone's lawyer, Bridget Fonda is equally meaningless and Andy Garcia is hackneyed, if willing, as Vinnie Mancini. Sofia Coppola is a disgrace. The film stalls every time she is on screen and she is not capable or attractive enough to fulfil her role.<br/><br/>Secondly, Al Pacino had changed so much since part II that he almost appears a different person. At times he is so far removed from his persona in the first two films that he seems to be playing another character. And whilst his performance is easily the film's best, his better moments are offset by a couple of cringe-worthy incidents, such as his hammed-up stroke in the kitchen scene.<br/><br/>The film itself does entertain at times - but at nowhere near the level of the first two. Much of the story is lifted and turned around from the previous films and consequently is not as interesting. The script, much like some of the cast, simply does not possess the hunger of the originals.<br/><br/>But the worst moment of the film is how it chooses to end the trilogy, moving as it does from the awful, to the excellent and plummeting back to the diabolical. Firstly, we are treated to a final turn from Ms. Coppola as she dies unconvincingly on the opera house steps. We then see Pacino's finest moment of the film as he expresses initially silent agony at her side - a truly great few frames. But then, for some unfathomable reason, we are transported forward 20 or 30 years to Sicily, where Pacino is wearing some of the worst make-up in movie history, and he falls out of his chair and dies. To call this final scene rushed, crass, unimaginative, comical, insulting, lazy, pathetic or arrogant would be to understate things greatly. There simply could not have been a worse ending to the trilogy.<br/><br/>All this said, the film is watchable if you are able to put all of these points out of your mind and simply let it wash over you. There a lot worse films. But I awarded it five stars owing to the unbelievable mess made by the men that created the two original masterpieces. My advice is to watch this once, but in future only bother with Parts I and II, as they were intended."

","This is not a bad movie at all. But there are some glaring flaws. Sophia Coppola being the largest, who at the worst times comes off as flat and lost. The story itself meanders a bit, and doesn't really differentiate itself from the first two the way it should. Joey Zasa's character was humorously villainous. The helicopter scene was a poorly executed idea. Michael Corleone's character was muddled and i had a hard time connecting this Michael to the Michael in the first two. Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen was tragically absent. But Michael's character needed resolution, and that part was done well. It's hard to watch as Michael seeks forgiveness for the evil things he's done, and i applaud Coppola for going a different route with Michael. He could have just given what everyone expected, a Michael from part II, barely sane and zombified and still bent on wiping out his enemies. But he made Michael human again, and i appreciate what he tried to do. Andy Garcia really stole the show for me. His performance was more than worthy of an Oscar. He really saved the film in a lot of ways. Diane Keaton does great, as does Talia Shire. The climax of the film really moved me, despite Sophia's awful effort during the scene. Any fan of the first two should see this, it is a great film with equally great flaws. But sadly doesn't compare to the first two."
"Jsimpson5","8","1","3","26 January 2007"," Highly Underrated
","When you talk to a lot of people who saw this movie, they will tell you that this is a horrible movie. I beg to differ.<br/><br/>Basically this movie jumps ahead to the late 1970's, as Michael is still in charge of the Corleone family. Michael is now trying to make the Corleone business dealings legit. At the same time he takes a young protégé under his wing, so that when he retires, someone else can take command of the family.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is pretty good. A lot of people will tell you that Sofia Coppola did a horrible job as Mary Corleone. I mean she wasn't that bad as the role in my opinion, but she probably would have been the better choice then Winona Ryder who is a bad actress.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the bad hype that people give this movie. It's a good movie in it's own right, so do yourself a favor and watch the last movie in the Godfather Saga."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","1","3","3 August 2006"," A Great Conclusion To One of the Best Film Franchises In Cinematic History
","Michael Corleone has gotten old. He wants to go straight--given a slightly liberal definition of that term. He's gotta get out. And he almost does. He sells his illegal business to win back his family, but most importantly, his wife and son. But he still has things to deal with, such as Vincent, Sonny's bastard son, and Joey Zasa, the rival clan leader who purchased Mike's territory. Mike also has to deal with a corrupt priest turns to him for help. He will donate a large sum of money to the Catholic Church, and in return, he will own the majority of the 'International Immobilarie', a company whose shares lie in the protection of the Catholic Church. But this is a setup.<br/><br/>This was the least-well received of the Godfather films, and I can guess why. The fans did not have their Michael Corleone. Yeah, they had a guy named Al Pacino playing someone named Michael Corleone, but it was not the same Michael from the first two films. This Michael was straightened out. He did not resort to revenge. He did not do to his enemies what the fans wanted him to do. He was the Marlon Brando of the third movie, only not quite as memorable.<br/><br/>Another reason I know this movie was bashed was for its acting--particularly from Sofia Coppola (other than that, the movie was fine in terms of performances). I did not like her acting, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. It didn't distract me from the story. I noticed the flaws in her performance at first, but then got used to it. I sympathized with her when people bashed. I realized that this was her first real role in a film. You can't expect Oscar-material out of a first-time actress. I felt even more sympathy towards her when I turned on the audio commentary by Francis Ford Coppola. I'm sure even if the bashers heard what he had to say...well, Coppola does evoke sympathy for his daughter.<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, I'll move on to the technical side of the movie. Gordon Willis' dark cinematography fits in for the dark mood of the film. His yellowish hue so present in the previous films has faded, gone now into a sort of nineteen seventies vibe. And I will stand by the fact that you can have a lot of static camera, and still evoke emotion.<br/><br/>Nino Rota, sadly, had passed on by the time this film was underway. But not all hope was lost, for Carmine Coppola had worked on the previous two pictures behind the scenes in the music department, and now stepped up to the enormous task of scoring the movie. While he did not come up with the iconic themes, he did some wonderful orchestrations that I still love to listen to.<br/><br/>Francis Coppola's direction is in the same vein as Part I and II, which is not a bad thing. There is a fair amount of violence, but there is also some great acting. Pacino shines, as always. Talia Shire also deserves some recognition for the role she plays--quite different to that of the first two. Sadly though, the absence of Robert Duvall also hurt the movie. But the real star here is the obvious Andy Garcia--the bastard son of Sonny Corleone, Vincent. His Oscar nod for this was well deserved.<br/><br/>Without giving that much away, I will say that this had one of the most emotional climaxes I've seen in any movie in the past few years. So, overall, this is a great conclusion to one of the best film franchises in cinematic history."
"MaxBorg89","8","1","3","16 March 2006"," Flawed but compelling epilogue
","Let's get this straight: The Godfather: Part III is not as good as the first two outings, and wasn't really necessary. But then again, neither was Terminator 3, which can't match James Cameron's original cyborg opuses, yet people think it's a good film if considered necessary to know how the whole story ends. It's the same for the third Godfather chapter. On its own, apart from one flaw, it could be a great picture, but compared to its much superior predecessors, it's just an interesting conclusion of the epic Corleone saga.<br/><br/>Many years have passed since Part II, and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is getting tired: he decides to hand over the business to his nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), put an end to all illegal activities he's had a hand in, and seek reconciliation with his wife (Diane Keaton), who still fears him for what the mafioso patriarch did to his own brother. In fact, Fredo's death, shown in flashback at the beginning of the film, is probably the main reason Michael wants to retire: he has realized what a terrible man absolute power has turned him into, and he doesn't that to happen to his children. Unfortunately, though, he still has enemies, and they're going to strike pretty hard, maybe through Vincent, who has inherited his dad's quick temper (remember Sonny Corleone?), or Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), whose friendship with the new boss is blossoming into a passionate, and incestuous, love affair...<br/><br/>While the first two Godfathers dealt with power and its effects on people, Part III's main theme is redemption, which is desperately sought for by the aging Michael, a man so repulsed by his own crimes he even confesses his evil deeds to a priest. Al Pacino still makes a believable Corleone, although I have to say I preferred the determined, ambitious, ruthless Michael from the '70s. Nevertheless, his performance is respectable, a thing I can't say of Sofia Coppola. With all due respect, she's an excellent writer and director (Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies), but her acting is very bad, and you notice it even more when she shares the screen with the show-stealing Garcia, who's having the time of his life as the Don's nephew. He's terrific, but his performance alone can't fill the huge charisma hole left open by Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and James Caan. Still, he and Pacino make the third chapter of Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia epic worth a look.<br/><br/>So, ultimately, I must say I've seen better franchise conclusions, but I've also seen much, much worse."
"itamarscomix","8","1","3","17 February 2006"," Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in
","Frequently attacked and constantly under-appreciated, The Godfather, Part III is often, and unfairly, referred to as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of cinema. When comparing  and I suppose a comparison is inevitable  The Godfather, Part III is certainly not quite as strong as the first two films, both of which are classic masterpieces, practically flawless, to be found in any respectful list of all-time best movies. It was largely a failure both commercially and critically (being nominated for seven Oscars but receiving none). Nevertheless, Part III is a fantastic drama, as good a crime drama as Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', which was released that same year and received much more critical acclaim; certainly the last great film Francis Ford Coppola had directed yet (hopes for 'Youth Without Youth', which has a late 2006 release date). Just like The Godfather, Part II achieved greatness by not trying to recapture the original but being an entirely separate and unique creation, so Part III is a separate creation that stands by its own right, and while it's a continuation of the first two films, it does nothing to subtract from their greatness as some sequels do. The Godfather can work perfectly as a single film, as a two-parter, or as a trilogy; it's a wonderful saga either way.<br/><br/>In many ways, The Godfather, Part III, is closer in its spirit to the first film than to the second. International affairs take second place to character development and human insight. Part III, however, focuses on the character of Michael Corleone deeper than any of the other films. It's debatable whether or not Al Pacino's performance here is stronger here than in Part II  it's clear that he's more experienced and mature an actor than he was in 1974, though he may have lost just a bit of his edge. But while in Part II we saw Michael as a decent man gradually turning into a monster, all the while focusing on his life in comparison with his father, Part III delves more deeply into his soul; the influences of Shakespeare and Sophocles are stronger than ever before, as Michael turns into a tragic hero in the classic Greek sense of the words, a man with, ultimately, good intentions, brought down to his tragic end by fate and by his own flaws. Michael is more human and more pitiable in Part III than ever before, and Pacino is certainly up to the task. Comparisons to Vito are certainly there (watch Michael talk some sense into Vincent, just like Vito did to Sonny in the first film) but they're no longer the focus of the film; this film is about Michael, and so Pacino's performance here is more impressive than in the first two parts.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fantastic (although there aren't any actors in the caliber of Brando, De Niro, Caan or Duvall  who was supposed to be in the film but backed out), but other than Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, who reprise their roles from the previous films excellently, the real revelation here is Andy Garcia, who plays Vincent, illegitimate son of Michael's eldest brother Sonny, and friend-of-the-family Lucy Mancini (the affair between Lucy and Sonny is referred to very briefly in the first film, although it plays a large and important part in the original novel). The role of Vincent Corleone is certainly the strongest in Garcia's career, and his only Oscar-nominated one; Vincent is wonderfully reminiscent of his father (played by James Caan in the first film), and he plays an important part of shedding light on the character of Michael Corleone, while never quite stealing the show from Pacino, clearly the center of the story. Also commendable are performances by George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda and Eli Wallach.<br/><br/>There has been much debate about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter Mary, so here's my angle on it: it's quite bad indeed, and Sofia proves beyond doubt that she's not an actress. With a lesser cast around her, it wouldn't seem as bad, but next to actors like Pacino, Garcia and Keaton, Coppola seems totally out of place. However, it does little to hurt the film; Mary's part in the film is quite big, but she's mainly there to shed light on Michael and Vincent, and Sofia's less than mediocre performance is ignorable. Thankfully, she quit acting afterwords, and moved on to directing, a field in which she shows much more promise; in fact, the young Miss Coppola shows signs of being one of the most promising young directors of the new millennium.<br/><br/>The Godfather, Part III is a fascinating and thrilling tale, and the last forty five minutes are as gripping as any scene in the first two films; Coppola's directing is as inspired and sensitive as it ever was before, and the dialog is all spotless, believable and captivating. The reference to the death of Pope John Paul I, who died only 33 days after being indicted and whose death remains something of a mystery, is a nice touch, which helps create the sense of realism that was an important aspect of the first two films. It's not as timeless a masterpiece as The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, but if you loved the first two films, you should by all means watch this third installment, too."

","The Godfather Part III I saw this on TV a little while back and finally got around to review it. I loved the first one and also liked the second one, except it was too long! Well, anyway it takes place like thirty years after the Godfather Part II. Michael is trying to legitimize his business and get out of the gangster business. He meets his nephew and future godfather Vincent, who falls in love with his daughter Mary.(But they're cousins?) I'm not going to tell you all the stuff, but I'll tell you that the ending is absolutely heartbreaking. Michael is walking out of an opera with his whole family. Then suddenly a guy shoots at him, but instead kills Mary. As a crowd almost covers him, Vincent pulls out a pistol and shoots him. Its heartbreaking because it shows past images of Michael dancing with Kay in Los Vegas and him dancing with Mary. In the end, he falls over dead, alone. A great film and is so underrated."
"Hancock_the_Superb","7","1","3","5 September 2005"," Flawed But Entertaining Conclusion To The ""Godfather"" Saga
","If you become a mob boss, there's no way to get out and stay out. That's the lesson that Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) learns in this third ""Godfather"" film, which isn't up to the great creative heights of the first two films but is reasonably entertaining in its own right. Michael has tried to go legitimate, attempting to buy a holding company in Europe which is effectively owned by the Vatican, but finds the Catholic church is up to its own neck in corrupt. Meanwhile, Vincent (Andy Garcia), the hotheaded bastard son of Sonny Corleone, shows up, starting a war with hood Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), which gets Michael sucked back into the ""business"", along with flirting with his young daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola). And another friend-turned-rival of Michael's, Don Altobello (Eli Wallach) turns up, trying to knock off Michael so he can take over his empire. It all comes together in a trademark ""Godfather"" montage sequence, but tragedy comes as the result of that, as well.<br/><br/>The movie is very, very flawed in many ways, and it's easy to see why a lot of people think it's crap. One problem is the supporting cast. While most of the actors do a very good job, there are also many problems. Sofia Coppola has been bashed enough and I don't feel the need to add mine to the din of voices attacking her. The other actors aren't so much miscast as given poor material. Mantegna is great to watch but his character is killed off an hour into the film. Wallach is perfectly cast as Altobello but he's eventually done in by poor characterization and bad writing (not to mention getting one hell of a lame death). Same with Helmut Berger as a slimy Swiss banker. George Hamilton is adequate as Michael's new consigliere, but he won't make anyone forget Robert Duvall. And Bridget Fonda is just annoying, though thankfully she's only in all of two scenes.<br/><br/>There are a number of great memorable scenes (the helicopter hit and Michael's confession coming to mind instantly), but the set-pieces of the movie just aren't up to snuff. The assassin characters are introduced way too late in the movie, and the ending montage is overly drawn-out and lame compared to the baptism scene of the first and the Hyman Roth/Pentagelli/Fredo montage of the second. The Roman Catholic plot was interesting (attempting to tie in the death of Pope John Paul I rather awkwardly) but again, poorly done.<br/><br/>But what saves the movie are two things: some great performances by the leads, and a heartbreaking ending. Al Pacino gives one of his two or three best performances here, showing Michael to have suffered greatly from his time as ""Godfather"" and willing but still unable to go straight. Diane Keaton continues her great work as Kay, with considerably more poignancy here. Talia Shire and Richard Bright have considerably larger parts than in the first two and it's nice to see these two fine actors strut their stuff. Raf Valone is wonderful as the Cardinal who hears Michael's confession and later becomes a reluctant (and ill-fated) Pope. And Andy Garcia steals the show as Vincent, the explosive, hotheaded wannabe Mafia don who causes this whole mess.<br/><br/>But for all of the movie's many flaws, what saves it is the positively heartbreaking ending, when Mary takes a bullet for her father. No matter what may think of Sofia or her character, that scene is heartbreaking, and Al Pacino's muted screams make the scene even more tragic. And the very ending - with a eighty-plus year old Michael Corleone dropping over dead in Sicily - is beautifully and simply done.<br/><br/>""The Godfather Part III"" is a very, very flawed movie, but it isn't as bad as its reputation would suggest. If you can get past the somewhat convoluted story and the fact that it isn't in the league of the first two (and Sofia), then you should be able to enjoy this movie. 7/10"

That this schlock is lumped with the first two works of art broke my heart. The legend of Michael Corleone certainly needed to be continued, if not finalized.

","And the amazing thing about that is that it's better than most of the stuff being made today. I think the reason why it doesn't have the acclaim accorded to the first two is that it was made too late and doesn't have the powerhouse actors the first two did. Notably missing is Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall wasn't offered enough money) and Sofia Coppola should not have been cast as she wasn't an actress (Winona Ryder backed out of the project at the last minute). The funny part of trivia about this film was Coppola's visit to Duvall's house in which Duvall thought he was wanting the recipe to his crab cakes not offering him a part in this next film and the fact that Coppola threatened to start the film with Michael's funeral because Pacino wanted so much money. Again real life situations are part of this movie and are obvious to the semi-trained eye. Garcia isn't bad he just isn't enough to make it truly great which in and of itself isn't his fault the movie was just too contemporary for it's own good. The ending goes for a real slam dunk and it achieves it as far as ending the trilogy. The best part is the mob meeting that was good and so was the action following it.

","The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was as good as part 2, and not as good as part 1, my initial rating for it was an eight. When I saw it for a second ( and third time ), I began knowing why almost everyone doesn't like this movie. While parts 1 and 2 can be watched hundreds of times, without being bored for one second ( especially part 2, which is now my favorite movie of the trilogy ), i felt VERY bored watching part 3 again. I actually fell asleep during the movie, and woke up only to watch the final 15 minutes, which are definitely the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good things, Al Pacino was excellent as always, Andie Garcia, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shore were very good in their parts. I also think the storyline is good, despite being a bit surprising. After all the power Micheal Corleone had in part 2, i felt he was too weak in part 3.<br/><br/>Now let's move on the bad things. Sofia Coppola's acting wasn't the best, but i don't think she ruined the movie as everyone says. I felt the movie was a little slow, especially in the second half, and it could have been about 20 minutes shorter. The movie's main flaw, in my opinion, is that it gets weaker with every time you watch it, while the other parts get stronger with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>So I recommend watching The Godfather part 3, but only once, so you could know how the story ends, but don't watch it again."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","1","3","3 March 2005"," superb conclusion to an amazing series
","SPOILERS Released 16 years after the previous part, it is not difficult to see why people were sceptical of ""The Godfather: Part III"". Doing badly at the Box Office and loosing out on awards due to ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Goodfellas"", the film has always been viewed as an inferior film in comparison to it's predecessors. Whilst perhaps more inconsistent than the original two films, it is still however an amazing story with solid acting throughout.<br/><br/>Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is getting old. Beginning to become burdened by the events of his life, this Godfather has plans to make his family's finances legitimate. Helped by his sister Connie (Talia Shire) and protégé Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), Michael begins his progression to becoming a law abiding member of society. As he begins to realise though, the more you try to leave the old life behind, the more you get dragged back in.<br/><br/>Released so long after the previous part, this film smacks of a next generation. Old faces like Michael and Connie are grown old, some are dead (Tom Hagen a notable absentee due to an argument over Robert Duvall's fee), and all the children of the previous films are grown up. In a way however, this does aid the film drastically. With absolutely mind blowing performances by some of the elder cast (Pacino in particular is jaw dropping good), the film becomes a chance for new blood to show their skill. Some do it well (for example Andy Garcia), some do it not so well (stand up Sofia Coppola).<br/><br/>Ultimately though, like the two films before it, the key about this film is it's script. With a story involving the Vatican and corruption, it tells an interesting story, albeit not as riveting as in the first film.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is one key flaw with this part of the series. In ""The Godfather"" we are given two magnetic performances by Pacino and Marlon Brando. Both thrive with a plot which suits them to the ground, and they work well together. Then in the second chapter, we have Pacino and Robert De Niro. Whilst never actually meeting during the film, these two actors again put in amazing performances. However, in this final part, the only main star is Pacino. He manages to once more put in a performance of true genius, but he is very much alone in this film. He is helped by a fine cast, but it is Pacino's film and his alone.<br/><br/>It is a confusing truth that so many people condemn ""The Godfather: Part III"". Whilst it might not have the charisma of the first part and it may focus on one genius actor rather than two, it is still a stunning film and a worthy conclusion to the series. We have witnessed the finest Trilogy to have been made so far, and it will take a very long time to be beaten."
"wrcong","6","1","3","10 February 2005"," Went to the well once too often
","This film is a poor shadow of its two monumental predecessors. It is more a run-of-the-mill sequel (read: pale imitation of the predecessor) than another film in the great tradition of the first two Godfather films.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this film had gigantic footsteps in which to follow. Sadly, it doesn't come remotely close to following them. Al Pacino gives a solid if uninspired performance as the aging Michael Corleone. (He was saving his intensity for Scarface, I suppose.) The other performances are flat. Worse, the story lines seem generally less plausible. Part of what made the first two films so effective was the more or less close parallels to actual underworld events. This story did not succeed at that project.<br/><br/>I suppose that seeing this version completed the full circle, but I did not need to see Michael's daughter (Sophia Coppola) take a bullet intended for him to get the idea that the gangster life had cost Michael everything he held dear. Part II completed that part of the saga with tremendous insight and subtle power. I did not need to be hit over the head with the idea in Part III.<br/><br/>The movie is not a total dog, but it is not in the same league as the first two -- not by a long shot."

","The Godfather Trilogy is one of the richest cinema experiences ever, and many people think that the Godfather Part III is the worst of them all, with justification. However, this is only in comparison to the other 2 which were as close to flawless as movies come. If this was a single movie, released on its own, it would be called a masterpiece. This movie delves deeper into the character of Michael Corleone than any of the other 2 films. It has one of the most haunting and powerful endings that I've ever seen. Andy Garcia was phenomenal in this, and the Atlantic City massacre scene has got to be one of the trilogy's most memorable; that caught me completely off guard. And come on, I dare you to say that the part where Don Lucchesi gets his glasses stabbed through his throat was not cool! The only major downfall in this movie was the performance of Sofia Coppola. That really made me wince, especially compared to such great actors like Al Pacino or Andy Garcia. I swear J Lo could have done a better job on the character... In all, however, this is a fine movie, one that is unfortunately overlooked in respect to the other two. Despite this, though, the Godfather III is a masterpiece, and the fact that it is not on the IMDb Top 250 is a crime. However, be aware that this film is not meant for children. Many people are shot, often with pretty bloody results. As well, there is a hanging, and a man is stabbed through the throat with glasses (as mentioned above). Language is bad with almost 20 f words, and there is an incestuous relationship. However, if you can handle all of this, then this is the film for you. Intriguing, violent, and powerful, the Godfather Part III is a must see."

","Whether you love or hate this movie mainly comes down to whether you love or hate Sophia's acting, but I've always felt she did a half decent job. Others could have done better, but there is not point in moaning about what's been done. It is a great movie. The ending is one of the most tragic, moving scenes ever filmed, perhaps Pacino's greatest moment. It moves at a slower pace than its predecessors, echoing Michael's tired descent, and the message that family life cannot be separated from The Business is never clearer.fine, it is not as good as the first two, perhaps it should have been made 5 or ten years earlier. 9 out of ten"

","Whilst never really reaching the heights of the first two films this nevertheless still has its moments. A lot of the critics dislike this due to Sofia Coppola and I suspect that has more to do with her parentage than it does with her acting. Personally I think her acting is fair enough, but I think the film is rather let down by the Vatican plot line.<br/><br/>Michael is still trying to achieve is goal by legitimising the organisation. This time it's the younger members of the family that are frustrated and their actions deny Michael's ultimate goal. Al Pacino puts in another fine performance that sees him become increasingly imprisoned in his position. Overall a good movie, but not a classic."

Here is a list of reasons<br/><br/>1) Weak plot 2) Strange character relationships 3) Bad acting from a few 4) Some cheezy/predictable parts<br/><br/>1) The plot was Michael trying to legitamitize his business.  Somehow, attending his son's Opera Debut, getting named a Saint, a feud between some guy name Joey Zaza, and feuds with other mob heads mixes into that mess. The difference from ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part 2"" is that the sub plots were in the general vecinity of the main plot.  Part 3 is just a giant mess.<br/><br/>2) Who would make out and date their 1st cousin? (enough said) 3) Sofia Coppola (enough said yet again) 4) I sooooo predicted Michael to be in the car when Kay was going out into Sicily and almost everything was predictable, like the climactic killings in the end.  The Godfather Part 3 was trying too hard to be like the original (the ending at least) because they have everyone in a peaceful setting (Baptism in the first, Opera in part 3) and then it cuts to all these killings happening at the same time.<br/><br/>I did not like The Godfather Part 3 much because it was a huge disappointment"

I dont like this movie for a very simple reasons, very little of the original story carries over to this installment. made up characters like vincent and marie and inconsistent ones like Kate, who after disaproving of michael's chosen career in the first 2 installments is now so accepting of the mob wife role. And what is with the whole Vatican issue, sounds more like international politics than the  underworld power struggle of the two first movies were. Also gone are the mentions of real life famous characters with names changed from the first movies , for example famous singer and actor Johnie Fontaine,that gave the fictional story of the godfather a non fictional touch, i loved that. The only character from this movie that i liked was Joe Montagnia's; the only character that kept true to the original mafioso persona of the first installments. if you love the godfather like i do stick to the first 2 movies, you wont be sorry ."

It would have been a better movie if they would have combined the Michael scenes with Sonny's early days. <br/><br/>**1/2 out of **** Stars"

Sofia Coppola really truly should not have gotten the part as Mary.  The only positive thing I can say about her is that she has nice hair, which is not much, is it?  Andy Garcia, well, he was not bad but could have been much better.  There are a couple of moments when he seems to have forgotten his lines.  Is this Coppola's fault for letting us see it? And is he (Garcia) really strong enough to continue the Corleone empire?  The movie doesn't quite let you make your mind up.  Pacino is, as always, faultless, this time as the ageing Michael.

","I am very disappointed to hear all the negative comments and the jokes aimed at the final installment in The Godfather trilogy. But I guess it isn't that surprising for the third installment takes a long time jump over the second and is less violent. If the first movie was an introduction to power and a very powerful family, the second was about using that power as protection for the future, the third is about the cost of using power to secure your future, how you may change yourself but can't change your past.<br/><br/>
This is Al Pacino's best work of the 90s and probably his final subtle performance. Andy Garcia (the Pacino of his generation) steals the show and is the perfect actor to play James Caan's son. Sofia Coppola isn't as bad as most people think but I really regret that Winona Ryder wasn't in her place. Director Francis Ford Coppola takes a different approach in his direction, shooting much longer scenes with Michael Corleone and much more Italian language. The final climax and final image is haunting and is the inevitable, masterful end to America's greatest saga."

I mean, movies are made for the audience, but if a  writer/director makes a movie the way he does, that's his business. It's called artistic license. I for one think that whatever someone puts in a movie is fine and if I don't like it so what? When I watched Part III I liked Sophia, I liked Vincent, and I even liked the way Michael died.

The moment Michael Corleone declares ""I would burn in hell to keep you safe"" to his daughter (which happens quite early on), I knew how it was going to end. This filled the rest of an already bloated film with the wrong kind of dread, exposing each emotionally manipulative scene to ill effect. Also, an abundance of unconvincing or even unnecessary ""hits"" in the movie is more exhausting than anything else, and robs the climactic, drawn out scene at the opera house of any emotional impact that might have remained. Lastly, the final scene of Michael's pitiful death years later as an old man, alone and unloved, unfortunately serves as a symbol of the movie itself rather than the character."
"RossRivero99","8","1","4","15 April 2017"," A good movie but not as good as the first two
","Compared to the first two Godfather movies which were masterpieces, even though this third and final installment in the franchise is a disappointment even though I did happen to like this movie. This movie wasn't adapted from the Mario Puzo novel but it obviously did use mostly the same characters with some new additions. The movie is set roughly 20 years after which part II ended beginning in 1979 and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still the head of the Corleone crime family but now he is using his power before retirement to do good with founding the Vito Andolini Corleone foundation (which is obviously named after his father) with his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) who happens to have a crush on her cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia). With that relationship Michael is very reluctant to let it continue. Also during this time Michael and his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton) are still divorced, he has only one sibling left which is his sister Connie (Talia Shire), and he wants his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio)to join his foundation, but his son refuses and then goes on the path to his own career. Before and during Vincent and Mary flirting Vincent had a girlfriend named Grace Hamilton (Bridget Fonda). Francis Ford Coppola is no question a great director and a fantastic screenwriter but this movie not only flops compared to the first two films, but it also pales in comparison to every great mob movie that I have ever seen, which is why I think that it's a good movie not by any means a great one. The problems that I had with this movie are that, Coppola could have gotten deeper into the story like he did with the first two, and one of the positives is that the acting is very good with standout performances from Pacino, Keaton, Garcia (who got an Oscar nomination), Fonda, Shire, and the great Eli Wallach as an aging mobster named Altobello. But the only performance that was really embarrassing to watch was Sofia Coppola's because I got the impression that when she was filming her scenes her dad was probably telling her to improve and she didn't every time and then pretended to like it with in the next several takes, and that she was cast all because she is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, but then again that's just me. This was a beautiful movie to look at and to watch but if Sofia Coppola had improved on her performance the movie would have been better than I currently perceive it to be, but it's still an honorable conclusion to follow two masterpieces."
"classicsoncall","8","1","4","12 January 2013"," ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.""
","I didn't care much for this film when I first saw it, but I watched it today from a different perspective. I put the continuity of the first two pictures out of my mind as best as possible, and tried to watch ""Godfather III"" as a stand alone movie. Not entirely possible of course, but you get what I'm saying. After all this time, the film holds up pretty well, as the aging Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to take the family business legitimate by cashing out the casinos and racketeering ventures. The business with the European conglomerate Immobiliare got a bit too intricate, but the tie-in with the Roman Catholic Church and the historical reference to the death of Pope John Paul I was an interesting story element.<br/><br/>What I liked about Michael Corleone was the way he kept his character subdued while plotting his next move. The contrast Andy Garcia provides as nephew Vincent Manicini is a polar opposite to Michael, just like his hot headed father Sonny who's quick temper got him killed in the first installment of the franchise. Vincent watches and learns, and capably fills in as the new head of the Corleone Family when Michael takes ill.<br/><br/>If there's an issue I would take with the picture, it would be the drawn out opera scene that drags the resolution of the story in the final act. I think back to the brilliant revenge sequence of the original Godfather, and this one was somewhat anti-climactic in comparison, though for shock value, the death of Mary Corleone (Sofia Coppola) was a twist I think most viewers wouldn't have expected.<br/><br/>As an aside, and basically unrelated to the story per se, the opening scene with that shot of the World Trade Center had me doing some quick math, and while this film came out in 1990, the Twin Towers would only survive the picture by a mere decade, and now another decade has gone by since then. Putting things all in perspective, it really boggles the mind."
"silent_orpheus","6","1","4","1 July 2012"," Some say underrated, some say shouldn't have been released
","Being somebody who loved Godfather I and II, this movie truly changed the way I will remember Don Michael Corleone. But that's not even the problem. Not only did this movie undo what was done in the first two movies, it had a major flaw in the casting of Mary Corleone. Although some may not agree, the majority of this movie's storyline is dependent on the much loved Mary. When Sofia Coppola played Mary (honestly she sounded half-asleep throughout the movie, idk if she's trying to sound seductive but it wasn't working for me), the entire plot comes crashing down. The way Mary Corleone was portrayed did not allow the viewers to become attached to her character, much less understand why the characters around her adored her so. If Mary had been portrayed with a stronger presence, it would've been an acceptable closing to the Godfather series. If I could make erase my memory of this third movie, I would. The way Godfather part II ended was perfect. With Michael Corleone making the stone-cold decision to kill anyone who poses a harm to his family, it made his character rock-solid, respected, and most of all, a legend. But being a huge fan of the first two, I had to see the final installment for myself, and man did Sofia Coppola disappoint. I'm not saying I'm 100% happy with the other characters' acting and the overall plot. But if Mary's casting had more character, it would've made the movie a LOT more formidable. Al Pacino's acting was all that saved this movie from being a horrible one."
"paul2001sw-1","Null","1","4","21 July 2011"," Overlong and unnecessary
","One thing everyone knows about each of the three 'Godfather' films (even if they haven't seen them): that the first is the classiest piece of soap opera ever made, that the second is the most successful sequel ever made, and that the third is spoilt by the poor performance of Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter (who, of course, subsequently gave up acting altogether for a career as a director herself). For once, all of these pieces of conventional wisdom are true; moreover, all (and not just the last) are pertinent when answering the question, why isn't the third film (made after a long interval) as good as the other two? Because the complete answer isn't just Sofia's fault: it's fair to say that, after two epic movies, the whole idea has started to run out of gas, and the plot (based on the short reign of Pope John Paul I, and the death of Roberto Calvi), which appears tangential at best to the overall story of the American mafia, is itself one indicator of this. In effect, the central story has been told already, and it feels as if Coppola is cranking out one more episode of a soap, and no longer in a good way.<br/><br/>The movie isn't all bad, but it loses further points for its bizarre ending, a lengthy sequence set during a night at the opera during which almost every character appears to be killed, including many whose particular role in the plot is not at all clear to the audience. Indeed, at times, the symbolism almost appears comically obvious - opera singer picks up a knife, man in the audience gets stabbed, opera singer picks up a rifle, man in the audience gets shot, etc. - and it's impossible to argue that less grandiosity, and more editing, would have benefited the whole finale. Ultimately, there's a reason why sequels aren't usually very good (if a story is told well, it is told and then it is done); and while Coppola managed to defy this rule in making 'The Godfather Part II', sixteen years later he came decidedly down to earth."

","Watching this film many years after its release for the second time, I have to say if the power had gone half-way through I'd have been pretty annoyed, and yet as the end titles rolled I felt much like after the first viewing that there was nothing really outstanding or memorable about this film.<br/><br/>Rather than packing a final jaw-shattering punch, (like the 1st installment), or confronting us with bleak immorality, (part 2), the film is like one long second act without any of the set-pieces that made me sit up and take note in the previous movies, (horses head, murder of the five families, motel hooker mutilation, Easter parade, domestic violence, etc.), although some attempts are made to include many of these ideas, (eg. the assassination of Joey Zasa).<br/><br/>The cast try their hardest. Andy Garcia, initially very annoying, settles down to a more natural performance after a ludicrous establishing scene at the Corleone party, biting an ear off - (come off it Francis)! Sofia Copplola mostly carries the part, (unless she speaks); Diane Keaton leaps in and out from the wings saying the same old things, and George Hamilton does rather well in the unenviable task of filling Robert Duval's role as consigliari. Vatcian politics is portrayed bleakly and the theme of honour killing is dealt with quite well, making some nice references to motifs in the previous installments, (eg explaining the curious operetta seen in part 2 by a young Vito). John Savage, however, is utterly wasted in the superfluous character of Tom Hagen's son, and Franc D' Abrosio seems hopelessly miscast as Pacino's son.<br/><br/>All in all though this is a cynical film made purely to capitalise on the franchise and made to line Coppola's pockets after the commercial failure of Tucker. The script was also over-laboured and subject to major changes, some a result of financial constraints. The direction is less assured than the previous films, Michael's 'dread' is imperceptible and, curiously for a film of this genre, there is nothing adult enough to elevate it from a melodrama; - it's pretty much family viewing! All in all I enjoyed watching this film, and it does close the story for good, but considering the power & legacy of the first two movies it is ironic that the series should end on such a wimper, rather than a bang."

"borjaml_90","9","1","4","10 February 2007"," A perfect final for a perfect story. Totally underrated
","I heard and read lots of comments about this movie and how it was awful compared to the first two of the trilogy. Many people seemed not to like it because it completely destroyed the line in which the first two moved. But that was until I saw it.<br/><br/>I didn't expect too much from it, because of all the things that people used to say. But as I was watching it I realised how wrong all those people were. This movie reflects the end of one of the most tragical stories ever told, it shows another vision from the main character, Michael Corleone, who is wonderfully performed by Al Pacino. His life has been all full of something he never wanted. But he carried on with it until the end because it was kind of his responsibility after his father and brother death. But in this film, He appears to really want redemption for all what he has done.<br/><br/>This is one of the things that people like the least from the Godfather III. And I can't understand it. Of course, it would have been easier for Francis Ford Coppola to film another movie with the remaining bad acts from Michael, full of violence and similar to the other two. But this movie gets into the mind of Michael, and shows his inner feelings, that have stayed there forever, ever since he killed his brother. It is one of the most powerful films ever psychologically speaking.<br/><br/>If The Godfather part III had been a continuation of the other two, the trilogy would have been open for more, and it wouldn't have been as perfect as it is, as the three are, all together.<br/><br/>And to talk about the performances, this may be one of the best performed movies ever. Al Pacino offers a masterwork in a grown up moment of his career, with solid speeches, and powerful acting full of emotion and expression, totally one of the best in his career. He amazed me in the final scenes, with the killing of his daughter, he really showed a Shakespearean dramatical performance. Awesome. And Diane Keaton gives the perfect answer to him as the unforgiving ex-wife of Michael Corleone, Kay. Then there is the young actors, such as Andy Garcia, in his early career, sums up with this movie the essence of the Corleone family in just one character, and Sofia Coppola acts really well too, despite all the people who say the opposite.<br/><br/>The story of this movie is so touching that it could make you cry, because it's about a person who has suffered a degeneration because of some external circumstances and after all his life, he apologises for everything, because he wants to die in peace.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not the best one of the trilogy, and maybe the two first were more impacting, specially for that time, and of course I think that The Godfather I or II is the best movie ever, but let's not think that's a good reason to say this isn't a great one too. It's the closing to the story of Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, I can understand that it didn't won any Oscar and all that stuff, but no one should think this is a bad movie, cause it's a must-see for everyone interested and it's probably one of the most underrated films in history (obviously it had a hard work to do, due to the quality of the first ones). It's unthinkable from my point of view, to see the two first parts of the Godfather without seeing this one, just to complete them, as totally perfect as they are."
"critical-escapist","9","1","4","7 February 2006"," The 70's vs. the 90's: Different time, different motion picture
","Before I saw The Godfather: Part III, I read many negative reviews (except for Roger Ebert's) about it and I had my mind set on watching a horrid movie because I was such a fan of the first two. But I was surprised: It wasn't as bad as everyone said it was and just because it wasn't good as the first two (The Godfather was made in the 1972 and The Godfather: Part II was made in 1974) this last installment of the ""trilogy"" serves the whole saga some justice because it gives a nice deliverable ending to two cinematic masterpieces.<br/><br/>The film begins with a haunting memory of the Tahoe estate. Then cuts into Michael being honored by his church and mirroring a celebration of the first two parts. (but held indoors!)<br/><br/>When Anthony (D'Ambrosio) tells Michael he wants no part in the family business and wants to pursue a life in music, Michael reluctantly agrees. <br/><br/>But then pops the alternative: Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) comes in with the support of his own of Connie, Michael's sister (Talia Shire) to meet Michael. He is the illegitimate son of Sonny, Michael's brother and he tells Michael that Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) has been bad-mouthing him behind his back. Vincent, like his father, has a temper and is prone to doing things without thinking. He wants to join Michael and leaves Zasa so Michael takes Vincent in, reluctantly.<br/><br/>The main plot in the film is actually quite confusing and I don't know if I'll fully explain it in the correct terms: Michael wants to buy a company called Immobiliare, which is controlled by the Vatican. Don Altobello, who becomes furious that his mafia would not be included into the deal because of Michael's hunger of being legitimate - he wants to keep the company as legitimate as possible because that has been his ultimate Americanized dream.<br/><br/>There are a few ""subplots"", including the rather disturbing but at the same time I must admit as rather sweet incest romance between Mary (Coppola) and Vincent (Garcia). When Mary approaches Vincent and he tells her to ""Love somebody else"" just breaks my heart for some reason.<br/><br/>Another one that I thought was fantastically written was probably the dialog between Michael (Pacino) and Kay (Keaton). Why? Even though it seemed misplaced (since it was written in later) I thought it would of had been terrific in another film. But too bad, it's already in this film: When Kay comes to Sicily for their son's debut in an opera and Michael is there to finish off the Vatican deal, he shows her around the city and those moments are priceless. These are great actors doing great dialog and the scene where Michael and Kay are both in that room and he tells her he still loves her and she starts breaking down - I think I was going to cry as well. But after thinking about it a while: What happened to the abortion in Part II? (Goodness, he started yelling her and then later slapped her ...) Did it just disappear out of Michael's mind or is this a very different film? And yes, it is a very different film - with flaws that we can just forget and move on with our lives.<br/><br/>The man is suffering  he even has a diabetic stroke in the course of the film. But this is a man who has done evilness.<br/><br/>The acting isn't all as bad people say it is. I want to start off with Sofia Coppola who has received two Razzies for her performance - if it wasn't for those bad reviews I would never had noticed that her acting sucked. My mind just paid attention to her acting - and other than how her voice sounded so unnatural and strange, she wasn't as bad as people say she was. And there's Andy Garcia, who beat out quite a number of people for the role of Vincent and even though he wasn't really deserving of his Oscar-nom, he did quite well adjusting to his character when his character had no development whatsoever (I mean, he became Don in just uh - 2 weeks?). There is Talia Shire, who is probably one of the best gems in the film. She is malicious and as sweet as poison and that's why I loved her here. Keaton turns in a mustered-up performance of a Oscar-winner (Annie Hall). And for all the love/hate comments for Al Pacino - he's on top of his game and you know what? He may be the best thing in the whole entire film. The silent scream scene in unforgettable.<br/><br/>So my critique of the film? I think this is *the* film I would be willing to watch again if I was to choose between the three. Why? Because this is my favorite film even though it wasn't the best film (Part II is the best if you asked me). This film is a nostalgic surprise (with one too many flashbacks from the first two) and Francis Ford Coppola (who has admitted he made the film for financial reasons) does a fantastic job. I thought the shots looked more ""modern"" because sixteen years is a lot of time to improvise on skills of film-making which makes a very different motion picture. I think Part III felt more like a Hollywood blockbuster/wannabe Oscar bait. But all in all, it's a very entertaining film (yeah, it may be confusing but still enjoyable).<br/><br/>The Godfather: Part III is also surprisingly funny (""When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart""). I didn't expect that coming!"
"Aditya_Gokhale","6","1","4","20 December 2005"," The Death of Michael Corleone
","After hearing about all the bad reports, I still wanted to see ""The Godfather Part III"", since the great feeling of having watched Part II still lingered! When I started watching, I felt it was kind of disconnected from its predecessors, as is inevitable because of a gap of over 15 years between Part II and Part III.<br/><br/>The story revolves around an aging Michael Corleone making a deal with the Archbishop and others in the Vatican as a step towards going completely legitimate. But as it turns out, they have plans of their own (along with some other people) to swindle him instead. Michael realizes that the more he tries to get rid of his old ways, the more he seems to be sucked right back in! <br/><br/>This is one review which will have to start with its minuses rather than its pluses! <br/><br/>1. It is appalling to see an old, tired, ill Michael Corleone gone all ""soft""! Also, he is no more the brooding, cold, calculating, heartless Michael we've come to know from the later half of Part I and the whole of Part II. Here's a guy who we have always known to not break into a hysterical fit over the death of someone close to him (e.g.'s deaths of Sonny, The Godfather himself and Mama Corleone). He always expressed his grief through his eyes; and always maintained a calm demeanor. Yet, in this movie, he goes completely over the top, insane with grief and screams like hell when his daughter is killed in the end! Not that he is not good in the scene; he is of course, great! But it is rather sad to see a regretful Michael, weeping every now and then! He just seems so weak and helpless.<br/><br/>2. Most of the characters I'd come to love after Part II are missing. One most important character is Tom Hagen! He is sorely missed and I cursed the film-maker for not giving Robert Duvall the salary he wanted and casting him in the role of Hagen again! Instead, Hagen's son makes a small appearance! <br/><br/>3. Andy Garcia has been introduced as Vincent, Sonny's illegitimate son! Personally, I have nothing against Garcia, and he has been good in all his other movies I've seen. But he just didn't seem a good fit here! He tries too hard, is short tempered like his father Sonny, but the whole thing just doesn't work for him! I am surprised he got an Oscar nomination! <br/><br/>4. And about Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary...the less said the better! <br/><br/>5. This is a sequel that rips some scenes off from the first and second movies.<br/><br/>For example, there is a function in the beginning and Johnny Fontane makes an appearance to sing a song! <br/><br/>Then there is Michael telling Santino's illegitimate son Vincent, ""Never let anyone else know what you're thinking"" (reminds one of the same thing said to Santino by Don Vito in Part I). <br/><br/>The scene of the killing of Joe Zasa looks like a cheaper imitation of the killing of Don Fanucci from Part II! Both killings take place during a festival.<br/><br/>Then the arrangement of a meeting with the members of other families, ""to make peace"": again a reminder of the powerful meeting scene where Don Vito makes peace with the heads of the other families, from Part I.<br/><br/>Now the few pluses: <br/><br/>1. Acting from Al Pacino. He is now old, weak and sick, so he doesn't appear to be anything like the Michael we have known from Part II. Still, a great actor that he is, he does justice to what the script demands of him; although I would still have loved to see his ruthless old self! Acting from Talia Shire: she is good as the old Connie who is always by Michael's side.<br/><br/>2. The climax scene at the Opera. This is one scene that is reminiscent of the brilliance of the first two parts. Wonderfully directed! <br/><br/>3. The final scene of the death of Michael Corleone. I have to admit, it was very sad to see him die alone. That is a very powerful scene indeed.<br/><br/>This movie is actually quite watchable and a fairly decent film, if watched as a stand-alone after possibly changing its name! But as a part of The Godfather series, it appears highly pale in comparison to the first two parts, and hence loses points.<br/><br/>If only Coppola would've at least tried to come close to the greatness of Part II...<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"rclark07","9","1","4","5 December 2005"," good movie
","God Father III had a lot different style then the first two. Probably because it was set twenty years later. I really loved the insight and thought put into it. There was a lot more music and a softer dialog. I think what made the movie was Michael getting older he actually looked more like a mobster. He was more reasonable in this move then the last two, he seemed wiser. He was looking for redemption in his life. I'm not sure if Andy Garcia was a good replacement to take over. I think he fit in well though. The daughter wasn't a very good actress. She didn't seem like she fit in this move. All in all I think it was a really good ending to an awesome trilogy. The music was awesome. I especially liked Brucia La Terra. I recommend this move to anyone but you have to see the I and II first. Michael dressed incredible in this part."

"gws-2","8","1","4","25 September 2005"," Underrated
","I agree with the sentiment expressed by others that ""The Godfather III"" is an underrated film. I suggest that the primary reason for its having been underrated was Francis Ford Coppola's unfortunate decision to cast his then 19-year-old daughter, Sophia, in the pivotal role of Mary Corleone. Sophia Coppola had neither the charisma nor the acting chops for such a role, which made her scenes painful to watch. Nevertheless, the movie was outstanding in most other respects, I believe.<br/><br/>The closing scenes are mostly cuts between an opera and a series of assassinations. This was a good choice, because the story, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is highly operatic  and it works. Although ""The Godfather III"" is certainly not in a class with the first two films of the Godfather Trilogy, which were two of the best films ever made, it is still a fine movie.<br/><br/>The film was made at an early enough stage in Al Pacino's career that he did not consistently overact as he has done to his detriment in too many roles since. There is nobody better than Pacino when he exercises restraint, as he did here in his portrayal of Michael Corleone. The other members of the large cast, other than Sophia Coppola, were uniformly effective, too, particularly Diane Keaton, as Michael's long suffering ex-wife and the mother of his children. <br/><br/>""The Godfather III"" is a worthy concluding entry in the Godfather Trilogy. Highly recommended, 8 out of 10."
"hutchinson_3","7","1","4","23 September 2005"," Not as great as the first two, yet still a profound movie.
","The Gofather series is of course arguably one of the most influential and captivating works of contemporary art. The first two in the series hardly need to be spoken for with regard to their magnificence. The third one however, I feel, needs someone to stand up for it. It is the younger brother who only played college ball while its brother played professional, for lack of a better analogy.<br/><br/>The Godfather part 3, at first glance, is just a poor sequel which was meant to appease hardcore fans, make money, and start off some careers. Yet, if you really look at the 'summary' of all the Godfather conflicts that were put into this movie, you will see that it is just as artistic as the first two.<br/><br/>Michael is a hero. A hero whose life ends in tragedy. His fatal flaw is the ability to understand the nature of good versus evil. To elaborate on that further, Michael understands that he must sacrifice his peace and plans for the future to save his family. This of course will take sacrifice, what he fails to understand is, that good conquering evil will always come with a price, and that sometimes it is hard to distinguish the two. That will seal his doom.<br/><br/>Michael cannot differentiate between what is right and what is wrong while he doing the right thing. Telling God that he will sin no more if he is let out of the business, then handing the wheel over to a man who he knows will commit great acts of violence, is, I'm afraid to say, committing a sin. He also fails to realize that killing your brother who was just stupid, is probably not gonna look good on God's account. Many other instances of synonymous circumstances occur throughout the movies and I doubt I have to elaborate for anyone who has seen them.<br/><br/>Michael fails to see, that after many of his loved ones death, he still did his job well, he saved his family, but doomed himself for not listening. And it is understood in the end that he dies alone, hating God, hating life, hating all that he did for he thinks he failed.<br/><br/>All in all, the Godfather 3 is actually a damn good movie, which sums up all of the points the first two did not make emphatically clear. I suggest that if you find this movie to be bad and your a fan of the series , to watch it again and look for all the summaries."

In parts I and II you are cheering for the guy who's breaking his way to the top, in III he's at the top, and has seen the errors of his ways, so he wants to make things better. It's because he wants to make things better that people don't like this film.<br/><br/>If you liked parts I and II you probably won't enjoy this as much.

","I remember seeing THE GODFATHER III a couple of months after it was released on VHS and being completely mesmerized by it. I actually had my reserveations, thinking what many of us here though at the time:""How can Coppola TOP the previous installments?"" He did not top them, but he certainly was VERY close. Several years passed and I bought the DVD trilogy, but before I could get to watch GODFATHER III, some local TV channel aired it, and I couldn't help but watching it, albeit, not totally focused and incomplete. Somehow, the movie didn't grasp me this time around. A couple of days later I decided to watch it with my wife, on DVD and give it another chance. How wrong was I! The magic that unfolded when I first saw it came back like a hammer blow. I remembered something that I already knew: You have to watch these films with total attention to fully appreciate them. The lack of continuous action packed scenes may discourage some people, but then again, when the action scenes appear, they are over the top. THE GODFATHER III is set some 16 years after the ending of GODFATHER II. Michael Corleone is still trying to make his empire, ""Legit"" and his desire to shed the blood of his enemies has greatly diminished. We get to see most of the original cast, although Tom hagan's character (played wonderfully in the first movies by Robert Duvall) is sadly absent. It's never mentioned, but it appears that he died during the 70's. Michaels two children are now young adults. Andy Garcia is introduced as Sonny Corleone's bastard son, Vincent Mancini. His performance has yet to be outdone by himself! He is simply superb as the future heir to the Corleone Empire. Michael, in his attempt to go legit, strikes a deal with ""immobiliare"", the Vatican Bank. This deal will make the Corleones as respectable as the Rockefellers. As Michael tries to get this deal done, he faces new enemies who don't want him to run ""immobiliare"". The circumstances force Michael to adopt his old ""Mafia Warfare"" tactics, although he does it hesitantly. THE GODFATHER III is just as complex and richly textured as the other two movies...even the film quality has that ""grainy"" aspect that makes you think it was really filmed fight after last picture. Al Pacino's performance is more subdued in this one, but that's because his character is an Old Mafioso looking to redeem himself. The anger and fury of young Michael is present in Vincent (Andy Garcia). The ending is tragic and while it not may please everyone (it leaves many lose ends in the air)it's decent finale to what's possibly the most highly revered film trilogy in history."

","How can anyone recommend The Godfather Part Three? It is absolute pants. The Party Scene at the very beginning of the Movie is so long winded I had to fast forward with my Samsung DVD remote. Also, why make Michael Corleone appear so weak (both physically and psychologically)? It hurt to see this once great Character deteriorate in such a way. Al Pacino's 'oh lets use violence as a last resort' Character is baloney, pathetic and annoying. And why is almost half the film (I'm obviously exaggerating) spent on trying to make Opera seem appealing to the masses? It's so boring (the Opera and the Film). The last major scene of the Movie drained the life out of me - it was that bad. The only part of the film which made me emotional was the very last scene. I hope Godfather 4 goes back to the roots of the first two Godfather Movies i.e ruthless Empire building with a touch of character development."
"Steeldealer","5","1","4","31 January 2002"," Ultimate letdown...
","People often criticize Sofia Coppola when discussing this film. Rightly so. She goes from mediocre to terrible depending on the scene.<br/><br/>
However, this film could still be great if that was it's only flaw. I just watched all three nearly consecutively in about a 24 hour period.<br/><br/>
First, the cast. Robert Duvall is gone. His character is gone for reasons possibly unexplained, although I think there was a hint that he had died of a heart attack. His role as the consiglierie taken by...George Hamilton. He's actually not bad but he just looks and seem out of place, probably through no fault of his own. Sofia Coppola, a beautiful girl if she would give Karl Malden his nose back, is just incapable of pulling the emotionally complex scenes off. She's fine in the less demanding scenes, making previous claims that hers is the worst performance in cinema history invalid. Crispin Glover couldn't handle ANY scene in ""Rivers Edge""...but I digress... Replacing 1970s Al Pacino is the modern Al, incapable of subtle, nuanced performances. So, he sets to shouting...often. Then you have Diane Keaton. A pretty woman who still has never been attractive a day in her life. While watching this movie, I finally solved this enigma. She finds the worst hairdos any woman could possibly wear. Dear God, help this woman. She's fine though, doing what she can with the one-note character of Kay who was poorly written even in the first two Godfather movies. Then you have Andy Garcia. He has two facial expressions and two tones of voice. The expressions are ""ridiculously goofy grin"" and ""deadpan"". The tones of voice are ""screaming"" and ""deadpan"". I was always impressed with him in ""When A Man Loves A Woman""...now that I think of it, I was impressed with Meg Ryan. Joining George Hamilton in the category of decent actor looking hopelessly out of place is Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna. Neither is very convincing either, though seemingly through no fault of their own.<br/><br/>Then you have the plot. Some mumbo-jumbo about double crosses and triple crosses with the only original or fresh concept being the involvement of the Catholic Church and the Vatican. There's a ridiculous part where a helicopter attacks a room filled to the brim with mob bosses. I asked myself why it wouldn't have been much easier in every way to just plant a bomb. Then I realized that Andy and Al couldn't have escaped from that. The scene looks like it was shot for about twelve dollars. You only see one shot of a portion of the helicopter for a second. There's also the trouble with Talia Shire. She does do a credible job. But her character is VERY different from the Connie we knew from the first two films. Plus her make-up is bad. She has age make-up and her neck always looked perfectly smooth...except for three wrinkles that were all perfectly straight. They looked like gills...<br/><br/>There are a lot of great things about this film. The music is terrific, the locations and cinematography are beautiful, and the hitman in the opera house sequence is riveting. If it was being graded strictly on its own merits, I would probably think more highly of it. But the fact remains that this film falls victim to its own legacy.<br/><br/>I think the worst thing about the film is the frequent flashbacks to the first two films. Possibly the producers were hoping to cash in on any good will we feel towards those two masterpieces. All it succeeds on doing is reminding me how inferior the film really is to it's two superior predecessors.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is Martin Scorsese's mom. She's adorable for the fifteen seconds she was in the film. Of course, all that did was remind me I could be watching ""Goodfellas""...<br/><br/>Scale of 1 to 10...? It's a 6..."
"GreenHornet69","5","1","5","17 June 2018"," Unfortunate
","As much as it pains me to say so, given this is one of ""The Godfather"" titles, this film is an unfortunate bookend to an otherwise timelessly classic, beautifully written, impeccably acted, and hauntingly filmed saga. The storyline should have ended with the time-jumping, prequel flashbacks which filled in the rich backstory of the Corleone family in The Godfather: Part II.
I rated The Godfather: Part III a six (6) star rating based on the films lineage.
Also, I gave the film an additional rating star for each of the actors reprising their respective roles and given their acting linage. (This is not a one to ten rating of the actors themselves--only additional start ratings for them film itself): one (1) star for Al Pacino, one (1) star for Diane Keaton, and one (1) star for Talia Shire.
For the storyline a negative two (-2), and for associating itself with the first two films a negative two (-2); it fell far short of earning the privilege of being one of ""The Godfather"" films.
Alas, it receives a 5/10 rating...a generous gift."

Only the incredibly brave or incredibly foolish would even attempt to touch this series with a ten-foot pole for fear of besmirching either its legacy or their reputation, though this unnecessary epilogue was surely only even attempted for monetary reasons. The insatiable studio was determined to milk this cash-cow with or without the talent that could make it even close to something worthy of its moniker, so perhaps it was best that Coppola and co came on board. Sadly, while it is perhaps better than it could have been and the picture does indeed have a few interestingly inspired moments, the overall effect of the piece is one of total disappointment, leading to an aftertaste of poor writing, bad acting and an utter lack of subtlety that makes you yearn for the first two features again. It almost seems like it's from a different franchise and, while it doesn't quite ruin what came before, you're probably better off not knowing what happens to our mafia-man protagonist once the credits roll on 'Part II (1974)'. 5/10"
"Rahal97","6","1","5","29 December 2016"," Disappointing
","Sure, the movie is pressured because the first two movies are legendary, but let's face it, part III is not nearly as good as the first two movies, it is even a bad movie. This movie ruined The Godfather Trilogy for most viewers and I can understand why. The directing and acting are below average unlike the first two and the plot is not that good. In my opinion Andy Garcia was terrible in his performance so was Sofia Coppola. The Godfather Part III exited the principle concept and idea of The first two movies. It is far from being a movie that emphasizes on the gangster life of the Corleone family.<br/><br/>In conclusion it is bad movie, Al Pacino saved it a little. 5.5/10"
"DarthVoorhees","9","1","5","26 July 2007"," Despite the horrific miscasting of Mary the movie is as chilling as it's predecessors.
","The Godfather films were all morality tales but this chapter is by far the one rooted most in Michael Corleone's perception of good and evil. The Godfather III is more of a psychological thriller than the previous chapters. The story here isn't the Corleones fighting another gang to expand their criminal empire, It's Michael Corleone versus himself. Al Pacino is a master and he delivers a really underrated performance here. This Michael is a tragic character, a man who has felt his sins weigh him down throughout the years and he seeks redemption. Puzo and Coppola put together a brilliant screenplay. It's actually really clever that they tied corruption in the vatican with the mafia. And showing the Church the organization which should be the centerpiece of morality and ethics deal with the evil Mafia is brilliant satire on what the definition of being a good person is.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia is brilliant as Vincent Mancini, the bastard son of Sonny. The Godfather movies have great characters and Mancini is overlooked when compared to the colorful cast of characters from the previous chapters. Mancini like his father is violent and impulsive but when he is teamed with Michael he learns the lessons of deception Michael used to become the man who all most out shined his father.<br/><br/>I all most think Godfather III would have gotten the Best Picture Oscar hadn't Sofia Coppola been cast in it. She's ugly as sin and she reads dialouge like a first time actor. The scenes between her and the great cast are like putting Da Vinci next to a paint by numbers kit. Every cast member in III is excellent except for her. She takes away the fourth star from this movie for me. Winona Ryder wouldn't have been much better but she could at least hold her head above water with Pacino."

","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two ""Godfather"" films, ""The Conversation,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", the third ""Godfather"") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.<br/><br/>Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.<br/><br/>Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).<br/><br/>Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.<br/><br/>My Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"

The Godfather Part III of course, continues Don Corleone's adventures as being a Mob boss. But he wants to venture out of crime and into more business ventures. His main focus, and one which threads this movie, is the acquisition of a huge energy company from the controlling hands of the Vatican.

OK.. fine, I'll jump on the Sofia Coppola bandwagon.. She looks.. strange. And Andy Garcia looks like he's on speed for half the movie! And Diane Keaton... well, let's not discuss that please.<br/><br/>I recall Robert Evans saying that one of the reasons he wouldn't work with Francis Ford Coppola again is that he doesn't know how to edit his films, and when he saw this, he said it was 'pure Francis'.

The acting is good with ONE exception. Al Pacino is solid as Don Corleone, but this is his weakest performance in the trilogy. Diane Keaton is passable as Kay. Andy Garcia is excellent. Talia Shire is good. But Soffia Coppola was absolutely awful. Coppola must have been desparate to put her in.<br/><br/>
Godfather III's strengths are in some of its scenes, which it has two excellent scenes. The Atlantic City Massacre and the Opera Scene, both flawlessly shot.

","Sixteen years after Godfather Part II came out, the third one came out to wrap up the storylines. What ends up happening is a solid movie, but not quite as good as Godfather movie. It doesn't seem like it was the intent of Francis Ford Coppola or Mario Puzo to make this one great, but rather just to complete things. Coppola's direction is strong, but he treats this just like a movie. The script is solid, not exactly as original or brilliant as the first two but relatively strong. Al Pacino offers possibly his best performance as Micheal, a man troubled by his life and a man trying to go legitimate. Unfortunately, things don't quite work out as well and even he says ""Every time I try to get out, they suck me back in."" Diane Keaton is again, miscast as always. To replace Robert Duvall from the first film, and Robert De Niro from the second, Andy Garcia plays a supporting role of major importance to the plot. His unerving performance as the violent and angry Tony earned him an Oscar nomination, which was somewhat deserved. He feels a bit too over- the- top though and doesn't do the key emotional moments as well as James Cann in Part I did. The technical aspects of this movie don't give it quite the glossy feel of the first two, but rather just a gritty normal crime drama. However, the plots sometimes feels a bit jumpy, the connections between characters still unclear and the violence too overdone. It's a solid movie, but not really that good of a Godfather movie. 7.5/10"

Both have similarly convoluted plots, both have across the board great acting exept for Diane Keaton in II and Francis Ford's Daughter in III, and III has a beautiful overall plot movement towards the devastating final scene. The Vatican stuff is clearer and more interesting than the cuba stuff from II. Diane Keaton is markedly stronger in this one than in the first two.

","The first two Godfather movies kept you guessing and there was enormous tension and interaction between the players. This time, with Godfather III, the film is slow and the plot feels devoid of imagination.<br/><br/>Don Corleone is a mobster who wants ""out"" of the business and to live a legitimate lifestyle. We're supposed to feel sorry for him. My thought on this is first off, no, I don't feel sorry for murderers, and secondly, so what? You can't base an entire film on saying over and over again how sorry you are. It's boring. Every scene is melodramatic, as though it's going to have more impact if the film is twice as long as it should be. Again, boring.<br/><br/>I think what's happening here is that this film is only for fans, people who loved the first two movies, and know all the characters. It's been a few years for me so I was seeing Godfather III fresh, and it didn't strike me.<br/><br/>Who should see this movie:<br/><br/>-- Fans of the first two, but save it for a rainy day, and you are safe to skip it.

After finally sitting down to watch it, I was glad I did because it was a fitting end to the saga and a fine film in its own right.
Now, I do not feel this film is the same caliber as the first 2. There is a lot missing from this film, but it tells a different story from those movies that I thought was well done. The biggest drawbacks for me are the actors, either some of the roles cast or the lack of characters from the first 2. Robert Duvall is sorely missed (I read somewhere there was a contract dispute and that's why he wasn't involved). Sophia Coppola's performance is not as bad as I heard it was, but it was still no a highlight of the film.

The values of loyalty and family are contrasted with crime and evil acts.<br/><br/>In the final film of the series, Michael Corleone has grown older and the actions of his past begin to haunt him with guilt. Along with losing his family in the previous films, Michael's unhappiness drives him to atone for his sins.

Unfortunately, unlike the other films in the series, Godfather III doesn't stand on its own.

I didn't quite understand his position on the daughter's romance with Vincent, her cousin. The connection to the Catholic Church also seemed a bit forced, as if it had been snapped on in the script. Al Pacino has remained up to the challenge and managed to perfectly display the psychological contradictions of his character.

","This movie is really good contrary to the comman belief that this is not the good film. Just omit and see the movie... This is the best end of the trilogy.... Don't go for negative review... Cheers<br/><br/>Excerpt from Wikipedia:<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, and directed by Coppola. It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire. The film also interweaves a fictionalized account of two real-life events into its plot: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981–1982; both are linked to Michael Corleone's business affairs. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García, and features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.<br/><br/>Coppola and Puzo originally wanted the title to be The Death of Michael Corleone, but Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable. Coppola subsequently stated that The Godfather series is two films, and Part III is the epilogue. Part III received mixed to positive reviews compared to the critical acclaim that the first two films received. It grossed $136,766,062 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture."

","The violent history of the Corleone crime family did conclude on an ideal note in The Godfather Part II but thanks to the unquenchable greed of studio executives plus the dire circumstances director Francis Ford Coppola found himself in during that time, what was until then a perfectly flawless motion picture saga ultimately got tainted by a highly inferior third instalment, which wasn't even needed in the first place.<br/><br/>Continuing the story of Michael Corleone, The Godfather Part III finds the aging & guild-ridden Mafia kingpin seeking ways to legitimise his criminal empire and has slowly distanced himself & his family from the underworld, over the years. But his efforts to come out clean is thwarted when an assassination attempt made on his life begins a new era of bad blood between different families. Meanwhile, the Don takes a young protégé under his wing.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who unfortunately lost every single creative brain cell of his during the making of Apocalypse Now, The Godfather Part III packs in a pretty weak story and while it manages to replicate the look of its predecessors, it lacks the precision care, passion & dedication with which the first two instalments were brought to life for the screenplay that Coppola co-wrote with Mario Puzo simply lacks the same level of intensity, tenaciousness & quality.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are finely executed to match the ambiance of the previous two films, as evident in its gorgeously detailed set pieces, shooting style, colour tones as well as numerous references to earlier chapters. At 162 minutes, it has the shortest runtime of the three yet is the most difficult to sit through for much of its plot is nothing but plodding and could've benefited from a bit more trimming in the editing room. And the soundtrack by Carmine Coppola only makes use of the previously used tracks and for the most part, stays within its realms.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, Eli Wallach, Sofia Coppola & others and while the reprising cast is able to impress once again, the new members fail to leave a lasting mark. Pacino does amazingly well for the most part and he's brilliantly supported by the well-balanced inputs from Shire & Keaton. Garcia is the best of the new cast yet he's easily overshadowed by the mere presence of the veterans. Wallach chips in with welcome contribution, And the director's daughter commits career-suicide by delivering an awfully terrible performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Godfather Part III gets a lot of flak for leaving a dent on what could've been an unblemished cinematic legacy but it's not really as bad as it is made out to be. In fact, it's quite an underrated cinema for it has its share of interesting moments but then, none of it was ever required. Coppola has himself stated that The Godfather series is two films with this one serving as an epilogue, and that pretty much sums up his opinion about this chapter. Lacking commitment in direction, severely marred by lack of depth & refinement in its screenplay, and further brought down by underwhelming work from its cast, The Godfather Part III is somewhat under-appreciated but it's also unworthy of its title."

","The Godfather: Part III takes place many years after Part II. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone a.k.a The Godfather is older, wiser and better than before. His nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), who he takes under his wing, is irrational and short-tempered, just like his father (Sonny Corleone, as played by James Caan in Part I). Part III sees Michael trying to correct the wrongs and wipe away his sins. III should've been filmed shortly after II. Time has sapped The Godfather's intensity. Pacino and Garcia are on top form. This film's success is partly down to the others. A fine film in its own right but one that will never reach the heights of its predecessors."

","The Godfather Part III (1990) isn't the best film in the series like were the first two. This film should be release in 70's like the first two were, but it was released in 90's. This film still has some moments but is not that good just like the first two films were.<br/><br/>Real Power Can't Be Given, It Must Be Taken.<br/><br/>Some 16 years after Part II, The Godfather Part III brings us into the 1970's as an aging Michael Corleone has had enough of the family business as it was and wants to go legit. But other heads of New York families don't see it that way and he is forced to deal with his nephew, Vincent (Andy Garcia) who like his father (the late Sonny) wants to shoot first and ask questions later. Meanwhile Connie supports Vincent in his old school ways as she tries to sway Michael to stay firm on the old ways of the family. The subplot of the Vatican's interest in the Corleone family and the trails & tribulations of such offer a glimmer of purity for Michael or better yet his darkest fears. Godfather III never basked in the glory of Parts I & II, simply because it tried to hard to be just as perfect. Part III does have a solid story and great performances, but it just doesn't quite live up to expectations. Bottom line not quite the best swan song to the legacy of this series, but nonetheless a good effort by all involved.<br/><br/>The third act isn't the greatest film like, were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like the first two, and it suffers further by comparison to ""Goodfellas,"" which came out just a few weeks before it. But ""Part III,"" was still one of the best movies of its year (1990), thanks in large part to a devastating and necessary ending: Up to this point, Michael Corleone's evil had never been repaid with adequate suffering. And the King Lear-like climax on the steps of the opera house in Sicily, punctuated by Michael's mostly silent scream, provides a legitimately Shakespearean finish to the saga.<br/><br/>What everyone knows about the film is that, at the last minute, Winona Ryder dropped out of playing the key role of Michael's daughter Mary Corleone and director Francis Ford Coppola unwisely replaced her with his own daughter, Sofia, who wasn't a trained actress. It showed. As an actress, Sofia is bland and whiny, though in her favor, it must be said that she seems much like the spoiled princess that Mary is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Part III"" has much else to recommend it: A thrillingly chaotic, completely unexpected shootout in a rooftop meeting room in Atlantic City, an equally well-staged bloodbath at the Little Italy street fair the Feast of San Gennaro, an intriguing conspiracist take on the events at the Vatican in 1979 (when three popes presided within a span of two months) and several more classic lines of dialogue added to the canon.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, and directed by Coppola.

The only thing I disliked was the way they've ended the trilogy... in the stairs of the opera. The end was a bit forced, but is great at the same time. Al Pacino did a good job, as well as Andy Garcia- Vincent is a great character! As we all know, Copolla is a genius, but I felt the story was a strange continuation, unnecessary. But it still good!

"murtazaawsome","6","0","1","28 August 2015"," As an individual, the film holds its own but as a sequel. It lost its identity.
","The Godfather Part 3 coming out in 1990, starring the likes of Al Pacino, Andy Garcia and Talia Shire is a commendable effort by the director legend Francis Ford Coppola. The film undoubtedly delivers a strong punch with exceptional acting, direction and screenplay scoring not one but seven academy award nominations. But as a huge Godfather franchise fan I can't help but feel disappointed. The first two films in the series are the hallmarks of the golden era of Hollywood. Especially The Godfather part II in my opinion is one of, if the not the Best cinematic wonders ever achieved. But then comes the part III in the sequence. There are so many points on which comparison can be drawn but let's just focus on the biggest one. The character of Don Michael Corleone. Michael Corleone the youngest of three sons of Don Vito Corleone succeeds his father's Huge underworld empire to become the next Mafioso Don of the entire States. He leads a dual life, one as the head of an immense empire and the other of a family man. His character is shown (in the first two films at least) as a very intelligent yet quite man who has an obvious aura of unquestionable power and authority. He seldom raises his voice or displays extremes of emotion e.g. anger or sadness. But when he does, you can not help but be awed. This completely changes or rather, Disappears in the third installment of the series. Michael Corleone who have aged considerably since, and is a father of two grown up teens, also divorced, is an unrecognizable man. The same person who once was a stone hearted, cold blooded killer and the head of a ruthless gigantic empire is now.. reduced, to an old man. Who can not seem to get a grip on his own family and ever slowly crumbling empire. The personality of this man is now utterly different, he openly celebrates with his comrades, dances around, laughing/crying publicly and even confessing to his previous sins! This to me was the most disappointing point of the entire film as I can not seem to find a single shard of similarity between the character of Don Michael Corleone of the first two Godfather films and the Don Michael Corleone of the Godfather Part III. The man who was so reserved and self-contained now seems to me to be the precise opposite. And let me clarify that age CAN NOT be an excuse in this case as such a huge change in personality does not occur in a lifetime let alone 20/30 years. As stated earlier that people watching part III of the installment without prior knowledge of the other two will enjoy it immensely, but die-hard fans like me can't help but be saddened. Thank you."

"Maladjusted_1","7","0","1","9 July 2015"," A nostalgic but insufficient send-off for the Corleone Family.
","I watched 'The Godfather: Part III' the day after watching the preceding film, and anticipated a disaster given the poor reception of the title. As a standalone film it isn't so bad, but it is constantly loomed over by the two colossal previous instalments. From the first scene, the nostalgia is palpable: the social mingling and musical accompaniment (by Al Martino's Johnny Fontane, even) is characteristic of the 'Godfather' films, but is neither as grandiose nor as well-performed in this title. The wedding scene at the beginning of 'The Godfather' is probably one of the best-constructed scenes in film history, but the get-together in 'Part III' is a hollow piece of retrospection. This ""exhausted nostalgia"" may have been in part intentional, reflecting the passage of time between the second and third films, and the tolls exacted on the understandably exhausted characters. This passage of time feeds into another of my criticisms of 'The Godfather: Part III': I'm not keen on the very modern setting. I'm aware that if Michael Corleone is seen in 1959 in adulthood, logic dictates that by 1979 – when 'Part III' occurs – he'll be in his fifties or sixties. Therefore, Coppola couldn't escape setting it in the late seventies, I guess, but it just doesn't seem right for 'The Godfather'. The post-war setting of the first film which smoothly carried into the late fifties setting in the second film seems natural and appropriate; the portrayal of young Vito in the second film, set largely in the 1920s, is excellent. Michael Corleone's arrival at 1980 just seems anachronistic, bizarrely. I wonder if the producers tried to steer away from the late seventies in this title, for I noticed that the heavy focus on settings such as Sicilian villages, grandiose Vatican complexes and luxurious dining halls removed many of cultural traits of the 1970s. The timeframe of the film isn't enough to deter a fan, though, as there are scenes in 'Part III' that stand competently in their own right: one such scene was an exchange between Pacino and Eli Wallach in the back of a car, and this carried the atmosphere and profoundness that defined the earlier films. Wallach is one of the highlights of this film, but I can't say that I enjoyed the cast half as much as I enjoyed the first two films'. 'Part II' survived without Marlon Brando: Robert De Niro excellently took care of that. But without Duvall, Brando, Cazale and De Niro, 'The Godfather: Part III' really does seem disembodied and hollow. There are some enjoyable additions in this film, including Andy Garcia and the aforesaid star of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but the spirit imbued in the characters of the first two films seems to have stayed away here. I won't address the plot in great detail, as there are many synopses and summaries available, but it is largely framed around Michael Corleone's attempts to legitimise his business by acquiring the Vatican's lucrative shares in a European real estate company, International Immobilare. Of course, in the world of Francis Ford Coppola, nothing is simple, and Corleone finds himself unenthusiastically thrown into the mix with shady Vatican officials, swindling businessmen and rival gangsters. Whilst the main plot was decent enough (if a little underwhelming for a grand finale), it's the subplot that I take particular issue with. It comes in the form of a romance between the characters of Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola, and it simply cheapens the film. Think ""Anakin and Padmé"" ('Star Wars') instead of ""Romeo and Juliet"", and you'll get why I'm cynical of its inclusion. This subplot starkly contrasts with the relationship of Michael and Kay in 'The Godfather', as this latter romance scarcely dominated the screen, for there were much more riveting things happening. This perceptive selection of what to include and what to leave as implicit helped to distinguish 'The Godfather' as one of the greatest films of all time; unfortunately, Coppola seemed to have partially forgotten his masterpiece-creating formula. To conclude, 'The Godfather: Part III' is a necessary conclusion for anyone who appreciates the unparalleled intrigue of Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, but this third instalment largely serves as a protracted piece of nostalgia: where the final flashback in 'The Godfather: Part II' asks, ""Remember the good times?"" this film simply asks, ""Remember?"" I've read criticisms that the film was released as a cash cow, but I'm not so cynical. There would have undoubtedly been a financial incentive, but I think that 'Part III' was largely a conclusive goodbye to the Corleone Family, designed with good intentions. Coppola seemed to be aiming for the effect that Eastwood would more successfully create with 'Unforgiven', orchestrating a dignified send-off for an iconic but now aged character/series."

","The Godfather is raved as being the best movie ever made. It's sequel is arguably better. Sixteen years after Pacino made his biggest captivation in The Godfather Part II, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo reunite to create a third instalment of the two greatest mob movies ever filmed. The Godfather Part III is raved as being one of those movies that's the worst in the series. That's true, just because the first two are better. Coppola has not done a true masterpiece since Apocalypse Now in 1979. Instead, he has done what I like to call ""near masterpieces."" This is is one of them. Even if this was a real masterpiece, I doubt this would have surpassed or been at the level of the first two. The very first one was adapted from Puzo's novel and the second one was half an adaptation and half new work. The main reason why the non-adapted stuff in Part II was because it was so close and fresh off from the first. If they did not wait almost twenty years for a third instalment, then Part III probably would have been better. But honestly, who expected it to be at the level of the first two?<br/><br/>Twenty years after splitting with is wife Kay (Keaton), a soon-to-be retired Michael Corleone (Pacino) is being honoured by the Catholic Church for his great contribution. Right before retiring, he wants to legitimize his family by making it non-mob related. Right as the family starts to become normal, Michael is sucked back by his nephew (Garcia) who wants to be the new Don where they must deal with a massive conspiracy by the Vatican.<br/><br/>Pretty much the only flaws I found were Pacino's hairdo (just kidding) and Andy Garcia romancing with cousin, Sofia Coppola. Other than that, the movie is great. After almost twenty years, Coppola and Puzo put together a 3-hour work of excellence. The story is great, acting is top-notch thrills are massive. This may not be as good as the first two, but I think it still stands well by their side.<br/><br/>4/4"

"raphaklopper","10","0","1","19 October 2013"," Part 3 of the BEST movie ever made (here is the review from parts 1-2-3 together)!
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word ""perfection""? Well, ""The Godfather"" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.<br/><br/>While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.<br/><br/>As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.<br/><br/>The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely ""perfect"" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.<br/><br/>But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the ""American Dream""; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .<br/><br/>Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes ""The Godfather"", the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10"

","This third and last was by far the most stimulating part of The Godfather trilogy, you watch in the manner of a dog does while someone is eating that piece of meat at the dinner table, you just couldn't take your eye off the screen. I imagine the communication between the cast members and the director was energetic, by observing the interaction between the actors you can't help but to think about how organized and coordinated this has been made by the Coppola. The screenwriters introducing a character that hasn't appeared on screen until this third part, its Sonny Corleones son, Vincent Mancini, Vincent is a ill-tempered, emotionless character who wants nothing else than to work with Michael, as his father, he is very impulsive which mostly leads to trouble. I'm not sure if either Vincent was written like this or if the actor himself created this version of him, however, i didn't feel like Andy Garcia could live up to his role, he extremely violent at the start but later as he climbs to the throne he becomes this calm and careful individual which to me didn't seem so imaginable. <br/><br/>The ongoing events towards the end that sync up with the music from the orchestra fits perfectly along with the situations that we observe, to me it felt like using all different kinds of puzzles that didn't come from the same box but still fits elegantly. Brilliant and creatively done by the editors. <br/><br/>From what i have noted, it is that the further in we follow Michael throughout the trilogy the dark it gets for him, he is accepting more and more responsibility which puts everyone he cares for in danger, his violence and decisions is affected by his age, but he only does what he thinks is best for his family which could very well be the worst. You could speculate if there is any moral of the whole story, because of all the bad things he has ever done in his life, he had to grow old and outlive most of his young family members, maybe the moral of the story is, that crime never pays and you reap what you sow. It could be a lesser percentage that would agree that Michael becomes more entertaining to observe the older he becomes, he open up his tough exterior and we stumble on a regretful old man who just wish he could take it all back just to keep his family safe, or, even burn.. in hell."

","The third and final film of Coppola's Godfather series ends with a bang. It holds up really strong within the trilogy and I feel currently is underrated. Before seeing this film I thought this film wouldn't hold up as everybody seems to say that The Godfather Part III is horrible or lackluster. I completely disagree as I feel this film is incredibly strong. Yes the film doesn't have that feeling of a period film because it isn't. It's more contemporary and I think it's a great way of seeing these characters in a new era.<br/><br/>The point of the film is to show that Michael is trying to become a better person and trying to make his business legitimate leaving the ways of corruption and murder behind. But just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in; I just couldn't resist. The reason the old film felt a bit lackluster for me is that there are too many new characters introduced and those characters aren't as interesting as the ones in this film. The characters in this film do feel new but most are just older versions of themselves from the first film or second film. The main focus, even though there are other things going on like romance and revenge, is Michael looking for redemption as he has regretted everything that he has done. There is a lot of reflecting of the past in this film, like about Fredo or what Vincent and Mary's discussion about their fathers or when Kay and Michael was in Sicily. These moments were enjoyable. In comparison to the second film, I preferred this one as I found it to be more entertaining to follow.<br/><br/>Coppola returning for a third film is risky as for years people have seen Michael Corleone as a horrible man. So the decision of restoring his image to the public and family is very risky but I think it paid off as I think it gives the saga a better closing. The film goes back to the strengths of the first one and keeping it linear. Coppola did a great job in concluding the saga and will be regarded, at least by me, as a classic.<br/><br/>Gordon Willis did the photography for the Godfather trilogy but since this film is set in a more contemporary era then that style that was found in previous films is now gone. The film is still shot well with moments that are beautiful, in particular Sicily, but this really is more about the characters rather than capturing something unique and daring. The film's photography definitely isn't as strong as the original but it's appropriate to the film's setting and story.<br/><br/>Instead of Nino Rota being the composer of the film, it's now Carmine Coppola. Carmine has worked on the first two of the Godfather films but his role was minor. Nino Rota died a few years after the second Godfather film, but his work is still found in this film. I felt that Carmine Coppola did not deliver that same level as Nino Rota did as it was a little underwhelming and never creates a sense of presence but his score does fit well with the film and does his best to fill in Rota's shoes.<br/><br/>Acting again like the previous films is top notch. Another brilliant performance from Al Pacino showing off vulnerability that was rarely shown in previous films. Andy Garcia felt like a reminder of James Caan's Sonny but making it his own and adding a more unique personality to it. It was great to see Eli Wallach in films, as the films I have seen him in were always vicious, here he is a little more soft but still retains that viciousness in a subtle way. Keaton and Shire were great in playing stronger women in a time where Michael is vulnerable. Sofia Coppola was not spectacular but she did her part fine, chemistry between her and Garcia wasn't at the level of Pacino and Keaton but passable. Good thing that she chose to be a director rather than an actress.<br/><br/>Great ending to the trilogy supported by a strong script, great direction, decent photography and score and fantastic performances. It is definitely along with Coppola's finest work and should not be dismissed."

Nothing here is attractive or appealing to Gangsta Wannabes or those looking for some sort of Pulp presentation.<br/><br/>This is an unwelcome but necessary conclusion if anything remotely resembling Reality is to be part of its conceit. All the Money and Power in the World cannot sanitize the corruption that is the foundation of the ""Family"" and the Church.<br/><br/>An underrated Movie with a willing Cast and sumptuous Production. This was not an easy thing to pull off and it works on the level of Conclusion. Nothing happens here that could be considered a Fairy Tale ending. It is an ending to a Film Trilogy and as Entertainment cannot compete with the first two Movies. As a stand alone it would be unbearably gloomy and sardonic, but as a Final Act to the Opera that is The Godfather it is not only satisfying it was inevitable."

","Watching this movie for the first time turned out to be an unexpected treat. The main cast consisted of Michael and Kay--Al Pacino and Diane Keaton returning some 16 years later as a middle aged couple who are now divorced. Keaton has had it with the Corleone family and Michael, now suffering from severe diabetes and heart trouble, wants to wind up his bloody days and make peace with his rivals. Talia Shire, as Michael's sister Connie, has become Michael's personal assistant and care-giver. Eli Wallach performs the role of family elder who encourages Michael to let go of the fighting and gang war bloodshed. Andy Garcia gives a superb performance as Vince, the son of brother Sonny and the heir apparent to the ""family business"". Pacino tries to tame the irascible nephew who has learned the family's criminal behaviour all too well. Michael's own son has abandoned his father's wish for him to become a lawyer in favour of becoming an opera star. This career choice takes the whole family on a trip to Sicily for the son's debut. Michael meets the future pope, whose plans for the Vatican Bank are somewhat at odds with the past. Michael hoped to clean up his image by aligning himself with the Vatican Bank. I like how the Vatican intrigue is woven into the movie along with the death of a pope and the election of the new reform cardinal. The locations in both Italy and America are stunning. I found that Keaton and Pacino made an fitting transition as they become the older generation to the children and their cousins. The opera music and the final location in Italy all contributed to the overall pleasure and effect of this very satisfying movie."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","0","2","24 June 2013"," A very good end to one of the best trilogies of them all.
","Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy is one of the most beloved trilogies of all time. Well, at least two-thirds of it is. Most love the first two, and granted, they are works of art. But it's the third one that has many split. I have read that some people have tried to forget about it all together. I will admit that it has its fair share of flaws. But I definitely won't forget about it.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III takes place some time after its predecessor. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still stuck in the life that he never wanted. But now, the past has sort of caught up with him. He's tired of the business, and it's time for a change. Change appears in the form of Vincent (Andy Garcia), Michael's nephew (the bastard son of his brother, Sonny). Vincent is a confident and angry young man, and he seems perfect for the job. But problems arise when Vincent begins dating Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola). Yes, kissing cousins.<br/><br/>There is a side-story involving the pope or something, and I don't quite understand the story there. But there is another side-story involving Michael's son Anthony not wanting to take over the family business. Instead, Anthony wants to be an Opera singer, which sort of ties in with the climax of the film. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Michael's ex-wife Kay, and Talia Shire finally gets to do something as Michael's sister Connie.<br/><br/>It is nice to see some of these characters again, but yet, something doesn't quite feel the same with The Godfather Part III. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is m.i.a. (he is actually dead in the movie, but the character's replacement doesn't get to do anything). The acting isn't quite the same either. With the exception of Keaton and Garcia (who was nominated for an Oscar), nobody seems to be doing their best. Everyone (besides Coppola, will get to that in a second) is good, but they are not up to the standards that they once reached.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are the ones between Michael and Kay. I think that those are really nice, especially since Michael is trying to turn over a new leaf in this one. Also, there wasn't really a second where I was bored throughout. Also, it does tie the series together nicely. Yes, of course it's too long. It's as if it was FFC's goal for the whole trilogy to make each of them long. He nailed it.<br/><br/>Now, to the real flaws. Again, I don't quite understand the plot with the pope and stuff. But what really makes The Godfather Part III suffer is Sofia Coppola. Now, I'm sure that by now, this is probably what stirred up the most buzz about this movie, and you've probably heard about it anyway. Francis Ford Coppola directed a film called Tucker: A Man and His Dream. It was a box office flop, and so he was told that he had to make a commercial hit to make his production company, ""American Zoetrope"". So, he was forced to make a movie he never dreamed of: The Godfather Part III.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder was initially cast in the role of Mary Corleone, but was forced to drop out at the last second. He was sort of running out of time, so he had confidence that his daughter could do the role. Well, she did the role, and it won her two Razzies. Now, here's what's wrong with casting her: For one thing, she isn't an actress. The only movies that were on her resume prior to TG3 was FFC's movies, and they were cameos. But what doesn't help about her lack of experience though is the fact that the character is just annoying. Mary is sort of slutty, naive, and, well, she's supposed to be smart but actually she just comes across as dumb and sort of desperate.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothers me about The Godfather Part III is the fact that Mary and her cousin are dating, and nobody really seems to care. I was expecting Michael to freak out and sort of try and murder Vincent, and it doesn't happen. Instead, he calmly tells Vincent to end it. It just shouldn't have gone down like that. I know that if I was Mary's father I would slap her like Cher did in Moonstruck and tell her to snap out of it.<br/><br/>In the end, The Godfather Part III was nominated for 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, and supporting actor. So, who had the last laugh, TG3 haters? But, that said, it did go home empty handed, and it was the only one in the series not to win Best Picture. Also, despite all of the negative publicity, Sofia Coppola eventually won an Oscar for writing 2003's Lost in Translation. Who really had the last laugh? She sure couldn't act, but at least she found her niche.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III may have been better had Coppola spent more time on it. But I am still happy for what it is. I still think, all flaws aside, that it really is a good movie. With more time, he may have reached potential. Instead, we have a flawed, but very good, movie with great moments. It was nice to see the family in business again. It isn't as good as the first two, but really, what were you expecting? This is a very good conclusion to one of the best trilogies of them all.<br/><br/>A-"

","This one was actually my favorite, and I don't know why the other two are rated so highly while this one was hated.<br/><br/>While the daughter's acting could have been better, I feel it was sufficient for it to get things across.<br/><br/>This one was my favorite, as I felt that it portrayed Michael's tragic downfall incredibly. Here, you also see that nothing went according to plan, as in the end he was even unable to get his son to take over his business. Finally, when he decides to give up the title of Don, his daughter is killed.<br/><br/>I believe the most beautiful yet sad part of the movie was the ending sequence where it flashes all the women he lost in his life and shows him dying alone with his dog. A fitting end of a life a crime. Sad, but a perfect ending to the trilogy."

Even with her bad performance if you actually pay attention to the movie it's a way better movie then your average gangster flick put out there. Andy Garcia puts on a great performance as the newest Don of the family. Vincent Mancini was a bastard child of Michael Corleone's older brother Sonny, so he didn't grow up with the Corleone name.

","The Godfather Part 3 to me should have been named ""the fall of Michael Corleone"" reason being the movie centered on the fall of Michael himself, and how he gained it all but lost everything in the end. The movie is a nice addition to the classic two that came before it in 1972 and 74, but it does not give you the satisfaction of a classic like the others.<br/><br/>Done 16 years after The Godfather part II (1974), this movie is popular for starring Sofia Coppola, whose father Francis Ford Coppola directed this and the first two prequels. Her performance was so captivatingly bad that it was difficult for you not to notice. The good thing is that you will probably be watching it on DVD so you can skip forward any scene she is in, because her presence in the movie and all her lines could have been deleted and the movie will still be good to watch.<br/><br/>The movie stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire who reprise their roles from the first two films as Michael, Kay and Connie. Robert Duvall however refuses to be in the movie due to a salary dispute.<br/><br/>The movie plot takes off in 1979 like 20 years after the end of the second part, with Michael (Al Pacino) old and nearing retirement.<br/><br/>His Children Anthony and Mary grew up with his wife after she got custody when she and Michael divorced. Tony his son did not want to have anything to do with his father's business, this withdrawal by Tony left a gap in the Corleone family and Michael had to mentor his brother's son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) for a role he would have preferably given to Tony. Vincent like his father Sonny was hot tempered and acted before thinking, this led to a dispute between him and Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) who handles some of the Corleone family business interest.<br/><br/>With Michael's life nearing an end he trains his new successor Vincent to take his place but Michael was not prepared for the tragic end to his era as the Godfather, an end that left him alone and with nothing.<br/><br/>The movie was a commercial success, and received mixed reviews. It however didn't win any Academy awards unlike its predecessors who won the Academy Awards of Best Picture during their release and also other notable Academy Awards. This part III got seven nominations among which were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Andy Garcia), Best Cinematography and others.<br/><br/>Al Pacino did well in his acting in this movie but his performance was not as grand as the ones we witnessed in 1972 and 74 were Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor for The Godfather and nominated for Best Actor for The Godfather Part II.<br/><br/>The Godfather trilogy is a nice collection for anyone to own and enjoy.

It draws well from the previous 2, leaving you understanding why it waited 16 years to be made. I loved how it rounded out Michael's destiny after showing how much the years wore on him.

","Like the first two, this movie had a few moments, but as with all sequels, it tends to start to lack. Like the second one, it was difficult to work out the plot, though the characters and their development is quite well done. Also, as with the previous two, the plot is wound up very quickly, with the antagonists all being killed within the final minutes of the movie. It wouldn't be a problem, except that the antagonists were scattered across the world. Also, I really did not understand why they killed the Catholic priest at the end.<br/><br/>Anyway, in this movie, Michael Corleone has moved out of the crime business and is trying to go straight. Unfortunately, pressures from his sister and his nephew, and his enemies, are trying to push him back into it. I guess the theme here is that once you are a criminal, you are always a criminal. In fact, the final ending is quite tragic, but I will not go into too much details.<br/><br/>The interesting thing I found in this movie is how the characters have finally developed. Michael Corleone is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of the world and the eyes of his wife. It opens with him gaining the highest honour that a lay person can receive from the Catholic Church, and this sets the theme for the entire movie. His sister though, who was an innocent housewife in the movie, a promiscuous woman in the second, has become a crime queen. In fact she assassinates somebody in the final moments of the movie, though we are not sure as to why this happens.<br/><br/>Then we have Michael Corleone's son, who has gone the way of his father in the early parts of the first movie. In this scene he refuses to have anything to do with the family business, and in fact, like his father, he drops out of college to pursue what he wants to do. Michael is actually trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his ex-wife, though this never comes through, because even though redemption is there, it is too far for him to get. His pride refuses to let him take it, and pressures from enemies also prevent him from getting there."

","Ah, ""Godfather III"", the ultimate black sheep. So often criticized, so often ridiculed, so consistently beaten into the ground that I was actually pretty reluctant to see it. When two of your favorite movies of all time are followed by some sort of popular running gag it's pretty off-putting, and you fear it will ruin the character's mystique. Unjustly though, because ""Godfather III"" is a very worthy end to this trilogy. Most of what you may have heard is true, but it isn't as bothersome as I thought it would be. Yes, Sofia Coppola couldn't do a decent line delivery to save her life, but at least she isn't really in this thing much. Yes, some returning characters have become completely redundant , but if you leave them out you're stuck with about two original actors (and I'm counting Richard ""Al Neri"" Bright, which is already a stretch). It's flaws just don't weigh up to its merits, that's all I'm saying. ""Godfather III"" carries all the ingredients I loved about its predecessors, it's chock full of memorable scenes and feature some of the best lines in the entire trilogy. The scene where Michael utters the now legendary ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in"" is absolutely magnificent, and there's plenty more where that came from. The finale is pretty mediocre compared to the rest, but the movie immediately wins you back with an incredibly powerful ending scene. No better way to end this trilogy, I'm actually talking about both that scene and the entire movie. Don't believe the hype, this final chapter is definitely worth seeing."

After all, when it is about a sequel, you immediately have expectations of it feeling the same as the previous one(s).<br/><br/>In the case of Godfather and Godfather II, their tone is exactly identical. With only two years between their filming, it is easy to understand that Coppola, Puzo and actors had that same energy going on.<br/><br/>Godfather III was made over 15 years later, so there really is a great gap this time. The actors are older, some of the old faces are gone and new ones have stepped in.<br/><br/>What is the problem of this film? Primarily it is the fact, that it doesn't have that same tone or amount of content that the previous two had. They were frighteningly subtle and documenting. This one is more based on drama and it has more straight-forward storytelling. It really didn't tell you anything you needed to know after the brilliant and wrap-up at the end of Godfather II.<br/><br/>So, is it a bad film?

You can hardly see a moment of excitement in Vito Andolini's face (Marlon Brando in the original Godfather). He plays it chillingly cool, and I think that's the secret ingredient. Al Pacino did the same in the first two parts, but the third installment got out of control somehow, and there is a lot of overacting. It's a pity, because the story is really good, but a tighter direction could have gone a long way further.<br/><br/>I still recommend The Godfather, Part III.

","It shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that the long-awaited end (hopefully) to The Godfather saga doesn't measure up to its predecessors. Francis Coppola accomplished everything he set out to do and, under the circumstances, produced as good a Part III as anyone possibly could, but the fact remains that the movie didn't need to be made in the first place, except of course to help revitalize the sagging career of its director. The new film does nothing to enrich the earlier episodes; too much of it is simply a carbon copy of what worked (because it was fresh) the first (and second) time around. That terrible sense of Mafia ritual is still vivid, but Coppola takes the operatic elements of the story much too literally (especially during the protracted climax), and the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone into a kinder, gentler padrone was a major miscalculation. The film at least provides one memorable performance (a fiery Andy Garcia, playing Sonny Corleone's ambitious bastard son), but the script reads as if it were written under duress, with plenty of incidental plotting but not anywhere near enough momentum."

","The Godfather Part III (Francis Ford Coppola, 1990) is an unnecessary follow-up to the devastating gangster epics that defined the '70s. Al Pacino, who in the intervening 14 years had begun shouting a very lot, returns as Michael Corleone, the mafia don who's going legit - with a little help from the Catholic Church. Also along for the ride is his brother Sonny's non-legit offspring, Andy Garcia, whose unquestioning loyalty just about makes up for his appalling temper - and the fact he's got the hots for his cousin, Michael's daughter (Sofia Coppola). The film begins with a set of sumptuous tracking shots around various unpopulated ruins that suggest this is going to be ""Terence Davies' The Godfather"". Alas, no. Instead, we're pitched into an overambitious story concerning high finance, Papal assassination and moral absolution that dwarfs the curiously uninvolving Garcia-Coppola romance.<br/><br/>Screenwriters Coppola and Mario Puzo strain to make each line a killer - when they're not penning exposition - meaning that the script is clunky and often lacking insight. Take the scene between Corleone and estranged wife Kay (Diane Keaton). ""I don't hate you, Michael"" she says. ""I dread you."" So far, so agreeably unexpected, but they won't shut up - and the resulting exchanges are first over-dramatic and then superfluous. ""I did what I could, Kay, to protect all of you from the horrors of this world,"" he says. Her reply? ""But you became my horror. The children still love you, though. Especially Mary."" Err, great. Mary, for her part, has come in for a bit of flak - some of it deserved. Though the director's daughter has an interesting face and excels during one heartbroken exchange (the ""I'll always love you"" bit), her delivery is often distressingly wooden in a way you rarely see on screen. And while her beau Garcia is unquestionably charismatic, he's also clichéd and dull: if he's his generation's answer to James Caan, perhaps we should rephrase the question. Robert DeNiro was turned down for that part, while Robert Duvall's character was killed off after he asked for $5m and Coppola threatened to write Pacino out of the series unless he settled for $2m less than he wanted. That wrangling - and the director's threat therein - betrays the poverty of vision here, with use of footage from the earlier films suggesting desperation rather than an epic sweep, as well as showing exactly how far Coppola had fallen.<br/><br/>The film isn't a complete write-off, though, boasting a hit-by-helicopter that's utterly unexpected and thus entirely great, some fine individual scenes - like Pacino's confession at the Vatican and his son's performance of the series' famous love song - and that certain brown wood-panelled glossy look unique to these films. It's also rarely dull, moving at a fair clip and balancing plot, action and character drama in the traditional manner. But it's rarely special - and within the context of this trilogy, that's pretty damning."

","Misjudged due to its truthfulness, filmed in 1991, this Godfather is a fitting third film.<br/><br/>It's now the 70's and times have changed since the 1950's hay days of the first two films. Pacino portrays an aged, mellower, ill and haunted man, gone is the steeliness of his youth. Michael Corleone's hair changes colour after his stroke, and there are plenty of character touches added to the older Don, as well as to Talia Shire's Connie Corleone.<br/><br/>Many of the original cast appear which adds to the continuity, a great touch for die hard fans. You can argue that Sofia Coppola was miscast but it may just be because she's not authentically beautiful, sorry, you can't pick your family. Missing is Tom Hagan and George Hamilton as B.J. Harrison fills the gap tolerably. Andy Garcia is excellent as Vincent Mancini, Sonny's illegitimate son.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo take the rounded characters on journey of self realisation. It's a pleasant character study that reflects how we change as we get older. The film gains momentum, building great tension and shock in the third act. However, don't watch expecting the atmosphere, vitality or vigour first two.<br/><br/>These are 1950's remnants in the 70's and all the power on earth can't change destiny."

","For years, people have bashed this film without really understanding it. After watching all three the last few days, this is the logical end to the Michael Carleno story. A lot of the problems with this film have more to do with Paramount playing hard ball on a film they knew would save their year. Why you don't pay Robert Duvall $5 million is beyond stupid. Even with Godfather III being a financial and critical hit, Paramount still had a shake-up not long after that.<br/><br/>People bang on Coppola for casting his daughter in the film. He did cast his sister to play Connie and she turned pretty good. The real problem with the role is how naive the daughter is and no actress was going to be able to salvage the same criticism people had about Kay in the first two films. Expect in Godfather I, Michael told her everything early on what the family business was all about. I think she realized it by the end of the first Godfather that Michael wasn't joking. I guess if the character was more like Michael, it could work, but Connie already filled that part in the film. Knowing the cousins thing was based on Coppola's grandparents lessens the yuck factor, but not by much. It would have been better for Anthony not Vincent to take over and maybe screw some distance cousin by marriage. The reality is the movie needed a love story and a way for Michael to pay for his crimes at the end and this was it.<br/><br/>If anything, the movie does a good job of exploring the many corruptions of the Vatican during this time and giving its own account of what happened to Pope John Paul the First. Coppola can still move the pieces on the chessboard better then anyone else in the game. The other plus is Pacino as Michael. I wish we would have seen more actions that lead to him being wanting redemption and a lot calmer then in part II. Yet, it doesn't take away from him once again owning this role and putting a final dramatic end to one of the greatest villains in cinema. Keaton is again awesome as Kay and the best scenes maybe between her and Pacino. They bring their A games all the time in their scenes and makes you want to see more of them.<br/><br/>All in all, its not the perfect end to the saga, but its still good. Of course, like the Star Wars prequels it suffers from fanboy interpretations of what they wanted and not the reality of how films get made or where the story needs to go. I wouldn't mind seeing a fourth film since Coppola hinted that that Micheal's death is such an long time later then Mary's death, he could be inserted at any time. Still, it might be better to end it here and another crap sequel that Paramount would make without Coppola or the original cast."

","It was never going to be easy for anyone - even the original cast and creative team - to come up with a worthy epilogue to the Godfather saga. What disappoints me most about this film is that there were too many missed opportunities, resulting in a stylish but meandering melodrama that is a far from satisfactory final act.<br/><br/>Inevitably, where established characters have to be played by the same actors, there will be the odd crack to paper over - most regrettably, Tom Hagen's absence due to the failed negotiations over Robert Duvall's fee. Yet even where characters are retained, they bear curiously little resemblance to their younger selves. One of the most compelling aspects of the first instalment was Michael's slow transformation from squeaky-clean war hero into ruthless Mafia don; his reversion to 'good guy' status might have been equally fascinating but is never really explored. Meanwhile, his sister Connie seems to have assumed an uncompromising, matriarchal role quite at odds with the revulsion she displayed at Michael's earlier behaviour. Again, the intervening years alone are all that is offered by way of explanation. <br/><br/>Also, although one can accept that new characters are inevitable, the introduction of Vincent seems both contrived and unnecessary - adjectives that sadly are equally appropriate in describing this film's plot, which takes a great deal of time to unfold into very little. A far more intriguing storyline would have seen Mary murdered earlier in the film (and not just because of Sofia Coppola's lamentable acting) and then focused on a profound dilemma for Michael: whether to turn the other cheek and accept this karmic punishment for his transgressions, or to avenge his daughter's death by plunging back into the shady world from which he is so desperate to escape. <br/><br/>This could have been a truly poignant and morally ambiguous conclusion to the series but as it turned out, The Godfather III is neither sufficiently consistent with its predecessors to be a convincing sequel, nor engaging enough to be anywhere near as remarkable a film in its own right. Admittedly, it could have been far worse - but the sad thing is that it really should have been better."

","Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) seems to have mellowed down in his later years, and he wishes to keep it that way. But just when things start going the way Michael wants, he's pulled back into the life of a mobster. The brilliantly eerie similarities between an old Michael and Brando's elderly Don Vito is what makes this film a must-see. Many fans were disappointed at its tameness and the incestuous subplot. The film does an excellent job of earning its keep by not mimicking the previous two films and moving the story forward as opposed to a full circle.

","My friends were really divided about the Godfather Part III: no whether it was good or bad, but if I should see it or not. Some said I may as well complete the trilogy, whilst others said it would ruin the first two masterpieces. In the end I decided to watch it to judge for myself after watching The Godfather Part I and Part II again.<br/><br/>Set 20 years after the events of The Godfather Part II, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has made moved back to New York and is made a Commander of St. Sebastain by the Catholic Church for his charity work. He has been a legitimate business man, with a few a links to the Mafia. He is suffering guilt from his ruthless raise to power, the murder of brother and the death of his first wife in Silicy. His daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) is still close to him, running the Vito Corleone Foundation for him, whilst his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has turned his back on the family business to focus on a music career. In the middle of a ceremony to celebrate Michael's deels to the church, Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garica) shows his face. He is a low-level hood who is in the middle of conflict with a Mafia Don, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna (Fat Tony from the Simpsons)). Michael offers to show the young hot the ropes of the business. After a devastating hit that wipes out most of the Mafia Dons, a power vacuum happens the world of crime. Michael is forced back into the Mafia because of it. The second plot involves Michael attempting to buy Immobiliare, the real estate sector of the Vactican Bank. The deal is meant to save the Vactican's troubled finances and Michael is encouraged by Archbishop Gilday (Donal Donnelly), the head of the Vactican bank to invest $600 Million in Bonds. But this ends up being a scam by dodgy elements of the Bank and forces Michael into Vactican politics.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III has often been derided by fans for being inferior and insulting to the first two films. But there is a sector who do still like this film. They is a long gap between this film and the preceder, which is never a good sign. It means that a lot of chances are forced appond the film and gaps have to be expanded. It is also normally a sign of cashing in on a popular title. There are problems with characterisation in the film. The first two films are about Michael's moral decline and becoming a ruthless and cunning Mafia boss. But in this film the filmmakers are trying to make him a good guy and forced back into the business. It weakens the message. The rise of Vincent also felt unrealistic and less organic compared to the rise of Vito and Michael. However, I do like that Connie (Talia Shire) as an adviser.<br/><br/>The plot itself should have been really interesting, dealings between the Mafia and the Vactican. That in itself could have made a really good thriller/drama, and showing the international nature of both organisations. As well the power vacuum in the Mafia, and forced change could have lead to a good film, particularly more in the context of the first two. But the Godfather Part III seem to be trying to put too much in one film which was shorten, because it also has the added family drama that was key to all three films. As a stand alone film it could have worked, but as a Godfather film, not so much.<br/><br/>Acting wise, it was hit and miss. Of course Al Pacino was excellent, Michael Corleone was the role that made him into a star. Andy Garcia is also a good actor, and most of the actors returning were good. The big problem was the casting of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter. Sofia has a good look, and lovely long hair, but she was so wooden and weak that it was a struggle for the other actors. Her expression on her face was so distance that it looked like she wasn't really interested. Luckily she moved into directing where she shows her real talent.<br/><br/>Francis Ford Coppola does a fine job directing, having some good set-pieces like the hit on the Mafia (even though it could have been simpler). He keeps the tone the same as with the first two films, have the slow burning atmosphere that made the first two films great. But this film did feels a little too slow and distance compared to the first two. Some of the music also did not fit as well as the first two films. However there are good scenes, like the intercutting between the opera and the outside events.<br/><br/>Overall, its no where near as good as the first two films and should have been a stand alone film. But it still has entertaining moments. 3 out of 5."

","To be frank and obvious, The Godfather Part III fails on many levels so that it cannot hold a candle to the first two. And should we really have expected it to be as good as Part I and II? The reason it was even made was because Coppola was strapped for money and felt he could give closure to this epic saga. More on that later, but first to focus on what went wrong in this continuation of the Corleone crime family.<br/><br/>In this third story, Michael has aged considerably over the years and is now starting to decline not only in health but in his mindset of how to run the family. Mob activities are becoming more and more violent, something he is not necessarily ready for. He becomes involved with Vincent (Andy Garcia) who is the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny from the first film. He has inherited his father's temper and ambition and hopes to help the Corleone family take on Joey Zusa (Joe Mantegna), a mob boss now running their New York business. Michael also gets involved in the Vatican and their running if large sums of money. This plot thread I thought was fairly ridiculous and uninteresting. Of course, the best things of the story are the family arcs and the relationships between these people.<br/><br/>For the positive, the acting is good but not on par with what it was before. Al Pacino and Diane Keaton are both wonderful as Michael and Kay, two people with a lot of history but much to connect with each other. I do wish we could have seen more of the history of them and Michael explaining his actions in Sicily from the first film. Garcia is quite strong as is Talia Shire and Eli Wallach but Sofia Coppola brings everything to a halt with her very wooden and stiff performance of Mary, Michael's daughter. She speaks in one tone, has little chemistry with Garcia and has a weird contortion with her mouth that is distracting. Is it the worst thing of this movie? No, that would be the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo, who seem to go out of their way to avoid doing what they did in the first two films. Those focused much on the family and the internal conflicts within. This part has a global span, going from Rome to New York to Sicily; it all seems too much for one movie.<br/><br/>The burning question is: was this a necessary production? I think it was, for now we know there never will nor can there ever be a fourth film as well as the closure we do receive on these people. The best part of the film is the family itself and we continue to see development in many of the characters, especially Michael and his sister Connie. For me, Connie's arc was the best of this film as we watch this beautiful woman, who got married in the first film, seem to lose her way. She is conflicted with the fact that she loves her family but is appalled by the violence associated with them. What happens to her in this movie is shocking but also understandable as it was with Michael's transformation. That, of course, is the main theme of this saga. Pacino seems to ham it up a little here but is still very effective in his role as a man filled with demons of his past and trying to do anything he can to exorcise them.<br/><br/>Why does this fail? Probably because we expected too much of Coppola. He hardly expected the first film to be so widely revered as it is, let alone the second film. Could he have known people wanted that same quality for this one. I am glad I saw it for now the story is complete to one of the greatest cinematic achievements."

","I was not happy with how they aged Al Pacino for this role. But that is the besides the point, it doesn't take away from what is a very good ending to the trilogy.<br/><br/>Although some complain that Coppola's direction is vastly contrasted to the previous two movies, I didn't feel that affected the movie in a negative way.<br/><br/>Michael Corleone is now old and his business is finally 'legitimate'. However, there are obstacles in his path to purging himself of past sins, and his confession to a priest about how he murdered his brother is highly symbolic of how that one act has haunted him till now and is something he will always regret.<br/><br/>I loved how this movie picked up from the devastating murder of Fredo in part II and emphasized how Michael wishes to seek repentance for this act. However, a negative in this movie is the character of Kay and how she reappears in Michael's life and he seems eager to seek her forgiveness and profess how he has always cared for her. What I found even more incredulous was how she claims she has always loved him! After her murder of his child in part II I found this not in-keeping with her character development by the end of that movie. Equally ludicrous is how Michael has changed towards her and seeks her approval even now. It is sad because it shows us how alone he really is yet it isn't in-keeping with the Michael we saw in part II.<br/><br/>The devastatingly poignant ending where Mary is shot is the final bullet to Michael's heart and he dies alone. I wasn't happy with this ending but somehow I suppose it fit. Mary couldn't have the love of the cousin who loved her back because his destiny is to take over from Michael as the new Don. So her death seems the only solution as we know she will not be able to live without her cousin reciprocating her love. Vincent, her cousin, is the bastard child of Michael's elder brother Sonny and somehow I doubt his ability to succeed Michael successfully. But we will never know how that turned out...<br/><br/>All in all a must-see for die-hard Godfather fans. This movie includes flashbacks to Fredo's murder and Michael's first marriage. Yet the real story here is about Michael's relationship with his family and in true movie-hero-villain style his downfall into a lonely broken-hearted death, in much the way as Tony Montana in Scarface ended up."

","THERE IS an old, time worn bit of conventional wisdom that goes something like: <br/><br/>""They"" say that a sequel to a movie is never as good as the original!""<br/><br/>WELL, WHOEVER ""They"" are, and ""They"" are eternally making these absolute truisms, always have and always do so. ""They"" would certainly done themselves well to dial it down a bit, remembering what ""They"" said about absolutes; namely that:<br/><br/>""They say that there are no absolutes!"" (Except of course the absolute truth that there are no absolutes. Did ""they"" say that? Absolutely!<br/><br/>WELL, SCHULTZ, you certainly do get the point; being that most of the many sequels that are made, do not measure up to the first entry into what mostly always spawns a veritable series of motion pictures. (Just consider for a moment, if you please, the likes of JAWS II, ROCKY II, DEATH WISH II, BATMAN II, TOPPER TAKES A TRIP, HALLOWEEN 2 and even APPOLLO 13!* <br/><br/>AND WHAT about perhaps the all time cheapie, spin off in SON OF KONG; which could exist to cheaply recoup some of the exce$$I've budgetary buck$ of Pop's story in KING KONG (RKO Radio Pictures, 1933). <br/><br/>THERE HAVE been a few notable exceptions to the rule, though. The first that pops into my fatigued mind is FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931) being followed a full four years later by BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1935). (Notice that back in the ""Good Olde Days"", Hollywood seems to be a little more trusting of us, the great, unwashed masses and actually did make variation on titles. They didn't think they necessarily needed something like DONDI II; in order to convey the message that a picture is a sequel.)<br/><br/>AND SO too, that THE GODFATHER's being followed by THE GODFATHER: Part 2, represented only the second time in our memory that the sequel actually was better than the original; following these two James Whale FRANKENSTEIN Pictures, was a delightful continuation and fulfillment of the originals' story line.<br/><br/>SO NOW let's f-a-s-t f-o-r-w-a-r-d a trifle. Hey, many more $how Bu$ine$$ Mega Buck$ could we 'possibly' extricate with more actors being present. The wild one of idea were, that falsely reasoned that there should be continued success with the sequels. BBUUZZZZT! (Our game show buzzer) WRONG!!<br/><br/>THE LUCK ran out as Puzo, Coppola and Paramount went with GF#3! Why, you asked? What went wrong?<br/><br/>FIRST OF ALL, 1990 take away 1974=16 years between numbers two and three. (Sounds a little like toilet training.) A lot had changed in Hollywood; as well as in the Real World. Finding clever ways to bump-off the enemies was taking some inventive, albeit strange twists. For example, we gotta go to tie in the Catholic Church with a contrived storyline involving the murder of the Popntif! Connie Corleone (Miss Tallia Shire) becomes a combination Hit Man & Lucritia Borgia! People get to hear Opera performed in their own language; being Italian (in Italy, yet)! <br/><br/>THIS IS not to say that the movie doesn't offer anything; for many of its sequences are interesting, but somehow don't seem to mesh very well into a smooth running gangland saga. Youmg Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) is well cast as the illegitimate prince and pretender to the Corleone Family throne; but his character seems to be almost cut from the same cloth as an Agent 007. His skills at pulling off the hit of the really 'Bad Guy' Gangster, Joey Zasa (Joe Montenga) are really well developed for a young guy; with his tactics being similar to those being studied at West Point.<br/><br/>IT HAS been said that the Godfather author, the late Mr. Mario Puzo, was working on a fourth installment of the Corleone Family story when he passed away in 1999. If so, we have no doubt that we will see how the Family Business runs with young Don Vincenzo (Mr. Garcia) calling the shots.<br/><br/>THEN MAYBE Director Coppala can take a new road and bring us a GODFATHER TV Series; perhaps a Sitcom. How about Charlie Sheehan as the wisecracking Don Corleone with Rip Taylor as a Funny Consiglieri; just for Comic Relief! <br/><br/>FOR Remember, Schultz, we Americans, that is all real, right thinking Americans love our Gangster Pictures, even the lesser ones. <br/><br/>NOTE * Me friend Schultz and meself still haven't seen APPOLLO 13. We've strong feelings that we should see APPOLLO 1 to 12 before hand."

Michael is also trying to reconcile his relationship with his ex-wife, Kay (Diane Keaton) and protect his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) from the Mafia business.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III is the most misunderstood of the trilogy. I feel that Sofia Coppola gave an underrated performance, but I'd like to see what Winona Rider could have done with the character. Sofia Coppola portrays the innocence that Michael wants to preserve. Andy Garcia also received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his performance as Vincent Mancini-Corleone. The movie also includes a good supporting cast including Joe Mantegna (Criminal Minds) as rival mobster Joey Zaza and Eli Watch as Don Altobello.<br/><br/>I found the third entry in the series to be a great movie, but not as good as the first two.

His end is not as well staged/framed or told as Brando was in the first film. In fact it is pitifully short of the rich details.

","I have mixed feelings about ""The Godfather III"". While I reckon it's a well-done film, with forceful performances by almost all of the cast -Al Pacino is always a good actor, although he certainly overacts quite a few times here; for me, the supporting actors, with the exception of Sophia Coppola, were the best part- and a good directing job, if looked at as what it is, the finale of the Godfather trilogy, I have to say that it is a completely unnecessary film, and that the saga would have been much better off if it had ended with the second movie.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that it practically denies all that we had learned about the character of Michael Corleone, which this movie is entirely about. We find him aging and declining, together with his empire, and the turn that he takes at a point in the film, and from then onwards, is just out of character.<br/><br/>However, the film is flawed even if we put aside the fact that it should be coherent with the previous two ""Godfather"" installments. For example, I feel that Coppola was trying too hard to keep up with the previous two movies, and it shows -he tries to replace actual interesting content and a well devised plot with sequences that are perhaps spectacular and entertaining, but oftentimes too long and not always necessary -see, for example, the never-ending opera sequence toward the end. In other words, ""The Godfather III"" is too packed with artifice and directorial tricks where there should have been more substance and a really interesting, well-woven story to tell.<br/><br/>As to the story itself, while it does not lack interest, it is too full of subplots that are tackled on but left unfinished, and aren't always pertinent, or don't add any interest or meaning to the whole film. This makes the movie sometimes too messy and even boring.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a movie that Godfather fans will probably enjoy for what it's worth, but definitely nothing too special."
"mail-4230","6","0","1","26 March 2009"," Disappointing, clichés and no story
","I'm incredibly disappointed with the Godfather III, it has in no way kept any of the dramatic strength, the intensity nor the atmosphere of its predecessors. Many critics concentrated on the weak side parts, which is true compared to the long line of top actors in the first two episodes. There is no replacement for Robert Duvall, a John Cazale or a De Niro at all. Garcia is not bad, he plays the reincarnation of Sonny quite convincingly. But the part itself is not big enough to fill the movie nor is his love relationship to Corleones daughter. It was one of the key strenghts of the Godfather to integrate story lines of many characters in that ""Family"" environment and bind them well together. In Part III we see a scarcity of that, on top of it is blends the clichés of Mafia guys cooking pasta when they are at war, machine gun shootings when there is a reputation at stake and now the ""evil church"". There is no surprise in it and hell, how boring is it to have a real estate fund as a new ship for the Family - it's no way as interesting as a Casino.<br/><br/>I had hoped for more, the script fails behind and if I look at it objectively, Al Pacino seems not have had any significant new idea on how he could evolve the character of Don Corleone.

"HelloTexas11","6","0","1","7 October 2008"," overly reverential follow-up
","'The Godfather Part III' suffers from a bad case of wishing it was either 'The Godfather' or 'The Godfather Pt. II'. You'll lose count of all the situations, scenes, ideas, and lines of dialogue that are lifted either in part or in whole from the two earlier films. It's almost as if Francis Ford Coppola feels it necessary to constantly remind the audience that this is in fact a 'Godfather' film, rather than just getting on with it. The film is generally good enough to stand on its own, though it does suffer in comparison in many ways. Al Pacino has a hard time getting inside the character of Michael Corleone again. He makes a half-hearted attempt to act old, but it's never terribly convincing. His supporting cast is much weaker than in either of the other two, partially because of new faces brought in, such as (usually) reliable Eli Wallach as an aged Mafia boss. His performance is only adequate, and then there is Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter, Mary. Her acting is more on a level with your average teen flick and at times is hard to watch. For reasons that never seem very clear or worthwhile, Diane Keaton is brought back as Kay in what could be called an extended cameo. Her scenes with Pacino are not satisfying either; Michael is courteous and flattering, suggesting they could be together again. Kay basically tells him what a slimeball he is and that she loathes him. Speaking of lifted scenes, there's one in 'Part III' that could almost be considered a 'response' to one in the original movie, where Kay watches Michael assuming the role of the Don and sees the door shut, symbolizing her being shut out of that part of his life. Here, in 'Godfather III', there is a scene where Michael and Kay almost achieve a kind of rapprochement when Michael is suddenly called into the next room to handle some dirty Mafia business. In what might be called 'Kay's Revenge', this time it is she who walks slowly out of camera view, in effect 'closing the door' behind her. Most of their exchanges though are simply rehashes of things said in the second film. There are so many lines lifted from the first two Godfathers, the effect borders on parody at times. ""Never tell anyone outside the family what you're thinking."" ""Today, all Corleone family business will be settled."" 'Part III' is so reverential and referential to those works, it's almost like one long homage to them. Another character from them, Connie, appears at odd moments like a ghost from the past, long enough to express concern for Michael and the family, a kind of melancholy loyalty, then she disappears again. Sonny Corleone's son, Vincent, is played by Andy Garcia and is the one character to bring some urgently needed kick and vitality to the film. Like his father, Vincent is a hot-head, a 'shoot first and ask questions later' kind of guy. He wants to solve the family's problems the way they USED to and of course Michael has spent almost his whole life moving away from the mob style of doing things and making the Corleone family legitimate. The plot itself has to do with various intrigues, financial and otherwise, at the Vatican and Michael becoming involved with some unsavory types who, shall we say, do not have his best interests at heart. 'The Godfather, Pt. III' is a good film, not a great one, one that certainly goes out of its way to remind us what masterpieces the first and second 'Godfather' films were."

","This film succeeds in many terms like superb acting and good directing but something unknown to me makes me don't like it , may be because i expected something different when i first saw it.The film in itself emphases very much on understanding and justifying the human nature of the main character trying to make us sympathies with him once again after the tragic end of last part of the trilogy (the murder of his brother by his orders)and that made the film like a one guy show and that may be one of the reasons it didn t appeal to many people when they compare it with the tow other films ,aside with its gloomy atmosphere and the sad end for its hero. The developing of the characters is believable and consistent with the previous prats.There are some things not important but felt bet odd for me like Konnys (Michels sister) reaction to her older brother death and believing he is drown contrary to her reaction to her husband death in the first part and i didn't understand one scene in which the assassin using glasses in the office because he was in a suicidal situation ,I mean how was he suppose to escape .The curt end Michel's death alone and old in his home town could v been done much better .Yet this film has its many strong points especially his dealing with sociological issues for man with power and responsibility feeling the end closing and trying to redeem his self yet the circumstances surround him make him fail with the greater loss of all ."

","The first two films of the Godfather saga were close to perfection, some of the most masterful movies ever made. Although part three is a big step down from those films, it has redeeming qualities that allow me to give it a passing grade. This sequel involves Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) trying to at last free his family from the world of crime and find someone to take over leading the family business. Michael's most likely successor is his nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), the son of Michael's brother Sonny (James Caan's character from the first film). This is the area of the film that proves to be interesting, as these two characters expand on the details of events and people in the first two films and give us information we did not really go into in those movies. For example, they discuss Michael and Sonny's relationship and Michael's short-lived marriage before Kay. These discussions are truly fascinating. I disagree that the film is too long, as I think this movie, as well as the first two, move along at a fairly quick pace. It proves to be interesting enough to sit through without really getting bored. My first problem with this film, however, is casting the director's real-life daughter Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter in the film. Her acting was pretty unrealistic and did not fit with the brilliance the rest of the cast seemed to have. Also, I dislike how the film chose to end. It felt as though the whole of the saga was not really resolved, that all three films were building up to nothing. It's truly not a bad film, but it doesn't have the masterful work the first two had. It still proves to be worthwhile, and hey, who really expects the third film to be the best anyway.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"pdlaker34","10","0","1","15 June 2008"," so close, but not quite
","I think this movie is very close to being a great film, but it fails in a few places. first of all, what was Coppola thinking when he gave his daughter the role of Michael's daughter and then he gave her all those lines. Normally I don't like to be so tough on actors, but man was she bad, it's a good thing she changed her mind and decided to be a director because she's made some really good films except for one (Lost in Translation and Virgin suicides, hated Marie Antoinette). Another thing is that i wish Robert Duvall would have been the concillere and then I if that would of happened the concillere would've had more lines. I thought Pacino was great, Garcia was close to being like Sunny, and having Eli Wallach in it was excellent. This film was more interesting then the second one and if there would have been a better cast it would have been better then the second one. in conclusion, no Sofia Coppola and no George Hamilton, have a little different casting in other places and have Robert duvall, and then you have a film just as good as the second one, none of them could be as good as the first. I give it 8.5/10, but I do not think this deserves to be on the top 250 and round down instead of up because there are problems with it."
"jdkraus","7","0","1","6 May 2008"," It isn't a bad nor is it ""an offer that can't be refused""
","I love the first two ""Godfathers"", but this one did not have the caliber of the first two. There are things that make this movie feel like a ""Godfather"" but there are also things that don't. <br/><br/>Starting with the good, I found the plot to be very interesting. More than twenty years after where the second Godfather left off, Michael Corleone seeks to make his family legitimate by buying up part of the organizations in the Vatican. Things don't go as he had planned and once again he is pulled back in to fight off new foes and reinstate his family in the mafia with the help of a young protégé that loves his daughter. <br/><br/>It sounds pretty good, but much of the old cast is gone from the original two films. It would make sense for some of their characters to die off over more than a twenty year range, but many of the new faces aren't competent, particularly Sofia Coppola. I can understand Francis Ford Coppola would want his daughter in production to start her career. She's good-looking but she is bland and uneventful.<br/><br/>Eli Wallach seemed to enjoy himself as Don Altobello, the clever backstabber. Joe Mantgena as Joey Zasa was all right, I guess, but he gets killed off before he even gets a chance to develop his character. I have to add that, none of the Corleone family's enemies are developed, nor are their motives clear for why they want to kill Michael. This may have been intended since greed is a common thing that drives many people, but is there anything else? The film seemed to focus on what gruesome death the other mob bosses get rather than explain their characters' motives. <br/><br/>Talia Shire was a nice addition to the film. Her character has changed from the abused wife in Part I, to the pitiful widow in Part II, and to a cunning mastermind in this one. She's one of the few well-developed characters. <br/><br/>Of all the Godfathers, this one has my favorite performance by Al Pacino. His character was youthful and cunning in the first two but now he is an old man that is haunted by his past demons and wants forgiveness from the things he has done as a mob boss. His silent scream at the end of the film is priceless and moving. I'm surprised he did not an Oscar nom for his performance. <br/><br/>Andy Garcia was also great as Sonny's hotheaded son Vincent, who later becomes Michael's protégé. But what disturbed me was the unwanted development of his lust for Michael's daughter. Incest is something I don't look forward to in a mob film, particularly a Godfather. <br/><br/>Like the first two films, it has beautiful production design, costumes, and grim cinematography. It has the original score that Nino Rota composed wonderfully for the Godfather Part I & II but unfortunately Nino died before this one was in the making. So a new composer takes his place and adds some music to it that makes the film feel hokey. The music reminds me of something that would be in a cheap soap opera. It gets too dramatic in a scene of suspense and too melancholy at an emotional part. <br/><br/>It isn't a bad nor is it ""an offer that can't be refused"". 7/10"

He is like Vito and Michael Corleone, who wanted to do good but destroyed their own families they wanted to protect.<br/><br/>How can it be, that there was no one strong enough to prevent that this spoiled girl with the attraction of an unripe lemon in the botanical garden of Oslo is put in a row with such really huge actors like Al Pacino, Eli Wallach and Diane Keaton?"

","I've barely been alive longer than that and can already appreciate the fact that, even though it is considered by many to be the worst of them all, GP3 is *well* worth whatever wait there was.<br/><br/>Despite its numerous shortcomings (Sofia Coppola, Bridget Fonda, Sofia Coppola, Sofia Coppola, etc.), it is able to rank almost in the high esteem of its predecessors because it is a story that is more about redemption. As it should be after two films of Michael's (Al Pacino) continuing descent into crime, both legal and spiritual.<br/><br/>And GP3 is a more spiritual film, focusing most of the movie's attention on the Vatican and corruption therein. So the intended message of the movie may have been lost in all the stabbings, shootings, and lynchings (that's right, there is a lynching). But it doesn't matter because one message still remains. A message echoed when Michael tells his children, ""More than all the money and power on Earth, you are my treasure.""

","Having slept the way through watching ""The Godfather"" part II, I saw part III, expecting it to be as boring and heavy. However, I was better satisfied. However, there were still many flaws I encountered while watching that made me think of it as lesser than the original. The story isn't bad. It has a better setting and is simpler to follow. However, the dialogs were what failed. They just sounded too false, too rehearsed. Although it still has the quotable potential like in the original, there are some lines that sound a little out of place. Michael Corleone's character finally redeems himself, now acting as Don Vito would. He's likable and lukewarm, although with a dark past, but still, noble with people. I was at first puzzled with Vincent's presence in the story. Now, real ""Godfather"" fans might know that Lucy Mancini never bore a baby with Sonny in the novel, and so Vincent shouldn't even exist. When the story came along together, he grew on me. Yet, I thought his romance with Mary was useless and not very realistic. Joey Zasa was a great character. He should have had more development and not just put as a traitor and have him whacked. I actually felt sympathetic for him. This was one of the reasons I disliked Vincent at the beginning. Connie was what I hated the most from the whole story. Women weren't supposed to tangle with the business in the Family. Puzo specifically explains this in his novel. I regret Tom Hagen's absence. He was the character that, although part of the Family, explained everything to you as a civilian and whom you could feel identified. He was my favorite.<br/><br/>Okay, after detailing what I hated, let's move on. Coppola's directing was great. He masterfully uses visual elements from the original and creates new ones that mesh together perfectly. The perfect example was the Archibishop's interview, identical to Bonasera's. The music was great, coming almost on its entirety from Nino Rota. Unlike part II, this one has the most action. There's shooting and blood in almost every scene. However, there was one thing I thought was the greatest mistake of them all. Corleone dies alone, with his daughter shot (something completely cruel and sad) and with no one else around him but a dog. This is not possible within the Mafia world. A Don never dies alone, nor in the streets. Yet, Al Pacino's performance was the best in the trilogy. The way he cries and screams after his daughter's death is so beautifully done, he makes the viewer cry with him, even though Mary wasn't a very appealing character.<br/><br/>So, I liked part III over II, yet, it not nearly as great as ""The Godfather"", which is, till this day, the best movie ever."

","I enjoyed the first two the most. I think the writing and direction of this one is good. But the acting is awful. Andy Garcia seems to have watched the first two films to many times and he seems to try and consume the screen but does not succeed. His dialogue especially with Sophie Coppola is dry and not godfather worthy. The major difference between this and the other films is that there is no character development. You are kind of given the characters from the previous films and that is how they stay throughout the film. Also I think not having Robert Duvall kills the family. Michael is the only character we really know and it makes it difficult to relate to all the new people. If you are a fan of the first two you need to finish the series with this but don't expect much until the end."

","It has taken me years to finally watch the Bonus DVD, and ask everyone to watch it AFTER watching all three films. <br/><br/>I must say that Michael was the ""Tiger Woods"" of the family. His eyes really told how he felt, had people really studied them. He was like a master chess player and he never ""whacked "" anyone that did not deserve it. He had the REACTION for every ACTION and the way he carried it off gave me the highest respect for the man. If you are truthful and honest with Mike, you are a friend for life, but start digging your own grave, if you cross him. I feel Kay was the only ""pass"" he gave, when she told him about how she lost the third child. He paid her back big time, but she kept on breathing. I was very sad when bad things happen in his family, but as I said, for every action, there is a reaction. Roots, The Color Purple, and The godfather are my favorite movies. I love all of them and the talent of the actors, sets, costumes, and the morals taught, as well as what you should do and what you should never do in life."

Furthermore, in terms of practically every cinematic aspect, it is way behind that of Parts I and II, and doesn't have the effect they do.<br/><br/>However, it is still a good film; it tells us of an adequate ending to the Corleone chronicles, and it tells it well.

","The general consensus about ""The Godfather: Part III"" is that it is nothing compared to the first two films. I agree with that statement. I do, however, disagree with those who say the film is horrible. The film is quite good, and shares with us some important lessons. While we may want a better end to the saga, we still got a great one. Yes, it is not without its flaws, but they are few.<br/><br/>Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now in his sixties. Age and wear have lead him to one thing; he knows and wants his corrupt business to become legitimate. He has lost his wife. His son wants nothing of the business, and he rarely sees his children anyway. While Michael is fighting for the legitimacy of his business, others are fighting against it. Vincent (Andy Garcia) is Michael's nephew. He is a very violent person; a person that is the main candidate to replace Michael as the future Don of the family. This is the sad story of one man's fight to redeem what he has taken, or lose it all over again in the process. The film co-stars Dian Keaton as Kay, who remains close to Michael for her children, but nothing more. Sofia Coppola plays Michael and Kay's daughter, Mary. <br/><br/>Al Pacino is nothing short of brilliant in his final role as Michael Corleone. He is emotionally powerful. This was one of his best performances. Diane Keaton gives one of her best performances, as well. She loves Michael, but hates what he does. Andy Garcia does pretty good as Vincent. I'm sure he's done better, but here he's good, so it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is not without its problems. The film has an opera scene that is both effective and entertaining. However, it lasts too long. It almost seems stressed. I, and others, don't feel that Sofia Coppola was the right fit for Mary. Her performance, well...isn't the best of the movie. This is no reflection on Sofia, who is the talented director and writer of films such as ""Lost in Translation."" Yes, she is Coppola's daughter, but something isn't working out here. The camera work, while much the same, isn't as dark or attractive.<br/><br/>Back to the film's strengths. This movie is a very successful human story. About how the decisions we make will effect the rest of our life forever. It is a great study. Francis Ford Coppola's talent had not left him, and his directing could still be described as breathtaking. The screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is rich and effective.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is good. The directing is fabulous. The screenplay; well-written. It succeeds in what it tries to do. Therefore, it is a good movie, and worth seeing. It's not perfect, and doesn't even come close to the level of ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II.""

In the next, Michael is sitting outside a little house in Sicily and falls out of a chair. Then the screen goes dark and the credits roll. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

There is no transition to this scene, just a montage of scenes from the other two movies to the accompaniment of CAVALIERA RUSTICANA. Then, BOOM!

","The third part is nearly the most interesting because we finally have these Corleones in the modern world. They have sold their casinos and gambling institutions, they have never been in drugs or prostitution and the new Godfather, Michael Corleone, wants to get respectable, recognized by the catholic church and world influential. So he tries to donate big quantities of money to the Vatican bank in exchange of a majority share in the Vatican's real estate institution. He fails at first but goes on and tries to find the invisible ways into the labyrinth. So he makes friends with as many people as possible in the financial, religious and political circles around the church. He finds out he has to go to Sicilia to get in touch with an important cardinal who is actually elected Pope, but does not last more than a few months. They have special teas that make you sleep very long in the Vatican. But this third part shows a great evolution of the Sicilian-American and Italian-American communities in the US. Violence is becoming less and less easy in the US. They have to respect the law and law-enforcing institutions are too strong and powerful for them to be neglected or under-evaluated. Then there is a shift in that mafia violence. The Corleones going to Sicilia, among other things to take part in the first operatic production of Michael's own son who is an opera tenor, violence catches them up and Sicilia becomes the theatre of what they can't do in the US any more. And once again Michael goes through and is well protected by the men of his nephew who he has just appointed his successor, and also by chance. The final gun directed at him cannot be prevented from firing, though the assassin will be shot back on the spot by the new Don Corleone, but Michael is once again lucky and the bullet does not reach him. For more details rush to the DVD. Thus the third part ends in drama, even melodrama. But it is definitely clearer than the second that is too long and too complex and entangled. We seem though to be living the last powerful years of this family that has to accept the challenge of becoming legal and respectable. In other words the world is changing and the mafia along with it.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","The Godfather Part 3 is a film which comprises most of the same events from the original film, but does it in such a manner, which makes the film stand in it's own right. In the films there is so many similar scenes, although visually differiental, which are used in the first. It is so hard to criticise this because in reality the life cycles of mafia members reflect so much similarity. It starts of with the basic reintroduction of the don; Micheal Corleone; similar to the first where the first compelation of scenes where inevitably focused on the main character; Marlon Brando. But as with the first a foreclosed and unintroduced character becomes involved in the film; in the first, Al pacino and the third Andy Garcia. As I perceive it, Coppola latched on to the filimarity of the original and integrated some individual conflicts between the two characters. This is apparent when u look at Micheals introverted personality and projected unwillingness to enter the family business whereas Garcia embraces the underworld of the mafia and wants to be a part of it. No matter how they became embrolied in such a world, they faced the same events, were that Brando didn't want Micheal involved and that later on Micheal didn't want Vincent to become involved, but as the first an murder attempt on both father (Brando) and Micheal (uncle) forced both Pacino, in the first, and Garcia into a higher level of the mafia, when the Turk and Sassa, were killed. Another similarity to the first was that Micheal lost his wife and in the third Garcia lost Mary. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Coppla didn't have much to worked with in this concluding part of the story, due to the fact that life comes full circle and that events do repeat themselves, but he did try to combat, the transparency of his repetition by those little character diferentials between Al Pacino and Andy Garcia."

I think sometimes these things can be taken too seriously, and as it stands this is a fine piece of cinema.<br/><br/>I think this can be taken on it's own, as much as one third of a whole.

","I've just re-watched Part III after having read some of the reviews on this site that trash it. Obviously, everyone's opinion of a film is shaped by their expectations, their preferences and probably a million other things but I think expectations are what ruin this film for a lot of people.<br/><br/>For me it's an incredibly powerful, tense and moving film of a different genre to the first two. If you come to this film expecting more of the same from the first film and classic mafia violence and plotting then yes, you'll be very disappointed. For me this film is about the consequences of the actions we take and the unavoidable paths we take through life. Michael feels that he cannot ever convert to the legitimate life and yet we see his son, who is so much like him make the conscious decisions that take him away from it all. He constantly questions why he can never escape his past but what it comes down to is the fact that he just can't let it go and forever feels he must live up to the reputation (of which he's constantly reminded) of his father.<br/><br/>The end is incredibly sad when we see Michael as a broken man, all of the women in his life that he truly loved lost to him or and yet Vincent is there, ready to take up where he has left off and make all of the same mistakes all over again.<br/><br/>Not only that but the tension in the film is incredible. How can people say they got bored?!! But I guess it's not the same tension you feel in the first two films and if you're not into looking for the deeper meaning behind the consequences of living your life as a wealthy gangster who profits from crime and violence then it probably is dull. Mind you, I defy anyone to find the opera scenes boring - I've never been so much on the edge of my seat at a film! And I've definitely never cried so much at the end of a film ever!!! An excellent ending to the trilogy and in my opinion, far better then the second film."

","This movie, in my opinion, was a waste of film. The movie did not bring you into the corleone family like the other two did. This movie lacked a good script. The actors were in place but they had no direction. Al Pacino's character really didn't do it for me in this one. In part part one and two, Micheal corleone was a man that everyone feared. In part three it looked like if he didn't belong. It couldn't be because of the age he plays in the movie because Don Corleone in the first Godfather was still the man. This movie made a mockery of what Micheal Corleone should of been. Talia Shire's character had more guts than that of Al Pacinos. Andy Garcia over acted in some scenes. Other scenes he did good. Sofia Coppola was not a big help in the movie either. The only time she didn't seem to whine and act like a baby was when she was not in the scene. This movie could of been a lot better if they would of taken their time and had the same passion that they had for the first two Godfather's. Its a shame that this film has to be mentioned with the first two which were masterpieces of cinema."

His mannered, fussy, grotesquely overacted portrayal of an elderly Don stands out among so many fine performances like (to paraphrase Raymond Chandler) a tarantula on a slice of angel food cake.<br/><br/>Sofia Coppola played the role of a sheltered, shy, naive rich girl, & her restraint--perhaps bordering on gawkiness--fits the character perfectly.

","""When they come  they'll come at what you love""<br/><br/>How prophetic Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)'s words would prove to be. In Francis Ford Coppola's hugely anticipated follow up to The Godfather: Part II, almost twenty years have passed since the final moments of the previous picture, where Michael ordered the death of his own older brother, Fredo. <br/><br/>It's 1979. Michael Corleone is one step away from fulfilling the promise he made to his estranged ex-wife Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) in the idealism of his youth in The Godfather  if he secures a deal with the Vatican to take majority shareholdings in the international conglomerate Immobliare for a hefty $600 million, the Corleone family will take it's final step into the world of complete legitimacy. The deal requires the Pope himself to approve, however, and forces conspire to prevent exactly that  forces from deep within the corrupt Vatican, and from criminal underworld Michael has been battling for a quarter of a century to escape. <br/><br/>Michael's life as a Mafia chieftain has etched a deep tire into him that is channeled through his body language. He no longer sits cross-legged in a supreme position of power: his shoulders droop, his face is drained. He seeks only for his family to be together again, for forgiveness and redemption  for his whole life spent in devotion to protecting his family to not have gone to waste. He seeks youth to pass on the burden he bears. His daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola) is naïve and unknowing of who her father is, but loves him deeply. His son Anthony (Franc D'Ambroiso) is more perceptive and is determined to never be involved in his father's business. Michael's nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia)  the illegitimate son of his older brother Sonny  is just as hotheaded and volatile as his father was, but is eager to change to work for his uncle. <br/><br/>More than any complex plot, the picture's best moments come with the exchanges between Michael and Vincent, once Michael agrees to take him under his wing at the behest of his hardened younger sister Connie (Talia Shire). Watching Andy Garcia's transformation is remarkable, drawing parallels with Pacino's own in The Godfather, of course, and perhaps Coppola's ability to capture the spirit of Part I, if not Part II with these moments is what saves The Godfather: Part III.<br/><br/>The distinctive elements of a Godfather picture are all present for the third reprisal: from excellent acting bar the already scathingly criticized Sofia Coppola (a dead horse that doesn't need beating), to Willis's cinematography and the famous score, to Coppola's eye for majestic scope in his direction. If anything, Part III is let down by an overly convoluted plot, and the glaring absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who brought a personality to the business dealings. Nevertheless, The Godfather: Part III is not a bad picture. It could never hope to be on the same level of the first two (the 16 years between films would only serve to heighten that pedestal), but Part III, with it's climactic Opera sequence that showcases Coppola at his virtuoso best  gut-wrenchingly tragic ending and all  provides an apt finale to the Corleone Saga that has been undeservedly vilified for the shortcomings its older brothers expose."

","Being almost twenty years after Godfather 2, the third Godfather movie still lives up to the same potential after Godfathers 1 and 2, although not as much by just a little bit. Although, I still thought the movie was excellent because it still had the wonderful action and drama of the first two Godfathers.<br/><br/>Taking place years and years after the setting of 'The Godfather: Part II' we see Michael Corleone(Al Pacino), now aged and divorced from his wife Kay(Diane Keaton). His children are now full-grown adults and finds out he has a nephew named Vincent(Andy Garcia) who is the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny. Michael takes Vincent under his wing to replace him as Don while he goes out to Vatican City to repent for all of his sins, but then gets the shock of a lifetime when he finds out that his daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola) and Vincent are seeing each other... even though they're cousins! Now, the whole incest thing between Coppola and Garcia was a little shocking to me, but (and this is coming from a teen who's not an incest fan), I didn't mind it. In fact, I liked it (although this will be the only time I accept incest). It was a nice little twist to the final film.<br/><br/>Filled with an all-star cast, including Pacino, Keaton, Garcia, Coppola, Joe Mantegna, Talia Shire, and others, the final film to the Godfather series gives us the same amount of quality and potential that the first two movies had. I don't know why people bash it so much, because I thought it was really good. I think it deserves to be in the Top 250 Movies along with its two predecessors. It really was great; a true classic sequel to a sequel to an excellent movie."
"ncharpil","6","0","1","25 October 2005"," A lazy attempt
","Godfather Part III is on the whole a rather good movie, but it is nothing compared to the first two episodes. This is due to the laziness and lack of inspiration in the movie, which have produced this Hollywood movie filled with shortcuts and stereotypes. It completely lacks the subtlety of the first episodes, in particular the script is at some moments completely awful. Some chosen moments : <br/><br/>""-Why is this country (Sicily) so violent? - History.""<br/><br/>""Que pane! Ah! Olio di Olivo! Como solo se (i forgot the Italian word for make) in Sicilia!"" (Come on! He might as well be saying yeeeeha! i likes a good ole' cheeseburger with fries - the guy sounds as sicilian as Kevin Kline looks french in French kiss...)<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that Sofia Coppola's acting was terrible, but quite frankly I think it's a bit unfair to put all the blame on her. The script is the real culprit here. Coppola had nothing left to prove : his legacy includes three of the greatest movies of all time (the two first episodes and Apocalypse Now). It's just a shame that he didn't find a way of giving the same strength and atmosphere there was in parts I and II. Pacino's acting is alright but not great. The last scene on the opera steps and the close up on Michael screaming is very good though. By the way, I thought the end (when Michael dies an old man in Sicily) is very disappointing : michael should have died there on the steps : his screaming could be seen as his soul bursting out of his body, the final redemption, it would have been a great ending. Also the plot is quite good, with the corruption of the Vatican under Pi IV (and not P2... that's in Perminator) and the mysterious death of John-Paul I. But with such a plot the movie should have been much better. So to sum this up, it's still an OK movie, but it just doesn't come anywhere near the first two episodes."
"johnkeons","9","0","1","15 October 2005"," Learned to appreciate
","I guess that the fact that part III is less appreciated lies in the fact that is more theatrical and political, hence more difficult that part I & II. The first time I saw it when it came out. I thought it was a nice movie but nowhere near its predecessors.<br/><br/>Since then I watched again about 4 times. And every time I appreciate it more for two reasons: 1. It's more theatrical and metaphoric (like the 'indirect' or as some call it unnecessary scenes of the puppet plays foreboding the events ahead in the movie). The opera finale is great because it mixes the the roots of the family (Sicily) with the big world of politics.<br/><br/>I think this is the biggest difference from the other two movies. Seeing the trilogy evolve it changes from a magnificent Maffia_Family epic where we 'learn' about the mores, rites and language of this world to a the development of the don who didn't want to be a don who grows cynical of his incapability (despite his power and intelligence) to control his surroundings, finally to a great finale where he finds out that nothing has really changed and he has not reached his goal and in the end lost everything he fought for (the/his family). He has learned that the 'legit' world is as corrupt (if not more) as the world he wants to get out of. This brings me to my 2nd point.<br/><br/>2. Politics After having seen a documentary about 'God's banker' and the Vatican I understood and appreciated the second layer in the movie much better. Especially when having in mind the last conversation Michael and Don Corleone had in part I about that he never wanted to be a puppet of the 'big shots', I realized that now Michael having reached the goal of being a 'big shot' on a global scale it is for him empty and the family is all he did it for, but there is no family left to fight for.<br/><br/>I agree with the people who say that the cast isn't as brilliant as in the other two (Hyman Roth being one of my favorites), this being the fact that I rate this movie slightly lower that part I and II. But still it is a must see movie.<br/><br/>Most gripping scene is off course Michael's cry on the stairs. Dead and empty eyes when he realizes that the last person he cared for is gone.<br/><br/>Enjoy and see it more often ;-) to appreciate it."
"bczech","7","0","1","6 October 2005"," Good but not great....
","This is a beautifully filmed motion picture. The settings and the sounds are perfect for sitting the mood, but what makes this film only good and not great (like its 2 predecessors) is the distractions of of 2 actors, 2 roles and a plot that, while logical, is somewhat unbelievable.<br/><br/>The actors, lets get them out of of the way, were Sofia Coppola and George Hamilton. Neither was believable, but I do not blame the actors, that error falls to the director for even allowing such casting. Sofia and George do not fit the mold. Their mannerism, dialects and mannerisms fail to compare to the outstanding acting of the other cast members.<br/><br/>The roles..The first is Vincent (played skillfully by Andy Garcia) For me to believe that Michael is so willing to accept the bastard son of his dead brother is ridiculous. This role should have been handled by Michael's or Connie's son. And the whole incest thing should have been nixed also.<br/><br/>The second role was one where the the scenes would have better fit on the cutting room floor. Grace Hamilton serves no real purpose. Appears out of no where and then is gone in a flash. It only adds to the distraction.<br/><br/>The other role was one that was missing. Tom Hagen was sorely missed, and his absence and lame explanation were horribly gaping holes in the Godfather fabric.<br/><br/>Lastly is the plot, while overall I found it very in intriguing, I still felt that so much was contrived. The idea has always been that Micahel had become what he had not wanted to be. He admired his father but never wanted to do what his father wanted to do. He bowed to the needs and desires of his families. But this chapter does not show that conflict, that coolness or that rage within.<br/><br/>One last note: While I will watch the film again I cannot help but wish that it never existed."

"robertbrizel","10","0","2","2 July 2005"," Fine Acting Performances, World Class Production
","I watched the Godfather series in its entirety in the last 3 days, and I found all three productions well done. Godfather I showcases Marlon Brando's unique talents, as well as Al Pacino's emotional intensity. It is this intensity, I feel, that carries Pacino through all 3 phases of the Godfather trilogy.<br/><br/>Godfather II, which also features a young Robert DeNiro as the Godfather, is most unusual through its use of flashbacks of young Don Corleone in Sicily and Manhattan's Little Italy. The outstanding performance DeNiro gives enables the production to work itself into the modern era. And as Pacino ages as the Don's son Michael, we learn from both Corleones the meaning of betrayal from within in all 3 parts of the trilogy. Microcosm of life, one might put it, and the elements of greed and deceit, figure most prominently.<br/><br/>The third part of the trilogy ends as Michael Corleone lives through triumph and tragedy at the highest levels of his own family and the Vatican-of interest due do the great publicity the Vatican has had in recent months due to the changes in pope.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I found the girl who played Appolonia in Godfather I, as well as Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone is Godfather III, both strikingly beautiful and quite charming in their portrayals of ordinary good Italian girls. In contrast to other reviews, I was quite charmed with young Sofia,and feel she still has promise as a world class actress rather than moving into movie director (like her father).<br/><br/>Winona Rider, who Sofia replaced, was not appropriate for this role. As Sofia was just plain ordinary, so much the better, so it doesn't distract from the focus and tempo of the production. Bridget Fonda is cast out of character in a brief cameo-she gets away with it only because she doesn't reappear.<br/><br/>As Pacino falls over in his chair and dies in Sicily as an old man as Godfather III ends, the potential for rising the last Don's opera-singing son for a Godfather IV remains. Like sequeling Scarface, it's just a movie subject of eternal interest worth money.<br/><br/>Francis Coppola is a fine director but will forever be known for the three Godfather movies-not necessarily for his best works. That's life."

","The Godfather Part III was likely destined for failure for the simple fact that it had arguably the highest expectations to surpass. With the first two parts of the Godfather trilogy being defining moments in cinematic history, it would seem that anything less than perfection would ultimately doom this film in the public mind. As it would happen, this is exactly what came to pass.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III received near universal praise for being the magnificent work it is. In fact, it went on to be nominated for seven Oscars including Best Director for Coppola and Best Picture. However, with it not equaling the previous critical success of Part I and II, it was uniformly dismissed as a ""bad"" film by the public. This is in fact unfortunate as Part III is so much better than most people give it credit for.<br/><br/>The only truly distracting element of this film would be the wooden performance of Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone (a part originally offered to both Julia Roberts and Winona Ryder). Time of course has allowed film lovers the chance to forgive Sofia the actor as she has more than proved her value as a writer and director in her own right. But apart from this one fault, the remainder of the film's elements are above-par.<br/><br/>The Godfather Part III explores the wages of sin with great mastery and show that, aside from whatever appearance is given, we are all human and all suffer from our mistakes. Michael (Al Pacino) continues his quest to legitimize the family business with greater zeal, somewhat of an act of penitence for having ordered the execution of his own brother. However, it becomes more and more apparent that he simply cannot escape the darker nature of the life he has lived and is constantly dragged under the waves by his past actions. Things are further complicated by the fact that his children want nothing to do with the family business, while the actions of his extended family -- who have come to desire the darker nature of 'the family' -- only serve to undo the work Michael has done to clear his family name and his own conscience.<br/><br/>The transformation of Connie (Talia Shire) throughout this series comes to a perfect conclusion as we see the maternal instincts she hesitantly came to accept in Part II twist into a mothering of the darker side of the family's power and influence to violent conclusions. Andy Garcia's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination in playing the ever-volatile but brilliantly cunning Vincent is well earned and stands out as one of the best elements of the film overall. His ability to hold his own on screen with Pacino at all times speaks volumes to his talent and skill.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the Godfather Part III was unable to live up to the public expectations placed before it. But it remains a beautifully tragic finale to the Godfather saga that is still a must-see for all movie lovers."

The biggest problem with this Godfather is that it is missing the great characters of the previous two films. The first was an ensemble cast with Brando as its center. The second ,divided between the De Niro and Pacino episodes ,created a compelling dynamic. Here, Pacino has to carry the whole movie. Although Dianne Keaton tries her best, she has become too bitter to be anything but nagging to Pacino. And we know by this time he is already tortured enough. The rest of the cast just doesn't measure up to the earlier versions . It would have been nice to have Robert Duvall return as Tom Hagen rather than suffer through the ""Lady Macbeth"" histrionics of Talia Shire.

Now she's not the best in the film, but she's not bad at all.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, I can get into the plot of this film. Michael Corleone (Pacino) wants to get out of his business in crime. He even goes as far as to confess to a priest about what he did at the end of the second film. This doesn't work as well as he planned. The young Vincent (Andy Garcia) now wants to follow in his Uncle Michael's footsteps. But he can only do this if Michael is there to guide him.<br/><br/>Another reason why he can't get out is the fact that a younger mafia man, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), wants to destroy the order of the old mafia.

His son is now an opera singer and his beautiful daughter, played by Sofia Coppola, is falling in love with the family bodyguard."

","The third installment of Mario Puzo's The Godfather...<br/><br/>Now playing...<br/><br/>(Spoiler included)<br/><br/>I think this movie deserves to be in the Top 250 of the database primarily because of the acting talents of most of the characters here. To start off with, Al Pacino displays yet another staggering amount of acting, complete with his now famous ""owl-eyes"". He perfectly delivered his role of an aging Don Michael Corleone here. Chills went up my spine when he delivered my favorite line of the film: ""I command this Family. Right or wrong. It was not what I wanted--""<br/><br/>Next comes Andy Garcia. A clap-deserving performance as Santino Corleone's son. Nice temper and nice acting...he really is convincing as a good nephew to Michael. <br/><br/>Finally, bind together the talents of Diane Keaton and Talia Shire...good women actresses. Keaton really knows how to act, and Shire is the perfect sister for Pacino.<br/><br/>The spoiler, I noticed, is Sofia Coppola. I must say her act is a bit lame and isn't right to be paired with such talents as Pacino.

I thought the bad critics was mainly cynical. But, in some ways I found them to be quite right indeed. Sophia Coppola is today a great director in my opinion. I loved both of her present movies. In this movie she's playing Michael Corleone's daughter, and she really doesn't suit the character. The movie also suffers from a bit of a loose grip. I had to watch this movie over three days because I found myself too impatient to watch it. The other two movies are also slow in a sense, but they kind of held a grip on you all the way. On the better side the movie does bring a lot of completing segments into the saga. It shows a lot of the afterlife of the mafia affairs which Michael Corleone is trying to stop once and for all now. Andy Garcia plays his part good as well. The confession scene is one of the best scenes of the saga even maybe. Its a good movie. And its a good closing of the saga. Very slow though.

","First of all these movies span a period of almost 20 years between the first and the last. Too bad they were not all produced as a series (in close order). Unfortunately I saw Godfather (1) a week ago but did view all three DVDs of II and III together today. It is a saga - like Gabriel Garcia Marquez' ""100 Years of Solitude"" - a story spanning several lifetimes.<br/><br/>Probably the most powerful images are those of the leading characters (which is almost an oxymoron)who play roles that are easily characterized as stunning. But especially Pachino, who is truly frightening but pathetic at the same time.<br/><br/>The movies themselves are gripping. I thought part III was the jewel, to which the entire three movies (less the first - more the 2nd) - was building up to. <br/><br/>The finale was classic and I'm sure any serious opera lovers will agree, very much a classic ""Italian Opera.""

Often cast as a ""heavy,"" a Mafia enforcer in countless gangster movies such as in the original Italian Job (with Michael Caine), it is refreshing to see him cast in a sympathetic role. As the Catholic Bishop of the diocese covering Sicily, he becomes father confessor to Don Michael Corleone and offers him saintly advice. His character is based loosely on the short-reigned John Paul I (Albini), a theologian, philosopher, essayist and poet of high caliber. <br/><br/>I will never forget his observation on why the corrupt Mafia culture persists in Sicily. He pointed out the stones in a stream/fountain in his courtyard. Then seizing one, he smashes it open to reveal that its core is dry. These people (the Mafia), he says, are like the stones immersed in water for centuries. They have been Christians for hundreds of years but they have never absorbed the true essence of the faith. <br/><br/>I liked III better than II which I found ponderous and filled with sympathetic yet corny details especially on how Corleone Sr. rose from petty mulcter to a leading Mafia Don.

","People really rip on The Godfather III, but I really thought it was an excellent movie. The ending was great. You have to think about it a while, but the lesson told by the story is profound and well stated. People say it wasn't a necessary part, but I think it was- we have to see how miserable Michael Corleone's life has become- his pursuit of money and greed got him misery and the worst kind of suffering and loneliness. He killed his own brother! It could be argued that he killed his own daughter too! Andy Garcia is excellent. We also realize that, essentially, Michael Corleone was a respected and feared coward. 'Vinnie' Mancini-Corleone, Vito Corleone, and Sonny Corleone could confront people. Michael had trouble with this. Vito rose to power on his own accord; Michael rose to power through inheritance and fueled by anger. He tells his understudy, Vinnie, never to hate his enemies, but this is exactly what Michael was guilty of- the major turning point in Michaels life came from hatred of his father's enemies.<br/><br/>Its fitting that Michael's greed should lead to the misery that is so profoundly communicated in the final see (collapsing dead as an old man) in The Godfather III. In a few seconds we learn the lesson: Greed and hatred can only lead to sorrow and loneliness. Alone in a chair, Michael collapses. We see that he lived the rest of his days (after his daughter's murder) wasting away in Italy, probably unable to gather himself and head back to the United States. We feel sorry for him, but when you think about it, this is the fate that he unwittingly chose. He dies a pathetic shadow of the powerful man that he once was. Despite all his former power and prestige, he dies alone- did he ever truly have any friends, or did he simply surround himself by loyal servants who feared him?"

","Viewed in isolation, ""Godfather III"" is a very good film. The plot is interesting: The Corleone empire tries expand into legitimate business via its connections with the Vatican, as Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) wants to convert into a clean life, something he always promised but never managed; in his quest, he is assisted by Sonny's illegitimate child Vinni (Garcia), who is in love with his cousin Mary (Coppola), Michael's daughter. However things turn sour as there are powerful enemies who also want a share of the pricey spoils originating from this grand deal.<br/><br/>The film manages to keep the mystifying atmosphere and intrigue that we are used to in the ""Godfather"" saga. Moreover, the overall acting ranges from superb (Pacino) to very good (Garcia), with Sophia Coppola being the only unsatisfactory exception. So far, so good.<br/><br/>Yet, ""Godfather III"" can by no means be treated equally as ""G1"" and ""G2"": Although ""G3"" is a very good, 8/10 film, the first two parts were movies with a special magic for which even the 10/10 grade seemed insufficient.<br/><br/>Somebody in this site suggested that the Godfather epic should finish with the touching last scene in ""G2"", in which we watch Michael, who after ordering Fredo's death, he stands lonely and miserably, pondering a family flashback. I have to admit that up to a point I could subscribe to this point of view; Perhaps the ""Godfather"" saga could have finished there. Still, I am not so sure: After all, it is fair to say that ""G3"" connects nicely to the previous parts, and although it lacks their magic, it is still a very good movie. After all, the last scene of ""G3"" is quite touching as well..."

","Yes, yes, yes...we all know that Sophia Coppola is lousy here. But while her part was an important one, the movie doesn't revolve around her. If you allow one of the supporting actors to ruin an entire film for you, I pity you.<br/><br/>There's a complex, captivating story going on here. Of course it doesn't capture the same magic that the first two films did, but that would be impossible. This is a story about a tortured soul, a man desperate to escape his past but who never will. It's fascinating because Michael is overwhelmed by guilt and remorse for the decisions he's made over the decades, but even with the benefit of hindsight he doesn't see how he could have done anything different (and the audience needs to contemplate whether or not this is true). Meanwhile, this character study is all wrapped up in a riveting story of political intrigue, corruption, and deception.<br/><br/>Pacino is his usual brilliant self. Garcia puts in a great performance and really does remind you of Sonny. Talia Shire (nepotism isn't all bad!) does a wonderful job as well, showing us a Connie who's evolved into a frighteningly cold and vicious woman. Probably the most underrated actor here is Eli Wallach as Don Altobello, a worthy foe for a criminal mind like Michael's. Yes, it was a mistake for Coppola to cast his daughter, who was a complete amateur at that time. And in an obvious attempt to replicate the assassinations/baptism scene from the original, Puzo and Coppola tried too hard and the result was an overly complicated and slightly confusing finale. But overall, this is one fantastic movie.<br/><br/>A final thought (MINOR SPOILER HERE): Pacino's performance in the final scene, on the steps of the opera house, is one of the most incredible acting displays I've ever seen. Never in my life have I seen such believable anguish and pain."

Sophia Coppola has since proved herself as a darned fine writer and director -- a good thing, since she's an abysmally bad actor. The young Anthony Garcia doesn't have half the chops, or a quarter of the charisma, as the young Pacino or the young DeNiro did, and THAT's why we're not likely to see a Godfather, Part IV anytime soon.

","It really says something about a film when, even when it's the weakest of a trilogy, still manages to be a fantastic film too. While The Godfather Part III doesn't manage to scale the heights of the first two films, this still manages to be a powerful film and brings the story of the Corleone dynasty to a gut wrenching conclusion. The continuation of Michael's story, this time as an older man whose life has moved on to new areas since the second film has a lot to recommend it and it is truly not the disaster that many claimed it was when first released. The central performance of Al Pacino is extraordinary. Filmed in 1990, just when every other Pacino performance was all about screaming and shouting dialog, here he manages restraint as a man burdened with the guilty conscious of ordering the execution of his own brother, a piece of character development that leads to a brilliant moment where Pacino confesses his sins. Pacino's performance here is one of his best in his latter day career when every line of dialog he utters in any other film tends to be said with the volume turned up, but here he brings back that wonderful quality he had during the first two films as well as his career in the 70's.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a highly mixed affair. Andy Garcia joins the cast as Vincent Corleone, the illegitimate son of Sonny and is superb. How his acting career floundered after this film is quite strange, but he settles into his character fantastically here. Good looking in the same way Pacino and De Niro were (sun tanned skin and thick dark hair), he looks the part and plays it fantastically. Being the son of Sonny the character has a fiery temper and Garcia plays it with the relish you would expect. When it comes to the romance with Michael's daughter, Garcia brings more of a Pacino/De Niro sensitivity to part, making it a wonderful hybrid of a performance that is fantastic to watch. Diane Keaton, once again, is superb as Kay and her scenes with Pacino are once again some of the highlights of the film. So, what makes the casting more mixed this time around? Well Sofia Coppola is the biggest weak link here. Looks wise she doesn't look like Pacino or Keaton and her acting ability is adequate at best. Original choice was Winona Ryder and it makes one quick to point out she would have been a better choice. Then there's George Hamilton as Michael's new lawyer, Tom Hagen having died off screen at some point. His performance is not bad, but he looks out of place in a film like this.<br/><br/>In saying that, the script from Coppola and Puzo is once again marvelous, Coppola's direction is as assured as one would expect and the conclusion is shocking and downbeat. The fact that Michael dies alone gives the ending to the trilogy a very poignant and sad tone, more or less confirming that he was doomed to failure no matter what he tried to do with his life, his family and his business.<br/><br/>This is still a fantastic film and makes this, overall, a superb trilogy."

I didn't like Sofia Coppola's performance because she seemed arrogant and stuck up.  The romance between Mary and Vincent feels forced and so does the rekindled one with Michael and Kay.  There is also a horribly edited scene were Michael has a stroke and the cut between frames moves some of the products around in the kitchen. Probably the most disappointing thing about the film is that it depends upon the prior two movies to explain itself.  A person could watch GFI or GFII and appreciate them independently.

Coppola's transparency and inability to do anything origional with the conclusion, even with his relunctance to do a third, was clearly visible.<br/><br/>For example some uncanny comparsions between 1and3, is the basic parallels which they have, such as there's a party at the start, (the wedding, part 1, the church's recog. of michael, part 3), michael is a mirror image of his father, vito, in terms of morals etc, michael like his dad, is hospitalised, by the consquences of his buisness, there, like barzini, is a young, celebrity gangster, Joey Sasa is backed by a close friend and business partner of michael, and similar to part 1, an assanation plot is carried out.

","Having rewatched this film last night I thought I would post my feelings on it after revaluation.<br/><br/>I would now rate it as being a better film than its 7.2 rating reflects, but I can see why people are so hard on it because all of this films problems were completely self inflicted.<br/><br/>Firstly, skimping on the 2m dollars extra it would have cost to cast Robert Duval as Hagen is just an unforgivable blunder and a horrible example of greed over art. Duval's character would have given the movie a depth and a link to the first two that was sorely missing. Connie and Kay had the emotional family aspect<br/><br/>covered but every scene that involved business was almost sucked into the void left by Hagen.  <br/><br/>Secondly the casting. Gee-whiz. I think enough has been said about Sofia's casting as Mary - its essentially<br/><br/>pointless to elaborate other than to say it was horrible. Also the actor playing Vicent just didn't do it for me. He displayed no depth whatsoever...that may have been deliberate but if so it was a mistake.<br/><br/>BUT...on the positive side, I thought the writing was again excellent, the story was intricate and bloody in keeping with the Godfather tradition and the<br/><br/>directing was again visually plush and rich and always moved at the right pace.<br/><br/>And then there's Pacino. *moment of speechless awe* One of his last great performances before the 'Scent of a Women' Oscar ruined his career. <br/><br/>Lastly, the ending was the best ending of any of the The Godfather films. When Kay and Connie look over at Michael as he screams in anguish they both have<br/><br/>an expression of  shocked understanding as if all his actions are finally<br/><br/>explained - as if after all of the years they are truly seeing him for the very first time. Its a beautiful ending.<br/><br/>I'd give it, in IMDB ratings 8.0/10."

","I'll tell you the truth. This was without a doubt, the worst Godfather film ever made. But you were shown how Michael Corleone ends up at the end. If you think all the way back to the first, he wasn't even supposed to be the Godfather. He was going to live a fruitful life with his great wife but then his brother died who was supposed to take the job as the Don when his father died. Michael never saw this coming. And he ended up doing the best he could yet the job and pressure got to him. His wife hates him, he had to kill his other brother and his wife killed his son soon to be. In this movie you see how incredibly exhausted, angry and sad of what he had done. He wonders and asks God how well he did as the Godfather. He questins his fate. In my opinion, I thought he did great as the Godfather. All he had to do was listen to Tom Hagen. Robert Duvall was fantastic in the Godfather movies. Tom Hagen was the backbone of the family and if he didn't listen to him the whole family goes down and since he did listen to him the family didn't turn out as bad as it did.

","How do you top two of the most acclaimed films of all time? If you are writing a sequel to them, the answer is likely...you don't. But in 1990 Francis Ford Coppola gave it his best shot in his collaborative work with Mario Puzo to create the third (and last) part of the God Father trilogy.<br/><br/>   This third film brings with it a very different atmosphere from the previous two, but a large part of that is that due to the lapse of nearly two decades between the previous sequel. ""God Father III"" is a film of tremendous worth though it does suffer several weaknesses. First I think Coppola lost a lot of series momentum by waiting 16 years to film the concluding episode (A mistake duplicated by George Lucas with his ""Star Wars"" prequels). The returning cast (though a joy to see again) struggled to recapture their old personas with a script over- burdened in very complex Byzantine politics. Another weakness is Coppola's over zealous attempt to underline Michael's quest for redemption. Yes redemption is an appropriate theme for a person such Michael's character, but every screen moment for Pacino is weighed down by his Coppola-imposed ""obligation"" to show his continuous, undying contrition. A scene I think Coppola thought was one of the best (Michael's speech to Dom Tominsino's casket) is actually one of most pointless moments of the film. The screen play is also plagued by a number of very awkward lines (very disappointing given the pedigree of the cast)..Kay's ""You became my nightmare"" was bad,and Connie's ""They will fear you now"" to Michael was very awkwardly delivered, but Mary's calm,proclaimed ""Dad?"" with 9mm gunshot wounds to the chest may have needed the most serious review by the screen editors. The other weakness, pointed out in several IMDB reviews, was Coppola's decision to make Godfather III a ""family affair"". Obviously sister Talia Shire is part of the ""God Father"" institution, and Sophia Coppola tired her best, but a film of this magnitude can't afford to play favorites in it's casting and production. (It's ironic that incest plays a role in the script!) Despite it's flaws, God Father III is certainly a worth while piece. Coppola was able to bring back most of the characters (those who hadn't been killed in the series) while introducing a new protagonist in the character of Vinny Corleone, played brilliantly by a young Andy Garcia. The over all theme of redemption for Michael was also an interesting study, (His garden confession being the most substantive), but again how much further could a man who had his brother killed fall? Even though Michael in his heart may have wanted redemption, he really never does much to ""get out"" of the World he entered as a young man. But again that is what Coppola wanted to emphasize in this coup' de grace of the Coreleone dynasty."

"JohnnyCNote","6","0","1","21 May 2003"," Initially intriguing, ultimately disappointing...
","I was unsure of what to expect of Godfather III. For me, the last great movie Coppola made was Apocalypse Now. His subsequent works, while as technically flawless as any living director's work today, have lacked importance and impact.<br/><br/>I long ago realized the essentially mythological nature of the Godfather movies, but the first two were at least entertaining and featured great ""Coppola"" look. (If you want to see something authentic, watch Goodfellas or Casino, or even the Sopranos.) But the Michael Corleone of Godfather III seemed like a different character. He was a lot more like Tony Montana from Scarface than the Michael from Godfather I and II. He had lost his refined, understated manner and gotten gruffer and craggy. Some of this might be attributed to the aging process, but not to this degree.<br/><br/>The idea of a Mafia don occupying a position analogous to royalty or a statesman is ludicrous, but it can make for an entertaining movie. Unfortunately, this does not carry through the entirety of the film. Up until the time Michael and his family travel to Sicily it kept my interest, but during the final, overly long opera scene I simply wished it would end.<br/><br/>There were other problems too, particularly with the film's timing. If we are to believe that this takes place in the time it was actually made, 1990, Michael would have to be about 70 years old (look at the cars, which are all of that time frame). I arrive at this by estimating his age in the Godfather I, which took place around 1945, as 25, meaning he was born around 1920. When he dies, he looks a LOT older than 70, or even 80, yet the movie does not indicate that 10 or 20 years have passed. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being a bit too picky, and with most any other director I'd agree. But this is Francis Ford Coppola, one of the best directors living today, so I find it not unreasonable to put his work under the microscope.<br/><br/>We are left with the clear impression that Andy Garcia was being set up as the next don, and I'm sure that there will eventually be a Godfather IV. I can only hope that it's not as disappointing as this I found the third installment to be. As far as Coppola goes, I once had the occasion to communicate with a close associate of his. He claimed that Coppola had been very deeply affected by the death of his son, which would explain a lot. Let us hope that he can find a way to overcome his grief and give us a movie truly representative of his immense talents....."

While I respect everyone's opinions, It's just hard to comprehend how people could trash this beatiful and high-drama movie.<br/><br/>Is there that much of a difference and deviation with this movie and Godfather Part I, and II? Francis Ford coppola stays genuine to his style of directing, and the writing for this script was great, while the cinemotography was amazing, and the storyline was intruiging. There isn't too much of a difference between The Godfather Part III and the other ones, so I don't see why critics find this one conspiciously different from the first two.<br/><br/>I actually thought The Godfather Part III was better than Godfather Part II.<br/><br/>Godfather Part I was the best by far. It's a perfect, beautiful movie that astounds me every time i watch it. I love the storyline that Michael Corleoni evaded the family's ""business affairs"" in the beginning, but then as the family was dwindling, he assumed responsibility and the RISE of Michael Corleoni begun. AL Pacino is amazing in this movie and so is Marlon Brando's. ****<br/><br/>Godfather Part II- A worthy sequel, but fell short for several reasons. The storyline is complex and obscure. The ""business"" references are odd and almost nonexistent. And most of all, the suspense and the tension is not there, unlike Godfather Part I. Nevertheless, i liked this movie. I thought the flashbacks to the young Veto Corleoni was awesome. While Veto Corleoni was justful and on the rise....Michael Corleoni was suspiciosly unmerciful and on the DECLINE...as he lost Fredo, Kay....***<br/><br/>Godfather Part III- definitely a good end to the trilogy. The suspense and tension is back in this one. It is interesting how Michael Corleoni has matured since his days in the Godfather Part II. He is reconnecting with his family and searching deep within his soul. He repents for his wrongdoings (very powerful scene)...and concedes his trust in Andy garcia, the new godfather in case anything happens. ***1/2"

Of course, the expectations for this movie will be tremendously high, so high that anything less than a spectacular film will be written off as a disappointment.  This is the atmosphere that ""The Godfather: Part III"" was introduced into, an almost impossible situation that even a good movie was destined to fail in.  Which is exactly what ""Part III"" is: a good movie. Taken on it's own, this a good film, with some fantastic actors (Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton), a compelling story, and well directed.  Of course, the problem this movie suffers from is it can't be taken on its own. Presented using most of the same characters, and as the final chapter in one of the most loved film story lines of all time, comparisons to ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"" are inevitable, and this is where ""Part III"" suffers.  It is not the equal of either of the first two movies; not that this would normally be a tragic sin, as 99.9% of all films are not the equal of the first two movies.

""The Godfather: Part III"" is quite simply, one of the most misconceived films ever made. Its incredible the amount of love and effort put into a film that's so mediocre. It is like the black sheep of the family, much like the Fredo in the Corleone family. There is a lot to like about this movie, but it just doesn't jell together.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong? Well, I think one problem is that Coppola should have trusted his original instincts when it came to approaching this film. Coppola originally didn't even want to make this film have ""The Godfather"" in the title. All he wanted, was something conoctating that this was a film about Michael Corleone and his redemption. That's it. While this film is epic in scale, with elaborate set pieces and beautiful scenes, it would have been better to make this film a lot smaller, more personal. Just about all the scenes where Michael deals with his enemies, although they are entertaining, have a been there/done that feel to them. They all feel like Coppola was trying to make an epic even greater than the first two films. Instead, he made a film that seemed strangely impersonal and distant (even though the true subject matter of this film is far from it).<br/><br/>Case in point, take the first long scene, where we meet all the characters again in Michael's party celebrating his charity donations. In the first two films, the long opening scenes had a symbolic significance. The first film's wedding, demonstrated the great Italian cultural heiritage present in the Corleone life. The second film's party, showed Michael's continuing distance from his heiritage, through his acceptance and approval of typical American norms and behaviors. So, my question is, what significance does this first long scene in the third film have? It seems to me, that the only reason this was done, was just because it was done in the last two films. There's no need for a scene like this, it was well established in the last film that Michael destroyed his relationships in order to achieve absolute power. This film should have been about Michael trying to rekindle these fragile relationships (which, in a way it is). Therefore, the introduction of all these new characters, just get in the way of what the film is truly about.<br/><br/>At least though, this first party scene is well filmed and entertaining. The final sequence, the typical montage of violent events that occurs in all these films, is so confusing and inept, that you kind of wonder if Coppola even cared about it.<br/><br/>There are though, very many things to like about this film. It is pretty entertaining on a visceral level. I liked the villians of this film, they were well played, even though I feel that they were unnecessary to the story. Andy Garcia is wonderful as Sonny's bastard son, and Al Pacino and Diane Keaton are great together, and both give great performances. But...<br/><br/>Man, Sophia Coppola is BAD. She is awful. Its strange, because she is such an important character. You have to give Coppola credit though, because she was a risk. By casting a nonactress in this role, Coppola was trying (I think) to show a person of complete innocence and their relationship with a father who they think the best of (which is far from the truth). She is like Jar Jar Binks in this way, a failure that is noble just because it was a risk, though misconceived she was. But, I wish I could say she was a bad actress, at least then there would be something to analyze. But she almost seems like an extra even when doing emotional lines. She doesn't even act, which is the worst thing you could ever say about a performance. I heard that Wyona Ryder was originally cast in this role. Obviously, that choice was a lot better, but what are you gonna do?<br/><br/>Also, the actor that plays Michael's son fares little better. Its not really his fault though. The idea that he would become the star of an Italian opera, just getting out of school, is really ridiculous. Also, for a guy who's so important to the story, he sure has a small part! I wish there was some way they could have gotten Robert Duvall to come back, because Tom Hagen, really my favorite character in the whole Godfather saga, is sorely missed.<br/><br/>Still, I'm giving this film a 6. I think its because it is entertaining, and the scenes where Michael comes into grips with his sins, and tries for reconciliation, are powerful moments overwise sorely missing in this film.<br/><br/>Score: 6 Grade: B-"

His famous quote:""Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!"" is my favourite. I thought the death of Mary was a very cruel punishment for Michael who cherishes his daughter. It's as if it is a punishment for his guilt of killing his own brother. The all-mighty Don Michael Corelone fell with absolute anguish and sorrow seeing his own daughter dying in his arms. Al Pacino protrayed the desperate Michael right on target. Sofia Coppola is a lovely Mary, and Andy Garcia is a great addition to the cast as the bastard son of Sonny.

So yes, it is a bit of a let-down. But in terms of narrative scope, mis-en-scene, music, cinematography & design, it is almost flawless.<br/><br/>I say almost, because there are a few obvious problems: 1. The non-inclusion of Tom Hagen, a crucial character who was killed off when Robert Duvall turned the film down. 2. The ""kissing cousins"" sub-plot - unnecessary, and as Don Michael Coreleone says himself: ""its wrong...and its dangerous."" 3. Remember the line: ""Hey cuzz...""? Does it send a shudder up your spine? Because its a reminder of how Sophia Coppolas sub-par performance almost wrecked the film. Actually, she was a last minute replacement for  Winona Ryder, who at the time had suffered a nervous breakdown - perhaps she needed some ""retail therapy"" to recover? heheheh....<br/><br/>Anyway,the film does tie together the Corleone saga together quite nicely, bringing the viewer a sense of and closure and finality. Pacino - as per usual - is superlative as he chronicles Michael's search for redemption. The scene in the Sicilian dining room with his wary ex-wife Kay (an understated and underrated performance from Diane Keaton) really evokes a sense of regret, and ultimately forgiveness. It is quite emotionally draining whilst simultaneously profound, as is the scene in the picturesque garden as Michael confesses his sins to the priest.<br/><br/>Part 1 saw Michael as a sensitive, obedient young man who was initially unwilling to carry on his father's mantle. Part 2 sees him as a cold, omnipotent leader who shuts himself off from both his enemies and his loved ones. By Part 3 he has become vulnerable, falliable and all too human, as he tries to change both his professional and family lives.. but as in most crime films, your past indiscretions always come back to haunt you...<br/><br/>In a nutshell, not as superb as the first two, but a damn fine film nonetheless, 8/10.

When you saw the three parts quite closely in time you really have a feeling of `déjà vu' which suppresses the suspense. Things here seems too superficial and put together only to answer all the questions we could have had in the previous films : how it was possible to act like that with Fredo, how Michael was feeling with his first wife and then with Kay. But, any of us could have made nearly the same answers and while in part II things seemed a bit too hard, here things seem a bit too nice  with respect to people feeling. For me, the only good part of the film is the enigma around the Vatican, which is inspired by a real life fact. The film gives its own interpretation of it and it is rather pleasant. Michael's daughter is a bit empty and the relationship between Michael and his children sounds more or less queer."

","Just to get this out of my system, i'm going to yuk it up about the Sophia casting call by suggesting they should have replaced Andy Garcia with Nicholas Cage.   Har!  But seriously, I understood the fact that Coppola was trying to capture a photo gallery of her progression by casting Sophia a part in all three movies.  But uhhhhh, with all close feelings aside, did you really think she was the most appropriate person to take up such a vital role?  <br/><br/>Quick note about the movie- Obviously what people have been coming around to realize is that the Godfather III is a last act in a complete parable about the consequences of taking such a destructive path in life.  It comes full circle in the end, consuming Micheal Corleonne and everything he knows.  If you reference back to the Godfather part one, Vito's face fell in silent agony when he learned that Micheal had taken up the mafia mantle.  He wanted Micheal to stay clean and run a be a legitimate leader; to provide a link for which Vito could break free of his past.  But he also knew that Micheal was the best suited of his sons to be successful in carrying on family affairs (much to his impending feeling of doom).  Vito knew the consequences of his lifestyle.  It consumed his sons, his family, and the grandchildren that would follow.  The sins of the fathers were visited down upon the coming generations.  And it consumed and destroyed them.  The whole thing plays out like a modern day Shakespearean.  Bravo."

","I really have no idea why Godfather Part 3 is rated that bad? To my mind part 3 is even better than part 2. Maybe it is because of the date the film was made: 1990...it is possible that people are sick of Mafia-Films and don't like that kind of film anymore. I think Andy Garcia actually was the best choice that could be made as THE NEW DON! He is handsome, courageous and dynamic. But I cannot say that part 3 can be compared to part 1. The mafia ambiance is still there but Al Pacino is trying to become legal with his business. This may be the only point to critic the movie. All in all I think it is a movie that should be watched if you are a fan of mafiafilms. My personal rating: 8.5/10"
"jambuba","10","0","1","4 May 2001"," Just as good, if not better
","Contains one small spoiler<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I had decided I had lived enough of my life not to see the Godfather trilogy (since I was not even a thought when they first came out!) so over the span of a month I watched all three.  They are all AWESOME films.  And I have to say, the third one is the best.  It finished the movies up and gave a much closer look into what Michael (AL Pacino) was thinking.<br/><br/>
Yes the third is very different from the first two but that is how it should be.  Unlike the first two Michael is trying to truly come clean.  The one thing that hurt this movie was the weak sub-plot about the Vatican funds etc.  They didn't really explain it well enough and so me as the viewer could care less about what was happening and it was a big part of the movie.<br/><br/>
The biggest part of the movie though is definintly the view on the family, just as the first two were.  The family evolved in each and every movie. I wish they would make a fourth one with Vincent as the new Don.  But sadly that wont ever be happening.  Don't just see this movie.  See the entire trilogy, even if you have seen it before.  And don't expect it to be just like the first to, because it is not, a different message is being conveyed in the third one.  The message of forgivness and repentance and how the evils of the past come back to haunt you."
"sehguhc19","Null","0","1","7 April 2001"," A great film with some minor, yet pivotal flaws.
","`Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in,' exclaims an exasperated Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) after learning that his family was lured back into the tangled web of the mafia. It was now 1979 and the Corleone family had been legitimate for several years until they were forced to regain their status as an active mafia family, due to the fear of Michael being assassinated. Director Francis Ford Coppola's saga of the Corleone crime family is brought to a close in this film, The Godfather Part III. In this final installment, Coppola explores an aging Michael, who comes to terms with the wrong he has incurred upon his loved ones and even himself. It also profiles how Michael steps down as the Godfather and hands his reign to Sonny's illegitimate son, Vincent (Andy Garcia). The film also contrasts with the others in terms of Michael and his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton) renewing their relationship and Michael giving up his role as Godfather . 	<br/><br/>In The Godfather Part II, the once strong bond between Michael and Kay was shattered. Michael had alienated her from his personal life and Kay had rebelled against everything that he had stood for. He took their children away and completely (both emotionally and literally) shut her out of his life. In Part III, they slowly regained some of their bond after they had been divorced (and Kay remarried) for several years. For example, when their son Anthony decided that he wants nothing to do with `the family' and that he wants to quit law school and become an opera singer, Kay goes to Michael to discuss that she wants to let him do this. Michael initially disagrees, but then gives his support because he sees how promising his career is (he was invited to sing at a prestigious Sicilian opera house), that he is very passionate about singing and that his not wanting to be in the family echoed what Michael's original plan was. Kay thanked him profusely for this, and strengthened their bond. Also, after learning that his family was once again involved in the mob, Michael had a diabetic stroke and was ultimately hospitalized. When Kay visited him, she remarked that that was the only time when he appeared helpless to her, and less of a threat as he was in the other parts of the saga. They identified more with each other at this time, and it made Kay realize that he wasn't as bad as she had originally thought. Lastly, their bond was strengthened when they united in Sicily to see their son perform. As Kay got into a cab, Michael, disguised as a cab driver, turned around with a friendly `Bonjourno' and gave Kay an insider's tour of his homeland, Sicily. He did this without his usual entourage of bodyguards, and at a time when his life was on the line, this was a great risk made merely to pleasure Kay. Later in his room, they revealed to each other that they always loved each other and Michael revealed that the worst mistake he made in life was letting her go. He came to terms with his existence and tried to mend what was still salvageable in their relationship.<br/><br/>
The Godfather told the story of Michael's ascension into the role of Godfather after his father Vito died. Directly parallel was the story told in the third installment, when Michael gave up his role as Godfather. He was growing older and was a diabetic, and was also disgusted with the life that he had led for a great deal of years. He saw Vincent as a vital and loyal member of his family who was able to run the family. The story told in part three, in my opinion, was a too obvious vehicle of making Michael's position parallel to Vito's and did not have the emotional impact equal to that in part one. Vincent was a one-dimensional character, a combination of the best aspects of Michael and his brother Sonny, who, I think, did not prove himself worthy of being Michael's successor. However, Michael appreciated Vincent's undying loyalty to him and that he had the capacity to care for his family. Vincent's future position was way too obvious from the minute he walked onto the screen because he had no other purpose at Michael's party.<br/><br/>
So was The Godfather Part III a mediocre end the perfect saga? I happen to think so. The basic plot line of Michael getting pulled back into the harsh world of the mafia was an intriguing one, but the details were hazy and the supporting characters were vague and one-dimensional. I consider myself to be an observant film viewer, but I found myself at times getting lost to why some of the details were taking place. The film lost a lot of integrity via the actors cast in pivotal roles. The worst actor in the film (possibly ever) was Sofia Coppola, who played Michael's daughter Mary Corelone. She had a very important role and basically deadpanned all of her lines. In her death scene, she simply flat-lined, `Daddy?' and collapsed. I felt bad for Michael, but couldn't help laughing at her horrifically bad performance. Another example of a bad actor in a pivotal role is George Hamilton, who played Michael's new lawyer, B.J. Harrison. He tried to replace Robert Duval's excellent performance as Tom Hagan, but failed miserably. Instead of being the rock that Michael could depend on, he ultimately became `the boring guy'. My least favorite part of the film was Mary's affair with her cousin, Vincent. Besides being poorly acted by Sofia, this was a pointless vehicle for Vincent to give her up to show his allegiance to Michael. Coppola (Francis Ford) should have found a better way to prove this because it was, quite frankly, sickening. There were many good points to the film as well. I found it satisfying that Michael came to terms with all of the crimes he had executed and that he was conscious of all the lives he had affected. I loved the way he patched his issues up with Kay and ultimately confessed that he never wanted to be Godfather in the first place. In part two, Coppola portrayed him as being relatively cold and unfeeling, but I enjoyed that in part three, we were reminded of his emotional core as portrayed in part one. I also liked that uncovered aspects of the previous films were touched upon, and that they were all cohesive. The third installment was created merely to bring closure to Godfather buffs. When compared to the other two, The Godfather Part III was in fact a mediocre movie and that fans and critics alike expected another brilliant masterpiece. When compared to any other film, it would be better than the rest."

","....I have just finished watching the final chapter in my favorite film trilogy of all time. The Godfather. After watching the first two films, and bathing in there brilliance, I read some very negative comments on The Godfather P:III. These were mainly in the shape of Sophia Coppola's bad acting, but to be honest, I found her acting to be realistic and convincing. The plot of the third film centers around the aging Michael Corleone and his attempts to legitimise his bussiness and find a successor to his empire. This successor comes in the from of Vincent Mancini (Lucy Mancini's and Sonny Corleone's son) portrayed wonderfully by Andy Garcia. But Vincents violent ways of doing things soon pull Michael back into the dark and violent world of the mafia.<br/><br/>This film is a brilliant conclusion to an epic saga. Puzo's and Coppola's script holds the viewer for all 163 minutes. The acting, like all Godfather films, is top notch. Especially Al Pacino, who should have won an oscar for his preformance. It's also nice to see old faces such as Kay, Johnny Fontain, Connie and Al Neary. All though the film is long, you really don't notice it at all, and I thought that the film could have been twice as long. I read elsewhere on the site from a comment that said 'This would be a good staging for The Godfather P:IV, with Vincent running things, while further developing the relationships between Michael, his wife and their son'. But I veiwed the special directors cut version, and from the ending I saw, how could this be possible?<br/><br/>With incredible directing, brilliant acting and an unforgettable ending, The Godfather P:III, all though not a good as its predecesors, is a marvellous film, which beautifully ends an epic saga and is an absolute must for all Godfather and Al Pacino fans alike.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10"

","I have had a luxury that few people have. I have never been exposed to The Godfather series until this past week, when I have rented and watched all three of films. While I feel Godfather I is the best of the 3, and number 2 is also a very strong movie, Godfather III was by far the most intriguing of the trilogy. There is something very special about this film. The contrast of Catholic redemption and Michael's attempts to better himself is enthralling. The use of opera to bring about the tragic end of the movie and the Corleone empire. The then 18 year old actress Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone, who brings about a sweet innocence to the film, who frankly I fell in love with from the moment I saw that scene with Michael dancing with her. Lastly, the tragic Shakespeareanesque ending brings the Corleone family to its final end. Yes, Coppola and Puzo impressed me in their third outing. I have seen the negative comments about this film, and it's the same old garbage you always see concerning sequels. People always try to compare them to the original movie, and in the process they miss out on the great work of art that the sequel is. Lastly, I must say that Pacino was at his greatest in this film. I never thought of him as in the same league as people like DeNiro or Brando, even after watching the first 2 films. But this film changed my mind forever. He brought Michael Corleone to a level rarely achieved by any actor in any movie, much less a sequel, and he has my utmost respect, and I agree with another reviewer who said it was a shame he was passed for an Oscar. But there's nothing new under the sun there, as the Academy hasn't learned anything about rewarding truly great performances."

Although I´m a Godfather fan, this last movie was simply the best of them. Getting the best things from the past and adding some new twists, characters and more individual conflicts. It was not only ""mafia"" or criminals, it was a personal drama. It was the fighting of one man´s soul to get out of the dirt.

","I have always been one who enjoys the `less violent' films of my generation and of course I can't forget the favorites of my grandparents and I, the infamous musicals.  The films that you knew what was going to happen before it happened.  The ones where you know who will end up together and the whole movie pertained to trying to win that special girls heart.  Yes, those kinds of movies have always been my favorites.  The choreography; singing and dancing. Tapping your foot along with the beat always made my day a little brighter.  These kinds of movies I have always watched until The Godfather movie was placed before me.  I was not asked to view this movie for pleasure but instead I was forced to watch it for a class, my grade depended on it. I must say that I have never seen anything like this before.  The intense action, not knowing which way to turn, who to trust, who would betray next, made this movie one of my all time favorites.  Not only do I get the love scenes but I get a thriller.  A spine tingling action-packed movie. Couldn't ask for anything better.  The performance of Al Pacino was magnificent.  The way he brought out his character; the evil, deceitful deeds he preformed all in the name of his family, left me with an exact definition of what a Godfather, a Don, is like.  Robert Duvall put on a fantastic show as the part of Tom Hagen.  Tom was the faithful lawyer and a brother to the Corleone family. Robert helped to create the sense of suspicion in his character.  Robert De Niro played an important role as Vito Corleone.  His splendid job of letting the viewers have the ability to see the similarities between Michael and his father Vito, left me with a specific idea to how and why Michael was the way he was.  The ability to see this, tied the family together in an formal way.  The use of flashbacks into Michael's fathers life helped for me to see how this illegal institution arose and helped to make the certain connections that were not provided in The Godfather (1972). This movie is a fascinating piece to analyze and should be highly judged according to this affiliation.  I need not mention the lighting styles that were chosen for this particular film.  Very clever.  The way the light reflected off of certain objects like the red rose upon Vito Corleone's chest, left me with the vision of blood.  This film was dirty.  It was a film where many killed, but they killed as if the individuals never existed in the first place.  The darkness of the film left me with the sense that these people are evil.  Either you are in the shadow of the Don, only the outline of your figure is visible, or you are a more important person in the life of the Don, in which you were `lighted' when it became necessary to deliver important information. I enjoyed both the Godfather movies, part one and two, but part two still continues to make the hair rise on my arms.  I can watch it over and over and the effect that the movie has on me never changes.  Even though I am not tapping my feet and singing along I definitely think that this is the greatest sequel ever made."

"matzucker","8","0","1","23 October 2000"," Grand, yet underrated conclusion to a magnificent saga
","You might call this film redundant, after what the second part showed us in the end, but then, I guess, you'd also have to call the second part redundant, because the developments in ""The Godfather Part II"" were already alluded to at the end of the original. Therefore, Part III isn't bad at all.<br/><br/>It's not quite as successful as the first two, but that's simply because, throughout the movie, we get a sense of déja vu: ""I've seen that before!"" And you did, alright... But it still works, that formula of blood and gore, family traditions, shady meetings behind closed doors, politics and business... you know the routine. It's captivating, thrilling and suspenseful throughout, especially the opera sequence at the end, which can definitely measure up to the legendary baptism scene in the original. This is as good as directing gets. Period.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a few weak points in this film, one of which is Sofia Coppola, who simply can't carry the weight of the part she's given. But well, that's what happens when you cast your  daughter (who happens to be a mediocre actress) in your movies. Ask Aaron Spelling!<br/><br/>Al Pacino shines as always in the part of his life, as does Diane Keaton, and several others. I would've wished for someone else than Andy Garcia, who's nothing like Pacino in the original, to play Vincent, but it's an OK choice, though.<br/><br/>Especially beautiful about this third part is that now the whole Corleone saga comes full circle with Michael's realization that crime just isn't the way to protect a family. The same thing his father realized before he chose Michael, his calmest, most considerate son, as his successor. Both learned their lesson the hard way and entrusted their empire to someone who'll most likely destroy it in the long run. Even Michael's final scene mirrors Vito's exit in the original.<br/><br/>Overall, a very fine film that, although not exactly in the league of its predecessors, is severely underrated and makes for a satisfying conclusion to the saga.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

I mean common are you guys kidding ? I love Winona Rider as an actress but ..... gimme a break here PUH-LEEEEASE !<br/><br/>Sofia Coppola got a bad rap in GodfatherIII from day one. I happen to be an American of Secilian parents and Secilian  upbringing. I think she was PERFECTLY cast as the don's daughter. Since she is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter we are to  assume that she was placed in the movie as a result of blatant nepotism .... WELL I DON'T AGREE ... I think F. F. Coppola  has a pretty good idea of what he is doing and has proven that with his track record. He brought many many personal idea's to the filming of the original Godfather movie which enriched Puzo's story tremendously without altering it one  iota. As I recall Coppola's wife designed the entire wedding segment in 'The Godfather' ... I have been to a LOT of Italian weddings and I challenge ANYONE to tell me that those scenes weren't PERFECT representations. I think F.F. Coppola hit a home run by casting his daughter in this film !<br/><br/>Sofia Coppola played that part in Godfather III and represented her character as well as it could have been presented. To give you an example of how stupidly other's would cast a film ... did you know that people in the industry actually argued that Robert Redford and Charles Bronson be considered for the role of Michael in Godfather I ???<br/><br/>If you MUST knock something then knock the Connie Carleone character. In the first two movies Connie Carleone Rizzi was an Italian American. In 'Godfather III' she becomes an American Italian.

"dust-7","Null","0","1","31 May 2000"," Good in part - but not necessarily as The Godfather
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>A good film, in two parts. If this had been the only Godfather ever released, it might have been up for the academy award. That's all on its own; particularly as it was a 1990 film, and films were starting to get a tad weaker, in general, by that point.<br/><br/>But it a) must not necessarily be seen as a sequel to the Godfather, and b) it might be seen as the most 'operatic' or Shakespearian of the bunch. It's not the sequel because it's no longer really the Puzo series, and the characters seem a bit different. The Godfather characters are sort of borrowed for this film, you could say. And I thought of classic drama and opera as soon as the assassin was introduced. He's sort of Shakespeare's simultaneously clumsy and comical competent killer.<br/><br/>What gets weird is the Vatican Bank story leeching into the election of JP I. We are to believe that Don Corleone has a private confession with the cardinal before he is elected Pope; and of course, the Don in short order goes ahead and orders the purge of assorted gangsters, just like he did in the previous film. But . . . And we are further to believe that an archbishop conspirator in the scandal literally poisoned the tea of JP I, and killed him. Now the poison in the drink is also the stuff of classic drama. And I'd take it for that. But as history, it seems laughable. Don Michael's order in the movie end purge literally includes this evil renegade archbishop, to the point of having some gunman lurking in the shadows shoot him, in the Vatican, as he walks up a winding staircase. The cardinal is seen plummeting over the side and falling down onto the worm's eye camera in the gallery below. Again - operatic, yes. Metaphorical fiction, sure. Characters as types even more than characters - yes. A Godfather I and II, not really. The play is the almost comical (yes, that's right) who gets 'hit' first, almost Shakespearian black comedy, as Ma Corleone goes for the other Don, the other Don goes for Don Michael, maybe the Pope, and the other Corleones hit the hitters, and so on. It all happens simultaneously, as the bunch sit there watching the opera. You have the quick cut to the action happening elsewhere (which is a Godfather trademark technic, to be fair).<br/><br/>I said two parts because the best part seems all these scenes when the family goes to Italy. I think it might have been much better if they'd gone easy on the old mob stuff, frankly, cut out much of the first part, and gone quicker to Italy, stayed with the story there longer, and developed the estrangment and reconciling of father and son - which brought the cast to Italy, to the opera. That part not only isn't developed, it's pretty much not even present - which is a little startling. The final revenge is just sort of dashed off, even after a private confession with the man soon to become Pope. That's just forgotten. That's hard to believe. It might have benefitted from a little of the emoting of the Don's final scream as dear Mary is accidentally shot by the goofy but dangerous assassin, rather than just a calm - hey, let's get revenge.<br/><br/>Of course, such a suggested movie would be even more of a departure from Godfather I and II than this film was. But it seems that's the direction 'Francis' wanted to go, but didn't have the guts, perhaps, to go all the way. As for his daughter in the role, she obv. had trouble with the acting. But it wasn't that bad. As for Keaton, she just didn't seem all there, like she was just reading her lines. As for Shire, I thought she was good - same for Garcia. I thought the cameo by now SF Mayor Willie Brown was appropriate, trying to line up crooked judges. As for Pacino, himself, I kept flashing on Dick Tracy given his delivery of some of those lines. But again . . hey. As for a comparison with the contemporaneous Goodfellas, this film shows more the uselessness of gangsterism than the off and on glorification found in Scorsese's somewhat less than epic film. The best scene in this regard might be the final scene. Long shot of the 90ish (?) near death husk of the great Don Michael, who 'never wanted to be Don', sitting next to a dilapidated Italian villa on a folding chair or something, reading the paper, just going limp and falling off the chair - dead. End of story, cut to credits. That's it. That's what his life amounted to. Regrets and remorse of his daughter's murder filling his thoughts. Maybe even a life never really even lived. Seemed more telling than anything in Scorsese's film."

"krumski","8","0","1","11 March 2000"," Fully worthy of the Godfather name
","What's the deal with the slagging this film has taken? Ok, so it's not as good as the first one (few films are), but it's a more than worthy wrap-up to the series, teeming with all the elements that make the Godfather saga so engrossing: strong characters, shadowy back-room negotiations, elaborate plotting and double crossing, shocking yet fantastically orchestrated violence and, finally and most memorably, an operatic finale which is a masterpiece of cross-cutting between ritual and acts of murder. If the film sags around the edges, well - that's entirely appropriate too, since Michael Corleone, its lead character, is himself now aging and frail. It is as if each of the Godfather films takes its cue from Michael's metabolism: the first is full of zest and youthful exuberance, the second is cold, hard and opaque, and the third is creaky and totters on the brink of collapse. Many take this as a fault of the film, when really it is the perfect mirror of the soul of Michael himself. As such, the weariness which pervades the entire story is poignant and heartbreaking, not the result of bad filmmaking.<br/><br/>The acting is all first rate, as is expected by now in a Godfather film. As Sonny Corleone's bastard son Vincent Mancini, Andy Garcia makes a strong impression and the push-pull between he and Pacino - the young hothead vs. the wisened and calculating veteran - gives the film its edge, and its unique place in the Godfather canon. It is slightly unbelievable that Michael would have no one else to turn over the running of the family to besides Vincent, a tangential relation at best, but since it works dramatically you tend to overlook the flaw in logic. Likewise, the scenes between Michael and Kay carry a special charge; though written near the level of soap opera, the fact that it is actually Pacino and Diane Keaton sitting across from each other, and that we feel we have shared so deeply in their history together, breathes a curious kind of nobility and sadness into them. Like everyone else, I missed Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, but even his absence serves, in an ironic way, to underline the theme of Michael drifting toward the end of his life, losing all his associations along the way; the loneliness and solitariness which enveloped him by the end of the second movie have not gone away, and his attempts to fight against and deny this fact is what gives his character real tragic dimension here.<br/><br/>Ok, just a word on Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary. No, she's obviously not a trained actress and her readings are a little flat, but you know what? It doesn't make that much difference. Her character exists more as a symbol to Michael of innocence and incorruptibility than as a true three-dimensional personage. As such, she at least has the right look and feel - I can imagine her as Pacino's daughter in a way I don't think I ever could have bought Winona Ryder (who was originally to play this role). What I'm saying here is that, while she's not great, she does what she needs to do and she in no way sinks the film - if for no other reason than that her screen time isn't large enough to do so. And for those of you who laughed at her in the climactic scene, I can only point out that this is *Pacino's* dramatic moment, not hers; if you can look upon his soul-chilling reaction and still not be moved, then I think there must be something fundamentally dead inside you.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great film, with a plot line that is at times admittedly hard to follow, but not nearly as much as the one in Part II. And this one has a better cast of characters - just think of it, the Corleones getting into business dealings with the Vatican!  The audacity of this storyline alone should make it beloved to all true Godfather fans. And some of the violence here - including the helicopter assault in Atlantic City, the murder of Joey Zasa on the streets of Little Italy, and most notably the new and wildly unexpected use found for a pair of reading glasses - is as brilliant and memorable as anything in the first film, and supersede the second one entirely. In short, Godfather III makes a great wrap up to the entire saga, and earns its full place in the family history; it's no mere footnote, but a great and satisfying film all its own."

","Alright, already. Coppola himself says he would have given the picture another name, but calling it the Godfather sells tickets (and everyone would've called it a sequel anyway). Look, filmmaking is a business, like any other ... he can't sit around and think up ways to satisfy a handful of Puzo puristas.<br/><br/>About the movie? BRILLIANT! My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me? This isn't even a gangster movie and, heaven forbid, from a humanist point-of-view it is a much better film than I or II (which may as well be the same movie, the pace just picks up near the end of the 6 hour saga). Even those who have never seen the original will bask in the glow.<br/><br/>The personal redemption of on-again-off-again Don Michael Corleone is almost secondary to the cultural tragedy in a story of well-to-do Italian-American family (the Coppolas) and their struggle with maintaining influence in a business and legal world more corrupt than the Sicily their grandparents left behind (Hollywood) -- and in the role of the spoiled-rich daughter with human longings, who better than the original article (Sofia)? I almost cried during her performance (and I'm a guy). What other actress could possibly have brought to the role the same authenticity?<br/><br/>Power struggles among men never cease, and the higher one rises in this world the thinner the air gets. The air is cleaner and purer, no doubt, but it can also make the subject dizzy and exhausted. Look at Talia Shire and Andy Garcia's characters -- Connie is finally in love with life after 45 years of being an airhead and ready to kick some ass. And the ""God's Banker"" saga merely illustrates the ridiculousness of attempting to buy salvation, since men of the cloth are last one's you should trust with your money because they have the least experience managing it. Incest is there because (as the operetta says) the power-hungry are fated to desire (and suffer for) that which they cannot possess (esp. rich cousins).<br/><br/>In conlusion, the Corleones in III are _any_ of your families that have busted their balls to be something, only to find that the more they possess, the harder they have to fight to keep it. Maybe even some of the younger generations got sacrificed along the way. The elements of Greek tragedy planted by colonists 2500 years ago in Sicily became cultural cliches because they were the truth; they speak to us today because we wish they were not."

","Okay, I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but here goes. First off, there are in fact, two flaws that hurt the film: casting of Sofia Coppola and the missing Robert Duvall. If you can look past these things, you will discover this movie is a masterpiece. For so many years, I would watch Part II and lament that Michael killed Fredo, that he lost his wife, and allowed the power to consume him. Part III addresses all of that. It is Michael's story again that one needs to watch and forget the things going on around him. I also liked the way the movie continued to borrow from reality with the Vatican plot. The movie is about guilt and redemption. Michael's confession, the meeting of all the mafiosos, the final scene on the steps, and the horribly tragic epilogue are all easily as memorable as anything in the others. Perhaps because it wasn't as much as a period film as the first two and so much time passed between II and III that it didn't feel like a ""real"" Godfather movie to some. I say the music, direction and themes of the movie are right in there. After all, Puzo and Coppola wrote this one as well. The scenes with Diane Keaton are sad and full of regret. Andy Garcia is excellent and a worthy addition to the characters. I was moved by this one more than the others. Part I is entertaining in a cartoonish way, Part II takes about 10 viewings to get everything, but Part III settled down and addressed Michael and his real feelings of loss. Forget the obvious flaws and look a little deeper. The irony is delicious."

","""The Godfather III"" (1990) is no cinematic masterpiece as its two predecessors are, but it is definitely worth watching. The acting is brilliant, especially the scenes with Al Pacino and Diane Keaton. Have you ever had a friend, relative or lover you were so close to for years but now only see them every so often, maybe every two years? If so I think ""The Godfather III"" will have that kind of emotional effect on you. Andy Garcia gives an excellent performance as Vincent, a well-deserved Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I've liked him since I first saw him in Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"" (1987). He has this slick coolness about him. He plays Sonny Corleone's kid, and displays some of the same mannerisms.<br/><br/>
So much has already been said of Sofia Coppola's poor screen presence. I feel bad for the poor thing really, hope she didn't take all the criticism personally. Let me just say this about the fatal casting of Sofia Coppola (Francis' daughter): Francis Ford Coppola was almost forced into making this movie; he was millions of dollars in debt so it wasn't made out of passion like the earlier two 'Godfathers'. The film is very disoriented in some parts and the characters' dialogue unintelligible in others. ""The Godfather"" movies are about a powerful mafia family, made by an Italian-American family. Francis and Talia Shire are brother and sister; Carmine Coppola is their Dad; and Nicolas Cage, Francis' nephew executive produced this film. And now we have Sofia. It's a shame about her casting really. The final scene in the film would've played much better if she hadn't been such a paper-cut character.<br/><br/>But the set pieces, cinematography and art-direction are all wonderful. I loved the locales in both Sicily and Rome. And this film does have the same feel of the previous two, its own language so to speak, so you can enjoy it on that level despite its major flaws.<br/><br/>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Music by Carmine Coppola (who died the following year movie was released). 170 minutes (Final Director's Cut)."

There should never be another in this series, leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>Now, back to the Mary casting: I cannot *believe* that a man as brilliant and intelligent as F.F. Coppola would be so arrogant as to nepotistically cast an unproven, ineffective actress in a central role like Mary. Unbelievable. It's the only taint on the entire series of films.<br/><br/>One of the best moments of the film: when Vincent is brought into the room with Zasa and is trying (unsuccesfully) to control himself, as he says, ""What am I gonna do with this guy, eh?"" he does a body movement that makes you swear James Caan is back playing Sonny.

And it has its minuses--an irrelevant subplot concerning the Vatican,  the annoying George Hamilton, and of course the miscasting of Coppola's daughter in the small but key role of Mary.

The movie may have come too late for people to remember the events, but they are still definitely mysterious enough to form the stuff of hundreds of films.  If anything, public knowledge about what happened barely scratched the surface, and why shouldn't an American Mafia family have been involved in the financial dealings?  What spoiled it for me slightly is that I constantly kept asking myself why the movie is expressly set in 1979 - the actual events including the deaths of the popes were in 1978.

","I must admit I came into this movie expecting the worst, as person after person has told me that this movie, while decent, doesn't compare to the first two. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself disagreeing with them.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie even more than Godfather II, although I admit it doesn't approach the first film... but then again, so few things do. I thought that both Vincent and Anthony Corleone were superbly cast, not only for their acting, but for the fact that Vincent looks SO much like a young Michael and Anthony looks even more like Sonny. <br/><br/>*Spoiler Start*<br/><br/>The movie includes many great scenes, such as when Michael tells Vincent that he may now call himself a Corleone, and his men gather around a sitting Vincent, kissing his hand and calling him ""Don Corleone"", the same way they did to Michael at the end of the first film. I particularly loved the scene where Michael, seeking to repent for his sins, swears on the lives of his children that if God gives him the chance, he will not sin again... yet no more than 5 minutes later, he gives Vincent the order to carry out the murder of several men. He swore on the lives of his children.. and that's what he ends up losing.<br/><br/>*Spoiler End*<br/><br/>It's a true shame that Sofia Coppola had to be in this movie. I am not a person that likes to nitpick the nuances of every acting performance, but she is simply a horrible actress. It's particularly a shame because she does a lot to spoil the climax scene of the movie, which should be particularly dramatic. Thankfully, she doesn't have all that many lines, and at least looks good.<br/><br/>Unlike Godfather II, which, while a very good film, I found to be rather disjointed and difficult to follow (the Young Vito storyline seemed too slow and drawn out, while the Michael storyline moved so quickly that I, at times, wasn't sure what exactly was going on), this installment follows a similar plot line to the first movie, right down to the multiple executions at the end, set to a Sicilian opera instead of the words of an Italian priest. The simplicity and flow of the stories in I and III made them all the more engrossing to me."
"ericjg623","8","0","1","23 March 2002"," A more personal ""Godfather"" movie
","As with ""Star Wars - The Phantom Menace"", this film took a lot of hits for not being a worthy successor to the original series, but in both cases I disagree. I'm certainly not going to argue that G-III is the best, but it is nonetheless a worthwhile film in its own right. <br/><br/>For starters, it is different from the first two, and not just because of the time difference. Just as the real life actors had aged nearly two decades since G-II, so does the setting of the film, which takes place in 1979. I think one aspect that hardcore fans really missed was the lack of a stellar supporting cast, it's interesting to note in both earlier films the large number of nominations for Best Supporting Actor & Actress Awards, whereas in this film the only nomination was Andy Garcia (who, incidentally, did not win). For the most part, this is Al Pacino's movie, and it is also the first time we really get to see him (or the rest of the Family, for that matter) as real human beings. In the first two films, the Family is almost like a machine  ruthless, ambitious, and able to crush anyone who gets in the way. Vito Corleone and his sons and lieutenants operate in a world of cold rationality, when the Godfather wants to put the squeeze on someone he `reasons' with them and if that fails to persuade he makes `an offer they can't refuse'. In the first film Mike decides to kill the Turk and the crooked cop because it's the logical, rational solution to the problem of protecting his father from a rival. Later, Mike has his brother-in-law, and later still, his actual brother, killed, all in the name of protecting the Family.<br/><br/>This film is quite different. The point where this hit me was about halfway through when Mike, back in Sicily, is making his confession to a priest. Initially, I thought, it's just a scam, he's only doing it to set someone up or get valuable information. That's what we'd expect of a Corleone, the sort of ruthless cynicism that allows you to manipulate anything, even a solemn religious ritual, for nefarious ends. But it's not that at all, Michael is genuinely remorseful for much of what he's done, most notably Fredo's murder. In another scene, he addresses the corpse of Don Tommasino (the guy who protected him when he was a fugitive in Sicily years earlier) and asks, `Why were you so loved, when I was so feared?' He's also trying to heal rifts with both his kids and his ex-wife. The whole tone of the movie is much more up to date. The women are much more prominent. Kay, his ex, still has feelings for Mike, but she's also managed to run her own life with the kids separate from him. This would have been unthinkable to a Mafia wife a generation earlier. And Connie, who in the original was little more than a whiny human punching bag for her husband, is now as cold and dangerous as her brother. In short, their lives are a far cry from that of Mama Corleone, whose job it was to shut up, take care of the kids, and keep food on the table for the boys. It must be noted, however, that none of the feminism or `touchy-feely' stuff gets in the way of some good old fashioned Corleone style violence, most notably at the end, when, in a move that is reminiscent of the end of G-1, Mike arranges to wrap up all the `loose ends' in the span of just a few hours. <br/><br/>Anyway, the plot is somewhat convoluted. There's a big business deal going between the Corleone family and the Vatican and of course the usual corruption and payoffs. Trying to keep track of the various characters and their machinations was difficult at times, but that's really not all that important. What this movie really is about is Michael Corleone having to finally come to terms with the life he's lead and what it's done to his family. It is less a story than a look at the personal side of both him and his family and, most importantly, what all the power, money, and `respect' has cost all of them. <br/><br/>8/10"

I love the Godfather Part III, especially because it is so different from the other two movies. I would have bored to see it go on in the same fashion as the Part I and II, because it already has been done.<br/><br/>It is like my husband says a chick flick, because it involves a lot of feelings and it does not concentrate so much on the action as the other two. It is the story about how Michael Corleone realises that money and power isn't everything, if you don't have the right people to back you up (Kay and the children).<br/><br/>As an audience it is a relief to see that the old Michael now realises that he failed something terribly to run the family business that his father established and that it now troubles him that he had his own brother killed. (the scene where the line `Just as I thought I was out, they pulled me back in', when Michael called out Fredo's name when he has the diabetes attack, you realised that the old man does not has a lot of time left and he is changing).<br/><br/>Yes, Sophia Coppola was terrible as the role as Mary (Michael's daughter) even if she hadn't been the Directors daughter, but her co-actors made up for it, so it wasn't that bad. Some people laughed when Mary died (because of Sophia's acting), I didn't even see her reaction the first time I saw the movie, because I was so focused on Michael. I think this scene is very moving and it breaks your heart to see the old Don suffer like that over the loss of what he had tried so hard to protect since the first Godfather film.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of not having Michael's own son take the place of the new Don, it would had been too obvious, so having the b**tard nephew come in trying to impress Michael was great, because in the beginning I didn't know if Vince wanted the Corleone's blessing or revenge for not being accepted in the past. I also liked the idea of having Connie having more say in the family business, as a woman, was a good twist to the usual Corleone family tradition where it is run by the males.<br/><br/>I think that Robert Duvall was missed in the film as Tom Hagan, but the character George Hamilton played was pretty good, because you didn't really know his character well enough to get the feeling that you could trust him as one of Michael's people, which made a little more mysterious.<br/><br/>Eli Wallach's character is one of my favourite, I think he should have a lot of credit to this movie, he did a great performance.<br/><br/>Some say that Michael should have been killed in the scene where Mary dies. For me that would have ruined it, because seeing Michael die peacefully (kind of like his own father did) is great, because it makes him suffer more for his sins, to die old when his child died young, perfect punishment.<br/><br/>To grade this movie, I would give it 8 out of 10."

It does show that his passion for the project dwindled. The movie does not have the freshness and detail of the other 2. But that being said it is not the total loss that many people make it out to be. The story is basically similar to Godfather 1, set in 1979, Michael Corleone is in his 60's and is trying to realize his dream of legitimizing his family business,of course he is naive in thinking that he could wash away his past and his sins, this film presents Michael as a tired man, a man that is so guilt ridden that he could hardly smile, those who know that series will understand what I'm referring to. Al Pacino plays it close to perfect, he is a man beaten, weary of all his mistakes, his heart is broken. I feel that the time that was spent in between the making of the second one and this was too long, the film doesn't achieve greatness, it does give a fitting end to the Corleon saga.

The acting was great if not solid all the way around. I only think Sofia Coppola was miscast and it would've been awesome to have Winona Ryder as planned. Andy Garcia did a really good job as Vincent. George Hamilton was solid as BJ Harrison, Tom Hagen's replacement.<br/><br/>My problem with III is that it seems to much time has passed. I would've preferred a storyline, like part 1, that goes on for several years simply because the character of Michael seems to be Michael only in name. I would've preferred more of a transition from the ""evil"" Michael in II to the one we see in III. I did enjoy that Michael was busting his butt trying to go legit because it was what he wanted in Part 1 and time was running out.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned that it was hard to believe that Michael would leave the family in the hands of a hot-head like Vincent, which I can understand. However, I think they did a fairly decent job of showing scenes in which Michael was teaching Vincent the ropes. It also didn't help that Anthony, Michael's son, didn't want anything to do with the family business.<br/><br/>
About the only thing that really bothered me about III is the lack of closure it gave the very important character of Tom Hagen. I missed Robert Duvall big time. All in all, I think III is a well-crafted sequel that is extremely good in its own right. Never mind that pretentious notion that true Godfather fans pretend III doesn't exist. If III is hard to watch, it's only because it's sad that there probably won't be more Godfather films coming and the film shows the characters we loved so much in the twilight of their years."

I had some problems with another casting choice: what was Briget Fonda doing in this?<br/><br/>
Andy Garcia was really good in the part of Vincent Mancini, and Richard Bright was solid as Al Neri, a hold over from the earlier Godfather films. There are some really good actors in lesser roles like John Savage (from the Deer Hunter and Salvador). Cast as Tom Hagans son Andrew, Savage plays a preist who is thus removed (unfortunately) from the family business. His talents arent utilized nearly enough in this flick.<br/><br/>Overall its a good movie, and an interesting look at the Corleone family 20 years later. But anyone expecting something along the lines of Godfather 1 quality will be let down."

","Part one and two were masterpieces, part three, although not completely having the power of the first two movies, does have something that sets it apart, the focus on one character, Pacino's Michael, the themes of redemption are powerfully acted, Oscar worthy, in my opinion Pacino's all time best performance, people are quick to look at some flaws like Coppola' daughters' acting, but its a small hole to complain about, a excuse to not praise the performance of Pacino and a character so richly put on screen."
"Shervin1982","10","0","2","2 November 2001"," An old family head faces the question to let a family member of his marry his daughter who wants to become the head of the family.
","Godfather Part III is the turning point of michael corleone's life, as he faces the question to go on with his sins and brutality of his family or to choose the next head as he goes down on retirement. The theme of this movie's changed a lot since part II, in which Corleone family was a powerful mob family. Here the Corleone family's been shown as the absolute power and dominating force. The culminating is quite sad which with the enormous play of Al Pacino becomes one of the best emotional scenes in the history of Cinema."

","Weakest sequel of the three. I couldn't help thinking how Michael, who's supposed to be a man in charge, let's things get out of control. Can you imagine the scene where Garcia bites his enemy's ear off happening in the presence of Marlon's Don. Never! He was in control and you were too if you were near him. It's as if Michael never learned anything from his father.<br/><br/>Everyone is talking about Sophia's casting...Garcia's casting is an affront to Italians. He's a Cuban for Pete's sake! He was nominated because of the name of the film. He didn't win and look what he's done since...nothing. He plays the shallow version of Sonny. This film tries to think too much. Tries to be too intriguing. It's neither. Too bad I had to pay for it in the DVD Godfather package, I would have left it in the store."
"taimur74","Null","0","1","13 October 2001"," One of the great performances of the decade
","Yeah yeah everyone knows the gf3 is not as great as the first 2 but dont see this and you're missing out on one of the best performances by any actor in the 90's . I'm talking about Al PAcino reprising his legendary role of Micheal Corleone .He is absolutely magnificent in this role . Hunched over and seemingly defeated but still emanating that intensity and power that was in part 2 . This is surely micheal corleone's saga and pacino does full justice to his role even if the movie does not serve him well . It also has one of the greatest delivered lines in movie history <br/><br/>""Just when i thought i was out they pull me back in """
"Joel-23","Null","0","2","3 January 1999"," Pretty much the same as everybody
","The first time I saw the series of Godfather movies, I saw them all in the same weekend. To move from Michael's innocence to his corruption to his redemption/consequences (anybody think Mary died for Michael's sins?) in such a short time was deeply affecting to me. No, Godfather III is not a ""great"" work on its own -- but it shouldn't be viewed on its own. Mary's death, then Michael's death are fitting conclusions to THE American film masterpiece."
