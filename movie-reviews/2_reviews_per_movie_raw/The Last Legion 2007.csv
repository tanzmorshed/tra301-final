"ccthemovieman-1","6","70","83","4 January 2008"," No, Not Much Credibility But At Least It Was Entertaining
","Reading the back cover of the DVD and seeing that Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley are given top billing, I expected an intelligent King Arthur story. Well, it really wasn't either, although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter; overall, it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors, how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is really a Roman empire one, not a King Arthur story. We only see the tie-in to the later in the last few minutes of the film, in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar, a small boy, and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.<br/><br/>Mixed in with that tale was the famous ""excalibur"" sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But, once again, that is only explained in the final minutes. However, the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths, who want him imprisoned for life, or killed.<br/><br/>What made the story interesting, at least for me, was the chase-scene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy, fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counter-attack in the north in Brittania. That, and the pretty computer-generated scenery and action stunts, kept it interesting. However, don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical political-correctness of today (i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds).<br/><br/>Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However, if you want an hour-and-a-half of decent escapist fare, and can put your brain on hold for that time, it fits the bill and will at least entertain you."
"lukas1979","8","285","381","16 May 2007"," fun light-hearted legend
","I can understand why some people may be disappointed watching this movie, especially if they were expecting a CGI laden gore-fest. If you do not expect this then you should not be too disappointed.<br/><br/>I think the negative comments go too far. It never pretended to be anything other than an action/adventure movie from the beginning (so why compare it to hardcore historical stuff), it was funny, mixed up a few legends, and had a very simple but nevertheless entertaining story.<br/><br/>This light hearted and enjoyable movie provides well-paced entertainment that would be suitable for a teenage audience (perhaps 10+) but can also be enjoyed by adults.<br/><br/>There is no gore, sex, or swearing, and whilst the fine cast will not win any Oscars for their performance, they did a fine job in fulfilling their roles, given the movies objectives.<br/><br/>This movie does what it says on the tin and does it well. A fine example of how a movie can be enjoyable without every scene being covered in blood (although I enjoy those movies too)."
"aereaus","9","106","149","18 May 2007"," Historical accuracy is not the point
","After reading through the comments, I was floored at how many people totally missed the point of the film. This is a tale of legend, and it tells it quite well.<br/><br/>For those who commented on the historical inaccuracies of costumes, armor etc., they are completely wrong, the costumes are accurate to the late period, (ask a recreator, we know). And yes, the long sword was in use by the Roman Army for a very long time. Late Imperial cavalry-length Roman blades were around 26 to 27 inches in length as opposed to the standard legionary 22 inch Gladius.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I said in the beginning this is a film about a legend. Do you think ""Gladiator"" was a true story? Yet it swept the Oscars. It is what it is, and after two viewings, I still have found no fault in the story, the acting or the direction. Historical fact and cinematic storytelling are to a certain degree mutually exclusive. No matter how hard you try to stick to facts when creating historical fiction in any medium, be it books or film, you will inevitably come across the necessity of a compromise between what can be established as ""fact"" (and even there period sources of the time are questionable) and what suits the story. In other words, you can be accurate to a fault, so to say, and have a story that reads - or visualizes - like a lead balloon, or you can alter the so-called ""facts"" to suit your purpose and create much more - and far more visually compelling - drama.<br/><br/>I guess some people just need to find fault to make themselves feel superior.<br/><br/>(Possible Spoilers) As for the story line... The concept of a Roman link to the Arthurian legends is not a new one. Mary Stewart's ""The Crystal Cave"" was the first book that introduced me to the concept, and since I'm a Western Civilization teacher, I'm fascinated by the histories and legends that have risen from what is known as the ""Dark Ages"" of Europe.<br/><br/>All and all, ""The Last Legion"" is a great film. I recommend it to any SCAdian, recreator, Pagan, Wiccan or Dark Ages history freak.<br/><br/>P.S. It was certainly better than ""King Arthur"" starring Clive Owen."
"NeverWalkAlone","8","165","249","17 May 2007"," A good one for the family
","As others have said, I don't know why people are giving it bad reviews... The movie was good, entertaining and very family orientated( No Gore/blood - no nudity ). Granted, its no Troy, 300 or King Arthur, so if your looking for some epic battle with plenty of digital effects then this isn't for you. Having said that there were plenty of fight scenes just no massacre. Its not a movie you will buy but for a one off rental its good enough to entertain the family for the night, so grab a popcorn, sit down, put ya feet up and relax while you watch another tale unfold!<br/><br/>The kids will love it!"
"odysseus-6","4","63","94","24 May 2007"," A case study in how bad directing, and cinematography can make award winning actors look amateur
","There was a lot of potential in this story about the fall of the Roman Empire and how the last Roman Emperor became Pendragon, father of King Arthur.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the entire thing is reduced to a very poor TV movie, and although the weak screenplay plays its part, this film is really case study for anybody who wants to know how abysmal directing, excruciatingly poor cinematography, bafflingly bad editing and over used scoring can take a cast that for the most part is award-winning, (with the exception of the dreadful man playing the villain) and make them look worse than community theater.<br/><br/>It is clear from the outset that the director has not got the first clue what he is doing. The actors have been given very little guidance. They deliver their lines, but are given absolutely no room to emote. Any moments where these world class actors would be looking thoughtful, or considering what they're saying with gravity is all edited out of the film, and the interchanges in dialogue are spliced so close together, there is never a moment where scenes are alllowed to breathe. It's all edited and directed at schlock B grade television pace. Add to this the fact that the cinematographer is obsessed with mid-shots and 2 shots and a composer who doesn't know when to shut his orchestra up, and you something that is barely movie of the week material."
"DICK STEEL","4","75","118","2 September 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Last Legion
","There are many adaptations and versions to the tale of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, with Merlin the sorcerer, and of the magical sword Excalibur, some versions which set it into stone, while others, handed out by a lady in the water. The Last Legion is essentially touting a story about the beginnings of Excalibur and how it took to the former. However, it took a long route to tell this story, going all the way back to 400-something AD, a time where Rome is in turmoil.<br/><br/>Actually Rome is in turmoil ever since Julius Caesar got killed by friends, Romans, countrymen. In a time where generals scheme to usurp the throne and politicians of the Senate are corrupt as hell, it's little wonder why one of the best and most loyal generals Aurelius (Colin Firth) gets recalled to protect the rear of the new boy-king-god-Caesar Romulus Augustus, played by Thomas Sangster (the kid in Nanny McPhee and Tristan and Isolde). Naturally the enemies spring a surprise attack, and our merry men have to flee Rome, and journey to Britain to regroup with the 9th Legion (henceforth also known as the Last Legion), bringing in tow a seer Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley), and a lady warrior in Mira (Aishwarya Rai).<br/><br/>Like most medieval stories with elements of magic or involving the higher powers from Mount Olympus, The Last Legion does away with the sorcery portion, like what Troy and King Arthur had done, opting instead to focus more on reality, and what possibly could have been done without divine intervention, or fantastical assistance. Thus this makes Kingsley's role a little redundant, and relegates him into a fortune teller rather than an all powerful wizard, despite his garb looking a lot like Gandalf's. <br/><br/>While it could have gotten away with its material given 10 years back, unfortunately the stakes in the genre have been raised, and everyone's expecting a spectacle of huge armies battling in hand to hand combat, with its combatants having some form of fancy killing moves. The Last Legion pales in terms of providing that level of detail and spectacle, and chose instead to provide unsophisticated battle scenes, or swordplay that is a tad too uninspiring. Most of the fanciful moves were reserved for Aishwarya, but even that too began to become repetitive. Not even her booby trapped enhanced short sword offered anything we're never seen before.<br/><br/>With characters you don't really care about, what made it a little unbearable amongst the good guys, was the totally hokey, unbelievable romance between Rai and Firth's characters. It doesn't mean that having characters from the opposite sex means they find each other irresistible and want to get into each other's pants. There is absolutely zero chemistry and zero buildup. One minute they're allies, the next they're admiring each other's swordplay, and then, the bed beckons. And if the villains justify what kind of heroes we get, then it's a no brainer that they are bland and devoid of any interesting notion. World domination seems to be their only objective, and both the Romans and the British (using the term loosely here) villains are merely caricatures. <br/><br/>As I said, while The Last Legion might have worked if it's released 10 years ago, this movie can't justify it being made now. It's suitable at most for that DVD rental for a lazy afternoon, but nothing more, and only if you're in dire need of some, or any, form of entertainment."
"ma-cortes","7","19","26","29 July 2009"," Features exciting fighting scenes, impressive battles and fabulous costumes
","This is a nice production with an average budget, great sets and thundering battles about the fall of the Roman Empire. Although the complete Roman Empire decline and fall took centuries, by the end of fifth century it was simply a battleground for warring rival Caesars and Barbarians chiefs. The Germans gather, take over and pull down the Roman gates. The Goths commanded by Odoacer(Peter Mullan), king of Herulos, invade Rome(476 AD), assesinated Orestes(Iain Glen), father of emperor Romulus Augustulos (Thomas Sangster). The young Caesar is sent to Capri along with his preceptor Ambrosinus(Ben Kingsley). A motley group of soldiers led by loyal Aurelianus (Colin Firth) are assigned by senator Nestor (John Hannah) to free him. They're accompanied by a beautiful Indian warrior named Mira (Aishwarya Rai). Without another alternative, they travel to Britannia to meet the last legion, located near the Wall of Adriano; but they're pursued by relentless barbarians (Kevin McKidd, James Cosmo). Although the Romans had partially withdrawn from Britain and its politics essentially dissolved into chaos. Later on, it's thought that a minor war lord, probably named Artos, did his best to maintain civilization and Christianity in the west of England.<br/><br/>This is a larger-than-life production with good direction, interesting scripting, and enthusiastic performances place this far above the usual empty-headed historical spectacle. Several action scenes are outstanding with spectacular battle images and thrilling fights. Unfortunately, on small house screens much of the splendor will be lost. You will be left with the wooden Colin Firth and the gorgeous Aishwarya Rai in a love story that was underdeveloped due tho the film's emphasis on spectacle. The picture packs colorful cinematography by Pontecorvo and evocative musical score by Patrick Doyle. The flick is professionally directed by Doug Lefler, who previously made ¨Dragonheart , a new beginning ¨. Rating : Good, it's a nice extravaganza well set in ancient Rome, done in great scale and praised for its action sequences."
"redhandfilms","4","120","207","8 June 2007"," Disappointment
","I just got done watching this movie. And I must say, if you really want to see this movie, save yourself an hour and a half, and just watch the trailer. The trailer is really as good as this movie gets. I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie too. I'm a big fan of medieval and roman films, but this one really just falls short on everything. I would say thats its worthy of being a sci-fi channel original movie, but I don't don't want to insult the sci-fi channel (Seriously, they have tons of aliens and monster, don't tick them off. You will get eaten.)<br/><br/>This movie falls short on pretty much every account. Casting was awful. I'm a fan of Sangster, he was great in Love Actually, but he's not yet strong enough to be a leading man. Firth, with his quirky charm, should stick to romantic comedy. He's much better at fumbling through a confession of love than being an epic hero. The plot, dialog, acting and directing were all horrible. I kept sitting there thinking how it could have been done better, only to come to the realization the best thing to do would be to throw out everything and start over from the plot outline. The sets cheap and generic. They would have done better dusting off set pieces from Ben Hur(1959). Costumes were pulled from every generic Barbarian/Roman stock wardrobe or Halloween store. Perhaps one of the most distracting things was the music. I think the composer is sleeping with one or more of his trumpet players because thats all we heard. Trumpets playing as they hide, Trumpets sounding during the battle, Trumpets here, Trumpets there. Couldn't get enough of them.<br/><br/>At best this movie is a rental to watch at home. When you're alone. In a windowless room. Don't invite your friends over, they will make fun of you. I'm sorry if this sounds cruel, but, like the parent of a child failing kindergarten, I'm simply trying to express my disappointment for a film that could have been so much better. Its just sad."
"bar_chonok","7","177","318","23 April 2007"," Last Legion is not that bad!
","Well, i just read the previous comment and i can't say I'm quite happy with it :( I mean, the movie was not that bad at all!! Everything was in the right place: the music, actors, the plot and all... No, really... I just don't get why he said (I mean that guy) the actors were bad. They were just brilliant! Well, maybe to watch this movie u gotta have a sense of humor because many scenes in it were quite funny. Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth and Thomas Sangster were really good it seemed to me. Well Aishwarya Rai could of acted better probably... But anyways I reckon there are so many really bad movies and I don't think this one is just watch-it-once-and-then-forget-it film! Besides, the whole thing was real: I mean the castle, all the decorations, they shot it on location, and if you see throngs of people running on the battlefield you know this is all real! I guess u gotta appreciate it because they could of made in on computers... I mean, it's such a rare thing nowadays... Speaking about the plot... Yeah, maybe it's a bit naive and even silly (remember this when you watch the final scene) but overall it was quite dynamic and everything. Finally it was Dino De Laurentis production, they've been writing the script for 6(!) years so do you really think they didn't notice it was crap or something? Well maybe it's not that great compared to '300' but it's good enough anyway My conclusion is: you gotta watch the movie especially if you like Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley or Thomas Sangster or if you like adventures. And it seemed to me it's a kind of a teen movie rather than a serous one (i suppose it's for people of 12-25). And one more thing to say: though it's a historic movie (and i really hated history at school!!!) somehow i liked it and I've seen enough movies to tell a good one. Enjoy!"
"tha_savage1","1","55","95","17 August 2007"," Not quite there
","The movie starts with an interesting theme, but quickly turns into one cliché after another.I liked how they linked the Arthurian legend to the line of Caesar. How ever the Standard group setting in Sword and Sorceror movies soon kicked in. Complete with the girl pretending to be a man, the Black guy(unexplained) in the middle of a foreign country, the battle weary soldier, the wise-old man and the child they must all protect. The acting by the Goths was laughable as well as the main villain. It's like they took a movie written for children and tried to add violence at the last minute. I say it was a waste of time and a disappointment"
"jawtooth","3","90","166","22 May 2007"," What a waste of talent
","I watched The Last Legion with some hope, but not that much and was still disappointed. What starts as a huge CGI filled epic, goes into a weak,empty story with not the best acting,action and a terrible story.<br/><br/>The acting talents and chances of a good film as so badly wasted and in parts the film seems to not know what it wants to be.Action film, Epic historic tale, kids adventure and even comic farce, which was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>Its empty and totally soulless.The ending is so bad, so very very bad that Myself and a friend sat stunned.lol<br/><br/>Its such a great shame that the main star of ROME the TV series was anywhere near this film.Rome it totally superior in every way.

"purplepenguin-1","9","36","63","23 August 2007"," Not a bad take on the origins of Authurian Legend...
","Somehow I missed the trailers and promotion of this film. Normally I see most movies like this right away, but I didn't get to see this one until just yesterday.<br/><br/>If you are going in looking for a historically accurate film then you are waisting your time with ANY Hollywood movie. But this one doesn't have anything that ruined my suspension of belief at all. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a movie misses something obvious (Like Romans using stirrups on their horses, yes I am looking at you Gladiator!) but this movie didn't have one of those.<br/><br/>The fighting styles that they gave the characters, while flashed up for filming, were believable for the cultures that they came from (A Roman Cataract using Japanese sword techniques! Come on King Arthur!) and while I wouldn't rank the fight scenes anywhere near anything done by Wu Ping, they again don't take away from the story.<br/><br/>Now the story its self is where I have some problems. They seemed to rush it most of the way. I almost wish that they had made it a mini-series on TV just so they could have told the whole thing. I think that there is some missing story that I would like to hear, like the origins of the villain and where he got his scars and what not.<br/><br/>Anyway, just don't go into it with any expectations and I think that you will enjoy yourself for an hour and a half."
"khunia","1","115","232","17 May 2007"," So much potential, yet it is all wasted
","This movie didn't feel like it should be on the big screen more like a miniseries. The plot goes nowhere, it is just so confusing, seems like a huge rip off on King Arthur.<br/><br/>I really like historical movies but if your going to make one (Historical Movie) then the script writers should have done some research. The entire lookand feel of this movie comes off more like a fantasy adventure the Romans don't look, act or even dress like Romans nor are they even armed liked Romans. The main character carries a long sword rather than the short sword favored by roman legionnaires. The list goes on and on it is ridiculous.<br/><br/>I waited in impatient anticipation for this movie to say i was extremely disappointed would be an understatement. The fight scenes were dull the acting more so, as for colin firth as an action hero well seriously you gotta be kidding me.<br/><br/>6 years to write this movie hahahaha thats the funniest thing i have heard in a while, they should have just googled the historical facts and the story would have been much more accurate, fun and bearable to watch.<br/><br/>The potential of this movie was huge and it was all wasted, terrible casting, horrid script, music (atrocious), acting (dull) and poor camera work all add up to a terrible movie.<br/><br/>To be honest my recommendation is to wait for this to get to free to air television.<br/><br/>After reading a few posts i hvae decided to add more to this post, the entertainment value has nothing to do with special effects and gore, it comes down to the actors making the characters believable and drawing the viewer into the story. It has nothing to do with Gore (I watch horror movies for that), but if your going to have fight scenes and battles do them right. As for objectives well a movies main objective is in the main ""to entertain"", my son was as confused as I was with the story he walked off halfway through and I was 5mins behind him. As a movie I say once again this movie fails on all levels, it is neither entertaining, educational or emotionally engaging, seemed more like a pathetic effort by all involved with the making of this film."
"Timelagged","Null","14","22","20 May 2007"," Music is Puccini
","The ""original"" theme running throughout this movie is a fairly direct copy of Manon Lescaut by Puccini. Unusual to hear something so blatantly used without attribution.<br/><br/>I'm sort of torn about things like this, I know it's just entertainment, as the Arthurian legends certainly were, and have some value just as that. <br/><br/>However it's a shame to see Roman history, which is rich enough on its own two feet, now being turned into this sort of thing also, with magic swords and secret powers and so on. The history is so strong and interesting without adding that."
"shamgar-1","5","9","13","5 June 2008"," A Lesser son of greater sires.
","The beginning of the movie seems promising, but unfortunately after 15 minutes it becomes a mediocre epic movie.<br/><br/>Storyline: The Storyline is acceptable, in a way it's just another version of the King Arthur-myth, so there are a lot of familiar aspects. It has some good plots, but some are ruined by bad acting of the actors, while others are very cliché (the 9th legion coming to rescue when all hope has faded... hm... Rohan (LotR) anyone?).<br/><br/>Scenery's, sets, clothing: Scenery's and sets look pretty good, but the clothing is just horrible. The Germanic 'Barbarians' are dressed in typically Hollywood mindless barbarian clothing: horned helmets (which didn't exist), lot's of animal skins and dirt, which makes it hard to see their face. The Goths are typically casted as evil bad guys to be killed at will by the heroes, without any personality whatsoever. The truth is far from that.<br/><br/>Acting: The overall acting is terrible. The Goths: The acting of the evil barbarians is overdone, either they are plain stupid or too evil (Wulfila - Kevin McKidd), which combined with the ridiculous un-authentic clothing, makes you laugh at the sight of them. They are not intimidating at all. Only Hrothgar (James Cosmo) appears to be a bit normal, but James Cosmo is just cool :) Too bad he only got a small part in the movie even though he is the better actor (for proud, strong warlike types), because he was mostly the reason why I wanted to see it anyway. the Heroes: Ben Kingsley is doing OK. He seems to have fun, although his character is a bit weird. Colin Firth's acting seems more like 13 in a dozen 'Let's get this over with' kind of thing. He is very timid and seems mostly frustrated that he has signed to do this mediocre movie. Aishwarya Rai: looks pretty, but she is just not an actress<br/><br/>Good parts: James Cosmo, storyline is decent, but ruined by the rest of the movie<br/><br/>Overall: It's a mediocre epic movie. It claims to be in the vein of 'Lord of the Rings' but can't compete by a long shot. I think the movie 'King Arthur' is even better (and has a more believable explanation of the myth, although there are too many inconsistencies in that one) and that movie is not very spectacular.<br/><br/>I would rate it 5 out of 10, because the sceneries and sets look decent and at times the movie looks nice, but often it more looks like an unintended parody to the genre."

","Because it'll feel like at least ten hours. Wow, I read the reviews before seeing this movie/ thing. People hated it. People liked it. I decided those who hated it were bitter, angry people who should lighten up and enjoy life. To those people, I apologize for thinking that. You were right. This movie seems to crawl from place to place without vision or energy. It's an epic stitched together with dull talks from actors who will take their paycheck and hope they can bounce back after this. <br/><br/>It does feel small budget. It also feels like the editor was told to put this together so families could watch it and then just decided not to try anymore. So not only does it drag, but the fight scenes are more like pushing and shoving scenes. But there was a technique employed that was clever. In it, we see someone throw something (an axe for example), we cut to another actor's reaction (""That's bad. I'm awake, right?""), then see the weapon lodged in a person's body. I think they did this three times, a great example of how well this was conceived.<br/><br/>If you don't understand what makes some movies bad and others good, check this out. It really will help you appreciate the good stuff."

","Folks, in the same way as the previous poster, I disagree strongly with all the negative posts.<br/><br/>The most important that needs to be made when you're watching this movie, as in many such movies, is that it didn't start off as a movie script - it's based on a book. That means that all your usual movie expectations are left hanging, but with good reason!<br/><br/>Simply because the movie isn't chock full of special effects, unnecessary sex and callous bloodshed doesn't make it a bad movie by any means - and if you'd like to say that it does, you need have a good think about what you're looking for in a movie!"
"Ismaninb","3","31","59","3 June 2007"," Not fit for history lesson
","Generally speaking I dislike gore, superfluous sex (between the sheets) and am not especially fond of special effects. In my opinion it is a big plus, if a movie can do without these. At the other hand I enjoy sword and sable fighting - think of Erroll Flynn or the French musketeer movies. Finally the period of the late 5th century, with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, is highly fascinating.<br/><br/>This movie is not an untold story. It is historically completely inaccurate, something like president Bush being in charge during the Vietnam war, with Franklin Delano Roosevelt being his political opponent. As examples I will only take two points. Odoaker took over power in 475, not in 460. Wulfila died around 383.<br/><br/>Really, I like retelling or even reinventing legends. But I don't like utter nonsense. Clearly 6 years was not enough yet to write a decent script. Even then, if the story was told in an interesting way, the directing was skillful, I might have forgiven. But no. In the beginning ancient Rome was used as a background. It was unrealistic like cheap epic movies from the 50-s. Ben Hur got it much better. And the story? The director hardly takes time to show the emotional struggle of a young boy being the mightiest person in the world. It better could have left out. Now it is just one of the many scenes, which remain hanging in the air.<br/><br/>Odysseus-6 is completely right about the actors, so I will not repeat it. I am sorry, several old sword and sandal Italian B-movies are better than this one. Every director degrading the highly talented and skilled John Hannah to a wooden amateur like this, should be put on a black list. One has to pay full attention, then one can pick a few moments, where the actors get the chance to act - for instance the scene, where Odoaker decides to keep the boy alive. I can imagine a savage barbarian behaving like that. Problem of course is, that the real Odoaker already had spend several years in Rome and was not a barbarian anymore .... He was quite a popular ruler in Italy, after almost 75 years of incompetent Caesars.<br/><br/>I will just wait for someone filming Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave or a book of Rosemary Sutcliffe. These authors show, that historical drama can have roots in hard facts.<br/><br/>Surinamese TV showed the movie at midnight, so alas I cannot ask my 12 years old son, if he was entertained. I was hardly."

It was embarrassing, how they tried to gain credit by using household names from history - because this movie had nothing to do with real historical events.<br/><br/>The way to try to link the Romans with King Arthur, with a touch of Indian Veda-philosophy thrown in, was just stupid beyond belief..<br/><br/>Also, I found it VERY insipid, that the movie just HAD to contain the obligatory politically correct elements: one black man and one ferocious woman among the Roman combatants. Although EVERYBODY knows, that both had been an impossible thing at the time...<br/><br/>The fact that I give the movie two stars instead of just one, however, is due to the fact that there WERE some beautiful and accurate props in it, such as clothes, weapons, scenery etc.."

I think they had every chance to make this a very interesting and exciting story but spoiled it with a weak storyline and dull special effects. <br/><br/>It seems as if they took a pretty good story and turned it in to something they could package and deliver fast, because of the big Rome hype after several bestselling books and TV-shows. It feels as something you've seen before and hoped to never see again. Pretty poor acting witch I think comes from pretty poor directing and script. <br/><br/>All and all a waste of time"
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","4","5","26 October 2016"," Better than most reviews indicate
","I typically don't add a review when there are already more than 100. But in this case I'm going to because I think this film is overrated. Oh, I'm not saying this is a great epic about the Roman Empire. It's not. I don't think it's too faithful to history, but good enough to be called historical fiction. What I do think it is, is a good adventure film. Just don't take it so seriously. What made me laugh was that in the blurb I read about it, it said it was a ""cut rate"" adventure film; apparently only spending $67 million in 2007 was ""cut rate""; only in America.<br/><br/>You have a decent cast here. Colin Firth plays Aurelius, a military leader charged with the responsibility of protecting the young Romulus. He's good here, and it's nice to see Firth in a different kind of role than we usually do. Thomas Brodie-Sangster does fairly well as the young Romulus Augustulus. Ben Kingsley is decent as a druid who also protects and teaches the boy. Perhaps most interesting is Aishwarya Rai -- my favorite female Indian actress -- as a female warrior.<br/><br/>The plot is decent. The young Romulus has been crowned the new head of the Roman Empire, but shortly after that his mother and father are murdered and he is kidnapped. Obviously, a rescue is needed. Thereby the action.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this film? Well, I think for many it's the idea that any film about the Roman Empire -- even a fictional story -- is supposed to be filmed in great grandeur. This is filmed well, but not on a grand scale.<br/><br/>This won't end up on my DVD shelf, but it's a good film (not a great film). I'm glad I watched it. Might watch it again some day."

","I remember the first time, almost 10 years ago when i was reading the same title book,from Valerio Massimo Manfredi, i was wondering, if there was going to be a film adaption, for this interesting book. Of course they had to skip a few things,as they do almost in every book-to-film adaption, but even if you watch the film, without reading the original script first, it is a complete story and you wont be disappointed. Especially for people loving this history period, i am almost sure that they will find interesting and enjoyable.Maybe, indeed, a few historical inaccuracies are here,cant say for sure, but even there are a few, i could easily overlook them.<br/><br/>I don't know if there was already a myth including a Roman Emperor with this famous Sword, but, in my opinion, even a final twist like this, can be a pleasant surprise! <br/><br/>As far as the cast concerns, i would say that the casting selection was a nice one, and i think that each and every one of them fulfilled my expectations."
"rajdoctor","4","15","27","17 August 2007"," The Last Legion
","I went to see this movie only because it had one of the Bollywood leading lady  Aishwarya Rai. I knew the movie had poor ratings and did not expect much from it before entering the theatres.<br/><br/>The story is about the blood line of Julius Ceaser  a young child Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) whose parents are killed, kingdom overthrown and he imprisoned. His personal guard Aurelius (Colin Firth) joins hands with a couple of his own guards and Mira (Aishwarya Rai) and with the help of a sorcerer Merlin (Ben Kingsley) rescues the child and defeats the enemies.<br/><br/>The movie is stupid to say the least, as if we are seeing some B-grade movies of 70s. It has good sets, and excellent actions; but the screenplay and dialogues are a big let down. Overall the casting is very poor. Colin Firth huffs and puffs to fit the role of a warrior guard, and so overacts Thomas as a child emperor. Ben Kingsley  what are you doing in this movie? As a moral guardian of the young emperor Ben Kingsley still sounds like Mahatma Gandhi when he opens his mouth and says some philosophical and thoughtful things. Aishwarya was okay. To make her look like an Indian beauty the make-up artist put layers of brown shining dusk on her face and body. She performed her role with commitment, but over-expressed herself in violent actions scenes.<br/><br/>For director Doug Lefler, this was his second ambitious project and that too with historic setting. I should say that the quality of details in expensive sets and costume etc. was finely done. The action scenes were good but not up to the mark of great directors.<br/><br/>So what was positive about this movie? I think it is a good entertainment for children and family. It does not have a heavy complicated story, and gory of sex and violence  that is normally seen in such movies. It is a clean entertainer in that way.<br/><br/>(Stars 4.5 out of 10)"

","I finally finished watching this movie after falling asleep to it 3 nights in a row, and I must say: What a genuine load af garbage! First things first; the acting is absolutely horrendously performed by the whole cast. Even Ben Kingsley is a joke in this movie. But everybody does their share of poor acting: from the crude stupid barbarians, to the insanely hot chick, to the boy (our main character) who is just the most annoying little brat ever. The makers of the movie tries, ia a very pathetic low-fi kind of-way, to give the film a LoTR feel to it, usually accompanied by the most vulgar, irritating and repetitive soundtrack ever. Often it gets kinda funny though: Our heroes is preparing for the last stand, looking out past the castle walls, they see the enemy approaching: Hero1: ""How many are there?"" Hero2: ""Thousands... maybe more"" . - What like millions? This movie is lame from the beginning to the end so I advise you not to waste two hours of your life, like I did, watching this garbage. It must be the worst movie I have seen this year along with Clercs 2. The only reason I do not rate this 1 is because of the chick, who is sooooo hot, she makes some of the scenes kinda watchable. The plot? Who cares it's lame."

The plot was OK, I've seen worse, but the CGI effects for the great city of Rome were horrible, and the history was awful also. What kind of historian was backing them on this movie, that let the soldiers go from a semi-plausible Hadrian's wall to a 13th century castle, in 460 AD? and what kind of decision is it to then go from there, BACK to Hadrian's wall because it'll be easier to defend??? apart from actors being miscast, the plot being weak, the history sucking and the CGI being downright awful i guess you could say its a good movie, or even just decent.<br/><br/>The only upside is the ludicrous technology used by the Goths to destroy the gates at the beginning"

","Well the plot is the same of Manfredi's book. The young kid Romulus is the last of Roman emperors. When Rome is sold to barbarians, he must go away to Britain to save his life, protected by his most faithful bodyguards. There, the last battle for the honour of Rome will begin, starting also the myth of King Arthur. This plot is not bad, and quite interesting, but is the only good thing of the movie. Characters are quite stupid, most of the dialogues are silly: the hand fight, the ""seduction"" of the captain, the finding of the sword, the attack to the Emperor's palace (and twenty barbarians conquer all Rome???). This, mixed with quite bad action scenes (all the fights are awful, there's no contact, in fact most of the time you can see the space between the bodies!!), worse special effects (Ambrosius throwing fire) and the worst of all is the historic facts: When was a LIberty Statue in Rome? Why the Emperor's palace is 3 metres far to the forest? It was not in the middle of Rome?? When there was huskies in the Roman Empire? (at the British town) Why the swords had no blood after beating an enemy?? (well, in the last battle they had...) In addition to this, the thing that upsets me more is the fact that the movie pretends to be good! It exhales an aura of: ""I'm telling you the truth"" that makes it irritating! It is almost insulting, doing something so bad, and indeed present it as a master piece."

As instead of the dramatic end they most probably wanted this film to have, it nose dives straight to the bottom of the groansville.<br/><br/>Why they have to go to such lengths to try and write a clever film plot is beyond me, I suppose the groan element at the end was comforted a lot more by the fact that the rest of the film was poor too, if it had been enjoyable to watch, that ending would have been more annoying.<br/><br/>What we do learn from this film is: You can brand someone in a random way and they will receive a perfect aligned scar...

","I must say that it isn't every day that you get to watch 60 Million go down the tube but this movie had a nice cheesy script, decent actors but i put all the blame on the director. As one said above, if Ridley Scott would have put his touch to it - surely it could have potential.<br/><br/>Instead, the directing is so amateurish i thought i was watching Clash of the Titans 2 with the same wardrobe even the silly golden mask on the evil character.. which was beyond cheesy.<br/><br/>But the hardest part is to imagine where did all those 60M go?? it wasn't the sets, the sfx were too unrealistic to be expensive unless for a mere video game, but maybe the actors got paid millions. Aishwarya was hot and probably the only eye candy but if it cost 5M perhaps it would all make sense.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that any good movie requires a director that can turn the script into a moving story and get great performances but this film looked like a miniseries for abc.. just painful to watch on the big screen. i just hope Lefler doesn't take the helm of anymore movies - i honestly didn't notice one decent close up shot and i agree the costumes were on target but they still looked right off the rack as if everyone went to a halloween costume store, and the sets unrealistically clean, it was not Switzerland but roman and English who didn't have street cleaners every day...and all the beginning roman sets make the movie look like it was shot in the 70s - one isn't sure they ramsacked a simple temple or all of Rome.<br/><br/>And I agree, the child was horrible...esp the beginning shots on the roman statue - yikes.. i could go on and on but it is pointless..<br/><br/>And to those that feel this movie is worth 10 bucks.. sorry but i would feel cheated even more but luckily for me it was almost free. I give it a 3 because i wanted to see lovely Aishwarya who did a great job in her fighting sequences and too bad she didn't have more lines..at least there would have been some beauty on the screen.<br/><br/>Save your money and just watch the trailer, and wait for it as a freebie, and even than you'll be terribly disappointed unless you have a great sense of humor than maybe it will become a B movie cult classic - the second most expensive after Waterworld.. at least that had good action shots."

","This film has to have one of the strangest cast lists in history but i loved the film, it kept well to the book but there were certain areas where i think it made a detour. The opening began with the talk of Caesars Sword and this made the film goer believe the story was about this but on reading the book it was about the relationship of Aurelius & Romulus the new Caesar. The film also took slightly different direction in scenes such as the attack on Romulus's Home and if my memory is correct the battle right at the beginning of the book was completely scrapped.<br/><br/>This film needed Ridley Scott as Director as i think he probably would have made more of it and i am certain that this film will get totally panned by the critics. I mean Colin Firth as a Roman Commander Protecting the emperor, the absolutely amazing and gorgeous Aishwarya Rai as an eastern assassin and the annoying kid from Love actually as the Child Caesar. I know why not have Mr Bean as Rambo or Arnie as Forrest Gump. All this aside the film is a good film to watch with all the family, Violence is moderate, no sex, no swearing so its a good film for all the family to watch.<br/><br/>On the Whole i enjoyed this but please don't go in expecting Gladiator, i was waiting for Bridget Jones Pants to blow across the Screen like tumbleweed but alas that did not happen."

","This movie was a fun, lighthearted adventure flick with lots of spills and chills to keep your interest up. The good guys and bad guys were clearly delineated. It was fun to see Colin Firth as a tough guy instead of the stuffy, stumbling, mumbling pseudo-nobility that he usually plays. Ben Kingsley is always fun. The kid was cute, the woman was tough, and Kevin McKidd, aka Lucius Vorenus of ""Rome,"" is as good a bad guy as he ever was as a good guy.<br/><br/>My husband picked it up out of curiosity; we had never heard of it before and so went into it without expectations. When it went off we both were grinning. ""Fun movie,"" my husband said, and he was right. I'll watch it again, too. It was that much fun. Kind of a throwback to a 1940's movie--I could easily see Basil Rathbone in Kevin McKidd's part, Errol Flynn as Colin Firth's character, and Maureen O'Hara as the feisty woman warrior.<br/><br/>I'm surprised to see all the horrible reviews. I don't know why people are so hung up on historical accuracy. There probably was an Arthur, but everything that is ""known"" about him is a legend anyway, so what's wrong if there's another movie to talk about the ""legend before the legend""? And since the Romans were in Britain until 500 AD or so, what's wrong with a Roman precursor to Arthur? I watch movies to be entertained, and occasionally enlightened. If I learn a new fact (I always verify anything a movie depicts as fact before repeating it anyway) then so much the better, but I watch documentaries and read history books for my historical accuracy. There's nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned Saturday afternoon adventure flick. I liked it and am glad others were also able to take it in the spirit in which it was intended."

","I was vaguely aware of this as a recent release when I pulled the DVD from the local library, and approached it without expectations when I fired up the disk player. I realized in the first three minutes that this was no ""I Claudius,"" but stayed with it out of curiosity.<br/><br/>The film clearly targeted 12 year-old boys, but had real trouble finding its audience. First, the hero appeared to be 9 or 10, an age 12-year-olds view with disgust. Why would they go see anything with their little brother in it? The attempt to project a puppy love interest to this audience, in the form of an introduction to a young Ygraine, would also make 7th grade flesh crawl. All of the violence pulled punches, with impalings, amputations, and clubbings yielding no blood and polite collapses and closing of eyes of the victims.<br/><br/>The Goths looked like Oakland Raiders fans, and further confused the audience by not wearing black raincoats or pale make-up like the more familiar Jr. High Goths. When unmasked, the villain Vortgyn looked like Willie Nelson the morning after a deep dive in Whiskey River.<br/><br/>Everyone in the film appeared to be aware how dire the project was, but did their best to hide their embarrassment. I'm sure they had words with their agents later.<br/><br/>The movie's best point was its relative brevity--no attempt to persuade the audience that it was getting its money's worth by stretching things out to three hours. But then, this movie didn't end so much as set up a sequel. As the old joke goes, there must have been days on the set of ""1941"" that they looked forward to ""1942."" In the final analysis, this appeared to be a European shot at a Hollywood-style formula picture. The Europeans used to be pretty good with sword and sandals epics if the budget stayed low. But this attempt at a Gladiator-meets-Lord of the Rings hybrid falls flat at every turn. Going forward, I'll keep my eye out for Doug Lefler. I'm sure he as several bad films in him before producers force him to fall on his sword."

Costumes are terrible and uninspired. Make-up is just boring and even the actors, especially the Goths are more than poor, looking more like a German punk-rock band or something... The movie is just awful and sometimes I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a cheap comedy or an action-movie.

The actors were not miscast, the music was not horrible, the plot was not weak, etc. I was reading some negative reviews and the things I mentioned were the opposite in those reviews.<br/><br/>This story is based on the legend of Excalibur and King Arthur.

Colin Firth did a wonderful job as Aurelius and Thomas Sangster was great as Romulus. Also, the lady who played the girl warrior is beautiful.<br/><br/>I don't know how the music can be considered inappropriate as a reviewer said in one comment. The music is just fine.

There he is, up against Sir Ben Kingsley and Colin ""Darcy"" Firth, and in my humble opinion quietly blasts them off the screen...while playing a 12-year-old! (He was actually 17 during filming.)

"jpdt19","6","12","26","3 June 2007"," Good but Disappointing
","Firstly i would just like to agree with the previous two other commenter's who have quite rightly rubbished khunia's comment about inaccuracy. As was quite rightly said, if you are going to make a loud complaint, make sure your facts are accurate!! As mentioned, the long cavalry sword or spatha is considered, by the late empire, to have replaced the stereotypical legionary short sword (gladius) as standard infantry equipment. Another thought is that if Aurelius was an infantry commander/prefect, he likely would have used a long cavalry sword anyway, as even in the early empire, most commanders would have spent the majority of battles on horseback. I found the depiction of the 9th legion enjoyable, especially how they formed and marched, were they extras does anyone know, or a hired reenactment group. I noticed that actually of the 4/5 units that were shown, we only saw one actually doing anything more than marching. There were also were a number of slight sticky points about the ninth. 1) Them being apparently still equipped in the stereotypical legionary manner, which as far as i know was not standard in the late empire. 2) regardless of how or why exactly it happened, it is generally agreed that the 9th legion no longer existed by the 3rd century Ad. 3) The standard of the legion is a dragon, and it is referred to as the legion of the dragon. Why??? The standard shown, is, as far as i am aware, one that was used by cavalry units, called a dracco, why would a legion have a dragon for a standard, even if, as i have heard, the eagle was removed at some point? <br/><br/>As for the story and film itself, while i always enjoy any decent display of the Roman Army, i did find the story of the film itself disappointing! However, the film is based on the book of the same title by Valerio Massimo Manfredi. I read this book sometime before, attracted by the title, but found the ending disappointing, the same fault i have with the film. The film is limited by the material it is based on and so regardless of how good or bad the acting or accuracy, which in this case were both of a convincing quality, the film never could really have shone, even allowing for the common, though not always unique slaughtering of a good novel by it's adaption for film or TV. Also to be fair, the period in which the book/film takes place is one of such confusion and chaos that perhaps it is hard to write convincingly about it. The only good book about the Roman world at the end of the empire that i have read which does the period justice is ""eagle in the snow"" by Wallace brim, which i heartily recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>General Comments and opinions! Even with the inherent fault in the story this film is so so so so much better and more accurate than the horrible King Arthur 2004! <br/><br/>Firth does a good job. His portrayal of a roman commander is convincing, intending to cut off a thieve's hand would not have arisen much comment in those days, and a legionary commander would have been tough! I did also appreciate his portrayal of Aurelius's sense of despair at seeing his world fall apart.<br/><br/>Yes the boy from love actually is annoying in some ways, but that doesn't mean he isn't a good actor, little boys are naturally annoying on the whole and he does do a good job.<br/><br/>OK as for Aishwarya Rai, i think she did OK!<br/><br/>I did find it sad seeing Kevin McKidd, who played Vorenus in ROME, playing a goth, and i kept expecting to see him appear with Pullo on the Roman side."

As I watched the film, it became apparent that this movie was aimed to the preteen - early teen audience - in other words, a family film, even with the violence.<br/><br/>As for claims of historical inaccuracy, there is no definitive knowledge of any of those characters in historical text. There are a variety of texts about these people, and they all vary to some degree. <br/><br/>This movie wasn't made to compete with Gladiator, King Arthur, or Camelot.

It was really bad.<br/><br/>It was like a two hour episode of Hercules The TV Show from the 1990s.<br/><br/>The cinematography was bright and crisp like a comedy when it should have dark and grainy like the Gladiator or even King Arthur, which while not the best move was certainly better than this film.<br/><br/>There were some decent actors in the film, but most of them were cast in the wrong roles, and thus their performances suffered. Colin Firth was wonderful in Love Actually, but was completely unbelievable as a legendary Roman Centurion. Kevin McKidd, best known for his role on the HBO TV Series Rome, might have delivered a decent performance, but I was far to distracted by his awful wardrobe and makeup to notice. I would have much rather seen him in the role of Aurelius  but then that would have raised unwelcome comparisons to his television series. The best actor, or at least the one with the most awards, Sir Ben Kingsley completely phoned in his performance.<br/><br/>The wardrobe and special effects department looked straight out of a low budget TV Show. No amount of acting could make the heroes heroic, or the villains terrifying through their ridiculous costumes.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were straight out of the 1950s and demonstrated the worst theater techniques known to man. They also demonstrated just how bad both the editing and special effects were, because you could clearly see that no damage was done in one shot, then six scenes later a character would have a wound from where he was struck, despite not having one before that.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was not impressed with this film. I am a big fan of many of the actors in this film, and very much wanted to like it. I guess I will just have to blame the director, who by the way did work on the Television shows Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princesswhich certainly explains a lot."

The story has been so diluted that it makes no sense. Epic journeys that they undertake are over in the time it takes to change the position your sat in and characters which are important to the story just seem to have been overlooked. They have made this film without giving any of the characters a foundation and this just led me to find it all a bit forced.<br/><br/>Sometimes i complain when a film is too long but with this it could have done with at least an other forty five minutes, in fact i found it too short.

","For serious film lovers this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>The plot is so conventional and predictable you will bore easily. Thomas Sangster puts in a satisfying performance as the lost boy who finds his way. Rai in a sum what unconventional role for herself is impressive yet contains flaws in her part which seems to be disjointed from the rest of the film. Colin Firth puts in an adequate performance as Aurelius, yet his character is conventional and has cinematic reminders of Clive Owen in King Arthur. <br/><br/>Those watching the movie for Firth as a sex god will be disappointed as he seems too old even to be ruggedly handsome.<br/><br/>The film itself has strong cinematic ties and reminders of King Arthur Kingdom of Heaven and even at some stages Troy yet with each one being cinematically worse than the original. The narrative itself is predictable with the ties to Caesar being the father of king Arthur evident half way through the movie. <br/><br/>The love interest between Rai and Firth is predictable even before we are shown that the mask warrior is in fact a women. Which again is another predictable part of the narrative. Another problem is that the narrative starts to fast as the audience is not emotionally attached to any character except Sangster and eventually Firth (built up gradually through the film). With the predictable narrative it bores the audience, which is contributed to with a disappointing climax, as although there is a masked villain he is easily defeated and through the entire film poses no convincingly serious threat. <br/><br/>The movie is suitable for young children in terms of captivating an audience, yet for adults and teens boring as hell. <br/><br/>2 outof 10 as although boring narrative and cinematography the actors atpoints are captivating."

","Oh dear. Why hasn't there been a good Merlin/Arthur film since John Boorman's Excalibur? This is the latest in a long line of shockers. Excalibur was good because it stuck to fantasy. This tried to tie history and fantasy, and ends up pleasing no-one. Anyone who knows anything about the late Western Empire will get wound up by the factual inaccuracies (Romans were Christian, emperors didn't live in Rome, they lived in Ravenna, etc. etc.), and it also fails to justice to Arthurian legend at the same time. As others have pointed out, tying in Rome to Arthur has been done (very) successfully in literature, but this just irritates. The casting was pretty woeful too, and the whole female Indian assassin thing just seemed to be shoehorned in (Producer fancied the actress? Can't think of any good script reason). There's got to be a director out there who can do a good Arthur film, and who knows, one who can do a good fall of the Roman Empire story; it IS after all an interesting era, and deserves better than this."

","Excellent film. In the league of 300. This film had a great story line that is historical. It shows the ending of the Roman empire but the legacy of that empire. This is not the roman empire of the Jesus's time but 400 years later. Sure it is a legend but that is the whole point. This shows the beginning of Great Britain and the attack of the Goth barbarians from the North. It is against tyranny.<br/><br/>This film is a great action film that is really about courage, honor, loyalty and bravery. It is that simple. It is driven by the story and has very little gore but plenty of action. It is like a classic Errol Flynn swashbuckler but modern film making. The acting by Colin Firth is not wooden it is steady and shows a real man of great honor instead of whiny self hating nerds. The boy is great. the supporting cast is strong and Ben Kingsley takes acting to a high level. The film can be seen by any age. It would not be liked to much by the jaded, anti-American anti-western civilization types who giggle like babies and are obsessed with politically correct issues. It is old fashioned adventure with themes of honor which make it timeless. A main character says the most important thing is ""seeking truth."" Good point."
"wayne170747","5","11","28","18 May 2007"," My comment is on the Aussie review
","There is always a danger when you criticize the facts that your own facts are wrong. You bravely stated that the Romans did not use a long sword.<br/><br/>In the time period of the movie, the fifth century the Romans did indeed use the long sword, the 'spatha'. The long cavalry sword had started to replace the short sword, 'gladius', as early as the 2nd century when Rome started to rely more and more on their cavalry force in place of the classic infantry legion. In the late empire even the foot soldiers relied on the longer sword.<br/><br/>The movie; well it doesn't quite cut it no matter which sword you use."
"clanciai","9","3","5","2 October 2015"," The last Roman emperor, a young boy, finds his way to Britain with some help of Merlin, an Indian princess and Excalibur.
","Most people behind this film are Italians, and you can tell that from the design: theatrical almost operatic story, colorful staging, great imagination, playful development of characters and story, florid fabulation and great joy of epic story-telling - most of the production names are De Laurentiis. All this makes up for not a bad movie at all. In fact, the story is not incredible, although utterly untruthful, and both Ben Kingsley and Colin Firth make credible characters and performances enough. Focus is though on the boy, who is the only thoroughly splendid character, both as an invention, the type and his development and acting. <br/><br/>What actually happened is unknown, but both Odovakar and Romulus are historical figures. In the film the events of Romulus' abdication occur in 460 after having been emperor for no more than a year, while it actually happened in 476 but is historically correct. No one knows what happened to Romulus, however - his fate is lost in history, and his young character and mystery is like made for legends. Odovakar did not remain king of Rome very long, being soon overthrown by Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths. <br/><br/>Vortigern, the awful villain of the film, did exist but remains a rather doubtful character - in the film he is grossly exaggerated to fit the role of a supreme villain, a tyrant of great paranoia and cruelty, while some sources name him the discoverer of Merlin. <br/><br/>A great epic adventure film made on a great epic story, in brief, a worthwhile entertainment with the positive consequence that it must raise your interest in the darkest medieval history."

","The Last Legion pleased me. It tied in to a number of things I have read or watched over the last year or so - the early life of Attila the Hun and the fall of Rome, the films about the 9th Legion which came out in 2010, Clive Owen's King Arthur movie - they all have a bearing on what takes place in this story of a small group of Roman soldiers who take the 12 year old Emperor Romulus to Britannia once Rome has fallen.<br/><br/>This low profile film has high production values and an excellent cast - Colin Firth is the officer of the soldiers, Ben Kingsley is a druid/mentor, Aishwarya Rai is an exotic warrior maiden, and the excellent Thomas Sangster plays young Romulus, old before his time.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action, well choreographed, and beautiful locations as well as some acceptable process photography.<br/><br/>And, although there are a lot of battles, there is nothing very graphic and no bad language, so this is an exciting film for families to watch."
"missmissa","8","3","5","8 December 2008"," Not the greatest, but certainly worth your time
","I remember seeing a poster for this film and thinking, ""Hmmm...a Roman take on the Arthurian legend (yep, that's been done before) starring Colin Firth. Huh?"" As much as I adore Colin Firth, he's never really struck me as the heroic sort, but he surprised me with this film. Having seen the special features on the DVD, they cast him in this unusual role on purpose because they were trying to go for something different. He was believable with the sword play and as a leader of men, but the inevitable ""rally the troops"" speech falls a little flat. Orlando Bloom and Cate Blanchett have given better versions of that speech than Colin Firth did at the end of this film.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the originality of the story in this film. As opposed to simply setting the Arthurian legend in the late Roman empire like ""King Arthur"", they actually told a whole prequel story with some actual, historical basis. That originality and the strength of the acting could have set it above the aforementioned film, but Last Legion's production values are sometimes lacking and while the story is original, the story telling leaves a little to be desired. There are three different villains that pop up during the course of the film and none of them are really given the time they need to seem truly threatening. Characters are also not given enough time to breathe and grow and relationships seem, therefore, to form almost out of thin air.<br/><br/>Those gripes aside, The Last Legion is an entertaining action film that leaves the blood and gore at a minimum making suitable for the whole family."

The fight scenes are realistic (apart from the lack of blood on swords) and it has some good comic moments. As a stand alone film it may never be a great but its still worth seeing. The sets are very good and on par with the Rome TV series and its funny with the connection between the 2 lol.

","The Last Leigon tells the story of the new emperor Romulus Augustus, a child forced to flee Rome after the Goths invade. With a loyal general with a handful of men, an Indian warrior, and a mentor figure they head to Britain to find the last legion (the 9th) and hopefully restore the empire, carrying a legendary sword made for Julius Ceasar...<br/><br/>This movie, like the recent KING ARTHUR movie claims to tell the story behind the legend of King Arthur. Unlike that movie, this one seems aimed at a slightly younger crowd, mainly as it follows the child emperor as much as his general. The trailer is misleading however, as Arthur doesn't feature in the movie until the end.<br/><br/>Despite this however, I really enjoyed the movie. Thomas Sangster as the young emperor does well, Ben Kingsley seems to be enjoying himself as the mentor/teacher figure (you can guess his other character name easily!), Aishwarya Rai as the Indian woman Mira is good, handling the action quite well. But the surprise here is Colin Firth. Best known for things like Pride & Pedujice, or the Bridget Jones movies. But here, he convinces as the roman general Aurelius and does very well in the action set-pieces. The only time he fails to convince is when he has to give a speech to rally his troops.<br/><br/>Like most movies of this type it's crammed with British actors, though I don't think it's a British movie. Peter Mulan, Kevin McKidd, James Cosmo, John Hannah are just some of those involved. This did get me wondering if this movie was edited down from perhaps a mini-series, or the film was much longer, as some actors only have a handful of lines.<br/><br/>Doug Lefler directs well, though there are a couple of shots that look like out-takes from Lord Of The Rings (not a bad thing mind you!).He handles the action well, if at times it is a little rushed in scenes. He directs the actors well, and although not a long running time, does allow time for little character moments through-out the movie, and does allow for little moments of humour to develop.<br/><br/>The movie does end on a moment that brought some groan from the audience I was at, but I'll forgive it that as over all I found the movie enjoyable and fun.<br/><br/>And there haven't been many of those this summer."

","This story had a lot going for it: a great cast, a fun story, the possibilities of modern CGI, and the landscape of western Europe. I was willing to overlook some of the absurd historical inaccuracies, like the possibility that Julius Caesar's bloodline survived into the late 5th century. Historical fiction can have some poetic license here and there, and getting too critical on the details would be like condemning Shakespeare for the liberties he takes with his plays.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of some of the campy samurai movies and Sinbad adventures of the 70s, or even Conan the Barbarian. The fight scenes were just plain goofy. A look at the director's resume explains a lot. Aishwarya Rai was very pleasing on the eyes, but there was no chemistry between her and Colin Firth, or among any of the characters for that matter. With such promising material, I can only chalk up the mediocrity of this movie to bad directing. Doug Lefler should never be given something like this again."

","Again I had to write a comment for this because lot of people gave this movie quite good ratings...<br/><br/>It really hurt watching this movie and I watched it until the end only to see my opinion confirmed. It has absolutely no relevance to the real world at all though it tries to give a feeling of how the world looked like and worked in terms of politics and society at those times around 400 B.C., even movies like Oliver Stones' ""Alexander"", Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" or even Wolfgang Petersens' ""Troy"" managed to get a more realistic approach done.<br/><br/>Some people might say that this movie isn't about relevance and facts at all, but about entertainment, but even that didn't work out! The plot is stupid and predictable; the dialogs are by far the most worn out and stereotype dialogs I have witnessed in a Hollywood movie in a long time; the movie is filled with plot holes and continuity errors that shouldn't have been there considering the budget they obviously had for it. All the time they try to get some thrilling moments through and a few seconds later they throw in some gags; neither of both works out. The characters are lame, two-dimensional and you can't relate to any of them (in fact watching the movie I hoped for them all to die...).<br/><br/>To conclude my opinion about this movie; it's a waste of time and money; don't watch it, you'll regret it for sure, like I do..."
"falacta","3","4","8","2 November 2007"," Seen it, choked on it, don't buy it
","It's a shame that this movie leaves so much to be desired. The backstory could have worked but the movie has too many flaws to deliver a convincing narrative. The historic setting is a big letdown. First, despite what some foreposter might think reenactors would say about it, late imperial legions didn't look, fight or work that way, even more so were the Goths a far more sophisticated people than the Conan types portrayed here and I do not really know what to make of those Britons shown in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I guess up to Capri the movie could have worked as a lighthearted action flick, but on what basis a Roman general concludes he can find a loyal legion left in Britain when that island was evacuated by the Roman empire more than 60 years prior to preserve military assets is beyond me. That aside there is probably no other spot of the Western Roman empire farther away from Italy which is not a safe spot for a boy when everything including Italy is overrun by barbaric warlords.<br/><br/>The weird thing here is that the travel itself is completely omitted to have a weird last stand against a bad guy that is essentially introduced at last minute and had no relevance on anything that happened before so one can have an epic battle.<br/><br/>Overall the movie seems to me a complete kitbash production that lacks for me any indication anyone invested real sweat and consideration into the making of it which makes the 6 year production time sound like it was cooked on a very small flame because none could be actually bothered to try to make it work.<br/><br/>Basically this movie doesn't work on the very basic level and it seems to me anyone from the actors to the editing crew knew it and only invested as much work into it as their contracts required.

"folsominc2","2","5","11","22 March 2008"," Last is Right!
","When I heard about the newly released on DVD movie, ""The Last Legion,"" a historical action drama with Colin Firth, Thomas Sangster, Aishwarya Rai, and Ben Kingsley, I just knew that it was going to be something that I would really love to see.<br/><br/>What I got was a hodge-podge of choppy clips that was more or less like re-enactors playing out a scene. From the very first ""stunt"" by Sangster's double, which was so obviously faked and not Sangster, to the more than apparent painting of the aqueducts and other scenes, it was a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film was timing. After watching and viewing it a couple of times, I turned on the Director's Comments on the DVD and found that they were working on a very tight budget, hot miserable weather and a lot of the cast was sick. I also learned that many of the grotesque scenes where the weapon connects with the body were cut in the American version.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of cutting extra violent scenes from the movie when the viewer can get the idea anyway; however, what I am not a big fan of is cutting the 1-or-2-second follow-thru shots that give closure to a scene. Example: When Mira goes down to the dock to acquire the boat they need for sailing to Capri. She reveals herself as a woman, visually seduces the boatman, and knocks him off the dock. There should have been a follow-up 1-2-second shot of the men again watching and their reaction to give the scene closure.<br/><br/>Another very confusing section of the story was why was Mira the aggressor in the ""romance"" with Aurelius? Why didn't he even seem interested? I learned from the Director's Comments that Aurelius was a widower. Nowhere in the entire movie was this clear, but if it had been, it would have cleared up their relationship. Although the story was primarily about Caesar, the boy, the clip illustrating the budding chemistry between Mira and Aurelius as they ""practiced"" fighting should have lasted longer than 60 seconds.<br/><br/>I was also extremely disappointed about the trip across Europe and the Alps toward Britannia. To the viewer, it looked like a hop-skip-and-a-jump, and needed a more powerful delivery of what they were enduring to reach the 9th Legion. Also, when Ben Kingsley fell to the ground to celebrate his homecoming to Britannia, why did the other characters just step over him and walk on? This was a scene that needed more time, plus a dingy probably should have been added to the dock, otherwise, how did they get to shore? Who and what was Vortgyn (Harry Van Gorkum) other than a tattoo artist with a bad attitude and facial problems? And I thought ""Win one for the Gipper!"" speeches were passé? <br/><br/>The almost final scene was also the final big disappointment. The death of the Goth who had killed Caesar's parents should have come more as a surprise, possibly with Aurelius falling to the ground and the kid piercing the bad guy after he falls. Aurelius' final shot should not have been him near dead and lying on the ground. If he was going to live, he should have been standing on his feet at the end and supported by his soon-to-be wife. The hero should always end standing! <br/><br/>There are just many different areas where I could point out where the viewer was left hanging, but it would take probably as long as the novel.<br/><br/>I understand if the director was suffering from budget problems and time restraints, however, I think that this picture which had great potential with such leading character actors could have been much better if it had been another hour. Why do something that will obviously not be remembered as very good if you can't do it right? The director and crew fell into another common error as many others do.It was apparent they were too close to their subject matter. The viewer doesn't know what is going on and their cutting confused the viewer on the complete story line which is completely unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Have to give kudos to the performances of Colin Firth, Thomas Sangster, Aishwarya Rai, and Ben Kingsley and the other cast members. They did the best they could with the material they had, and the lack of foul language, sexual situations and blood squirting fifteen feet was a big plus for this movie.<br/><br/>One final line that will probably be remembered from this movie is after shortly destroying half of the Goth army single handedly, Aurelius tells Mira, ""You are a fine warrior but careless!"" You are not jealous are you, big guy?"

","Somebody compared this film to Gladiator when trying to defend its historical inaccuracies but the thing about Gladiator is that it was actually a good film. If this film has been well-written, entertaining, or appeared to have a budget of more than a few hundred pounds spent on it then maybe it would have been able to get away with some of its other flaws. There was no characterisation AT ALL, the plot was so mundane and predictable I wanted to claw my own eyes out and the acting was utterly insipid which is hardly surprising as I imagine the cast members with any degree of talent (and in particular Sir Ben Kingsley) must have been crying themselves to sleep every night that their careers have come to this. People have also commented along the lines of ""at least it's better than King Arthur"". That's like saying getting punched in the face is better than getting kicked in the balls. I'll take neither thanks. To anyone who hasn't seen this yet and is thinking about doing so all I can say is don't. Under any circumstances. Ever. Just sit at home, watch Gladiator again and congratulate yourself on what a lucky escape you've had.

Romulus Augustus was born in 461 and would have been 14 or 15. The young emperor's father was killed in battle before Odacer reached the Roman capital where Romulus Augustus abdicated and either fled to or was exiled to southern Italy. He died there with little notice by the outside world. After his abdication, the world looked to the emperor that his father deposed (Nepos) as the legitimate Roman emperor. Constantinople recognized Odoacer as viceroy of Italy for Nepos, not Romulus Augustus.<br/><br/>So, maybe Romulus Augustus ditched Campania for Brittania with a group of loyal followers. Maybe. But they wouldn't have found the 9th legion there. The 9th was probably recalled to Germany and disintegrated during the revolts there in the mid 2nd century.<br/><br/>Finding the 9th legion in late 5th century Britain would be like finding Hession mercenaries from the Revolutionary war still holed up in Pennsylvania somewhere.<br/><br/>I left when I saw the battle brewing - a battle that none of the contestants would have been present for.<br/><br/>I will research the next historical film that I spend $9 to see. If anyone connected to this film was involved, I will skip it."

If you are expecting a movie similar to First Knight, 13th Warrior, or even King Arthur (2004), you will be disappointed. The fight scenes were not choreographed well at all. There was never a sense of danger in any of the fights, and the movie was way too ""light hearted."" I don't think there was ever a direct shot of violence, all of the movie's violence was dumbed down (some parts the hero had just dispatched an enemy and his sword was still squeaky clean). The action was very much like Xena or Hercules TV series - cheesy. There were also quite a few scenes that attempted situational comedy and only just passingly achieved it. I did chuckle a couple of times. I wouldn't normally even talk about plot (Give me action and I'm happy) but the plot in this movie jumped around a lot and didn't transition well. I don't want to be completely negative, but there weren't really any positive aspects to this movie. Bottom line - if you enjoy Xena or Hercules, go see this movie. If you enjoyed First Knight, go to the store with your money, buy some popcorn and soda, and watch your copy of First Knight on the couch."

In the book she is called Livia and is one of the survivors in her land, so why she is forced to fight. The story is first of all about the fall of Rome and not about Arthurian legends.

","I really enjoyed this film for the sensitive way in which it talks about legends and heroes. In a world full of cyber-heroes, a legend made by warriors of flesh and blood who fought for strong values and ideals is comforting. The accent was not on fighting scenes but on the values people like Aurelius, Vatrenus, Demetrius served; the same values even a young emperor respected. Maybe it is not a spectacular film script but I got the feeling I really understood the message: It is always about the truth. All in all, Colin Firth's acting convinced me about that, he was once again great!

","I have read this book and I really enjoyed it. For it to become a movie the directer either had to prepare to make a long drawn out movie or snip/rewrite a lot of the storyline. This I understand. And you only have so much money to invest. It seems to me that Dino De Laurentiis Productions did not care to make a great movie; they wanted a descent director (cheap) to make a descent movie with high paid actors. Never mind quality. Many a movies are made like this these days and it compromises the quality of movie making. It would've looked better to have seen Merlin(Ben Kingsley), during the climactic battle scene, making explosives - something quite magical in those days - and hurling at the enemy rather than shooting fireballs out of his finger tips. Its not believable nor does it do justice to an actor of his caliber. I only hope that the lack of good, sound direction and production of this movie will not harm Ben Kingsley's reputation.<br/><br/>It's just so surprising to see how many quality actors there were in this production. Put Ben Kingsley, as I have mentioned before, Colin Firth (English Patient), John Hannah (Four weddings and a Funeral), Kevin McKidd (Train Spotting, HBO Series:Rome), Aishwariya Rai (Veteran actress of Bollywood)in one movie and mix it with bad production and sophomoric direction you get a movie that will probably go directly to video. I had hopes for this movie. I do not advise watching such a waste of talent."

It is a good read (as re his other books), characters are developed well, plot is believable and you can get engrossed.<br/><br/>It is in other words, everything the film is not.<br/><br/>The script does contain the bare bones of the books plot, but the whole journey across Europe to the shores of Britain is missing. Scenes are disjointed and badly edited, you get no sense of who the characters are and what drives them.<br/><br/>They had Sir Ben Kniglsey (doing a dodgy Welsh accent - supposedly to show some link between traditional legends that the Arthurian stories were Welsh in origin) yet the action is set in the far north of England. On reflection I am sure this will be one film he hopes doesn't come back to haunt him.<br/><br/>I certainly don't blame the actors, lets hope the screenwriter takes a long hard look at his material before putting it in front of another producer.<br/><br/>As to the the lengths of swords as has already been pointed out, Roman cavalry swords were indeed longer (watch Gladiator's opening battle scenes and note Maximus' sword!!!)

One thing that I didn't like was the villain characters. They were both a little bit out of the spirit of the movie, they seemed like comic characters which didn't fit in with the rest of cast.

"mharrsch-1","5","3","6","20 August 2007"," Weak Lead..Weak Director..Weak Screenplay
","Well, I saw The Last Legion on Saturday afternoon and must admit, even though I wasn't expecting a lot, it was still a bit of a disappointment. Although it was supposedly based on Manfredi's book, the screenwriter used only the beginning and the end and skipped all of the hair raising journey across Gaul and narrow escapes from Wulfila. Kevin McKidd's screen intensity as Wulfila outshone almost everyone else and instead of capitalizing on it, the director chose to limit his screen time and spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on the PG-13 adolescent fencing between Aurelius and the woman warrior, Mira.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I also found Colin Firth less than charismatic and his performance rather lackluster. The young man that played Romulus Augustulus, Thomas Sangster, was good and those piercing eyes should serve him well if he should make acting a long term career choice. I see he already has quite a start on a filmography even at his young age.<br/><br/>Although a little low key at times, Ben Kingsley did a good job as Ambrosinus/Merlin and could join the ranks of Liam Neeson and Ian McKellen as a believable ""wise mentor"" figure. Indian actress Aishwarya Rai was beautiful and quite physically energetic despite the confines of a PG-13 script. It's just too bad she didn't have someone to play opposite that could engender more screen chemistry.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed that Alexander Siddig, another fine actor as evidenced by his turn in Syriana, was given practically a cameo role as the Byzantine ambassador who was quickly dispatched after revealing that the emperor of the East had chosen to recognize Odoacer rather than give refuge to the boy Romulus. And, John Hannah was totally miscast as complicit Senator Nestor. In fact, a friend of mine said she wondered if his death scene was supposed to be humorous!

Better read the Wikipedia articles before watching this movie, which is as I said entertaining, I give it 2 stars especially because of the Indian girl..., as well as because of Mckidd extraordinary acting, but it's a historical blasphemy also and doesn't deserve more.

That is where you can end the positives. Everything else is very low quality and in some cases, unbelievably bad.

One keeps hoping that if they had the wisdom and integrity to shoot on site and not resort to computers that the awkwardness will end and a good stretch of the movie will begin. It never happens.

The studio has tried to make it appeal to as many as possible, there's the token strong female character who, once revealed, struggles to fill the armour (should have given the job to the stunt guy who plays the earlier scenes), the attempt to kill Caesar with repeating bolt throwers (a dagger would have done the job).

","The Last Legion Spoiler warning, The Last legion is set at the fall of the roman empire and follows the last emperors struggle for survival as he escapes his foes and is finally forced to Britannia (Briton) where he recruits the help of former Roman soldiers.<br/><br/>I was dubious with this film when I noticed Colin Firth not only present in an action period drama, but starring as one of the main fighters in it. I would not need to tell anyone with the faintest knowledge of films that he is not cut out for such a role. He is a posh, pompous upper class, British of British man. He is dubbed the thinking women's pin up. With this suit wearing ball attending intellectual demeanor, is he really suited in a bloody, gruesome highly action based film, cast as a sword expert, master tactician and rough and ready soldier no less. The short answer is no, he does not suit the role one bit. I might have been more inclined to change my view on him had his career not deviated so drastically from such a role. This all being said, his character was perhaps the strongest (in terms of quality, depth and believable acting) out of the whole casting on the film that was littered with potholes, terrible acting, poor effects and ridiculous clichés. What clichés I hear you ask? Well for starters the age old idea that the good guys can quite easily kill around twenty enemies with little effort, even though the enemy has probably had just as much experience fighting as they have. But the main clichés, the thing that really pisses me off is when they cast a bloody woman as an Amazon style one woman army who shows up the men. Now I know that I am going to be slated and called all sorts of sexist names for saying this but it is near impossible that a women could ever accomplish that! There are a number of reasons why, for starters this incredible ability to kill dozens of other people with apparent ease is a gift not even Bruce Lee could hone so effectively, secondly just think how historically inaccurate it is. Women were not trained to fight, if they were then it was in self defense and a rarity. Even if a women was trained as a warrior then no one would hire her to fight for them, not just because women were not taken seriously in that way but also just think of the humiliation a senator or noble would face if they needed a women to do their fighting. My final point for the dislike of the clichés and the most sexist is that women are weaker physically, they are smaller and will almost certainly be slower than a man when wielding any kind of strong weapon such as a sword. And lets not forget the knockers, they can disadvantage women when fighting or even firing a bow at times. The portrayal of them being as strong and in many ways better than men as warriors is ludicrous. Now for the potholes, to start off with the film makes sense, it explains the situation and the fall of the roman world, the storyline makes sense right up until they free the emperor from his prison, a couple of things such as the druid dude randomly walking into the Gauls throne room struck me as a little odd but I could still get what was going on. Where it began to lose itself was afterwards, I understood that the east half of the empire had given into the enemy and so was no longer a safe haven and I sort of understood the idea of heading to Britain as it was the last place that might have had an army. But how did they manage to get there if everyone was so eager to destroy them? How did everyone know where they were headed, and what is more, how did they find them afterwards as Britain was one giant forest? It made no sense. Then, when they did find them, why did they fight, why did the townspeople defend an emperor or an empire that had firstly abandoned them and secondly brought an army down on them? The fight at the end was stupid too, they claimed they were fighting for freedom. How and on what grounds? How did the young dictator represent freedom, ""hmm a hereditary monarch yes that sounds like liberty and power of the people."" Oh and a final point that annoyed me, the black dude and the younger white dude arm wrestling, like the skinny (by comparison) white guy could fair against a guy with biceps the size of his head. In conclusion I think it was a shocking film."

It's a shame as the film had so much potential - which is probably what the cast thought. What a total waste of acting talent! <br/><br/>The fault is most certainly due to the director who lacked vision. The film lacks any form of direction and does not seem to know what its target audience is. Is it a historic action film? A family film, perhaps? Neither as it happens. Just a mish-mash of genres trying to please everyone and pleasing no-one.<br/><br/>Despite a good story to build upon the film just seems a bit aimless and lack-lustre. The cast had not been given any proper direction and the screenplay itself also left little room for character development. The result of this is that there was no empathy for any of the characters who seem quite one dimensional.<br/><br/>However, it was the bad editing and camera-work which I found to be the the most off-putting. Clips were cut far too short with no lingering moments for emotion to be portrayed. Even the camera-work was sometimes shaky. Given the beautiful scenic backdrops the cinematography could have been amazing. Instead the cameraman chose to do middle-shots almost throughout. The whole thing just seemed a bit amateurish.<br/><br/>In my view what could have been a really good film with great potential was ruined by a total lack of direction and inability to use the cast to their full potential."

","And this time I'm gonna do it differently! I've watched 43 minutes with 54 still to go but I've built a firm feel for the film and a surprising notion seems to be stuck in my head: this feels like an Indiana Jones film. A bit of humor, some nasty baddies... it's all there. In some odd fashion, THE COLORS look like they're from The Last Crusade. (And I mean this in a very positive way.) How crazy does that sound? Even the score resembles that 'building up to a swashbuckling adventure' kind of thing so familiar from the Indiana Jones films (without ripping off). And this leads to my main point: that beautiful sense of adventure the Jones flicks had this one has too - galley loads of it. It's a nice throwback of sorts, into a time when movies were fun and thrilling at the same time. By this I mean mainly and most recently the 80s. I don't wanna count in CGI-induced child's plays as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and others on this list of adventure films (entertaining as they are) coz... I just don't. Maybe a movie or two of the new Disney-owned Star Wars franchise has that special sense of... perhaps a naïvity and innosence in the fun and adventure - as did the first Star Wars films. Without rambling any further I'm gonna recommend this for the whole family of 1 or 10 or 11 even as I'm just getting ready to see the rest of the film. Maybe I'll revisit my review later on and give you a recommendation as to where the movie stands when considering families the size of 2-3; 4-9; 1+ cat and/or dog."

He plays Romulus Augustus, who is about to become Caesar. He is protected by Aurelius (Colin Firth) en be tutored by Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley). Okay, does this sound great or what? Romulus' parents are killed by some enemies who want take over their power. Aurelius, who has sworn to protect Romulus until his last breath, even if he has to die for it, goes down after a few slaps. When he wakes up, everyone is gone. Romulus and Ambrosius are kidnapped. Aurelius is determined to rescue them! He gets help from a knight, or no, a knightress. In the beginning the knight wears a mask, to give the illusion he's a man. But then there's a surprise, not a pleasant one. It is Bollywood's Aishwaria rai! She doesn't wear the mask the rest of the movie, so what was the purpose of wearing it in the beginning? Only an audience purpose? This woman is like Uma Thurman. They look alike, but Uma can act, Aishwaria cannot act. To have a pretty face does not mean you can act. I know, I can't act, I have a pretty face, but you don't see me in movies. With a bad cast as Aishwaria and Thomas Sangster this movie cannot be saved anymore. Even not by Colin and Ben.<br/><br/>But Romulus has to be saved (story continues). He finds a beautiful sword. His enemies want to take that sword. It looks like Lord of the rings, but in this case the ring is a sword. In battle Ben Kingsley stands with his arms wide like he is shooting fire balls, like he is Gandalf. Aurelius (Colin) gets beaten twice and hits the ground. He is about to die after two slaps! What a wuss! His body isn't pierced or something, he hasn't broken something. Aishwaria rai gets him in her arms like only she can do in the romantic bollywood movies. Is this a comedy movie or something? These are the people who have to protect Caesar (Romulus).<br/><br/>Ambrosinus starts a fight with an enemy nearby a tree from sleepy hollow. When all battle is gone, Romulus throws away his sword. Luckily enough the sword does not hit anyone. No, it hits a rock and there it stays for many years. Yeah right.<br/><br/>This movie is a waste of your time. Or, it was a waste of my time for sure!"

I wouldn't bother with this movie, that is one and a half hours of my life I will never get back. It is downright embarrassing to see Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth, and Aishwarya Rai in this piece of, fluff is too kind of word to describe this movie. An epic it is not.

","One of the sweet history falsifications nicely implied into the fine family movie. A lot of Anglo-Saxon and Western propaganda on the Ancient history, as usual. A lot of facts mixed up with a lot of historical nonsense make this film a mish-mash good afternoon entertainment for your kid. First of all, the path of the last Western Roman Emperor has nothing to do with this movie. Emperor August was captured by Odocar and sent to Southern Italy fortress from where he never came back as far as history knows. He did not have blood of the Caesars but was a son of a Roman who was Athila's clerk in occupied Pannonia region and who came to high position in Rome and later appointed his 12 year of son as Romulus Augustulus a Roman Emperor. There was no sword of Julius Caeser connected to King Arthur (whose existence has also never been proved), no Legions to fight Goths or anyone else to save the emperor ... also, we got some banal mistakes as wrong costumes of Eastern Roman uniforms at that time - ones shown in the movie look like Arabian. Worst of all is global encyclopedia dogma served in this movie as well: this was not the last legion; the last Roman Legion had seen the seventh century in the Estern Roman Empire. After that was transformed as military formation. Also, that time was not the fall of Rome, because Rome lasted all the way to 15th century even though attacked, ravaged, sacked and raped by the worst criminals in human history - ""Crusaders"" and imperiled by many other barbarians and savages mostly coming from the very same west. That is what Rome left as legacy to Brits: pillage and hunger for the Roman gold. Whole Churches had been sacked and transported to the west during these decades of ravaging. Capitol of the Roman Empire from 4th century - Constantinople, lasted for almost 1000 years more as biggest and most developed city in that time world by all means. It is so hard for today Westerners to mention that and it is clear why. Even without mentioning Christianity in the West or the East, Last Legion got lost trying to imply the topic of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" being clumsy in covering the fact that only the Western Roman Province of Italy had fallen, and Roman Empire continued to exist for thousand years more developing a high civilization that is going to distinguish every day more and more from barbarians around them, including these that occupied Italy, all the way until she falls.

"willcundallreview","3","2","5","28 October 2015"," Failed swords and sandals
","You know when you watch a film and within the first few minutes you just know exactly how it will turn out? , well insert The Last Legion because it's that. It's basically a swords and sandals adventure film that looks an awful lot like a bad version of Indiana Jones but set at the fall of the Western Roman Empire and also not as funny. The movie is basically about Romulus Augustus and he becomes emperor, guarded by Colin Firth of all people (playing a character named Aurelius) and many things happen and it sends his city and the empire into dismay. The plot is just really dull I mean it's not that it's awful or anything but this was just made so badly that you can't even enjoy the plot or ever feel anything whatsoever for the people involved.<br/><br/>Based on a book the movie see's an extremely long journey which in this film is more like 5 minutes long. The cast involved consist of some pretty big names including one from Bollywood screens of all places. As mentioned Colin Firth stars and he is pretty basic, he isn't as bad as some others but I just felt he was wasted and I have no idea why he took this job. Ben Kingsley plays Romulus's teacher of sorts Ambrosinus and he is really in the same boat as Firth, not bad but never OK, I felt let down with all the stars on show. The person from Bollywood is Aishwarya Rai who plays an agent from the Eastern Roman Empire and quickly becomes embroiled within the plot, now Rai is not bad but I did feel she is wasted like the others, her character could have been alright but she is yet again thrown in among the generic characters put out here.<br/><br/>Doug Lefler directs and his vision I feel is left in such a way as Rome at the time, in a complete mess. It just feels so average the plot but the way in which it looks and feels, it just makes it very poor and a bit of a mess to be honest, Lefler never quite takes the movie up a step. Tom and Jez Butterworth are the main writers or you could say they adapt this but in truth if this is similar to the book in anyway then the book must be pretty bad because this is not written well as a movie. The script is like something you see in a bad TV or straight to DVD movie, it feels so cheesy and it even tries at times to make you laugh even when the scene is kind of going along seriously. <br/><br/>I can't let this review go without the mentioning of the villains. The movie has a serious problem with throwing villains at you actually and not in a good way at all, One bad guy is the invading Goth Odoacer who is one of many Goths with Scottish accents and also a rather bland villain, I expect a villain to be notoriously evil but he just doesn't come off as that, not really a scary kind of bad guy. <br/><br/>So overall The Last Legion is no good, bust, a movie I actually find hard to recommend to anyone. I mean action-adventures should be easy to enjoy, easy to watch and also one where you can watch it again in the future. This is none of the things I mentioned and to rub it in you get some silly special effects which only go on to hamper the movies reputation, Oh wait there, some decent fight choreography, so yeah there is one alright thing about this movie."
"tomlu1","10","2","5","27 May 2013"," Very enjoyable
","Wonderfully made movie. No magical powers here and other fancy special effects, but very dramatic and thrilling regardless. Definitely worth the rental charge.<br/><br/>It tells the story of the last stand of the Roman Empire until it's fall, which leads to the story of King Arthur and the famous sword, ""Excalibur"". But that's for another movie. It mainly focuses on the last blood line of the great Julius Caesar and the quest of the most powerful sword ever forged. <br/><br/>I love these kind of movies and this movie I will cherish like the rest of its kind."

","About 40 minutes into the film I decided it was meant to be a family film. But no, a little while later I changed my mind and decided it was probably meant as an epic adventure but had seriously misfired.<br/><br/>In fairness to the cast, I thought they were all pretty good. Lots of reliable supporting Brit-actors. Thomas Sangster was fine, so too Colin Firth and I quite enjoyed Ben Kingsley's performance despite the Welsh accent.<br/><br/>What let the whole thing down was a lack of characterisation and time. When I watched the bonus features - the deleted scenes - I found that I would have included every one of them. The film was pretty short at 97 minutes and could easily have taken on another 20 minutes.<br/><br/>As it was, the characters were never fleshed out or developed. There was no time spent on building tension for the fight scenes. The supposed super-baddie - Vortigern - was no more than a bloke in a gold mask (and Sauron beat him to that!) who rode on 50 minutes into the film.<br/><br/>The director has to carry the can for this. It could have been okay but instead ended up as a mess. It's the sort of film that will languish in the bargain bins of DVD-land unless De Laurentis allows a re-cut and adds some weight to the film.<br/><br/>I think it could be worth a try."
"GypsyGeo","4","2","5","28 March 2008"," Disapointingly boring
","While there was nothing particularly wrong with this film, it was predictable and very boring. The production standard was satisfactory, the acting adequate, and it should have been enjoyable, but it wasn't. There was no excitement - no action. Lots of things happened, but sword fighting and movement do not make for excitement.At the start, the boy emperor was threatened with having his hand cut off, but we knew it wouldn't happen. The magic sword was crafted from a meteor. (What a clichÃ©). It gets tossed away at the end of the film and ends up sticking into a rock (so that Arthur can find it later and pull it out). It would have been better if the boy emperor was under a much greater threat and the danger to him was more pressing. Everything in the film was so predictable. The idea was fine, but it was let down by the very dull script and the lack of adventure. It could have been a fine film. It wasn't."

You have Sir Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth, Kevin McKidd (the star of HBO's excellent 2 years only but it was really expensive and the 2nd season wasn't as good as the first show ROME) Peter Mullan, Alexander Siddig (George Clooney's Syriana) and no Aishwarya Rai is pretty but she can't act doesn't add to anything at this point. Terrible run-on sentence I know but back to this so-called movie. I didn't find any of this entertaining and how this even made it past the development stage I cannot understand. The acting is a joke, the script is absolutely laughable, so much of the dialog is so bad you think you're watching ""Power Rangers,"" and last but not least the special effects are as bad as a Saturday night Sci-Fi channel movie! If this is the only movie you have seen on the legend of Excalibur, hurry up and forget it because It doesn't do any sort of justice to the legend. It's tag line is ""Before King Arthur, there was Excalibur."" Please do not let that fool you. It is the worst movie any of these actors have probably ever done, and it is even worse than an Oscar winner (Ben Kingsley 1982 Gandhi) now has one more terrible movie to add to his resume. The other one of course is the Uwe Boll (the worst director of all time) movie BloodRayne. If you want to see a good film watch ""Sexy Beast."" Now that is a good Ben Kingsley movie. 2/10"

","Yikes - one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Both in terms of history and myth this dog has no teeth and a mangy coat. The screenplay is a Power Rangers episode stretched way beyond the elastic limit, the acting landed somewhere between giggle and groan, and the direction was late-night infomercial. Terrible.<br/><br/>The basic idea here is that the sword Excaliber was forged for the conquerer Julius Caesar, but laid hidden when the last of his lineage ended with Tiberius. Fast-forward 400 years to the year 460 when the Roman Empire is crumbling, and the new Caesar is a young boy, torn between savage Goths and cowardly politicians. If only he had the magic sword, he could save the day... turns out, the plucky lad is a descendant of Julius Caesar, he does find the sword on the island of Capri, he takes it to Britain (with the help of Merlin the magician, a sexy ninja from India, and Colin Firth the Roman Soldier) where he kills the bad guy and later sires King Arthur.<br/><br/>If that sounds lame enough to be funny, just try watching this dog all the way through.

","The movie had decent qualities to it. It won't win Academy Awards (but then again with all the crap coming out of Hollywood lately, it might).<br/><br/>My problem is this: Hollywood cannot simply take history at face value. It constantly has to tinker with it, and when it does not like it, completely re-writes it. (Think Pochahantus) Romulus Augustus, was barely 13 when was deposed by the Germanic king, Odoacer and lived a very private and uneventful life at his villa estates on the coast of Italy.<br/><br/>Yet Hollywood needed to rewrite this sad final chapter in the Western Roman Empire's history."
"begob","5","2","6","18 October 2017"," Doesn't add up
","The infant emperor of Rome turns to a faithful legionnaire to rescue him from captivity and assist his flight to a far off land ...<br/><br/>The story is based on a novel, which I bet was plenty fat. There is a huge amount of history and incident packed into a very slim 105m run time, to the point where our heroes survey a snowy Alpine pass for a moment before a map-montage of Transalpine Gaul flashes up to represent their epic journey to Britannia, where they conveniently step to shore from a boat. And it turns out this is a prequel to a very famous myth, promoted to the status of legend by its Roman associations.<br/><br/>So the story is hugely ambitious but with only a fraction of the resources needed to deliver a satisfying production. At least that's the way it feels, yet it has a stellar cast and a huge budget. And the script is by a renowned playwright, and some of the locations are interesting (especially the recreation of the Isle of Capri). Something doesn't add up.<br/><br/>It's not just that the dialogue is painfully plain, but the editing and writing keeps hurrying us along through what should be a fascinating land of oddities and magical encounters. For some reason the story is coy about magic, only hinting that it's anything more than a clever hoax, and the climactic battle is extras in a field spinning and kicking and roaring, while the showdown with the nemesis opens with a ""startled!"" sound effect as a little girl looks around and ... he's there! Just bizarrely bad. I imagine the screenplay came in at 180 pages, and the producer said, ""Great - cut it in half. With a sword.""<br/><br/>The cast do OK with stiff lines, and the actress with the amazing blue eyes has less difficulty convincing us she's the unlikeliest all-action knife twirler than that she enjoys any chemistry with the glum leading man. The music is lavish orchestral stuff, but no big deal.<br/><br/>Overall: Interesting concept, underwhelming delivery."
"Jack_McSchmock","3","2","6","21 August 2008"," Cheesy poof!
","I was just watching this movie fifteen minutes ago, and it almost left me speechless. Not because Ben Kingsley's in it. By now, everybody should know that his ""Gandhi"" days are long past forgotten and after starring in ""Blood Rayne"", I've come to expect the worst of him. Also not because it contains some of the most hilarious bad acting since ""Indiana Mutt and the Crystal Numbskull."" No, it was because this movie simply is the perfect embodiment of processed cheese, gleefully smeared on a screen. And as always with those genetically faked all-natural ingredients, it has you wondering if it really DID taste better the last time you ate it ...<br/><br/>To the point, about everything in here is totally, unbelievably cheesy: the action, because obviously no one bothered to make it look half way serious (Where's that damn stunt coordinator Mel Gibson hired for ""Braveheart"" when you need him?), the costumes, because one couldn't help but notice how embarrassingly cheap they were, the pee-pee-poor dialogue uttered by characters cut out of a wet cardboard box still dripping with script-writers urine, a plot straight outta development hell, where you can see the final twist coming from a dozen Galaxys far far away... And did I mention the whole let's-just-pretend-it's-acting yet? Colin Firth (who is arguably the lead character) plays his part like he's not paid enough to care, above mentioned Ben Kingsley auto-delivers some corny Gandalf ripoff which could've made the whole ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy fail miserably (provided they had him using the same ridiculously fake blue beard), and Miss Rai ... well, let me say she's a beauty to behold, until she remembers why she's on screen in the first place. And if I tell you now that she's the single one character in this (supposedly heroic action-)movie who gets all the best fighting scenes, it should tell you something about what's considered ""best"" here. But at least, you can see she's used to moving her butt from all these dancing classes and stuff, but the others all look like they could't fight their way out of their own underpants unless threatened at gunpoint by Samuel L. Jackson, demanding his entrance fee back ... but okay, let's just be merciful and pretend this never happened. BTW, there were some more once-famed-for-I-dunno-what actors in the cast, but I completely forgot about their completely unmemorable performances as soon as they left the screen.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, one could easily smite this as a cheap and loveless medieval / fantasy hybrid for mental midgets which pretends to have something in common with ""Gladiator"" while dressing up as a dim-witted Hobbit, but if you're into unintentionally droll movies like ""Battlefield Earth"", you'll only be half disappointed that you rented this boredom-steaming pile of turd and not ""300"" again. On the other hand, if you're still twelve years old and therefore in the target audience, you might enjoy this flick anyway, but that's plain because you don't know any better."

According the movie the boys says ""5 Caesar were murdered before me, so what will happen to me"" and when the boy was becoming Caesar it seems that Rome empire is week. Since 5 Caesar murdered, the movie shows how week the empire becomes and fall down. After this point the whole movie is actually based on saving the new Caesar from the enemy. Once he's saved by his guard, he goes to the north Rome where he finds the rest of the army. Then in the north Rome with the new army they fight the enemy and the lord of the enemy. Once the lord is defeated the fights over and Rome is free. The movie did not have visual effect and violence. In other word no blood when stabbing. This movie is like PG rating..

","I wanted to like this movie more than I did. I'm normally a sucker for these kind of historical romantic fantasies. But I think it had several problems. Much of it might be due to the use of music. The score seemed 1) Kind of dated (could be because another reviewer said it was a shameless copy of Manon Lescaut by Puccini) but it just didn't have a contemporary feel to the mood it tried to set ... like something Williams or Silvestri would have composed. And 2) It was ubiquitous! Every time the kid picked his nose, the ""hero"" music would start up. It was just WAY over used. It started feeling like an old Cecil B. DeMille technicolor ""over the top"" epic where the color is TOO rich and the music TOO inspiring.<br/><br/>Lefler might've done well to remember that sometimes ""less is more.""<br/><br/>The plot was a little formulaic as well with it's cast of characters. The love story subplot seemed forced to me. I didn't get ANY chemistry from the two. Mira had more outfit changes than Lady Gaga at the Oscars. And the storyline could have been told with a little more mystery in it's pacing perhaps .... but that damn ""hero's score"" swelling to a crescendo every 90 seconds just ruined it for me.<br/><br/>All in all, it's watchable and a fun rollick ... but it's not the epic it could have been with a few changes. Perhaps even with just a change in the music."

","There are some precautions you have to take when you plan on watching this movie. Firstly, you have to accept that you will learn absolutely nothing about history. This movie is meant to be about as educational as a monster truck show, so no need to complain about the various preposterous inaccuracies. The makers obviously didn't care about facts, neither should you. Secondly, you have to buy that the fierce Roman commander in this movie is played by (of all people) Colin Firth. Nothing against Colin Firth, but no matter for how long he grows his beard, he'll just never look tough. Hell, even the kid he's protecting seems like he could totally take him out. Thirdly, the performance by Ben Kingsley is really hammy, which is funny at first but then really just starts insulting your intelligence.

It's ridiculous, it's impossible-- please stop. And if by chance there were such women, whom history somehow overlooked, I'm sure they didn't look like highly made-up models with skimpy outfits and contemporary hairstyles that never get mussed in even the most violent encounters.

That said, the best performance came from young Thomas Sangster as the boy emperor Romulus. He more than holds his own against his veteran co-stars, and he delivered all his lines perfectly. As for delicious Aishwarya Rai, she looks good and fights well enough to justify being given the part of the woman warrior. Rather disappointing were Colin Firth, who looked like he was having second thoughts about taking the role, and Sir Ben Kingsley, who gives his philosopher-sorcerer an Indian accent as if he was another Gandhi. And the great Harry Van Gorkum is masked throughout the movie so you don't even get to see him until the very end. Story-wise, while the first half of the movie is almost a snooze, at least the last half-hour picks up and it ends quite satisfactorily."

","Ever since ""Braveheart"" in 1995 and ""Gladiator"" in the year 2000, Hollywood has noticed that making similar movies is a secure bet. However: this is not always the case. Sometimes they are very spectacular to watch and become very fine movies indeed. Such examples are ""King Arthur"", ""Troy"" and ""The Lord of the rings"". But every now and then, they screw up and the movies that were supposed to be impressive blockbusters become nothing more than the most expensive fiasco of that year. Two such letdowns are ""Alexander"" and Kingdom of heaven"".<br/><br/>I'm sure that ""The last legion"" wanted to be amongst the finest of its kind, but it ends up being the total opposite. It's an expensive waste of talent. The movie is monotonous and the so-called deadly duels seem like sparring compared to the ones in ""Gladiator"". The only sort of interest is Bollywood-actress Aishwarya Rai who plays the part of Mira. Besides the fact that she is truly beautiful, she is also the only one whose fighting seems genuine. Colin Firth should stick to romantic comedies or social dramas because he doesn't seem to know how to handle a sword. His acting is OK though; it's just that his fighting isn't any good. Ben Kingsley has already impressed us in classic films such as ""Gandhi"" and ""Schindler's list"" but here he plays a character who seems to be the brother of Gandalf. And then there's also John Hannah; another great British actor who's been given nothing to work with and thus ends up falling short like pretty much everybody else in this doomed picture.<br/><br/>In short: If this is the today's standard for future battle movies, then I truly hope this is ... the last legion."

","By my number rating, this film could have been much better than it is. I felt like I was watching a wide screen version of Xena: Warrior Princess at times. Sporadically cheezy, with, as other reviewers have noted, great actors made to look amateurish by a director who is far more at home directing TV.<br/><br/>It could have been longer, with a more even flow; with sets that could look less like paper mache, and who designed that DisneyWorld waterfall beside the styrofoam Stonehenge? But, the story and charm of the characters is far better than the summer effects-laden blockbusters that have all come and gone. Aishwarya Rai's picture may make it on my wall.<br/><br/>This is a decent family film that could spark conversations on history, mythology, and film-making from a non-American perspective.

","I read the book, and was excited when I heard they were making a movie. Alas, I was already disappointed when I saw the trailer. They screwed up half the story in just 3 minutes for me. And, as if it could not get worse, they got all the costuming wrong. Can't Hollywood just make a historic view of the roman world. Example: they show the Roman legionaries (The LATE ones) with helmets that weren't even real. They are a Chinese interpretation of a coolus helmet. Further more, the shields are wrong (Not at the end, I mean before they find the 2nd century stuff.) The Late Roman Army had round shields, and they looked more barbarian (since they employed barbarians). The tunics and costuming are all wrong, the helmets are wrong. And in the end, where they find the 2nd century arms and armor, the Lorica Segmentatas are all made of leather. THIS IS A GRAVE ERROR THAT Hollywood AND CO. KEEP REPEATING! I see it too much. If you want to see what Romans looked like in the 2nd century, go to www.legiosix.org, and if you want Late Romans, go to Fectio. (google it)"

","The movie moves us to the year 476, the beginning of the dark years and the end of the Old Age. A historical and interesting event with little protagonism in the cinema. Do not expect history lessons. Nor is it fundamental because the vast majority of works in this genre pass the historical fact as far as I know, and yet almost all are entertained. But .... What problem has the cinema with the Goths and in general with all the peoples called barbarians ?. I suppose until they prove that there were also gay hot springs in Germania we will always be offered so rough. The last legion is bad with balls, a rehash of Braveheart, Gladiator and Lord of the rings. Many of the actors feel sorry and the only one with name (Ben Kingsley) interprets to an old flamenco dancer. Action scents distil scent of cardboard. The whole part in the castle of Capri is to start trembling, and eye that is the longest. Already in the final part I believe to have seen actors in plane laughing at the shame of others that transmitted the speech to William Wallace before the battle. The evil of the mask is a mad man, and the final battle is an anticlimax. I do not find anything positive and what I do not understand after all this, is that it has become very short and I have seen it without any pause, so I put a 5. What happens to me, doctor?"

"Leofwine_draca","5","1","4","25 June 2016"," Average film with a great cast
","THE LAST LEGION is a semi-realistic historical fantasy based on a novel by popular Italian historical novelist Valerio Massimo Manfredi. It's a story that attempts to merge both Roman history and Arthurian legend, and although it's not always entirely believable, it does have a fast pace to take your mind off the unbelievable bits.<br/><br/>One of the worst things about this film is the cheap and cheerful direction, which makes it look like a B-movie. I wasn't surprised to find out that director Doug Lefler cut his teeth on both HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS, because THE LAST LEGION looks a lot like those shows and has the same kind of shaky, bloodless action scenes.<br/><br/>However, the film does have a great cast going on it with nearly ever role in the film occupied by familiar faces. GAME OF THRONES fans are in for a particular treat with parts for Iain Glen, Nonso Anozie, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, James Cosmo, Robert Pugh, Alexander Siddig, and Owen Teale. SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND star John Hannah plays virtually the same role as in that show, and ROME's Kevin McKidd is the bad guy. The major roles are claimed by Colin Firth, who never really convinces as an action hero, and Ben Kingsley, reliably entertaining as the wise old sage. Meanwhile, Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai plays the token female role, unbelievable in the fight scenes but heavily sexualised throughout, much like Keira Knightley in KING ARTHUR. THE LAST LEGION isn't a great film, but it's a passable time filler and just watching all those familiar faces filled me with joy."

Now, no problem on the absence of gore, that's okay, but with the realism of fights. halph of what we've seen was too pirates of the Caribbean-like fighting with no realism.

","It's baffling that this film didn't do better at the box office. Of course, there was no marketing; maybe that had something to do with it.

A lot of the critics are cynics who travel in packs.<br/><br/>Though predictable, Last Legion was thoroughly enjoyable. Good performances all around boosted the watchability factor. The film is not avant garde or the super epic of late, but it is arguably a swashbuckling affair. I am a supporter of the challenging art film, and, nevertheless, I liked this film. There were some interesting things going on, for instance, the romance."

","The previous critique said it wasn't Troy or 300 and for that I was very grateful, as I didn't really groove on either of them. Especially 300 which I thought was a waste of good retina and I didn't see it all the way thru. This is a very entertaining movie in the tradition of entertaining historical movies like Lawrence of Arabia, Saving Private Ryan, Ghandi, et al. Not that this is of the same caliber as it was a low budget I guess. This has a great story, likable characters, nice acting and nice action. I'd read the novel this was based on and knew what was coming but still enjoyed the evolution of the plot. Good for kids to see and in fact good for anyone. This tells the fictional story of the last legion of Rome, protecting the Emperor, a young boy, who has to flee to Britain where the 9th Legion - still supposedly intact - is based. It ends with a fine battle and Excalibur with back-story fully revealed. Didn't you ever wonder how it got into the stone? Colin Firth is the central Roman who seems pretty wooden most of the time but is helped a lot by Ben Kinsley and a very beautiful Indian actress - and a great performance by the child. Get it and watch it."

","This movie, though had a good premise and the potential to be classic and creative, was nothing short of a TV movie, worse than lifetime.

Yet, upon seeing The Last Legion its obvious that he should stick to his romantic comedies rather than war epics. To mention the war scenes in this movie, is to say only one word... terrible. No five dollar word could explain just how TERRIBLE these scenes were. You half the fight scenes took on a Disney side where there was nothing shown or they were so fast you didn't have time to soak in the action moments. <br/><br/>The writing was frankly terrible and worse yet was the death scene of the main villain who only appeared in the movie for a total of ten minutes. <br/><br/>It simply isn't worth anyone's time."

It's not just that the plot is almost entirely different, many parts changed, a lot of them discarded. What is much worse than that, is that it has quite poor directing. Events just hope around with very little intermezzos, the story is poorly shown and it has even more clichés than the book. Many times it just gets annoying and confusing. The whole move feels extremely rushed forward.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, in my opinion it has lots of potential, but it's just a shame how badly executed it was.<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed by this movie, it had potential to be a decent piece on par with gladiator and king Arthur, but it falls very short.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you get the book first and watch the movie after."

","After reading several bad reviews of ""The Last Legion"", I was prepared for a very bad film indeed -- but instead, I found a good one. The performance of Ben Kingsley as the wise man Ambrosinus would, alone, have made the movie worthwhile. His Ambrosinus is a man of warm quiet confidence -- someone who is totally his own man -- a hint of humor glowing beneath. A convincing performance.<br/><br/>The performances of all major characters were fine or adequate. The least realistic character, of course, is Mira. While women have fought alongside men through the centuries when their lands were threatened, a professional warrior woman in this period is not realistic -- though Aishwarya Rai's performance made the character as realistic as it could be. The romance between Mira and Aurelius was mainly unconvincing to me, but fortunately not too obtrusive, and there are one or two good moments in their romantic interplay.<br/><br/>The relative lack of special effects was no problem at all for me: I saw the movie as mainly character driven, with good action sequences and surprisingly good dialog -- even inspiring. And that was the overall effect of the movie for me: inspiring."

","We (my wife and I) just came back from seeing ""The Last Legion"" and were *thoroughly* entertained!! The film kept a good pace and I never looked at my watch and my mind never wandered - the comedy was just enough to make you laugh here and there, and the action was well-planned and executed. We weren't sure from reading initial reviews that we wanted to see it in the theater, but it was worth a shot. As fans of movies like ""Beowulf and Grendel"", ""King Arthur"", I can say that for me, ""The Last Legion"" could go ""sword to sword"" with ""Excalibur"". While it does not exactly dove-tail into the Athurian Legend, it makes a pretty good go of it.<br/><br/>If you know the legend of King Arthur, well, I guess, you can say that every legend has a 'legend' And when I saw the sword go up into the air I knew it would end up in the stone. And I had my suspicions early on that the ""old sorcerer"" might turn out to be ""Merlin"".<br/><br/>The actors (as noted) played their parts well and brought this film off without being too pompous, fake, or full of themselves. The dialog was fine by *any* standards and it wasn't overly bloody or violent. To be sure, the 5th century WAS a violent time, and the Roman Empire was a tottering ghost of it's former self. Don't worry too much about the historical inaccuracies - remember, the first rule of watching ANY film is ""suspension of disbelief""....if you want history then watch ""The History Channel"".<br/><br/>I would have liked to see Russel Crowe in the lead, but 1) they probably could not afford him and 2) how to you top ""Gladiator""? The location shooting in Tunisia, Slovakia and ""Brittania"" was beautiful, and the camera work was excellent. Many directors choose to make films today that are dimly-lit, with jerky-hand held filming, and washed-out. This wasn't one of them. We go to see a film to be entertained for two hours (or so). I consider a film that does that to be success. This film may not win any Oscars, but we'll buy the DVD when it becomes available. It's worth the price of admission."

But if your looking for a movie where good fights against evil and wins out in the end, where a man's word is his bond, then you will like The Last Legion. <br/><br/>It has been a long time since being able to watch a movie without being embarrassed over what is being portrayed on the screen. When it comes to love making, it's far sexier to give the illusion of what they are about to do and then jump to another scene. So not having to turn my head every few minutes from embarrassment was delightful. It was like a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>Watching histories come to life on the silver-screen has always been at the top of my list of special movies. And many history movie buffs feel what they are seeing are true and accurate facts. Sad to say this is not always the case. Now, if the life of the young Caesar, being portrayed in this movie, is true fact, I have no idea. <br/><br/>Though lately, according to the Internet, evidence has been found in the caves of eastern terraces of Tintagel that King Arthur was a real person. So who knows? All I can say is if you are looking for accurate history, then watch the History Channel. But if you are looking for a good movie, then The Last Legion is for you."
"LeroyBrown-2","4","1","6","1 March 2009"," A bad mix of History and legend
","""The Last Legion"" tries to tie in the last Caesar with the legend of King Arthur. The legend of King Arthur has been for a longtime been linked to the Romans. The latest linking is that Arthur was a Roman soldier who commanded Sarmatian cavalry men in Britain against barbarians. Anyway ""The Last Legion"" mix in historical characters with mythology. Very rarely is a movie very accurate in telling historical events, mixing in legends you know that historical facts are out the window.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the naming of a young boy as the new Caesar, Romulus Augustus. Soon Barbarians invade Rome, kills the boy's parents and capture him. Of course there's treachery involved, I mean what's a Roman story without a good backstabbing? However there are a few soldier who will support the new Emperor no matter what. And they set out to rescue him and take him away from the clutches of the evil barbarians, hoping they could take him to the 9th legion or 'the last legion' in Britannia. <br/><br/>The movie's premise no matter how ridiculous, has the making of a good action adventure fantasy, but out right the movie misses out on that. First off a good fantasy film must have a good dream like quality in the cinematography and the lighting. This movie is too bright, specially in the outdoor scenes. It has none of that dusky look that makes fantasy films look more like a dream. The action is pretty decent but the ones with the female warrior just seems too choreographed. The sets have that crumbling look as befits the waning days of the Western Roman Empire.<br/><br/>The acting was not all that bad Ben Kingsley did a decent job as the Ambrosinus, he plays it with enough playfulness as a role in a movie like this requires. Kevin Mckidd makes a decent villain although I wish his performance was a little more over the top because the role required. The big surprise for me is Colin Firth, long have I dismissed him just like American producers have as the bland good looking guy in the movies who rarely if ever gets the girl. Here he's very good as the commander, he shows a quiet strong and authoritative presence plus he gets the girl, Aishwarya Rai. I don't know how her part got in the movie? She's just not the least bit believable as a female warrior, she doesn't have that ferocity that Lucy Lawless as ""Xena the Warrior Princess"" had. And as for her being the most beautiful woman in the world, I'll take Diane Kruger anytime.<br/><br/>The screenplay really doesn't explain too much to us, particularly the reason the commander and his soldiers remained royal to the young emperor. Neither did it explain why the boy became the new Caesar. Historically the boy's father completed a successful coup d'etat and made him a figurehead while dear old dad became the power behind the throne. The movie doesn't even give us a line lamenting the end of the Western empire.<br/><br/>The movie just fail on so many level and I put the blame squarely on the the director, producers and the writer. What they made is an action adventure pretty much like the ones from the 60s starring Steve Reeves"

","The Last Legion is a lavish, all-star mythological/historical epic with an ambitious storyline that links the last Caesar of Rome with Arthurian legend; it's also horribly miscast, boasts stilted dialogue, suffers from poor visual effects and mediocre action, and mines every hoary medieval movie cliché imaginable, all the while pandering to a family audience with its child-friendly blood-free battles.<br/><br/>Colin Firth stars as Aurelius, commander of the imperial guard, who leads a small band of warriors (including Bollywood hottie Aishwarya Rai as sword-swinging badass babe Mira) to rescue child emperor Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) and his teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley) from exile on Capri, after which they schlep to Britannia to try and find the last of the Roman legions.<br/><br/>Director Doug Lefler's previous experience includes helming episodes of Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess, and it shows, his film feeling more like a feature length version of one of these cheesy shows rather than the grandiose sweeping saga it so dearly wants to be.

"Shalotka","4","0","4","8 March 2011"," Imperialistic, naive, inaccurate, cute and therefore insanely funny.
","Oh, dear. It's a really bad movie, but still worth watching, even for laughs (or for unshaven Colin Firth).<br/><br/>I swear I was told it is an ""epic historical drama"". By my sense, it is just a little less historically accurate than ""Asterix in Britain"". Why didn't they go for a full fantasy picture, but only used style of filming typical for fantasy movies and pretended to be using historical setting? Maybe that's how you could film a legend.<br/><br/>Legends, however, most of all show how certain people today want to define their identity. By this interpretation of the Arthurian legend Britain apparently says: ""we, the British, have the true spirit of Roman soldiers, and totally so do Black and Hindu people under our rule."" I'm not sure if it's plain imperialism or just political correctness gone wrong and whether I should laugh (well, I did almost every time I saw that fat African-American dude among the Roman legionaries) or just get sick (it's a modern movie, do people really think that way?). I think Firth's many roles as an upper-class English gentleman contribute to this picture.<br/><br/>There are many things that didn't make sense neither historically nor within the plot. It's hard to say whether the creators of the movie were ignorant or rather purposefully wanted to show their beliefs and values regardless of the general knowledge. I'm not going to list every detail, but surely the better you know history, the louder you'll laugh.<br/><br/>Putting the confusing overtones and nonsensical settings aside, it is an enjoyable adventure with some funny moments and moving hugs. The movie is also family-friendly, because there is nothing inappropriate except sword fights. And even though Aishwarya Rai looks gorgeous, there's no chemistry between the male and female protagonists, the romance is implied just because they are the male and female protagonists. The implication is so weak, that I (an imaginative adult) honestly though they lied on the bed together because it was cold.<br/><br/>My guess about the target audience was perfect. Within IMDb demographics the movie is rated the highest by Males under 18 (action-adventure plot with a sophistication of the last decade's PC game) and Females over 45 (sincerly, Colin Firth has never looked so manly in any other movie). Doesn't it speak volumes?<br/><br/>I must have really overrated the movie with 4 stars, but at least I had a good laugh and didn't get bored. Also, there was the moon shown twice in different phases, which is the most rare things in movies (in almost all cases it is only the full moon which is the proper hint that it is night) and that excuses the poorly digitally pasted backgrounds in view scenes and saves a star.<br/><br/>Dear me, I still can't stop laughing. Maybe re-reading some fragments from a history book and re-watching ""Mamma Mia!"" will help me restore sanity.<br/><br/>And if there is any new movie about Spartans, Vikings and Ninjas coming out, make sure Colin Firth is in it. Unshaven."
"MBunge","4","0","3","24 September 2010"," Colin Firth: Action Hero!
","The cartoonish absurdity and fumbling melodrama of this movie can be summed up in a single phrase - ""Look! It's Colin Firth: Action Hero!""<br/><br/>In the dying days of the Roman Empire, a young boy is crowned emperor just as the Goth's invade and sack Rome. The deposed child emperor Romulus (Thomas Sangster) is imprisoned on a distant island. His bodyguard Aurelius (Colin Firth) teams up with Mira (Aishwarya Rai), a mysterious warrior from the Eastern Empire in Constantinople, and leads a small band of generic action movie characters to free him. After freeing Romulus and the boy's teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley), our intrepid band also picks up a magic sword. Left with no other place to go, they set off to Britannia for the last Roman legion loyal to the emperor. They're pursued by Wulfila (Kevin McKidd), the Goth put in charge of Romulus' prison, and in Britannia they run into a guy in a golden goat mask named Vortgyn (Harry Van Gorkum). It all ends up in a huge battle where Aurelius has to rally the last legion with one of the lamest battle speeches ever and that ends with all of the enemy soldiers needing to have telescopes to know they've been defeated.<br/><br/>The Last Legion is like an action movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture. There are certain plot points and character moments that are standard in action movies and this film ticks through them like clockwork. These filmmakers don't even try to do anything we haven't seen in a hundred other action flicks before. Frequently, it appears the filmmakers don't even understand why they're telling the story the way they are. They just know this is how the story has been told before, and that's the only way they can think to tell it.<br/><br/>There's no sex in this film, there's no interesting dialog and the action is both pedestrian and fake. There's a scene where Romulus falls 30 feet to a stone floor, breaking through a wooden staircase on his way down, and the kid gets up like he fell out of bed. Aishwarya Rai spins around like a meth-fueled whirling dervish, dispatching a truly ridiculous number of enemies. Even senior citizen Ben Kingsley runs around kicking ass and taking names.<br/><br/>If you've never seen an action movie set in the Roman Empire before, you might find The Last Legion mildly entertaining. But if you've never seen an action movie set in the Roman Empire before, you should watch Gladiator, Spartacus, Ben-Hur and about a dozen other films before you even think of watching The Last Legion."
"anthony_retford","Null","0","3","30 May 2010"," Kids Will Like This
","I thought this movie would be one I would enjoy after watching Spartacus - Blood and Sand, and also knowing I seek out movies concerning Rome in general. Actually I wish more attention would be paid to the Roman Empire based in Constantinople. That 1,000 years has certainly got short shrift from historians and film makers. Consider how many films have been made about the Roman Empire before 450 AD and then compare that to the number of films subsequent to that time, in fact for the whole 1,000 years and it is sad to see. I am convinced that almost all of us have gotten only part of the story of an empire that lasted until 1470 in total. It is known that the Russian Czars considered their reign a continuation of the Roman Empire. They were in power until the 20th Century. Remember that Czar is Russian for Caesar and that they were named the Romanovs.<br/><br/>However The Last Legion is not an adult movie in any aspect. The fight scenes were laughable (but suitable for kids), and the required romance was forced and artificial. And that is what this movie is for - kids. They don't know about historical accuracy in shields, armour and helmets and really do not care, and that is as it should be. All in all it would be enjoyable for kids from 7 to 10.<br/><br/>I did appreciate the thought that went into the ending. It took some imagination, although I remember thinking that about the sword when the kid first got it from the statue of Caesar and I could see the inscription on the blade."

","I saw this movie with no idea of what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it and but when I came to IMDb I found that it was given a pretty low score. Did I see the same movie? After reading some negative reviews it seems that the majority of low reviews seemed to be expecting a different type of movie, based on the trailer. I watched the trailer on the DVD and is it misleading, and full of spoilers (as they always are). That's really too bad because on its own this is a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>It is light-hearted and family friendly, but I don't see those as negative qualities. If you want dark and gritty Lord of the Rings meets Excalibur, then you will be disappointed. But if you've been disappointed by most every ""sword and sorcery"" type movie to come out in the last 20 years then this movie was a refreshing change of pace. The cast is first rate and the production value is good - far better than most Hack N Slash movies."

","OK... just to say it. The movie isn't that bad. Actually is a combination of old legends put together just to give as a message that we really need heroes. And that's true. The story is great ( with it's errors), the sort of story that will make you want more. The actors are a really good choice, even though, and this is a minus, the dialogs are a bit rusty. We should suppose that a 10-13 years old child should speak like Romulus in the end ? And Aurelius speech before the battle ... let's just say he needed something more to appeal. If you want a movie that combines action, history and romance, this isn't a bad choice. You will probably get a chill down your spine when that legion will appear in the right time , at the right place. I won't comment about it's minor errors in the script , and how the story seams a bit too far-fetched because I've really enjoyed this movie.

"realbobwarn","7","0","2","16 February 2009"," A good watch - with a 'cute' story twist. Good fun.
","It is a good film for what it is: an adventure story built on one legend and trying to add their own. There have been several theories about 'King Arthur' (if indeed such a character exists). Much was invented by medieval monks who updated the legend to their ere (hence 'knights in shining armour in the traditional view)- it was further dressed up by Tennyson and Malory and others in the 19th century. (See also Wikipedia). A recent Nat Geo Channel documentary looked at a few options - one of which was the Roman link: possibly a Roman soldier who with some others with British families, remained behind when the Legions left.<br/><br/>The matter of who's sword was Excalibur (or spoiler warning - 'E S Calibur' ... )? Well: we do not even know if a King Arthur ever existed at all. So, for story tellers .. who cares? One legend is as good as the next. In this context, the film is 'good fun' - and the cast do a good job. Highly recommended. With a higher budget and more script work and maybe some recasting, etc, it could have been a story alongside 'Gladiator'."
"blubb06","6","0","4","5 January 2009"," Gladiator meets (celtic) King Arthur
","I'd give this movie 6 and a half stars, it's a very watchable tale in the vein of ""Gladiator meets King Arthur"". Completely dreamed up, of course, and promoting a typically skewed view of the ancient world, but serious fans of Ancient Rome (like myself) shouldn't expect a big budget spectacle to be more interested in real history than Indiana Jones. It takes the ambition of an Oliver Stone to break up the usual mold of the ""heroic fantasy with modern political overtones"" genre as defined by ""300"" and ""Gladiator"". Anyone interested in the facts can read up on Wikipedia. In short: Not much is known about the last Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, besides that he was deposed and succeeded by the Germanic king Odoacer, as a child. Augustulus' father Orestes came from modern day-Yugoslavia, had served under Attila the Hun (now there's a story!) and usurped the Roman throne. In terms of old-fashioned ""Romanness"" and claim to divine descent from the likes of Julius Caesar, Romulus Augustulus is about as true as the Roman legions of that time. But his (short?) life must surely have been interesting, and his vainglorious name embodies all the hope and hubris of an empire long past its prime.<br/><br/>Other than historical names like Romulus, Orestes and Vortigern, the movie is entirely fictitious and in part attempts to rewrite the King Arthur Saga, complete with Ambrosinus/Merlin conjuring up fire out of thin air and a ""romanesque"" version of Excalibur. Whether little Romulus, given his family background, would have seen Celtic emblems and rituals as anything other than barbaric hocus-pocus would be an interesting question. The historic Lord Vortigern, who is also said to have invited the Saxon invasion by settling the first Germanic mercenaries in Britain, is cast as a villainous celtic priest who wants to steal the fabled sword of Caesar from Romulus.<br/><br/>Two things I did not like: The over-pretentious, occasionally boring music and the predictability. The main characters besides Romulus are action stereotypes - Not-Red-but-Black-haired Sonya falls in love with Die-Hard-Hero, and together they do what is right until destiny parts them, or not. Given that we know that little Romulus definitely didn't regain his lost throne, it's fairly hard for the story-writers to come up with a meaningful positive ending. So it's basically ""and they lived happily ever after"".<br/><br/>Two things I did like: The costumes, the action and the overall making - nothing special, but not bad either - and the attempt to make something out of a neglected part of Roman history, if fictitious and by stealing other people's ideas, i.e. the Arthur Legend."

","""The Last Legion"" is a fun, high spirited, sword, sandal, and sorcery movie that can be enjoyed by a parent watching with a child, or with his or her own inner child. This is a movie like they used to make. I kept expecting Tony Curtis to pop up and say ""Yonda lies da castle of my fatha."" This isn't ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" ""The Last Legion"" isn't graphically violent or pompously portentous. It's just a good, old fashioned yarn about Roman emperors, invading Goths, Hadrian's Wall, and fulfilled prophecy. There are gorgeous costumes, fun escapes, turquoise, Mediterranean waters, Capri and Britannia, archaic weaponry and threatened encampments. From top to bottom, the cast is fantastic.<br/><br/>In places the direction is a bit awkward, and the movie could have been so, so, so much better had casting selected a woman Colin Firth's age to star opposite him. Aishwarya Rai is young enough to be Firth's daughter and their pairing is not attractive or believable. Rai is never believable as a warrior. A small person can overpower a larger one, but not as Rai does in this film. The history is not credible. Other than that, though, ""The Last Legion"" is a movie much better enjoyed than nit-picked. It's a popcorn flick, a Saturday afternoon matinée the way they used to make them. Pop it in and enjoy when you just want to relax and have fun."

"Blueghost","Null","0","3","15 February 2008"," A little unbalanced, yet respectable entertainment.
","Like Variety said at the conclusion of their review, I really wanted this film to be better. I tried to see it in the theatre, but by the time I got around to going out and buying a ticket the film had been yanked. So I rented it in spite of hearing mixed reviews.<br/><br/>I liked much of what I saw, but this film was aiming to be more than what it ultimately became. Which is too bad, because even though it's a fairly solid run-in-mill actioner, it really could have been so much more.<br/><br/>There're elements of Indiana Jones, some Kill Bill, along with a dash of 300, all of which ultimately are riding the revived epic-genre courtesy Pete Jackson's LLLord of the Rings effort. And perhaps that's what holds back this pic from being a much better movie.<br/><br/>In short, what you have here is more market-tested stuff. The young audience wants to see martial-arts action, and so the studio orders the director to put it in. Which is bizarre, since the backers dumped nearly 70-million dollars into this thing to show some strange combination of eastern martial-arts action and fantasy mixed into what used to be called a ""sword-and-sandal"" epic.<br/><br/>My reaction; ""Huh?"" One wonders if this film made a profit, or if it will be remembered years from now like ""Spartacus"" or ""Cleopatra"" or ""Ben Hur"". Probably not. Which is a shame, because if the film makers had just stuck to the basic rules of making a Roman Epic this thing could've shined like Gladiator or Braveheart. But, it is regrettably aimed at younger audiences. And by this I don't mean it was missing graphic bloodshed, but it could have used a most mature approach to staging the one on one action scenes, instead of trying to present a faux Quentin Tarantino sequence to keep the film interesting for teenage boys.<br/><br/>The acting itself is okay. Firth as usual realizes his full potential, and Kingsley gives us a seer with true conviction. The rest of the cast do well, but no Oscars will be found.<br/><br/>The settings are fine, the sets are fine, the art direction is actually fairly top notch. But because the director was told to include certain elements into this film, and was told to take it in a certain direction, the film misses a finer mark.<br/><br/>Example; the opening action sequences do foretell what will culminate in the final climactic third act showdown. In fact it's pretty lackluster. The fall of a major urban hub that's the center of civilization is no mean feat. Yet we're only shown a small segment of what has to be a colossal confrontation between two armies; the Goths and the Garrison of Rome. The PG-violence doesn't bother me, but the scale of the battle (lack of cutaways to other parts of the city and so forth), create a knowing frown for the viewer. Wouldn't it have been nice to see the Romans in their full glory at opening of the film? Also, given the cinematography in the opening sequence, one is led to believe that this is going to be a serious epic. Costumes, sets and performances are top notch, but the catering to young boyish sensibilities truncates a more majestic quality that's never realized. As I alluded to before, instead we get derring-do replete with narrow escapes and martial arts' moves that look like they were lifted from a Hong Kong Kung-Fu B-movie.<br/><br/>The historical accuracy/inaccuracy doesn't bother me a great deal. This is, after all, a film about legend, but I was somewhat taken aback that there weren't more Christian references given this particular period of the Roman Empire. It wasn't too important, but a mention of Roman culture (either pagan or Christian, or some state of flux in-between) could have gone a long way to helping ground this film.<br/><br/>It is ultimately a film that's aimed at late-grade school to middle school aged boys, so the liberties taken with the genre aren't too surprising. But I've yet to hear praise of this film by those who specialize in catering healthy offerings to youth. I think largely because this film tries too much to cater to everyone. It's an epic; it's an action film; it's a love story; it's a ""fantasy"" film; it's a period piece and so on.<br/><br/>All in all I happen to like it, but only marginally. Like I said in the opening, I really wanted this to be a better film. Respectably shot, the teetering from one genre to the next, along with a few leaps in logic from one plot point to another (notably the lack of buildup to the opening battle scene) hampers the film.<br/><br/>If you have a spare evening, want to see some Roman sword play on your screen, then you might want to give this thing a chance. But, keep in mind that it is a film aimed at a younger audience, and might not satisfy your expectations for a true classic epic."

Perhaps it was my love for Roman history and the legend of Julius Caesar's unbreakable sword which held my attention. <br/><br/>The picture is set in 460 CE and opens in the city of Rome with a Young boy, who later emerges as the new Caesar. Narration sets the narrative that Rome's best soldiers are returning to Rome to defend its borders, and so we are introduced to Aurelianus. A few exiting battle scenes commence which lead us to the capture of the young Caesar, who by now has lost his empire, and Aurelius' attempt to keep his oath to keep the boy safe. We then arrive at Tiberius Ceaser's Palace on the Island of Capri. For those who know the legend, it is the last place the Sword of the Caesars' was seen. It is here that the legend and prophecy begins to find a hero to fulfil that legacy. In an attempt to forge an army to take Rome back from the Hands of Odoacer, Aurelius takes the boy and their new entourage to Anglia Britain and Hadrian's Wall in search of the Ninth legion, Rome's last legion. Encountering a rebel King and a legion transported into farmers, Hope seems to be lost. The Anglian king also wants the sword of legend, and hearing of the arrival of the young emperor, makes war on the new tribe. The young emperor and his commander Aurelius have one last battle against the rogue King of Anglia in hope of fulfilling the legacy. 'You are Caesar-Wherever you are, always remember' Aurelius Santonius' words to the young emperor before the last battle. <br/><br/>If one looks for historical accuracy, one looses interest within the first 15 minutes, however if one looks for entertainment and has a spurious interest in history and legends, I can guarantee enjoyment. As a historic piece, it is lacking in any truth. For example, the capturing of Rome by Odoacer took over 13 years, and happened in 473CE, which would make the boy, a man. Not to mention the fact that any family connection to Ceaser's bloodline was lost at the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, But hey, how often can historical truth and motion pictures really come together? As a picture it is technically superb. Enigmatic and captivating Performances from a seasoned cast of actors led by 'Drama Center London' Colin Firth as Commander Aurelius Santonius, Who is no doubt a reference to Lucius Santonius, A Lusitanian Warrior who fought with J.C in Gaul and later in the civil wars. The picture entertains with a mixture of legend, well shot and choreographed fight scenes, and two major battle scenes correlated with comic lines and actions which culminate in epic climaxes to the scenes. The film ends with a moving and inspiring suggestion that Ceaser's message of 'Cai Iul Caes Ensis Caliburnus' engraved into the sword gives birth to another great British legend of Excalibur.

The scenery is terrific and the cast consists of some of the better actors on screen who seem to have taken on this project out of respect for Lefler. It is entertaining but hardly deep.<br/><br/>Based partly on history, the story begins with the short reign of 12-year-old Caesar Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) just days before the Goths overthrown the city of Rome. Under the protection of Aurelius (Colin Firth) and Demetrius (a buffed up and solid Rupert Friend!) and after the death of his parents, the young Caesar takes to the hills only to be captured and sentenced to isolation on Capri with his trusted teacher and adviser Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley of course). So far so true. From here however we begin the struggle for finding troops to re-take Rome and end up in Britannia, the home of the last legion of Roman soldiers. Along the way the escaping group is joined by a Mira (Aishwarya Rai), a beautiful 'soldier' from Constantinople and all manner of Goths and turncoat Romans (John Hannah, Iain Glen, Peter Mullan, Owen Teale, Harry Van Gorkum, James Cosmo, et al), but once in Britannia their struggles are rewarded by finding the sword of Caesar that saves the day and becomes embedded in a stone and renamed Ex Caliber. And oh yes, Ambrosinus stays alive through the years to become Merlin, the one who now advises King Arthur as a child who will successfully pull the sword from the stone!

Great, great fun: silly swordplay and lots of objects flying in all directions; Rome full of evil Goths and bad senators, then suddenly we're in Britain....<br/><br/>This one is definitely for the guilty pleasure. It ain't no Gladiator or 300; more like the old 60s Sinbad films - I guarantee any eleven year old boy will love it - just don't start thinking or it'll ruin it immediately.<br/><br/>The time flies by - and it is watchable. Just leave your thinking brain outside and you'll enjoy it. Just don't comment on lighting, direction, costumes etc; all adequate but definitely not big film: will do well on Cable / Satellite and as a New Year movie. <br/><br/>For my money pleasant enough, but horrible if you start thinking in anyway whatsoever...<br/><br/>Cheezy, breezy, and brain easy 5/10"
"jacobyte-3","8","0","3","9 October 2007"," Read the Book, see the Movie, and enjoy the adventure.
","I enjoyed this film for what it is, a good historical adventure, that has been taken from a well written book. It is not meant to be a historical factual movie, but takes on-board factual elements, a bit like King Arthur and Braveheart. I first read the book The Last Legion and thought at the time it would make a good film. The film seems to have missed out some parts of the book, but if you had not read the book you wouldn't notice. This may have been to gain a lower age rating. This is not a movie like The 300, with limbs being hacked off and pools of blood, this is more restrained. There are some very good actors who do the characters of the book justice. One thing that is puzzling me, is I have seen this film before, almost the same form but it was a Technicolour film from the late 50-60s, I can't remember the Title, it's been such along time since I saw it on TV. The endings of the film are almost identical. But that would mean the book by Manfredi was a copy of this older film ?"
"dbborroughs","7","0","3","11 September 2007"," Fast moving action film is good but really could have used more time to flesh out some of the plot points
","Re-imagining of the Arthurian legends via ancient Rome.<br/><br/>The plot of the film has a young boy crowned emperor in literally the waning days of the Roman empire. When the Goths invade he is captured by them and thrown into prison. Rescued he and his few remaining men go to Britain to find the last legion. (And I forgot the bit about Cesar's lost sword) Based on part of a novel by Valerio Manfredi this film suffers from compression. There is simply no way that the amount of plot in this film can be held in 100 minutes. Its not possible. Well actually it is possible since thats the case on screen. This epic tale screams to be at least an hour to an hour and a half longer (miniseries anyone?). The removal of any number of plot details leaves little time for anything but action, action and more action. The action is quite good but the investment in the story is lessened since all we have are the characters heroic efforts to build character and plot points. For example the villain in Ben Kingsley's past is given way too little screen time to really be much of anything.<br/><br/>Over all I really liked the film. Its a perfect rainy day movie. Granted I didn't pay 11 bucks to see this in theaters rather seeing an import DVD so I was saved from over paying for it. To be certain some of the sequences seem to have been filmed with TV in mind, still the sets are opulent and the cast, especially Ben Kingsley are dynamite. As I complained rather loudly above the flaw of the film is that its much too short to do all the things it wants to do. If you can forgive that and enjoy the look of the movie and the action you'll have a good time. Just remember to make lots of popcorn."
"emperor28_1-1","7","0","2","2 September 2007"," Decent Adventure? Yes. History? NO WAY!!
","While I found this movie watchable, one would have had to REALLY hate history to find this even remotely an historical epic. The action scenes were fun, the acting was decent, and there were definitely some humorous moments (Ben Kingsly and the fireballs comes to mind). However, their perversion of history was frightening! Romulus was a usurper, he was the son of Attila the Huns secretary and was in no way, shape or form related to Julius Caesar, Odoacer not only didn't attempt to kill the boy, he gave him an estate in Southern Italy AND an annual allowance, and the Emperor Zeno in Constantinople would have been much more inclined to kill Romulus than Odoacer would have been, as he recognized his candidate for the Roman throne, Julius Nepopos, and wanted the kid out of the picture. And I won't even get started on dates (they open with a banner, 'Rome, 461'; Romulus didn't become Emperor until 475, and Roman troops left Britan during the reign of Honorius, 395-423), or the fact that Vortgyn was the British king who invited the Saxons and Angles into Briton to fight the Picts and Scots, and was definitely NOT killed by Merlin! History aside, though, it was a cute way to merge some historical facts with the Arthurian legend."
"burnett33160","5","0","2","29 August 2007"," The boy was good
","lm giving the last legion a five because though it was poorly done, it was in a funny way and thus sort of entertaining. It is essentially an endless parade of clichés, Rai is not credible as a fierce warrior and there are many laughable minor performances. On the other hand, the boy who played Uther pendragon was very believable and ben kingsley also elevated the film a bit. <br/><br/>Sangster would make a good Robim if christopher nolan ever chose to reintroduce that character into the Batman films.<br/><br/>Onto the director, who appears to have no imagination or personal style, every shot is stock and he does nothing to encourage the actors to rise above the stock characters. <br/><br/>Young kids however, under 14, may enjoy the film and id recommend it for them, perhaps they will develop an interest in ancient epics and when they're older, read the great books, like Morte D'arthur, Homer's Iliad and odyssey, Beowulf, and the Aeneid. This is a possible positive effect of the film."
"eofa1204","7","0","2","23 August 2007"," The Last Legion
","The thing to remember when going into see this movie is that isn't trying to be Lord of the Rings or Gladiator. This is a throwback to the 1950's and 60's style of movie making- no stylized violence, odd camera filters or extraneous CGI. That said the movie itself was very enjoyable. The plot follows Romulus Augustos as he, and remainder of his bodyguard travel, to the ends of what is left of the Empire of Rome to find the Ninth Legion. Along the way they run into Goths, agents of the Empire at Constantinople and talented Indian woman. While they've messed up the dates again and there are any number of historical inaccuracies, the film itself is entertaining. Its an Action Adventure film and it makes no bones about it. I was entertained for an hour and a half- what more can you ask of a movie."
"ericjstevenson","5","0","1","20 August 2007"," Copacetic, at best
","While I found nothing horrible about this movie, I did not find anything great either. I would be OK with this if I had rented it, but I didn't. Finding myself as 1 of the 10 people in a 295 seat theater on opening night should have been warning enough . . . .<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>While the acting was good, the characters were stereotypes.<br/><br/>****SPOILER****<br/><br/>The character who turns out to be Merlin is a trickster, not a magician - no magic there. Excalibur, on the other hand, is sharp enough to allow a young boy to cleave through a bed, a barbarian can use it to hack other swords to pieces, and it will pierce stone. Magic? <br/><br/>The Last Legion itself doesn't appear until probably the final 1/3 of the movie and makes a 5 minute appearance on the field of battle at the very end. <br/><br/>I give this movie a resounding ""Meh""."
"mimacdon4","8","0","3","20 August 2007"," Good old movie making...without the gore
","This film had an innocence to it that you rarely see anymore. It harkened back to the bygone days before CGI.<br/><br/>I think the screenplay could have been better...the book had more character development...there was the troubled past of the hero Aurelius--the loss of his parents at the hands of Wulfila...which had been buried in his memory...and the child he saved who turns out to be Mira, his comrade in arms.<br/><br/>Colin Firth stepped up to the plate as the warrior Aurelius. I would have liked to have seen more of his relationship with Mira.<br/><br/>elemacd"
"katperk2001","6","0","2","19 August 2007"," Not the best, but not too bad
","My husband and I just saw this film today. It wasn't the greatest film ever made by any means, but it was much better than others made of similar subject matter (King Arthur, anyone?). The actors all did a wonderful job, the film moved well, and the scenery was first-rate. However, it was a bit predictable. There were very few moves that I didn't see coming a mile away. Now, I didn't see the senator character's actions, but the rest...Even though I liked the female warrior character, she wasn't exactly unexpected. I don't think I'd see it again, or own it on DVD, but I didn't feel my time was wasted. Since there wasn't any graphic violence, kids could even go (maybe over 9 or 10). It's not real history, but it's a starting point for discussion."
"meadowlark1759","9","0","3","17 August 2007"," Fun summer escape movie
","Just returned from seeing the first matinée of this movie. It's basically a legend set during the Roman Empire. It has plot holes you could drive a chariot through. It can be campy and has some eye-rolling moments. But I LOVED IT !!! Talk about action! It's non-stop. My main disappointment was the absence of a good love scene between Firth and his leading lady. There IS chemistry between them, but not even an on-screen kiss... sigh. The images of ancient Rome and Hadrian's Wall are breathtaking. Even the little kid is believable as a mini-Caesar. See this movie for the fun of it, set your brain on ""non-nitpicking"", and you will have a great two hours away from the 21st century !"
"mardiggan","7","0","2","16 August 2007"," Nothing to Do with Recent ""Roman Hype""
","""The Last Legion"" was initially released, outside of the US, as early as January of this year... which means it was signed, sealed, and delivered before that, and had probably been in the planning stages a couple of years before that. It takes a lot to get a movie to the silver screen. Considering this, I find it doubtful that we're looking at a 'hasty effort' to 'take advantage of recent Roman hype,' as some have said. Being highly fascinated by historical Rome, myself, I really haven't noticed much hype about it lately; only an HBO television drama and the unveiling of a full, 3-D computerized model of the city of Rome, as it would have appeared in ancient times, that was ten years in the making (which I read about in an online science feature, and never saw in any mainstream news source; they're all too busy hyping Lindsay Lohan, Brittney Spears, and Paris Hilton).<br/><br/>This is not a gore fest. This is not an adult movie in the ""adults only"" sense. It's not American made, so it's devoid of some of the Hollywood BS that everybody complains about... and then complains about not seeing when it's removed. It makes no pretenses at being anything other than what it is: a fantasy, with some historical elements, and some elements from a number of myths and legends thrown in. People are slamming this movie for not being historically accurate; they are slamming it because it doesn't have the greatest special effects. I say, take your children to it and have a fun family day with something that just might encourage their imagination."
"freakncage2000","6","0","2","16 August 2007"," A decent movie. Read the novel instead.
","I read the book before watching the movie, which was better than the movie, in my opinion. The film lacked substance, and depth, it seems as if the story of 'Excalibur' was forcefully added to the plot.<br/><br/>The action was so-so, and could be disappointing to those who expect massive battles and intense duels. But, was sufficient in adding some 'oomph' to the otherwise dragging story. The fact that not much blood was shown, doesn't mean the movie is OK with kids; there are a number of awkward 'deaths', like an axe to the head, or being thrown into a burning tree (believe me, its strange when you see it on screen, in this movie).<br/><br/>The couple of Aurelius (Firth) and Mira (Rai) in the movie lacked chemistry, and most of their 'sweet' moments together were either cliché, or corny. Like the action, it barely added anything to the story; it was mostly to spice things up a bit.<br/><br/>Buy the DVD, I recommend it. Its' great for your collection, and more so, the movie is more satisfying to watch on the small screen. For you readers out there, read the book which inspired the movie (bearing the same title); its a lot better than the movie."
"Eden Advance","6","0","2","14 August 2007"," Movie is based on a book
","I've been reading the comments a bit, and after watching the movie, I can't say it's absolutely crap or that it's an Oscar winning movie, just sort of in between. I actually read the book some years ago, and let me tell you, the book is a lot better, simply because there are a lot more details and story in the book. The movie follows the main line of the book, and I might add the book is confusing at some points as well. At least one of the characters was completely changed in the movie (probably to save time) <br/><br/>I haven't seen a lot of movies based on books that are actually better than the book, or even come close to the book, so keep it in mind."
