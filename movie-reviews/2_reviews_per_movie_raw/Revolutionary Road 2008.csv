","So a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided to watch a movie and wanted to see Titanic again, so of course we get to the sad ending where Jack dies, but Rose lived on to have an incredible life, I asked my sister ""I wonder what would've happened if Jack lived? Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have?"", she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road, I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say, especially in 1997, thank God Jack died! OK, sorry for the lousy introduction, I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam Mendes(American Beauty) who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.<br/><br/>Frank and April Wheeler moved to Revolutionary Road in one of New York City's wealthy Connecticut suburbs, and have a daughter and a son in hopes of living the American dream. But April is dissatisfied with her life as a suburban housewife, and Frank despises his marketing job at Knox Business Machines, where his father worked for twenty years in a similar position. They feel that they are unique and special, but trapped in the conformity of life in the suburbs, where they moved to raise their children. On Frank's birthday April surprises him with a birthday cake and a proposal that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. Frank is reluctant at first but ultimately embraces the idea, and the renewed optimism breathes fresh life into their relationship. Meanwhile, April becomes pregnant again, she wants an abortion and has bought a device she has heard is safe if used in the first twelve weeks. Frank disapproves. Later, Frank is offered a promotion and raise at work. Eventually he tells April that for the sake of the unborn baby he has decided not to go to Paris. Extremely unhappy, April starts to go crazy and screams her hatred for Frank as he still tries to continue to make the ""perfect and comfortable"" life for her.<br/><br/>This movie was really amazing, it's one of the most over looked Oscar wise from 2008, both Kate and Leonardo pull in heart wrenching performances. The thing about their characters is that I saw so much of my parents in them, they had all these amazing dreams together, were so in love, but then discover that life jumps in the front seat to what they really wanted to do. Kate's character, April, is receiving a lot of hate, but honestly I couldn't hate her, how could you? Yes, she said some awful things, but when it came down to it, she just wanted the man she fell in love with back again, she wanted to feel alive. The problem was both her and Frank were trying to run away from their problems, then Frank got comfortable; honestly, who knows what would have fixed their problems? But I do recommend Revolutionary Road, I really thought it's a small masterpiece and will get more recognition in the future I hope.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Revolutionary Road is a drama centered around an unhappy married couple living in the 1950's suburbs. They struggle dealing with their lives, how things have turned out, and what to do next. April (Kate Winslet) is a stay at home mother and wife, who seems to want more than that. She had dreams of becoming an actress but it never seemed to work out. She's angry, depressed and really cold at times. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) works in the city, is unhappy with his job and bored with his life. He's just one of those guys that works because he has to. He needs to support his family, even if he hates doing it. Inner demons and problems of his own trouble him as he tries to live out his life. These character have problems and issues just like everyone else. Sometimes they may come off as selfish, cold, or confusing to us. Things haven't worked out, and they're upset. That's whats so interesting about this, you may have friends or neighbors in relationships like this, that would never think of. Everything seems great on the outside, but behind closed doors, it's a different story. We all have had things not go our way from time to time, but it's up to us to make the best from it and move on. April and Frank have a harder time with this. Fair, or not, they are unhappy. You may not necessarily relate to the characters yourself, but you can respect that their are people like this all the time, in everyday life still, that have problems they go through. They may not be as drastic as these problems, but everyone has something not right with them. There are many themes in this film, mainly being love, marriage, relationships, and life.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Winslet give powerhouse performances. They really have a great chemistry together and seem to build off each other. Relationships are complicated and the highs and the lows are really shown extensively. All around great and believable performances with a small role by Michael Shannon, who shines as the crazy guy who tells it how it is. This is a film that will probably be best known for it's acting performances.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty. The film, itself is visually and artistically amazing. The lighting, colors, sets, scenes, costumes, everything is extremely well done. It's beautiful. I loved the cinematography. <br/><br/>I can definitely can understand the hate, or dislike for this film. Due to it's depressing subject matter, it's not really a film you can sit down and just flat out enjoy or be entertained that much from. It's not a film for everyone. If you are just looking to be entertained and have a good time seeing a film, I don't think I would recommend this. It's shows the stark brutal reality of an unhappy suburban couple. If your looking for a film that more than that, one that is filled with terrific performances, great cinematography and direction, then you should check this out sometime. It's a really well made film all around, but be warned, it may be a hard one to enjoy."
"esale1","8","61","70","6 February 2009"," Thought-provoking and sad.
","Having been a 50s housewife with children at home and a husband who wanted to be anywhere but there, this movie was familiar territory. How many of us in those years simply packed our dreams away for the immediate necessity of putting food on the table and paying the mortgage? Di Caprio is outstanding, as is Winslet, she having to deal with an American accent along with the tearing emotions. I didn't see that anyone picked up on the final scene, of Kathy Bates and her husband, but to me that was the whole moral of the story - here is where you will end up if you give in to what you know is not right for you. Overall, though, well done - except women in the 50s did NOT wear hats to work!!"

","Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the incentive of my going to see this film, and I could not be more convinced of their talent than I am after the two-hour brilliance. <br/><br/>This film is reality in its purest, yet magnificently artistic form  the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience, from the overture of an argument to its climax; the screaming, the furious need to verbally and physically harm, punch, kick, no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil, there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles, a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship. <br/><br/>It is all a depiction of two genuine lives that have the potential of existing in complete harmony, yet cannot because of the stereotypical environment and situation they find themselves in. They both crave change, an alteration in their monotonous state of being, but because of the lengthy period of time that they have spent in such a circumstance, their mentality is differently modified. April (Kate Winslet) finds unreserved determination to leave to Paris and although her character seems at times erratic, we gradually come to understand that she is in fact the stronger personality of the two; she truly finds change favorable, whereas Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) seems to find the idea of change more flattering than change itself.<br/><br/>Each choice a person makes can change a life, and that life is not always theirs. This film shows us just how wrong something right can be, as well as how right something wrong can be."

","Love, it's a curious thing. When it's fresh it is new, it is exciting and you wake up every morning just aching to spend another day with the person you love. Then you get married, have kids perhaps and things change. You fight. You fight over NOTHING. You grow to loathe the person you used to love to wake up next to. The world closes in on you and things don't seem the same anymore. You daydream about what life used to be like, how much love you used to be in and ask yourself - what happened??? Frank and April Wheeler meet and fall in love at a party. They talk about how their lives are going to be extraordinary and they are going to be different. They are going to live in Paris. They are never going to be ""those people"" in the suburbs. That isn't what life has in store for them. However life happens, April gets pregnant and they have to settle for a life more ordinary than they had planned for with the promise that someday, they will return to their dreams and complete them.<br/><br/>The Wheeler's dreams do not ever become reality and as the bleak expanse of life stretches out ahead of April she decides to reach out for her personal brass ring and convince Frank that they are better than their home on Revolutionary Road and Frank's job with his father's company and are meant for the greatness that they once talked about having in Paris. April quickly begins to hope again that not only will her life change to what it should have been but that her and Frank will fall back in love again. Frank falls in love with the idea and agrees to go, but has reservations about leaving the job he hates but that gives him a purpose in life. The plans are only a temporary band-aid as their glass house of dreams tumble around them and become a shattered illusion of what it used to be.<br/><br/>This movie is not one that you will send your entire family to see - or even your good friends. It isn't one that everyone will get or even WANT to get. However, this movie will tear out the heart of the people that have been in a relationship that has gone sour and were powerless to stop it. You try everything to stop the inevitable train wreck you see coming but yet, it still ends in a fiery crash and you stand and wonder how your life could end up this way. That's Frank and April and you will come to love and hate them by the end of this movie.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is beyond amazing because it's simple and not overdone by the lead actors. Many things are not ever said - nor needed to be said - and were played with a flick of emotion across the face. I watched this movie expecting Kate to be the one to blow me away as usual and was shocked when it was Leo that knocked my socks off. I felt little sympathy for Frank in the novel but in the movie he plays him so well you can't help but feel sorry for him. I must mention that the supporting roles in this movie are nothing to sneeze at as well.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a wholesome family movie that will melt your heart, this isn't it. However, if you are willing to deal with a bit of stark reality - this is the movie for you. It rocked me harder than American Beauty ever did."

","I saw an advance screening of Revolutionary Road in Beverly Hills, CA this evening (December 14th). A Q&A session followed the screening with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn, and screenwriter Justin Haythe. Photos from the Q&A are attached to this report.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is a story that you won't be able to shake easily. The film will stick in your head and leave you to contemplate what has just happened on the screen before you. Richard Yates gives us the story of Frank and April Wheeler, the seemingly perfect suburbia couple. We soon find out their marriage is teetering on the edge of a collapse as they are overwhelmed by the fact that they have each made the wrong choices in their lives.<br/><br/>Once again Kate Winselt and Leonardo DiCaprio come together with great chemistry, pulling the best out of each other. This is a heavy film with emotionally complex characters, I'm not sure I could think of any two actors that could pull off the roles of Frank and April Wheeler like Leonardo and Kate did.<br/><br/>""Truth is usually in singular - Lies always come in plural."" I'm not sure who said that, but it is a notion that sums up this film.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon shinned in his role as the clinically insane son of Kathy Bates character; John Givings. Bates and Shannon both deliver humorous scenes to this heavy storyline, although there are times when you see the sadness and desperation in their characters as well. Michael Shannon's character, John Givings, is the truth in this film. Although clinically insane, he can see through everyone's lies and does the unthinkable; he forces everyone face their own truth.<br/><br/>I guarantee you will not be singing ""My Heart Will Go On"" after seeing this film. But you won't be disappointed with this little film gem."
"Red_Identity","Null","224","345","25 December 2008"," A beautiful, well-crafted Masterpiece. One of the best of the decade
","Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.<br/><br/>This film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.<br/><br/>The film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year."
"afterglow1-72","10","128","193","31 December 2008"," Revolutionary Road"" is an all around beautifully, artistically crafted film with powerhouse performances
","A show-stopping Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank Wheeler, with remarkable power and an insight we only get from the greatest kind of actors. Allowing the audience to become fully immersed in his psyche, letting us feel everything with him. Living his pain, resentment, and the smörgåsbord of emotions in between. It is a highly accomplished piece of acting from the lead actor that I cannot imagine being ignored come this award season. Frank is a flawed man that many people will be able to see aspects of themselves in. Not being satisfied with marriage, family, work. Feeling we are meant or destined for something greater, yet paradoxically feeling the doubt and insecurity in ourselves to really go after it. He's depressed, has a past he can't seem to let go of, he's arrogant, he's a liar, he's manipulative and in many ways immature. Yet we know him. He's our father growing up, he's a brother, friend or possibly even you. He makes mistakes and is almost embarrassingly human. What I found ultimately tragic about him was not the way in which he lied to others but the way in which he lied to himself. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank. He was terrific in ""Aviator"" , ""Blood Diamond"", ""This Boy's Life"" and others and has rightfully earned his place as one of the finest actors of his generation. Having said that, this is a whole new layer to DiCaprio that none of us have seen before. He brings a new, mature type of authentic subtlety to his craft. He doesn't resort to any big physical transformation. It's all internal. This is a new height for him, and easily the greatest acting of his career. A performance of great emotional intensity and depth that I can say without hesitation, will be remembered for generations to come.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet plays April Wheeler with a sharp fervor. She is angry, depressed and intensely believes she and Frank are destined for something greater than a life of conformity in the burbs. She is a tragic character in that she is basically a closed book, she shuns the love that people try to give her, she is a free spirit and quite the handful. She comes up with an idea to break free of the conformity she shares with her husband in an attempt to revive their marriage and at first it seems to work - the passion for life and each other reignited. But after an unexpected event and other factors, will the dream plan go through?<br/><br/>The chemistry between Winslet and DiCaprio in ""Revolutionary Road"" reminded me in many ways of the chemistry between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in the 1966 film ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". They create an intensity in their arguments that is electric and palpable. You cannot take your eyes off them, they glue you to the screen and stick it to each other as sharply as the couple from ""Virginia Woolf"" were able to. Frank and April's story is grounded in a greater, more painful reality, however. DiCaprio's raging sobs are chilling.<br/><br/>The film is very dark. And the honesty practically guts you in some cases, so I don't think everyone will love it. Watching it was emotionally draining. Sam Mendes certainly did his job well here. It's his greatest film since ""American Beauty""."
"Matt_Layden","7","14","17","2 May 2010"," The American dream is actually a nightmare.
","A young couple living in 1950's suburbia think they are different from all the other families living the American Dream. Although, they soon find out that not every dream comes true and they fall exactly into the situations they didn't want to be in. Their marriage is falling apart, they have trouble raising their children and they want out of this lifestyle.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is a filmmaker who knows exactly what he wants, which is why he would want to work on this film. Revolutionary Road is probably his least interesting film, story wise. After-all, it's just about two people who try to cope with their lives. There is no motivational plot to it, but the thing about this film is that it doesn't need one. We are getting a glimpse into the lives of two people who had big dreams and realized that they had to sacrifice them in order to live their lives. It's sad, but it also rings true. <br/><br/>The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the married couple who constantly fight. Everyone called this film the ""What If Jack and Rose Ended Up Together"" movie. Yet it is so much more than that. They give powerful performances, which unfortunately were overlooked during the Oscar season. Another Titanic star, Kathy Bates, gives her support to the couple as the real estate agent who thinks the world of them. She has a son, who is mentally unstable and asks to bring him over for dinner one night. Michael Shannon plays the son and he steals both scenes he is in. For a guy who is deemed insane, he is the only one who speaks the truth. <br/><br/>I watched this flick because so many people told me how depressing it was. While it was depressing I didn't find it to be that bad. The most depressing aspect of the film is how relatable it is to real life. This story happens everywhere and that is the sad part. <br/><br/>The cinematography is great, the 1950's feel was spot on and really gave the film more of a cinematic sense of wonder to it. Roger Deakins seems to know exactly what is needed for every film he takes on. The look and feel of the film here is so simple, yet so beautiful at the same time. <br/><br/>Finally, I can see why people may not like this film. It's definitely an acquired taste. I was not in love with it by any means and for those involved it's not their best work. Instead it's a film to enjoy once. I wouldn't bother watching it again because the pace is long and I feel that I won't be as engaged a second time. <br/><br/>On a final note, why do guys from the 1950's only last about 15 seconds?"
"detectivedancing","7","20","26","1 March 2009"," Strong performances let down by weak narrative spine
","Many people have said that Sam Mendes' latest forage into dark American suburbia in Revolutionary Road is how Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's characters from Titanic would be like had they have married in that film and Jack Dawson not met his effusive watery grave.<br/><br/>The film explores, from the very start, a broken relationship between the two brought on by banal life on the quiet Connecticut Revolutionary Road and both of them leaving behind the idealistic dreams of youth with DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler in an uninspiring sales job and Winslet's April Wheeler locked into the position of a housewife, briefly flirting with the world of theatre.<br/><br/>It is perhaps fitting that the opening scenes, culminating in a blazing row on an interstate roadside between the two, come after April feels she has failed in an amateur theatrical production. The movie feels like it has been adapted from a stage play rather than Richard Yates' novel with bulleted delineated locations and intense dialogue.<br/><br/>But it is the smouldering argumentative scenes between the Wheeler's that perhaps lead to a lack of fulfilment from the movie. While the feel is very Ingmar Bergman-esquire with gloomy and dark emotions bubbling under the surface, the movie does not portray the wider framework of the marriage strongly enough to carry these off.<br/><br/>The focal point of the film comes when April seizes on a former conversation between the two when Frank describes Paris in passionate terms, discussing his presence there in the World War II. In an attempt to reignite their lives, April suggests they set about moving to the European city so Frank can discover his true calling in life.<br/><br/>This provides an interesting pathway and allows the story to grow through the reactions of Frank's colleagues, a couple they're friends with, their former estate agent (Kathy Bates in her element as an interfering matriarch) and the Wheeler's two children.<br/><br/>It may come as a surprise that I had not referred to the children previously, especially as they fuel the destruction in Frank and April's marriage with Frank questioning whether April actually loves her children at all. The children themselves barely feature, merely used as plot tools to bring the narrative forward. This would not be such a problem but without any form of internal narration from either of them the sense of the true relationship between April and her kids is unclear and makes this aspect feel isolated.<br/><br/>The cold hard realities of the failing marriage are spotted by the estate agent's son, a mentally unstable man temporarily allowed out of an asylum, a notable performance from Michael Shannon, who frankly and with spite notices the hypocrisies and deterioration within the Wheelers romance.<br/><br/>The film uses set-pieces and the supporting cast to attempt to heighten the magnitude of admittedly bravely performed sequences between DiCaprio and Winslet, eventually reaching an engaging, though predictable, climax. While the movie is certainly not revolutionary in terms of its portrayal of a declining marriage (the television series Mad Men set in a similar suburban setting does this with much more care and intricacy), it is a solid piece of work from Mendes but cannot approach his seminal American Beauty. However, one is left longing for a greater insight into why and how the relationship has reached this point to provide much needed groundwork to the frequent marital disputes."
"wl323","9","50","73","28 December 2008"," Powerful - not for the oblivious
","Revolutionary Road has been adapted from the same named novel of Richard Yates. The setting is a suburban area on the east coast in the mid-1950s. Surely there have been many changes of values in gender, society, and family over the decades. Yet,Revolutionary Road, whether the film or the novel, has never lost its power of confronting us, people living in the globalized 21st century, with all the existential issues – questions about life. This is the only movie that I have ever seen which can pose philosophical questions directly yet without compromising the engaging power of drama to its audience. It throws at us with questions about the meaning of life, our responsibility to live an authentic life, our freedom to make choices and decisions, our desire to connect with others and maintain independence, the fine line between the sane and the insane, the limitations of life, etc. <br/><br/>Apparently, April and Frank are diametrically opposite. April is revolutionary, striving for making changes and acting out her desires; Frank is reactionary, always playing safe and following paths opened by others. But, this is not true. Frank was ambitious before marriage. He conformed to the norm for a while, but deep down he felt regretful for the lost dream. Without that intrinsic desire, April would not be able to talk him into moving to Paris at all. (Again, Paris is just a symbol). What is less obvious but crucial for the development of the story is April's passiveness to life. All we see is she pushing Frank to live a life he wants. But what about her? What is her passion about life? We just vaguely know that she wants to be special and live an interesting life. But what exactly it is about? Acting, maybe. But she decided to quit after some setback. Instead of dealing with her own disappointment, fear, uncertainty towards her dream, she averts her frustration by imposing her dream on Frank, making him believe it and actualize it. In doing so, she saved herself from failure to achieve her dream. But, she forbore her responsibility to live a life she wants. In short, both April and Frank possess the same two conflicting dynamics in their minds. It is just that the director highlights the contrast between the pair in order to create a tug-of-war situation, which effectively generates a tension throughout the movie. It is very hard to side with either April or Frank because they were in one in the first place. Personally, half of me goes with April and half of me goes with Frank. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the story is thickly embedded with philosophical propositions, Revolutionary Road is still a very touching love story. From the moment April thrust her dream into Frank's hand, their love was doomed. Being disillusioned and feeling trapped in a life she hates, April became numb to life. There was no more love in her. As what she and Frank had said to their lunatic neighbor, life became empty and hopeless to April. That's how the love's gone. So was the unborn baby. So was April. A funny question arises from Frank's definition of insanity: according to Frank, insanity is the inability to communicate with another human being and inability to love. How many of us are totally sane then?<br/><br/>As always, DiCaprio's acting is wonderful. He is particularly convincing when getting across the vulnerability of Frank. Kate Winslet performs well. However, when I expected some liveliness in April at certain points in the movie, I did not see it. The dialogues and the cinematography are very clever and powerful. We as the audience might have left the theater with a lot of questions that we fear to answer. Just as likely, we might have walked away in reminiscene of our own struggles about living truthfully.<br/><br/>This is a dense movie and worth another viewing at least."

"Golligow","8","139","224","10 December 2008"," Book 10/10 - Film 8/10
","I went to see this at an advanced screener in Leicester Square last night. Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight. So, the book, 10/10, the film, 8/10."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","73","113","8 January 2009"," ""The American Nightmare""
","""I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, just as our memory does. ""  Jorge Luis Borges<br/><br/>Even though Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is set in the suburbs, the reality is, that it is set in a dream world, an illusion; The illusion of purpose, of ones place in society and of what we are 'supposed' to do. We are supposed to get married, we are supposed to have children, and we are supposed to move to the quite suburbs and raise a family. Why? Because that is what everyone does, what everyone has done, and is the ingrained belief that everyone will continue to follow; there is no other reason, it's the blind leading the blind. That is the message that perforates the film, and is the hell that consumes the lives of April and Frank Wheeler. Revolutionary Road is and intricate and intimate portrait of how the so called 'American Dream' is sometimes the 'American Nightmare'.<br/><br/>They were happy once. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) was fresh from the horror, but freedom of the war and April (Kate Winslet) has great aspirations of becoming an actress. Married and in love, the couple buy a modest but quaint house on Revolutionary Road. But nine years later, two children and two crushed ambitions later, the doldrums and encroaching insanity of suburban life consumes the Wheeler's. Frank has an affair with a new co-worker, at a job he cannot stand, and April plays the role of mother, jumping about a few tired stage plays in a desperate attempt to feel alive. Following an explosive confrontation, April pitches the idea that they simply up and leave for Paris, the place Frank (that he visited during the war) said is the only place he ever felt truly happy and vibrant. But an unexpected pregnancy and a new promotion at work stifle their globe trotting plan, and the two spiral into despair. <br/><br/>Sam Mendes is no stranger when it comes to dealing with the pressures of suburban life, and as with his masterpiece American Beauty the simplicity of the narrative works to great effect. Unfortunately, there are a number of things that keep this film from reaching such heights, yet I assure you it is not the performances of the leads, with Winslet continuing her streak of stellar work and DiCaprio exploding onto the screen with some of his best work ever. Some of the supporting cast is less effective, such as a neighbour's son (Michael Shannon) who is given a reprieve from the mental institution where he stays. Visiting the Wheeler's he openly spouts profound insights into the horrors of conformity, and in turn, cranks up the subtlety of the films message to a sledgehammer across the face. I am not sure of this characters role in the novel, but I assume something was lost in translation. <br/><br/>With the highs and lows of the relationship, Mendes seems to follow suit with the screenplay which is at times astoundingly emotional and disturbing, and at times ghostly and uninvolving. The characters themselves are not particularly likable, but the film is so haunting, especially when completely over, it is hard not to recommend. There is, however, a fine line between a film that is tragic and one that is depressing, and Mendes is very close to crossing the line. But so well shot, so well scripted and with such powerhouse performances, it is still a solid success. Kate Winslet's character once quips, ""You never forget the truth, you just get better at lying."" and with Revolutionary Road it is nothing but brutally honest, and is sure to have those people dreaming of that white picket fence and two car garage seriously re- examining their 'dream'.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their ""empty and hopeless"" life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.<br/><br/>In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged. Their bitterness towards each other seems to disappear as the movie wears on but it does not. They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.<br/><br/>The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that. If the movie had started off on that and then switched over to its false hope and then depressing tone it would have greatly succeeded. Instead the movie becomes overly depressing and cynical not living up to its potential."
"jfmvp","6","37","57","17 January 2009"," Nothing ""Revolutionary"" about this road.
","I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I walked out of the theater following ""Revolutionary Road."" My expectations were lofty because I loved what Sam Mendes did with ""American Beauty"" (10/10) and I was intrigued by ""Jarhead"" (7/10) as well. Of course the preliminary bar was set high for a film featuring both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>And yet, I was underwhelmed by the final product that was ""Revolutionary Road."" No, this wasn't a clichéd case of setting the bar TOO high, because I always keep my pregame expectations in check. They're there, but I don't allow them to cloud my judgment.<br/><br/>Mendes was fine; his mise en scene was a bit mundane and predictable, yet still mostly effective. I would like to have searched for more subtlety when dealing with a director of Mendes' caliber, but it just wasn't there this time. Only shot that jumps out at me is the one of the sprinkler spout metaphorically separating April Wheeler from her family.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I felt that Winslet slightly outperformed Leo. Not that that's especially relevant, because neither performance was award-worthy. I'm shocked that Winslet could take home two Golden Globes in one year, when one of those Globes was awarded for her work in this film. She was good, but not outstanding.<br/><br/>I must tread carefully, though, because I shouldn't blame Winslet or DiCaprio for the shortcomings of the script. On the whole, the dialogue was absolutely painful -- nothing original came for seemingly endless sets of time. I'm aware that the screenplay was adapted from a novel, so perhaps the faults lie in the novel itself. Yet, that's not what I'm hearing from those who read and loved the book.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the general concept of the film, because we all struggle with the internal conflict of our dreams vs. reality, and many of us struggle with the comfortable suburbia vs. monotonous suburbia conflict as well. But ""Revolutionary Road"" was overkill in both arenas. Just too much of the same throughout: calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion. Calm before the storm, match, lit match, explosion.<br/><br/>Much of the repetition may have been intentional, but it simply wasn't effective. How Roger Ebert gave ""Revolutionary Road"" four stars out of four, absolutely boggles my mind.<br/><br/>This film is a 6/10, at best. If you love great cinema, you will be disappointed. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a level below."

","Just saw this movie. All I can say is: Wow! In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera, we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler; a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet, who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling, memorable, emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet, which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be ""in the moment"". Additionally, there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates, whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son, who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel cliché, but with everything else working so well, those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film, Winslet never disappoints, and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film. December 26th. Save the date!!!"
"tieman64","Null","15","21","23 March 2009"," Frank, April, Bill, Alice and Padraig
","Frank and April Wheeler live in Revolutionary Road, a Connecticut suburb. April is a failed artist, and so lives at home taking care of her children. Frank is a businessman, and works at a dead end city job. Both are disillusioned, finding little substance in the daily grind of life.<br/><br/>From here on the film merely rehashes themes fully covered by Antonioni half a century ago. Frank and April see their dissatisfaction, firstly, as sexual unfulfillment, and secondly, as a product of their environment. In an attempt to find happiness, Frank thus has a meaningless affair with a young woman whilst April has sex with a friend and later a baby with her husband. But no, such fleeting moments of biological bliss cannot quench what is really an existential problem. And so when Frank and April decide to move to France, echoing the countless characters in Antonioni's filmography who run away, we know that the couple are merely pursuing an empty fantasy. Man's greatest flaw is his incessant belief that some external change can bring about an internal state of bliss.<br/><br/>The sickness that Frank and April feel was long diagnosed by Nietzsche, when he noted that western civilisation was fast moving in the direction of the Last Man, a listless creature with no great passion or commitment. Unable to dream, tired of life, he takes no risks, seeking only comfort, tolerance and security.<br/><br/>Today, First World countries find it increasingly difficult even to imagine a public or universal cause for which one would be ready to sacrifice one's life. Indeed, the split between First and Third World runs increasingly along the lines of an opposition between leading a long, satisfying life full of material and cultural wealth, and dedicating one's life to some transcendent cause. This is the antagonism between what Nietzsche called passive and active nihilism. We in the West are the Last Men, immersed in stupid daily pleasures whilst Eastern radicals are ready to risk everything, engaged in nihilistic struggle up to the point of self-destruction. What is gradually disappearing in this opposition between those who are ""in"", the Last Men who dwell in gated communities, and those who are ""out"", are the good old middle classes. The ""middle class"" is a luxury capitalism can no longer afford.<br/><br/>One of the successors of Antonioni's ""malaise movies"" is Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"", a film which expands on the post-modern malaise found in all those existential films of the past 2 decades (American Beauty, Fight Club, The Ice Storm, Blue Velvet, Safe, Fear and Loating, Being John Malkovich, Revolutionary Road, In the Bedroom, Little Children etc) by tackling the class and power relationships around its disillusioned couple. Though it also centres on a couple, one a failed artist (Alice) and the other a doctor (Bill), Kubrick's film probes beneath the fantasy image, giving his characters a context which these films typical lack.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Eyes"" looks at the dark side of sexual liberation: the full commodification of sexuality, the sterility of a universe dominated by the superego order to enjoy, the collapse of religion and tradition, the worship of pleasure and youth and the prospect of a future totalised by scientific rationality and joylessness. In this world, love cannot flourish without sex; simultaneously, however, love is impossible because of sex. Sex, which proliferates as the epitome of late capitalism's dominance, has permanently stained human relationships. Sex is thus, as Derrida states, simultaneously the condition of the possibility and the impossibility of love. It is both nothing and everything.<br/><br/>But more importantly, ""Eyes"" is concerned with power, ownership and money and the way they connect with the issues of identity, intimacy and sexuality raised by films like ""Revolutionary Road"". Indeed, Bill's relationship with a mysterious power figure called Ziegler is at as pivotal in Kubrick's film as his relationship with his wife. Ziegler represents patriarchy, the symbolic order, yet he is also something of a Sadean libertine. He is both the Father who says No (guarantor of the symbolic order) and the Father who enjoys (wrecker of the symbolic).<br/><br/>You might thus say that films like ""Revolutionary Road"", which reduce their problems to domestic disputes, serve only to cut psychology loose from everything else. It's a type of hermetic, anti-social, ahistorical version of psychology, assuming that the whole cosmos is important only in relation to the conscious white male subject, which, incidentally, is exactly the sleepwalking egocentric complacency Bill begins ""Eyes Wide Shut"" so conspicuously cocooned in.<br/><br/>Few other films of the past decade (another is Lynch's Mulholland Dr) successfully attempt to open out domestic melodrama into the wider context of power, privilege, and patriarchy, and ""Revolutionary Road"" is no different, never developing beyond the complacent mindset of smugly moralising Hollywood liberalism.<br/><br/>Indeed, while Frank keeps his wife at home and out of a job, Bill wants nothing less than to block out female desire entirely. ""Women aren't like that,"" he says, hence his attraction to prostitutes and masked women. As sex workers they resume the assigned place of women in his libidinal economy: they are passive recipients of male desire, not, as Alice has so terrifyingly revealed herself to be, agents of their own desire. And of course, it is the frightening realisation that he is himself an ""object"" exploited in another's ""desire"", that leads to Bill retreating to fantasy; fantasy being the very banal reality that Frank and April live in.<br/><br/>And so it is the flight into the ordinary, the domestic, the apparently well-constituted identity, that represents escape for The Last Man, but more importantly, it is power and capital, that (he believes) facilitates the actualisation of his dreams.<br/><br/>6/10 – Outdated 60's existentialism. Mendes strikes me as the new Anthony Minghella (both theatre directors). Mendes hides behind his cinematographers, and though his images are always clean and precisely composed, one senses no real visual imagination."
"AngelDel","5","18","26","14 May 2010"," Leo and Kate's world of pure suffering.
","One of the reasons I keep devouring stories in general, and films in particular is that I firmly believe that the authors always have something to say, something worth being heard. A powerful message, if you may, about their view of life. A revelation to present the audience with, so we can leave the room with that ""wow, life is just like that"" feeling.<br/><br/>This message may be positive or negative, but it should always be believable within the reality of the film. I confess I rather prefer a positive one. Or, if negative, at least with a tiny bit of hope hidden somewhere, I rather not leave the room feeling miserable. But I understand some audiences may enjoy this and, in any case, it doesn't matter: it's your message, isn't it?<br/><br/>According to Justin Haythe (writer) and Sam Mendes (director), life is just too painful to be lived, too full of suffering and sorrow as to find the time to enjoy, create or love. We are hit with a most melodramatic picture of everyday events in a script that fails to create actual conflicts and believable drama. In such a farce, the luxury of the intense performances given by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are outrageously wasted.<br/><br/>Fans of the actors will undoubtedly enjoy it, of course, and such an effort certainly deserves recognition. But the story itself contributes nothing, neither to the film history wealth, nor to the poor audience's expectations, that are likely to feel rather down after the show, or even mad at the whole world for no apparent reason, just like the protagonist couple."
"porazzim42","10","21","32","5 February 2009"," Breath-taking and emotionally gripping film
","This was flat-out, out of the best movies I've ever seen. But I have been reading some comments about this movie and I want to clear some things up.<br/><br/>April is NOT selfish! She really loves Frank and would do anything to make him happy. She and him and both miserable in suburbia and she knows that Frank hates the job he works at. So she suggests that they go away. She only says Paris because she knows it's one of the only places he's ever been to that makes him feel ""alive"". She wants him to find a job that makes him happy. In fact, I firmly believe that if he told her he wanted to be a flamingo dancer, she would buy him the suit and let him do the can-can all over the house if it made him happy. <br/><br/>When he accepts her offer to got to Paris, she feels that everything will be perfect. But then she hears him on the beach telling someone else about the job offer. She is crushed, not only because she was the last to know, but because it was like he was stomping on her dream of happiness for the family.<br/><br/>She decides then that she's done...that she just can't handle it anymore. She is tired of living a lie that she is happy when she knows full-well that she isn't. She loves him but frankly, marriage and kids is draining the life out of her. I think when she heard what she heard on the beach and Frank said, ""Why don't you let that be my business,"" or whatever he said, he was basically telling her it was his life and to stay out of it. <br/><br/>That's why the whole fight in the woods scene happened...she had made up her mind. She wanted out. You may not agree with her decision, but I can definitely understand it.<br/><br/>And Frank is not a bad man. Yes, I am aware that he cheated on April. But so did she. He's the type of man that needs to be loved and appreciated. I think he felt he wasn't getting that with April. He loves her and cares about her but she's a lot for him to handle. Especially in the opening scene when they get into a fight about the play. He can see that she is hurting that it bombed and he wants to make her feel better. But he doesn't know what to say and whatever he says, is wrong to April because she's already in a terrible mood. And you know men...they mean well but sometimes they are totally clueless. <br/><br/>And he felt awful about cheating. Did you see the close-up when April and the kids sang happy birthday to him. He felt like the biggest jerk! <br/><br/>The acting was amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio was unbelievable as Frank. In the scene where April tells him she hates him and he cries, it ripped me apart inside. I don't know...something about men crying bothers me. Kate was wonderful as usual. I hope she wins that Oscar. The best thing about this movie was that DiCaprio and Winslet could speak volumes without saying a single word. It was all in their eyes. <br/><br/>Sam Mendes is a genius! Anyway, I think I'm rambling now so I'll leave you to decide for yourself what you think of this movie. I, as you can see, fully enjoyed it."
"gsedlik","10","123","226","6 December 2008"," Another matchup, another great movie
","I just saw an advanced screening of this movie at the DGA theater by Carnegie Hall. Ever since I heard that DiCaprio and Winslet were teaming up again, I had to go see it. After waiting a half an hour outside of the theater in the freezing weather, I was thinking to myself, ""this movie better be good"".<br/><br/>I was not the slightest bit disappointed, and I was extremely happy walking out of that theater. If there is one person I must applaud, it's the casting director, because every person in that movie really got into character, and not one person was out of line. DiCaprio and Winslet's chemistry was once again flawless, I honestly felt like I was watching a 50's suburban couple fighting about normal, every day problems, no scripts. All of the supporting cast was superb, especially Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon, who should both be very tough contenders to beat for the best actress and best supporting actor Oscars, respectively.<br/><br/>Thank you, Sam Mendes, for giving the American people another great drama to watch, that really gave people a dose of what the ""perfect 50's suburban life"", was really like."

","Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring, pointless 2  hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think  many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about  the movie. I thought Winslet was okay, but seemed mannered and  annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like  a 15 year-old boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed,  again, far too young to be playing these characters.  The film lacks story arc, structure, and most importantly...CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school (Mr.  Mendes) is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your  audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This  movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the  fight, however, because we don't know who the hell these people are. As  the movie progresses, we still don't see anything hint about who these  people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee, like we  never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then- nothing  happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and  DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1  reality show shot in 35mm. What's more, we don't feel or care about the  characters. When ever Winslet cried, I cringed. It's being touted as  one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered,  controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff.  And DiCaprio is just flat-out BAD. Perhaps I would think they did  better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise.  On top of this, the film is morbidly predictable, and cliché.  (SPOILER!) When Kate is ""Upset"" one morning, and having a fit in the  kitchen, Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's  pregnant, and having ""Morning Cramps"". And then of course, she says she  wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did.  Mendes, a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO  PERDITION, fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of  this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art  Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at  all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of  boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb  audiences go ""Oooo, now that's a great camera angle."" If this movie  gets nominations from the Oscars (which it will), I will know its  because those voters haven't seen the movie yet, and are voting for it  on name bases alone.  FINAL GRADE: F"
"alhodonai","1","39","69","14 January 2009"," Completely and Utterly Overrated
","I remember when I first saw articles about this movie. It seemed interesting enough; Kate Winslet is a good actor if not someone I particularly enjoy, Leonardo DiCaprio is usually excellent, and I loved American Beauty. The preview made it seem perfectly interesting enough, so I wasn't too disappointed when broken plans for the night lead to a group viewing of Revolutionary Road.<br/><br/>Until I saw it.<br/><br/>My God, it was absolutely terrible. Good acting (GOOD acting, not great) can't save a terrible film, and this was, in fact, a God awful experience. It was slow, it was overdone, there was no point to any of if it, literally no one in the movie was attractive save DiCaprio, etc, etc. The score consisted of three ominous chords repeated over and over again. Nothing. Happened. Quickly. Enough. It went: ""Long pause, stare, change expression slightly, stare."" Much too long a movie for far too little story. The point could've been conveyed less irritatingly if it had been presented quicker. It got to the point where, during what one could perhaps consider the climax of the movie (where DiCaprio slams a chair against the wall, Winslet lets out an ""AHHHHHH!"" at a touch on the shoulder, DiCaprio screams profanity before Winslet decides to walk into the woods, where DiCaprio proceeds to CHASE HER THROUGH THE WOODS), we were all laughing hysterically at it. It wasn't just my group of friends either, others were equally amused.<br/><br/>Point of the matter: Don't see this film. It's terrible. You won't enjoy it unless you like crap. Just... don't. Please.<br/><br/>The only positive thing about this film was the drinking game we would play if we could stomach seeing the damn thing again: take a shot every time they light a cigarette. That way, you won't make it through the first half conscious."
"alrodbel","1","53","97","1 February 2009"," A dreadful parody of ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit""
","The art of storytelling, whether in a play, a novel or a film is to create characters who become real. And once you identify with the characters, their lives become the vehicle for the tone and message of the work. Without such realism, such verisimilitude, there is nothing but parody, and the manipulation of stock figures.<br/><br/>I am a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, so I was looking forward to seeing them in a serious exploration of an era that I lived through as a young man. This work was stunningly without substance. Oh there were emotions, but the characters were not believable, and worse there was no attempt to make it so. The clue is the two children, throw away place holders, so they never even became people. Yet children are a part of any family, and we can't know the family without knowing the joys and trials of these most vulnerable members.<br/><br/>A good test that I use of the quality of any film is whether there are throwaway characters, or if every person seems to have walked in from their own full life. If they only utter a single line, you can still tell. The mental patient visitor was some kind of a joke I imagine. Not like anyone with schizophrenia that I ever met, and I met a few.<br/><br/>And it's not trivial that Frank could never describe exactly what he did for a living. The writers never bothered to create an occupation that would have fit the plot. So he was just a man in a cubicle. A nobody, with no interest in his work, but who was made a key member of a team to develop the most complex product of the era, who had no idea what it did, or how it worked.<br/><br/>Some may consider this transcending details to provide a cultural everyman. But everyman is no man at all.<br/><br/>This wasn't a dysfunctional marriage, as that implies that there is first a marriage. The film ""The Squid and the Whale"" was about a dysfunctional marriage, where the couple were at each others throats Yet both of them and their children were real unique struggling humans trapped in their history and that of their circle. That was a true work of art, while this was an exercise in a drama class.<br/><br/>For those who think this is some accurate depiction of America in the 1950s, believe me it isn't. If you want to see a film about a dysfunctional couple of the era, try ""Come back little Sheba"" or ""Death of a Salesman."" Each of these films created actual characters, and we were drawn into their lives as we learned about the era.<br/><br/>This film was about 2008, and how when two super stars are signed for a film deal there is no need to throw away money on writers who flesh out their characters, and provide plausible circumstances of their lives.<br/><br/>I just learned that the director of this film was the same man who directed, ""American Beauty,"" one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>Go figure!"

Just yelling and screaming as hard as you can, staring out the window, and tearing up. That's it! Aside from that, a few things happen in the movie that have no point whatsoever. What was the point of the office affair? Why spend 20 minutes on that and not have it go anywhere or mean anything? What about their friend's husband who professed love? What did it mean? Why? What was that point? What about the mentally challenged guy? Where did that come from, and how does that have anything to do with anything? I don't doubt that so many people enjoyed this movie.

The script provides no interesting little moments, surprising details, intriguing contradictions or sharply observed behavior.

"isabelle1955","Null","9","13","22 January 2009"," Riveting.
","This is a very good movie.<br/><br/>I think what a number of the negative commentators on IMDb have failed to realize is that this is not a 21st century look back at the 1950s. This book (yes I've read it. It's very good) was actually written  by a man  in 1961. This was very much a contemporary look at the state of 1950s marriage and social mores. Not some feminist diatribe written by a modern author 'looking back in anger' at a bygone age they never knew. And it's damning.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio give utterly committed performances as April and Frank Wheeler. Winslet in particular is excellent (the movie is directed by her husband, Sam Mendes, of American Beauty fame.) I thought to start with that Di Caprio was a bit light weight for the part, but then Frank is a fairly lightweight character, so in retrospect, I think he was perfect for the part. <br/><br/>The story hinges around the idea that the beautiful, bright young Wheelers think they are too good for the 'burbs, and that they are creative, arty types who should be living a far more Bohemian lifestyle. April puts up a good pretence on the home front in Connecticut while Frank plays at being an office drone in New York, but where is the lost promise of their youth and passion? Shouldn't they be doing something more profound with their lives? April hatches a scheme by which they can move to Paris and she will support them while Frank discovers himself. On the surface this seems like a very superficial idea for a major film, but it really all hinges around that central idea, are we all truly 'special', individuals, doomed - trapped - to live the life of battery hens, or should we just accept that most of us are pretty average and get on with it. <br/><br/>The Wheelers of course, inhabit the worst of all possible worlds, they ARE average but think they're not. April failed as an actress, even in community theatre, Frank may have a book in him. But I doubt it. They spend a summer making tentative plans to escape their life, but it all derails completely when April becomes pregnant with her third child after an act of unprotected passion on the kitchen counter (well Frank enjoyed it anyway) with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>And at this point I have to say that I think Winslet should be up for some kind of award for sex in uncomfortable places. In Little Children we saw her stark naked on the washing machine; this time it's the (front) seat of a car and on the cold Formica. I take my hat off to her (but only my hat...) <br/><br/>This is a stark look at unhappy relationships in a time which was more socially constrained. I was born in the 1950s about the time this movie is set (a third child, and admittedly in the UK not the USA, but believe me, bad marriages are universal), and I recall from early childhood the very apparent strains within my parents' marriage; the 1950s were a time of recovery from the war, when everyone was supposed to pretend to be happy even when they weren't and one was expected to put up a good 'front.' Very, very different from today. I'd go so far as to say that I was aware from quite an early age that my parents really couldn't stand the sight of each other anymore. But divorce was totally out of the question, it was social death, and my own birth is testament to how unreliable contraception was back then. Home-made and highly illegal abortions were really not that unusual. <br/><br/>The period details are all perfect, the incessant smoking - again well remembered from my own childhood where in retrospect I see everything wreathed in a cloud of my mother's cigarette smoke - the hats, the shirt-waister frocks. The only thing I don't recall from Britain is the Martinis. Sweet sherry was more the thing.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates as the realtor is great but Michael Shannon as her son, let out of the psychiatric unit for a four hour furlough, is just extraordinary. I see today he's been Oscar nominated and it's well deserved. After many hours of electro shock he lacks the necessary social conventions to put up a good 'front' and he is damning in his analysis of the Wheelers' relationship. It's good stuff, not exactly entertainment, but riveting nonetheless. The musical score is excellent.<br/><br/>One of the year's best, a movie all about the acting. OK, I'm off to work on my book now. I know I've got one in me."

","The subject of suburban misery and malaise, and the myth of the American dream, has been dealt with so frequently in movies, television and literature that you may wonder what more there is to say about the topic. If ""Revolutionary Road"" is any example, the answer is: not much. Indeed, the whole time I was watching this strangely insubstantial film from director Sam Mendes, the only thing I could think of were all the other movies I've seen that have dealt with the same themes and dealt with them better.<br/><br/>Frank and April Wheeler are the miserably married couple at the center of this story. Frank, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes off to work in a featureless anthill of a company, diddling the occasional office girl on the side. April stays home and frets over the acting career that never materialized for her and rebelling against the stifling sameness of suburbia that she feels she's better than. Most of the film consists of monotonous scenes of these two screaming at each other. I guess it's meant to be a sort of modern-day ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", the story of a married couple who could be helping one another but instead decide to tear each other apart, except that the material isn't nearly as interesting as Edward Albee's play, and neither are the characters.<br/><br/>For ""Revolutionary Road"" to work, we have to really understand why April is so unhappy, and that's something the film doesn't tell us. Kate Winselt tries awfully hard, but she can't make much of this rather unlikable character. She didn't have my sympathy because I never understood her problem. I understand suburban unhappiness in general, but I didn't understand it as presented here. DiCaprio has the easier time of it, because Frank it turns out isn't all that unhappy with his life, and pretends to be so largely for April's benefit. The film doesn't establish much about these two before they met or about the early days of their marriage. We're supposed to feel emotions about them in a vacuum without any context. I didn't feel anything.<br/><br/>There's not much relief from DiCaprio and Winslet, as one or the other is in virtually every frame of the movie. There are a couple of recognizable actors in supporting roles, namely Kathy Bates as a real estate agent friend and Michael Shannon as her bonkers son. This character is wedged awkwardly into the narrative as the movie's id, shouting out truths everyone else is trying to avoid having to admit, but Shannon's performance is over the top and I didn't know what I was supposed to make of him.<br/><br/>With wonderful films like ""Far from Heaven,"" ""The Hours,"" ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Little Children"" (which stars Winslet in a stunning turn, no less) and the cable series ""Mad Men"" exploring the same themes as ""Revolutionary Road"" but much more capably, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this gloomy, depressing movie that has nothing to say. It's not an awful movie, but at the same time it has very little to recommend it.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","Sam Mendes who likes to accompany his movies with the simple yet soul-searching tunes of the piano by composer Thomas Newman has come up with another heavy emotional drama that brings out the best in each of the actors involved. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD gives the utopia 1950's suburbs its dark and hopeless mode, a trap of all things ordinary. It may not be a feel-good movie but it has a certain fine art to it.<br/><br/>I don't believe there's such thing as a perfect marriage but I've never seen such a dysfunctional marriage as messed up as portrayed in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD either. The story based on Richard Yates' novel is a bit twisted, in my humble opinion. Having said that, I think Sam Mendes does an magnificent job at directing, and just like American Beauty, he once again successfully uses the small spaces of the kitchen or the living room and turn them into a war zone or a battleground between a couple whose love for each other has grown cold. I'm not sure what attracts him to these kinds of stories and characters but it seems like Sam Mendes has found his specialty. Once again, Sam Mendes' go-to guy for original score and music selection, Thomas Newman doesn't disappoint, he picks the sound of the 50s that fit into every scene, emphasizing piano as the lead instrument, especially the silence between the notes capturing the state of mind of the characters when they re-think what just happened and think about what they're about to do.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio will floor you with his explosive, raw performance as Frank Wheeler, the husband who for some reason is too afraid to leave his comfort zone, he lets people's talk to mess with his judgment, he's too proud to make any drastic change. Kate Winslet who is attractive and marvelous in every movie she's in, radiates greatness as the wife, April Wheeler, who can't stand living an ordinary life anymore but is sick and tired of not being able to get Frank to buy into the idea of moving away for a better life in Paris. Frustrated and angry, she's a tough cookie that finally reaches her limits. Michael Shannon who plays John Givings, a man fresh out of the psychiatric hospital, does an excellent job as the unlikely voice of reason. In a mad, psychotic, unconventional way, he serves a harsh shrink to the couple who may not want to hear what he has to say but somehow they know that his opinions are true, his words are insensitive and hurt like hell but they're true, every single word. Shannon has always been good at playing a character who seems like he's lost a screw in his head, another actor I can think of who's also really good at that kind of role is Gary Oldman and young Jack Nicholson years ago.<br/><br/>This is not just a movie for married couple, this is for those who have the misunderstanding mentality saying that once you've settled down, that is it, You can only build your idea of happiness around that one enclosed environment and anything beyond that would be considered unrealistic and immature. This is a movie for those who are cowards and can't seem to take chances in life other than what's given to them in the most usual setting. This is a movie for those who have forgotten that being in relationship means being able to make big leaps with your loved one based on faith and love. You are not going to get mushy happy feeling after watching this movie, some of you might come out feeling a bit empty and depressed but I hope this story reminds you that your happiness is what you make of it, and not some norms that the world requires you to follow."

","As I suspect many people were, I was drawn to this movie primarily out of curiosity, wanting to see the ""great reunion"" - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunited 11 years after their blockbuster starring turns in ""Titanic"" - with Kathy Bates thrown into the mix as well. There's no doubt that DiCaprio and Winslet have some powerful scenes together, but this movie is about as far removed from ""Titanic"" as any movie could possibly be. In this movie set in the 50's, they play the Wheelers - Frank and April - a young couple trying to make their way in the world, dissatisfied with life, with marriage, with each other and with pretty much everything else. They hatch a scheme for Frank to quit a job he hates to allow the family to move to Paris to let him ""discover"" himself while she supports them. Things seem to improve for a while, but the plan falls apart, and eventually so does everything else in their lives. The Wheelers are not a pleasant couple to watch or listen to, and, by the end of the movie, pretty much everybody else is sending the message ""I don't want to talk about the Wheelers any more."" They do have those handful of powerful, raw with (negative) emotion scenes, but in the absence of that anger (which sometimes seemed to border on hatred) Frank and April are actually pretty dry together, which might make a valid point about the state of their marriage, but which isn't very interesting to watch. In the end, I just found them to be unpleasant characters in an unpleasant movie. This certainly isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. 2/10"

"hall895","4","7","10","4 February 2011"," The hopeless emptiness
","At one point in this film the key characters, in discussing their own lives, mention the ""hopeless emptiness"" of it all. And thus in one line of dialogue is the entire movie summed up rather neatly. Empty for sure and bordering on hopeless Revolutionary Road is pretty much an all-around failure. It's a movie about an unhappy 1950s suburban couple who feel trapped in their own little world. They're disappointed in their lives and harbor fanciful notions of somehow getting away from it all. They're suburban nobodies who want to be somebodies. If the audience could say anything to this screen couple it would probably be ""get over yourselves"".<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is one of those movies which goes out of its way to thoroughly depress you. That's fine but if it insists on depressing you is it too much to ask that it entertains you somewhere along the way too? No such luck with this movie. Entertainment value is practically nil, nothing interesting ever seems to happen. Frank and April Wheeler are unhappy. They fight, fight some more, make up for a bit, fight some more and bemoan how miserable their lives have turned out to be. This goes on and on for two hours as the audience tries to stifle yawns. Frank and April are terrible bores. Their friends and neighbors are bores. One of their friends has a rather insane son who pops in a couple of times to inject some personality and life into the movie. Michael Shannon plays that part and makes a better impression than any of the big stars do. At least his character does some memorable things. But his scenes are all too fleeting. All too soon we're back to Frank and April throwing fits about the terrible state of their lives. Which rings rather hollow when you consider 99 percent of the world's population would kill to have the ""boring"", ""hopeless"", ""empty"" lives the Wheelers so detest. They have it pretty darned good but they've deluded themselves into thinking they deserve better. They don't. Their lives are just fine. Hopeless? Empty? Really, get over yourselves. Please.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both fine performers and they make the best they can out of this mess. The performances aren't the problem, the story is. And the characters. Never for a moment do we sympathize with Frank and April and that right there would be enough to doom the movie to failure. Who can identify with these people? Who would want to? DiCaprio and Winslet took on rather thankless roles in portraying this couple. With all the bickering and fighting there is an opportunity for the stars to go somewhat over the top at times and engage in a bit of scenery-chewing. But aside from that you really wouldn't criticize them. The stars don't let down the movie, the movie lets down its stars. There is so little for them to work with. The story is not engaging at all. It's a dull, boring movie in which very little of consequence ever happens. As such maybe it does capture all that emptiness the characters feel in their lives. But it makes for an empty movie."

","My grandparents still consider the 1950's to be the golden age of pure, unblemished Americanism. A time when teenagers were respectful, parents were bright, smiling examples of friendly authority, sex was post-marital and marriage was a time of apple pies and cheerful strolls down the charming neighborhood lane. I don't know at the moment if my grandparents have seen Revolutionary Road, but rarely do movies come along when the opinions of our elders would almost surely prove to be enormously valuable and insightful.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the novel by Richard Yates, which attacked the very normality and pleasant conformity of the 1950's that forms the basis of so much of the modern nostalgia about it today. There has been a lot of expectation about the movie that would bring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together again for the first time in more than a decade, but the romance that they share in Revolutionary Road could not possibly be more different from the one they developed on the Titanic.<br/><br/>They are Frank and April Wheeler, an outwardly charming husband and wife who live in a beautiful dream house on Revolutionary Road. They radiate an atmosphere of perfection and happiness and are loved by the neighbors. We meet them just after they've made what they promised each other was only a temporary move from Manhattan to the sprawling suburbs. The movie begins with April in an unsuccessful play, and we learn very quickly about their relationship in the car on the way home as Frank thoughtfully assures her that it's okay that she didn't become an actress, it's not her fault that the play was lousy, and then in the fight that ensues, Frank tells her that she acts ""sick"" when she gets mad like this.<br/><br/>It seems that the most important thing that Frank and April embody about the traditional 1950s couple was the routine sacrificing of dreams upon the altar of conformity and fulfilling expectations. April dreams of a romantic life in Paris, and Frank has artistic ambitions as well. But he is stuck in a job that he hates despite a good salary, they have two kids already and a third accidentally on the way, and adultery's going on left and right.<br/><br/>April suggests that they drop everything and move to Paris where, with money that she could make working combined with whatever they could get for the house, they could live comfortably until he could get on his feet artistically and they could both live the lives they have always dreamed of. They are doing what is expected of them already, but they're both deeply unhappy and they see no improvement ahead. <br/><br/>It is one of the movie's more successful tragic moments in the way that everyone Frank and April know react to the news that they are moving. Responses range from friendly disbelief to outward remarks of irresponsibility and suggestions that such a move would be ""irresponsible."" It's hard to watch Frank and April let go of their dreams when it was right in their grasp.<br/><br/>It's not unrealistic, ladies and gentlemen. It's uncommon and unexpected, but unrealistic? Irresponsible? I should hope not! It's commonly believed to be irresponsible and unrealistic, but it's not, trust me. I'm doing it myself. I left a job in Los Angeles two years ago that paid well but that I didn't like, and I've been living in China (decidedly less romantic than Paris, I admit) ever since. I now have a job that pays less than I made in LA, but my lifestyle is much more comfortable and I work 10 hours a week, which leaves me time to pursue my artistic endeavors. See how that works?<br/><br/>Granted, I don't have any kids, but I also didn't have a house to sell to put together some money to support myself while I found work. ""I just think people are better off doing some kind of work that they actually like,"" Frank complains. I tend to agree.<br/><br/>But ultimately life gets in the way, as they say. A gossipy real estate agent, played perfectly by Kathy Bates, makes friends with April and nervously asks if she might bring over her son John, who has been in a mental institution and who she thinks might benefit from meeting a happy couple like April and Frank. April agrees, but when John comes over, it seems that his only mental problem is an inability to adhere to accepted models of conformity, which manifests itself mostly in the form of cutting through other peoples' facades like warm butter and laying bare the sad, bitter reality of their lives. When he does this with April and Frank, the results are not pretty, but they are some of the best movie moments of 2008.<br/><br/>Kate and Leo both approach perfection in their performances. Both of them have appeared in other brilliant films in 2008 (Kate in The Reader and Leo in Body of Lies), but in Revolutionary Road their performances reach such a level of pitch and depth that, when combined, they reverberate against each other and turn into something entirely different. If there were an Oscar for the best combination of two performances, there would be no need for any other nominees.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is not the most uplifting film of the year (although it's also not nearly as depressing as, say, Rachel Getting Married), but it is definitely among the most important. It's not so much that the movie attacks conformity, but that it attacks that little voice inside us that prevents us from doing what we really want in life because it goes against the accepted norm. Watching the movie kind of takes a bite out of you, but it takes a bite of that part of you that gets in the way of your dreams."

","I could watch the wonderful Kate Winslett read a cook book aloud and not be bored, but what's the purpose of this film? I would imagine 7 out of 10 Americans live in one way or another on their own version of Revolutionary Road. When there's no particular struggle to obtain food or shelter one is left pondering the meaning of life and why one is so dissatisfied with one's lot. It's the middle class curse.<br/><br/>There is nothing special about this film or, I expect, the book on which it is based. For many, the American Dream is just a long, dull, pointless exercise on a treadmill while waiting for the inevitable. What's the point of seeing it played out in a film?

They had a wonderful house, wonderful family, and sure they may have been a bit hindered by the children. But my God. I really wish they would have been poor, uneducated, and maybe even some type of refugees. Then I could have perhaps seen a bit of reason to feel sorry. Towards the middle I was hoping they would shoot each other. Terrible movie. I hope the book was better. Don't get me wrong. I don't need the happy ending to a movie.

","This movie is terrible. It tries to make grand statements about the hopelessness of cookie- cutter suburbia and attempts to provide insightful character studies, but it fails miserably on both counts. The dialogue is particularly bad; as brilliant as Kate and Leo can be, they sound like cut-rate community theatre actors. The flashbacks and flashforwards are poorly handled and not only add nothing to the story but also detract from it. The pacing is way off, the score is a nuisance, and the subplot (such as it is) of the secretarial other woman almost seems poorly edited, as if the initial scenes were forgotten until the creators needed another bump in an overly flat narrative road. The only meritorious part of this movie is the character of John, the institutionalized neighbor son. His role is creepy and thankfully less monotone than the rest, but even this is not nearly reason enough to put up with the remaining mediocrity. Don't forfeit two hours of your life for this film."

Couldn't have cared less about all of the characters because Sam Mendes couldn't be bothered to explain them to us or develop them in any way. Couldn't take them seriously as a couple because they were so mismatched - Leo DiCaprio will always be a pudgy teenager to me, so couldn't take him seriously as an early middle-life crisis type. Kate Winslett? Well normally she at least looks good, but she was haggard in this. Just what was all the hype about? I really think that Golden Globes must be ten a penny if she actually won one for this. No wonder she was speechless - she probably couldn't believe that this performance had won it for her. Will be very careful in future about any more Sam Mendes films I see."

The movie requires the audience to suspend time and actually believe April was so close-minded she could not get a driver's license or take the railroad into The City - The Big Apple ! Man. However, we are expected to believe she was itching to blaze trails and live the good life in beautiful Paris! Hey, there is a really apt expression that fits her situation : ""Where ever you go there you are."" She was infantile, narcissistic, and worse a coward. I would have had more respect for her had she simply gotten on the plane and sent him a letter with a picture of her standing in the Louvre Museum or sitting at an open air café drinking a glass of milk! It occurred to me that in ""Titanic"" - DiCaprio died and here Winslet does. Perhaps in their next movie together they can die together or couple in a modern version of ""Dead Again"" made by Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh - this might work out the bad karma at long last - breaking the energy of star-crossed lovers who happen to be Libra (Winslet) and Scorpio (DiCaprio).

"Irie212","2","15","28","6 June 2009"," How honest can this movie be when the children are mere props?
","Hey, Hollywood, here's a question: If life is dull in the suburbs, why doesn't it occur to you that movies set in the suburbs will be dull, too? Because they are. Revolutionary Road is yet another mildly decadent, inert melodrama exploring what writers seem to regard as soul-dead all-white suburbia (American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Little Children, Pleasantville, etc. etc.). In my experience, suburban people are not stereotypically dull.<br/><br/>But dullness isn't this flick's only, or primary, problem. Dishonesty is. In fact, it's hard to say what the most dishonest part is. It might be plot devices like the two Wheeler offspring, who are treated as nothing more than props, yet we're supposed to believe that the third child will matter? Or the other plot device, the mentally ill mathematician, who seems to exist purely to say inflammatory things (he gets to, he's crazy) that let director Sam Mendes give Winslet and DiCaprio chances for histrionics. <br/><br/>But I think the most dishonest thing is Winslet's character, April. A moody hypocrite with bleach-blonde hair and coal-black eyebrows, she baits her husband into drastically changing their lives by following an absurd pipe dream (she doesn't even research these ""secretarial jobs in Paris"" that she talks about), saying that moving to Europe is for his sake when obviously it's just as much, if not more, for her own.<br/><br/>Clearly, we're supposed to have sympathy for April. That's what's dishonest, because nothing about her actions merits sympathy. Both April and Frank are unhappy in the 'burbs (what movie protagonist isn't?), but when Frank chooses to stay and face their responsibilities-- as well as tacitly admit that they aren't artists or writers or actors who have a Bohemian future in Paris-- April becomes a shrew. Along the way, she also contemplates a self-administered abortion (never mind the risks, or Frank's opinion, he's only her husband and the father). April is as selfish, callow and emotionally constipated as it is possible to be. For instance, whenever Frank wants to talk about little matters, like, oh, say, the fact their dinner party just broke up into a near fist-fight, or that she's taken to sleeping on the couch(!!), she retorts, ""Why do you want to discuss EVERYTHING all the time?"" Coward that she is, she wants to run away from her problems, to Paris; short of that, she walks away from her husband when he wants to work things out. I'm all in favor of walking away-- but from this movie, not from life's problems."

","It's been a decade since Sam Mendes' debut picture American Beauty. That's a really long time for the movie-going public. People forget a film's uniqueness and directors repackage old material into a new movie, to the dismay of us film reviewers. Benjamin Button did that to Forest Gump, and Mendes has done it with his newest work. I'm not bold enough to make the claim that he simply re-released American Beauty as Revolutionary Road but the two are very similar. That's OK since American Beauty won several awards in various countries. It's still a worth a ticket price, but people will forget about this film in five years as American Beauty resurfaces in their minds.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from Richard Yates' extremely well-received novel, first published in 1961. It is an examination of American suburbia that blossomed in the '50s and the problems therein. Now, I think that such an observation would be especially meaningful when made in its own time but not as much now. Many other people, including Mendes himself, have already produced Revolutionary Road in both film and other media. This forces the movie to rely on something additional besides its tired premise. Revolutionary Road offers viewers a disturbingly lifelike representation of a failing marriage. Winslet and DiCaprio are so good that I found myself turning away frequently. After their characters marry and become parents, both actors are constantly uneasy. Neither portrayal is subdued. Even when they are not verbally abusing each other, both are under veils of artificial emotion. There are no feel-good elements to the picture. Revolutionary Road is as effective as any gruesome exploitative film in never allowing its audience a moment's respite. It's different from American Beauty in that distinct way. The film is pessimistic while its parent is inspiring.<br/><br/>Unlike American Beauty, the wife character is the one who envisions herself in a situation more grandiose. Winslet plays April, a former stage actress, who meets Frank Wheeler at a party and eventually marries him. They settle at ""Revolutionary Road"" suburb and raise a family. April suggests that Frank quit his office job and pursue his dream of moving to France. She even agrees to work while he determines his real interest. Things seem to be working until Frank receives a promotion which he accepts. Verbal violence ensues and April reveals that she is pregnant with the family's third child. Frank demands that she not abort the child, but secretly wishes that she would. She does it herself and dies of blood loss.<br/><br/>Mendes still has not analyzed the suburban problem in a sophisticated way. His newest film is stuffed with lazy and obvious symbolism that has no conclusion. April is unhappy, Frank is too comfortable to care if he's happy, and the audience wonders what these people would do if they actually went to France. It sounds like they would live the same boring life they had in America but in a foreign country. OK, I'll let Mendes slide on that one. Not on this one. April's death is tragic because it leaves the film unfinished. Death is the solution to obstacles we cannot overcome. We are condemned to live in a world over which we have no control and are resigned to suffer eternally. Revolutionary Road understands that statement but doesn't recognize human willpower. April says she doesn't love Frank, so why doesn't she just leave? There is no indication that she loves her children either so she has no excuse.<br/><br/>I'm going to do something unusual with this review. I'll give it three stars but not a recommendation. It's cool seeing Winslet and DiCaprio reunited in the antithesis of Titanic. Let's hope Mendes doesn't develop his sensei's (Tim Burton) knack for recycling characters and themes in his next project."

","Revolutionary Road is a tragic realistic love story powered by the believable performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who reunite 12 years later after starring in 1997's Titanic together. They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch."
"Der_Schnibbler","1","26","55","3 August 2009"," More Hollywood liberal claptrap about women ""oppressed"" by family
","The movie, in a few words, goes like this: young couple meet, get married, move to a nice house in suburbia. Uh-oh, warning bells are going off already, for we all already know suburbia is the place where civilized people live, and civilized people don't like degenerate American mainstream society, so of course they are evil, mean, boring, ""racist,"" conservative, Republican! Dear God! But to continue... they move out, and things start, well...""falling apart."" Why? Well, you KNOW why. At least we're supposed to cynically anticipate the why. You probably haven't seen this movie though, so I'll tell you.<br/><br/>Life is ""empty"" and ""desperate."" So, the wife thinks up a ridiculously airheaded plan to skip off to another country. Soon, reality hits, the husband gets promoted, and there's the dilemma: throw it all away, or stay put and make the best of it.<br/><br/>For most sane people, the movie would've ended by there. But the liberal, leftist vermin who write stuff like this hate families, hate women who enjoy their natural role as mothers, hate everything that reminds of a normal, healthy, family-oriented society where men are men and women don't scream like spoiled children the second someone compliments their dress--that's if they ever wear dresses.<br/><br/>Anyway, the move idea flops and then wifey goes from bad to worse. They don't quite turn into the Manson family, but things get rather insane. And why? All because wifey can't play globetrotter.<br/><br/>Of course, this is not the way one is ""supposed"" to see the movie. Liberal lemmings and uneducated imbeciles will surely see the film's biting criticism of a 1950s America. This is yet another attempt by the ""chosen"" to subvert the true and natural values of the Europeans who built this country. Apparently, the mere memory of a better time, before the ""improvements"" of the deceptively titled ""civil rights"" era, affirmative action, when real women were mothers and real men were bread winners, is too much for these parasites to handle. And so the Hollywood propaganda machine keeps spewing its filthy poison into the minds of anyone dumb enough or anyone brainwashed enough to feel ""guilty"" who will listen.<br/><br/>The only positive I could give this film is that it was at least subtle. I mean, at least we didn't see the couple going to a restaurant where a bunch of ""poor, disadvantaged black folks"" were cruelly refused entry by a tight-lipped host because they were not worthy due to the ""color of their skin"" (as if race was skin deep, but that's another subject).<br/><br/>Skip this piece of fetid spew from the minds and hearts of hateful parasites bent on the complete destruction of all that once made white, European-descended society great and go watch something else instead, like ""Blue Lagoon,"" another movie about a couple who discover the natural and fulfilling way in life is the family unit, which this alien, cancerous element in our world is hellbent on tearing apart."

","The novel that this was based on was meant to be a learning lesson. It was intended to show how shallow and unfulfilled lives are when self is all we care about. Instead Hollywood did what Hollywood does best, attempted to make heroes out of selfish arrogant characters who care only for themselves. This movie was just plain awful. The only attracting feature this movie has is an on screen reunion of Kate & Leonardo. Which in could have been a good thing, but given the nature of this film they should have left off saying goodbye while floating on a door in the icy ocean after the Titanic sunk. Michael Shannon is a good actor who needs to find himself some good roles to really put his name on screen. He shouldn't be too upset about losing his academy award to Heath Ledge since this film was so bad to begin with."

"TheLittleSongbird","9","2","2","25 January 2017"," Not revolutionary, but very powerful and moving
","That 'Revolutionary Road' was directed by Sam Mendes (who directed the brilliant 'American Beauty' nine years earlier) and that it reunited two immensely talented actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet after 1997's 'Titanic' were reasons enough to see it.<br/><br/>'Revolutionary Road' may not be ""revolutionary"" and it is not perhaps a film that will be re-watched over and over by me. This said, there is so much to appreciate, there is no denying that it's incredibly well made and superbly acted. And to me and many others (though it is an understandably polarising film, the dark and unpleasant subject matter is not for everybody) it is a powerful and moving film, and one of the most realistic and truthful depictions of a struggling marriage on film.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Revolutionary Road' is wonderfully shot, bleak but also sumptuous, while the scenery and 50s production values are evocatively and handsomely rendered. Thomas Newman's music score is hauntingly hypnotic, achingly melancholic and at times ominous.<br/><br/>While at times stagy, the dialogue is insightful, making one really think about what it's saying (it has much to say and knows how to say it without preaching) and for many will wrench the gut and induce floods of tears. There is a little levity provided by Kathy Bates, that could have been ill-fitting but is pitched well. The story is deliberate, but the atmosphere is brilliantly evoked and there are many parts that have huge power and are emotionally devastating, especially in the latter parts.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes keeps things at an assured pace, keeps the atmosphere alive and doesn't undermine the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet in any way. DiCaprio and Winslet embody their roles, which are intentionally not the most likable, are very complex and very much compellingly real, and their chemistry is both tense and affecting. Winslet has the more complex one of the two and her performance is a heart-wrenching emotional roller-coaster, while DiCaprio gives an explosive turn especially in the fever pitch latter parts.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon proves himself to be a scene stealer as the brutally honest crazy nut, and Kathy Bates brings well-timed levity.<br/><br/>Overall, a powerful and moving film that is highly appreciated in many ways. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"jb_campo","2","2","2","23 January 2016"," Terrible - Avoid this bomb!
","Revolutionary Road stinks. The story was stupid. The acting was so-so. The dialog was asinine. The music was terrible too -this little jingle going on in the background to what, ramp up the drama? Please.<br/><br/>My wife loves Leonardo and these types of movies usually, but even she was begging me to Fast Forward thru this mess.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to tell you in detail how terrible this movie is. It seems that the Producers wanted to capitalize on a Titanic reunion of Dicaprio and Winslet, mixing in the odd storyline of this bomb, thinking that Sam Mendes could work his American Beauty masterpiece.<br/><br/>Do Not Be Deceived. This movie just sucked. This couple is unhappy. Oh boo hoo, he has to commute to work each day. He didn't want to do what his father did, and that is where he is. Kate Winslet does nothing, and complains about it, so hey, let's move somewhere different. Then the idiotic sex scenes, awkward pauses, strange blow ups by various people, odd neighbors, all done with the 1950s look, and hey, you have a winner - give me a break. How Winslet was able to keep herself from laughing at her stupid lines is a miracle. Dicaprio had to really blow up a few times, but it just seemed forced, and like I said, stupid.<br/><br/>I would give this a 0 rating except for the fact that the costumes/background effectively evoked the era, and that they convinced two fine actors to waste their time with this mess.<br/><br/>Do not go down Revolutionary Road. It is a disaster."
"bkoganbing","7","2","2","2 September 2011"," Wheeler Family Values
","The Titanic lovers, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, get reunited for Revolutionary Road a tale of sterile life in the suburbs during the Eisenhower years. Not that this is anything new, the subject was done as comedy and as drama in such diverse films way back then as Rally Round The Flag Boys and Strangers When We Meet.<br/><br/>It's a nice story, but not one I could terribly worked up about. So Leonardo is working for some firm as a sales rep and it's a job he hates. Good for him, 90% of the American work force are in jobs that are just paychecks to support themselves and their families. Which Leo and Kate increased by two during the course of the film.<br/><br/>Seeing themselves in a rut, Kate lets fly the brilliant suggestion that he just quit and move to Paris. Not only that he should just 'find himself' and she'll work and support and raise the kids and him. Leo likes the idea, but then gets cold feet and it goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>Leo and Kate are fine, but the film just is not up to the standards set by Titanic. I sure cared a lot more about Jack and Rose than I did about either of the Wheelers. Nevertheless Revolutionary Road which is the name of the street the Wheelers live on in the film, got three Oscar nominations including one for Michael Shannon as the bipolar son of the Wheeler's neighbor Kathy Bates who sold them the house. Nowadays Shannon would be on his meds and leading a more productive life than he is here. Shannon lost for Best Supporting Actor to Heath Ledger for the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is entertaining, but hardly groundbreaking."
"saarvardi","3","10","18","23 January 2009"," Sitting through torture would be less depressing than this film
","So you think life's tough? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet! If you really want to suffer, try living in 1950's suburban hell. In that period, women's freedom and choice of career was virtually non-existent, and whoever tried to shake this equation, often found themselves on the wrong side of society's ability to tolerant social turbulence.<br/><br/>In American Beauty director Sam Mendes's adaptation of the bestseller Revolutionary Road, Frank and April Wheeler (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together on screen for the first time since Titanic!), a young, suburban couple going through the motions of life. April, who doesn't want to play the role of the lonely housewife, makes life miserable for husband Frank, who can't seem to make her happy. When April comes up with a daring idea to relocate to Paris, France, the consequences of the decision manage to make the couple's life even glummer.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, I found Revolutionary Road to be a depressing experience, lacking the optimism or cynicism director Sam Mendes demonstrated in films like American Beauty or Jarhead. Instead, everything that happened to the characters of the film was so tragic and sad, that I was counting the minutes for the thing to be over. The acting was good, but nothing we haven't seen before in the department of suburban melodramas - even those starring the same actors (Winslet was much better in Little Children, which was more or less similar to RR, except that it took place in modern day and was much more tongue-in-cheek fun). DiCaprio was OK, but good thing he earned his Oscar recognition for bigger, better roles like The Aviator and Blood Diamond and not this train-wreck of a film.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know about you guys, but these sort of blunt, straight-out realistic dramas don't help me feel better about myself or get a better perspective of life (like I believe most films should do). Instead, this film just left me shattered, annoyed and disturbed - and truly unsatisfied.<br/><br/>I gave it 5 point out of 10 (and only because of the decent acting)."

Her strength is in characters whose presentation she can comment on in the performance.

","Having read and loved the novel, I can honestly say this is one of the best book to screen adaptations I've seen. It's extremely faithful to Richard Yates' 1961 brooding tale but also highly imaginative in its cinematic reconfiguration. In a way, the film had a stronger impact on me than the book. Going through that whole story in two hours is a devastating experience.<br/><br/>Everyone who worked on this did such a solid job. The entire cast was magnificent. I won't elaborate on any individual performance, because each actor played it to perfection. Director Sam Mendes finally lives up to the standard he set with his first picture, American BEAUTY. Exploring the dark side of American suburbia definitely works for him. Thomas Newman's score is haunting and, although less complex, reminiscent of American BEAUTY's heavily atmospheric soundtrack.<br/><br/>The entire movie is gorgeous to watch. It's full of powerful images that will burn into your memory. I loved the slight surreality to everything. The styles, colors, and strict conformity of 1950s Connecticut has an other-worldly quality. I think it was the right choice to, ever so slightly, heighten and exaggerate the emotions and relations of the characters. It added much needed humor at times and kept things from getting overly raw and dirty. Despite all the stylistic choices, I still felt it was very grounded in reality, and I found it to be almost embarrassingly relatable at times.<br/><br/>If anything negative can be said, I could see this getting criticized for being too perfect, too calculated, too Oscar oriented. It may be all those things, but it's also full of life and truth. The novel is a literary classic. The rights for the film were purchased not long after its original publication, but at that time, no one knew how to make it. Everything aligned just right for this movie to happen. I couldn't imagine this film existing any differently. It may take place in a bygone era, but it has everything needed to be a timeless classic, and as long as people keep getting married, it will always be relevant."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Evidently I am one of the few who didn't like the movie, and just to be clear, that doesn't bother me one iota. This is a depressing, non-message movie stuck in an unrealistic setting with characters who we don't care the least bit about. The fact that the American Beauty and Road to Perdition director assembled such a strong cast doesn't override the fact that it is just not a good film.<br/><br/>Basically we get a chance meeting at a party between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Love at first sight seems to happen because he is a longshoreman and she is an actress-wannabe who has never been anywhere or done anything. When she says he is the most interesting man she has ever met, we can only assume that he must also be the first. Besides that ... what does he see in her? <br/><br/>Flashforward a few years to a miserable life in early 60's suburbia and a couple of kids and we are then subjected to 90 minutes of screaming and bickering and crying and depression and anger. You know there is an entire segment of the law (and a Tammy Wynette song) just for these situations ... it is called D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Just do it folks. The whole thing is just ridiculous. And where are the KIDS?? They are only in a couple of scenes. Not sure how that happens. I know my kids were around the house most of their childhood.<br/><br/>The most interesting character in the movie is the white-jacket worthy son of Kathy Bates played by Michael Shannon (the mysterious marine seen in World Trade Center). His twisted and vile psychoanalysis of Leo and Kate is spot on, though ridiculous in itself.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes (Kate's real life husband) is blessed to have Winslet and DiCaprio cast or this film would die a quick death at the box office and most assuredly would not end up on any best of lists for this year. Based on Richard Yates' novel, the only explanation I have for the terrific reviews is that they are a product of the reputation of the novel and the high profile parties involved, and not for the finished project of this film. For a significantly better film with similar material, see Todd Haynes' ""Far From Heaven""."

People don't just work for years to achieve the American dream only to throw it away suddenly on some sill whim. The characters don't seem real to life, rather they exist to give expression to the author's point of view which is pretty stupid as far as I am concerned. If the writer(s) wanted to examine suburban living and come down on it as empty and shallow, they did a pretty crummy job. Two hours of fighting and screaming hardly made me think achieving the American dream is not worth it. Rather it bored me silly and I couldn't wait for the credits to start rolling.

Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, and every single actor called upon does a superb job in this movie no matter how tiny the part. But it is DiCaprio who truly shines and completely engulfs the screen with his hauntingly powerful performance. He is so brilliantly nuanced, whether it be in the small, beautifully poetic and tender moments of his performance, or the big, showy scenes for anger and desperation.

Strange to know that it is only her second movie together. For me the acting is very important in a drama. It was good to see that in the supporting cast Michael Shannon has a remarkable performance as crazy neighbor and the always good Kathy Bates as his mother. Of course all the other actors are also showing solid performances.<br/><br/>This Drama from Director Sam Mendes shows the life of a young couple in the 50's of the last century. Sam Mendes directed also the famous ""American Beauty"" and again he let us see what happens behind the doors of the houses of American families. It's a satirical look which includes tragedy and love. Revolutionary Road is not a Comedy in the classical meaning so keep this in mind when you watching it else you could get an unpleasant kick.<br/><br/>What was keeping my attention? Firstly as mentioned the acting and then of course the realistic story about a couple in the 1950's. When I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio on screen I was thinking he is dressed in a Frank Sinatra Style. So please also watch at the settings and costumes. All were selected carefully.

Mendes is cruelly X-raying the feelings and the conflicts of the generation that exited victorious from the war, enjoyed the post-war prosperity and fathered the baby bloom, a generation that made it materially but seemed to fail emotionally and culturally, falling into conventionalism and emptiness which only the late 60s flower generation will wipe away.<br/><br/>As principal actors Mendes brings back together Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the royal couple made famous by Titanic. This film seems to a certain extent a negation of the big love story in Cameron's blockbuster, and Leo and Kate's act make their relation in the film dramatic, credible and even memorable in its best moments. Actually the whole cast is wonderfully chosen and another performance to remember belongs to Michael Shannon who is playing the hospitalized son of the neighbors who under the cover of his mental problems plays the role of the Shakespearean fool, telling the truth in face of his guests.<br/><br/>Great acting and some memorable cinema scenes like the starting train ride and parade of hats from the suburbs to the city at the beginning cannot yet make from an interesting film a great one. The principal problem of 'Revolutionary Road' seemed to me to be the theatrical setting of many of the dialogs in the film. The evolution of the relationship between the two heroes, the emptiness of their lives, and the failure to fill them with content are being told in scenes that may looks better on a Broadway stage but less on a cinema screen. It's really a shame, as Mendes seems to be a creator really capable of strong visual impact. However, the two talents of Sam Mendes visual expressed and directing his actors cannot get together to make of 'Revolutionary Road' the great film it could be."

","Boy, it was a tremendous film. It was very gritty, too much at times, but it certainly tackled many aspects that many films have only mentioned. The screenplay and direction were fabulous. Kate Winslet really gave her best performance here. She gives a stunningly powerful performance. She deserves to win the Oscar. Dicaprio was just as powerful. The supporting cast was great, and Michael Shannon was just amazing. Besides Ledger, he gives the best male supporting performance of the year. An important film.

","Sorry, I don't get it. This is not a great movie. It is not even a good movie. Sure it's well acted; both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio give well crafted performances. And it's shot well; there are some great visual moments in the movie. But as a piece of narrative it's dull and pointless. Who cares? The Wheelers are merely an ordinary, if attractive, dysfunctional couple. She's selfish and unfulfilled, he's less selfish and unfulfilled. They love. They fight. So what! But then, an interesting character, John Givings, the supposedly retarded son of the neighbours appears - ah! this could lead us somewhere - but sadly not. And, the music by Thomas Newman (whose work I normally admire) was so simple and repetitive as to become irritating."
"robert-temple-1","4","4","6","11 May 2010"," Incredibly depressing film about disillusionment and betrayal
","Sam Mendes, who in 2002 made the rather depressing and darkly-lit ROAD TO PERDITION, has now made a really deeply depressing film about people screaming and shouting at each other. Leonardo DiCaprio is so good at all of this vicious behaviour that one hopes it really is acting. The only characters in the entire film who are in any way admirable are the long-suffering wife of DiCaprio, played nobly by Kate Winslet (who is not afraid to do without makeup and look increasingly haggard), and a character who is temporarily on release from an insane asylum (excellently portrayed by Michael Shannon), so that it is no accident of the script that the only truths spoken in this film are those declaimed by a madman. This film is set in the leafy Connecticut suburbs near Long Island Sound (a beach of which we actually see in one scene), where DiCaprio and Winslet are 'the Wheelers', an attractive young couple whom everyone admires. Winslet is admirable, but her oafish and totally vacuous husband is not. For years she does not see this, which makes her very dim indeed! Perhaps I should point out that the title of this film does not refer in any way to any revolution, and this is not a film about Lenin or Castro. Revolutionary Road is merely the ironical name of the deeply boring and non-revolutionary suburban street in which the Wheelers live. Kathy Bates is magnificent in her supporting role as a neighbour, but then when was Kathy Bates not magnificent? There is one sensationally brilliant scene in the film where the disillusioned Winslet sits quietly smoking her cigarette while chaos reigns around her, with other people screaming and shouting like the maniacs they all are, a true eye-of-the-storm moment, carried out impeccably by the imperturbable Winslet and, let's face it, brilliantly directed by Mendes. I hate to say that because I don't like the film, but one must be fair. As so often in reviews of violent films, when I ask 'why did they make this?', I have to pose the question as to why Mendes wasted his time on this subject. OK, so he gets credit for no one getting murdered, and he did not have to wipe blood and gore off his lens. Also, there are no exploding cars, no chases, and the only violence is psychological, though that is as intense as it gets. But there are pointless and seedy sex scenes. The Germans have two words which mean 'to eat'. They are 'essen', which applies to humans, and 'fressen', which describes the eating habits of animals. I would describe the copulating habits of animals as imitated by humans by a new word, also adding an 'r', and call it 'serx'. In this film the supposedly devoted wife Winslet has 'serx' in the car with a neighbour. This scene is either inserted to show her state of despair or just because Mendes likes serx scenes. (There is an earlier serx scene between Winslet and her oaf husband which takes place against a wall of the kitchen, where fortunately no pots or pans were hanging, but although nobody banged against any of those, another type of banging did occur.) I think we might also invent a new verb for having sex, by inserting an 'r' into the one which everyone shouts (as in this film) but which, due to the hypocrisy of human society, no one is permitted to write down, and certainly not in a review like this, which might be read by an underage person of, say, 45, and cause offence. So there is serx and there is oafishness and there is shouting and screaming, and that's about it, really. Certainly something to cheer us all up! Thanks, Sam! What's next? DIARY OF A MADMAN?"

","Wow. What a depressing, worthless film. Marc and I went to see this last night - I only hope that he can forgive me for suggesting it. What people say is partly true: Kate Winslet's performance allows her to show her range as the trapped, middle class suburban housewife - she is convincing and at times bold. Michael Shannon is Oscar nominated for his role as a mentally ill neighbour who is the only one willing to speak what everybody else is thinking - his key scene is hilarious and horrific.<br/><br/>The cinematography and period detail are beautiful and James Newton's score is affecting - particularly in a scene where Winslet grasps the last moments of light against the back garden tree, while, after their biggest bust up yet, Leo DiCaprio wanders around in the darkness of the house on Revolutionary Road - the house that typified everything 'perfect' about their life.<br/><br/>As just about every critic ever has noted, the concept is not original; David Lynch blew it apart in 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks' and surely after 3 seasons of Desperate Housewives, it's no longer an alien concept. As Kermode notes Todd Haynes' 'Far From Heaven' takes this initial premise in a far more interesting and brave direction, a beautiful film that I would watch 20 times before I ever set eyes on Revolutionary Road again. Bearing in mind that RR comes from Sam Mendes, who delved with insight and originally into this same white-picket lie with American Beauty ten years ago, it's even more disappointing to watch this film that adds nothing to our understanding.<br/><br/>I haven't even got to what's bad about it yet; the sheer hopelessness of the script, the clichéd dialogue, its torturous length, the bizarre sidelining of the kids or the moral corruption unbalanced without any sense of regret, repentance or redemption. Most of all, we both came out of the cinema with the same key observation: none of the characters were likable. Nothing about them was endearing, upright, selfless, loving, hopeful or genuine. Summed up, RR was over 2 hours of hateful, self-deceived people wrapped up in their purposeless, spiralling lives. Maybe that was the point?<br/><br/>On a personal note, it confirmed to me that I really do dislike DiCaprio as an actor - only his performance in The Departed approached bearable. The only thing revolutionary about this film is what a tragic waste of time and talent it is, bringing absolutely nothing of worth into the world. I'd rather lose a limb than watch this again. Not only the most bitter, unfathomable film I've seen in the past 12 months but probably ever. Buy the DVD for someone you really hate."

","I would like to comment about this movie, 'Revolutionary Road' (2008. I've read the previous comments, and I respect everyone's comments, everyone has their own opinion. In fact, I really wish I could agree with them as Kate Winslet & Leo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors and I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I finally rented it tonight, and I was so terribly disappointed with this movie that I can't sleep! I've been through a rough marriage dissolution and it was nothing like this. I thought the movie was too long, extremely boring, not to mention dark and disturbing. The parts with Kathy Bates' real estate character's son, the mentally disturbed man, were, in my opinion, confusing and did not fit into the movie at all. The relationship with the neighbors were not relevant, odd and plain creepy. I thought the film was horrible. Sorry, just my opinion!"
"howard.schumann","6","10","20","18 January 2009"," A missed opportunity
","In life, we either have the things that we want or the reasons why we do not have them. Based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road tackles the issue of what it would take to go beyond the reasons and create a life of authenticity. The film reunites the popular stars of Titanic, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, as a suburban couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who see themselves as special but whose mediocre lives do not reflect their ideals. Set in suburban Connecticut in the 1950s, the main protagonists mirror the growing intellectual malaise and search for meaning that lay beneath the outward superficiality of the ""affluent society"", an undercurrent that would give birth to the counterculture and the more open social environment of the 1960s. <br/><br/>As they move into their new house on Revolutionary Road with their two small children, Michael (Ty Simpkins) and Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins), Frank (DiCaprio) and Alice (Winslet) are determined not to be trapped by their surroundings but their self-deception and inertia ensures that they will get what they resist. They devise schemes to escape that seem plausible on the surface, but fail to confront the fact that they are comfortable in being the people that they used to mock. Ultimately, the gap between their aspirations and their ability to achieve them leads to growing frustration and an inevitable breakdown in their relationship that has sad consequences. <br/><br/>The film opens when Frank and Alice spot each other at a party and the closeness of their dancing indicates a strong chemistry between them. Flashing forward seven years, however, the promise of the opening scene has deteriorated to bickering conflict. Alice, who aspires to be an actress, is disappointed with her performance in the local theater and, on the drive home, becomes furious with Frank who berates her acting ability. Frank is now a thirty-year-old salesman for a business machines corporation in Manhattan, the same company his father worked for, and professes to hate his job.<br/><br/>Recognizing their untenable situation, Alice proposes that they sell their house and move to Paris where she can work in the NATO secretarial pool and Frank can ""find himself"" and begin to live the life he has dreamed of. Initially reluctant, Frank slowly warms to the idea, seeing it as a way to obtain a release from the suburban mentality personified by Frank's co-workers and neighbors Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) who view their proposed move as radical and silly. When Frank is praised at a job for a report he has written and offered a promotion and higher salary by Bart Pollack (Jay O. Sanders), however, doubts begin to surface about the Paris decision. <br/><br/>Soon the couple's arguments take on a more vicious tone, their confidence undermined by visits to their home by their realtor Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), her husband Howard (Richard Easton), and their mentally disturbed son John (Michael Shannon). Free from social restraints, John unleashes a searing indictment of Frank and Alice's values and his verbal thrusts are the film's power point. As a final straw, Alice reveals that she is pregnant and ideas about Paris must be re-evaluated. Fine performances by Winslet and DiCaprio support a solid, workmanlike effort by Mendes, but the film lacks the poetry that would raise it to another level and the dialogue is often self-conscious and overly theatrical. What could have been a work of power and beauty becomes instead a missed opportunity and, in Mendes' hand, Revolutionary Road is a dead end street."
"J. Ryan","5","9","18","28 December 2008"," Sam Mendes Hates American Suburbs
","The New York Times called this ""pessimism without redemption"" -- that's pretty accurate. Despite strong performances by DiCaprio and Winslet, the film never exceeds a relentless hammering of the banal American suburban existence by Sam Mendes. Within 5 minutes, we see an all-too-real-feeling argument between our lead couple over the realization that Winslet's character is just not a talented actress. From there, we are subjected to a near 2 hours of the worst moments of couples therapy. The problem with Revolutionary Road is shared by both the source material (Richard Yates' novel) as well as the direction. Mendes' earlier treatise on suburban existence - American Beauty - worked because of the self-deprecating humor of Kevin Spacey. Here, there's no humor, just multiple layers of misery. It doesn't help that a little careful scrutiny of that misery uncovers how trivial the couples problems really are (the couple wants to move to Paris because they are in a rut living in the NY metro area. Funny how no one asks, ""Why not get another job?""). In the end, R^2 is really a mediocre stage play filled with misplaced angst. Without any real drama (or perhaps too much of it), I really left the theater asking myself ""who cares?"""
"nick suess","7","6","11","20 January 2009"," Travel from South Pacific to the Cuckoo's Nest aboard the Ballad of Lucy Jordan
","Well, to be taken on such a journey really must have something for everyone, but along the way, we don't find out very much about these characters. What exactly was it on some enchanted evening that caused these two to spot one another as strangers across a crowded room? It seemed to be an artistic party, and must have been, as there was even a token black man there, something which would have been socially very unusual in the late 40s, even in NYC. So what was Frank, who claimed to be a longshoreman, doing there? Clearly April had some measure of artistic pretensions, and we flash forward and there she is 'starring' in the local small town am-dram production. Pity it's a flop, but she is already sufficiently off her trolley to take this as a sign that her entire life is useless. And we do get the impression that she is already in the habit of turning her marital favours on and off like a tap. So Frank has had enough, and pretty soon it's wombat time for him.<br/><br/>We ask ourselves where can they go from here? To our great surprise, it is the inspiration of a pic of Frank as a young GI at the liberation of Paris that leads April to instantly decide the cure for their increasingly troubled marriage is to pack up everything and move to that romantic city she has never visited.<br/><br/>And so the fantasy drags on. To try and get the boss off his back, Frank spouts some piece of impromptu bullshit, and is instantly proclaimed a genius and offered promotion beyond his wildest dreams. That's conflict point 1 with the Paris plan, and simultaneous conflict point 2 is that April gets up the duff. I think this was about the conflict point at which I began to realise I was hungry, and wondered how much longer this would all go on.<br/><br/>But then it got better. Introduce the local loony to upstage the lot of them, and hey, we even had a bit of 'Beautiful Mind' in there, as he had a PhD in maths! His brain had been fried by electric shocks, which had destroyed the maths, but led him to have an uncanny perception about those around him. He, as the 'fool on the hill' saw through the entire thing, and nobody liked that.<br/><br/>Now, Lucy Jordan, the woman who ""realised she'd never drive through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair"" lived then and continues to live in so many of us who eke out our dull suburban lives, raising our children, and growing old. Lucy Jordan is not new. Telling her story over is valid for us to watch and learn, and for going into that zone, and asking those difficult questions, I am prepared to raise my vote to 7/10. But where was the attempt to answer the questions?<br/><br/>In many ways I found myself admiring April at that point, as despite her fairly unsympathetic character she did dare to dream. I can remember the 50s, and the stifling pressures of that era to conform, these being laid down by an older generation simply grateful to be alive and free after the horror of two global conflicts. I was strongly reminded of a wonderful aunt who likewise defied that society by undertaking Bohemian travel all over Europe. Single and childless, and based in London, she had far fewer issues than April to confront, but I still think she made her important decisions upon the basis of more than just an old snapshot of the Eiffel tower, which was all that seemed to get April started. Was that how her decision was made? I did sympathise more with Frank, the brief shot of him as one of the swarm of trilby hats emerging from Grand Central was very powerful, evocative of 'Koyaanisqatsi'. Despite the numbing boredom of his job, he was knuckling down and getting on with raising his kids. And here suddenly was this notion, a brief fleeting glimpse of a seductively different life. But how was his decision made? Why did he suddenly flip from 'no' to 'yes', especially with the already growing realisation that he was married to a fruit cake? You see, in a story such as this, I expect the movie maker to really take us into some depth on the genuine conflict we face when being confronted by difficult decisions. Maybe the book explored this, but I haven't read it. Mendes cops out of it completely. So we are left with just the loony to tell us the truth.<br/><br/>Maybe we should listen more carefully to lunatics!"

There were multiple parts in the movie that were not suppose to be funny but people were cracking up! Imagine a horror movie so bad you laugh at it - that's what this is like. What a piece of garbage. Kate Winslet best actress? What a joke.<br/><br/>The movie has no plot and proves nothing. It is slow and builds into...NOTHING. The acting is good at best, and over done at that, and cannot save this film. There is absolutely NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Speaking of which, there are characters that make no sense. Especially a ""mentally ill"" guy that is in here for no reason. It takes place in the 1950s, why? They could have saved money on customs and have had this take place in present time. The score for the film is absolutely atrocious. They kept playing the same thing over and over again. One of the worst parts in the movie is when Kate Winslet is dancing to MUSIC and then they cut into the score of the movie. Why? She is dancing and now you're playing slow music? It makes no sense.<br/><br/>not even rent worthy.<br/><br/>I'm reading other reviews on IMDb and I see not only the people in the theater I was at were laughing at it, but other people on IMDb as well."
"nvillesanti","2","5","9","17 September 2009"," Pointless Road
","I just finished watching Revolutionary Road, actually I watch it twice. The story is set in US suburbia, in the post WW2. It enfolds a married couple, the Wheelers, who are in discomfort with their ordinary lives and they decide to do something different. Their plan is to move to Paris and start a new and different life. Winslet plays a 1950s housewife with unaccomplished dreams. She encourages he husband Frank (DiCaprio) to quit his job and sell their home so they can go on this trip. But Frank is more assertive to others opinion, outside their marriage, than of his own wife. For a moment we see them doing well until Frank is offered a better position on his work place and decides to cancel their plans. <br/><br/>I understand the premise of the story and Winslet character's desperation to get out of her, so called boring life. What I didn't get was her true motivations. I have never read the book and perhaps I never will, but the movie doesn't really develop why she is so into going to France and leaving everything behind. It's obvious, they are not happy and it's clear from the beginning of the movie where their arguments and fighting become cliché throughout the entire movie. The plot is focused on their depressive state, instead of showing how they got to be so unhappy. Perhaps you might have read this already in other reviews, but my other complains is the lack of character development. Character development is practically inexistent; it leaves you with a lot of whys. The main characters become unlikable and predictable, the only character that I found interesting was John Givings played by Michael Shannon. But other than that, I found the acting was just average, and it wasn't the best work of DiCaprio and Winslet. Story wise there is no concrete plot and in my opinion, it's not strong enough for the viewer to support the main character motive. Anyway, be your own judge, but be warned, this movie is depressing from start to finish."
"Turfseer","4","5","9","3 August 2009"," Grim put-down of 50s Suburbia
","Instead of blaming Hollywood for their self-congratulatory tales of suburban angst, why not blame a gullible public? For it's the public that laps up these specious and false tales. Why was 'The Graduate' such a success? Because it gave the average person the right to feel that 'I'm better than you'. It's easy to sneer at a Mrs. Robinson, an adult woman who manipulates the emotions of Dustin Hoffman's 'innocent' college student, Benjamin. She's willing to not only ruin his life but also that of her daughters. Her narcissism knows no bounds. In a nutshell, she's a character who's easy to hate. Hollywood has the formula down pat: give us an innocent rebel who 'doesn't fit in' and have him or her pitted against the 'monster'—the hissing mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama has evolved into the 'conformist' post-war suburbanite.<br/><br/>In Revolutionary Road there is nary a laugh to be heard throughout the entire 118 minutes of the film. No one seems to like themselves at all. At the film's beginning, the suburbanites' community theater production is a complete failure. And the worst performance in the play is given by our protagonist, Kate Winslett's April Wheeler. Heaven forbid people can have fun performing in a community theater production or even laugh at themselves if the production is a little off. No, the point is made from the outset that our community of post-war suburbanites is one of 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness'. This is the profound 'epiphany' that the makers of Revolutionary Road want us to experience and they are going to reveal these 'profound insights' to us. But the truth is, there is no such thing as suburban 'angst'—back then and now the vast majority of people have egos—in short, they like themselves! <br/><br/>Those who have written negative things about Revolutionary Road seem to agree that there is little character development when it comes to April Wheeler. When Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) tells April that she always felt she was someone 'special', the camera comes in close and we see the blank expression on her face. April is not to be blamed for her depression—society has made her into what she is. It's a trite idea that people are not responsible for their own lives but that's what Revolutionary Road serves up here. April is a Bohemian, a free spirit whose main goal is to move to Paris. For half the movie, her plan of liberation is about the only thing we find out about her. Certainly we find out nothing about her personality vis-à-vis her children—they are barely seen in this film and can be best thought of as a set of props in this overblown passion play.<br/><br/>Additional 'props' can be found in the characters of the Wheelers' neighbors, Shep and Millie Campbell. When April and Frank tell them of their plans to move to Paris, they later castigate them in the comfort of their own bedroom as ""immature"". The film's scenarists wish us to identify the Campbells as being arrogant and part of the overall suburban 'emptiness'. Shep loses further points when he beds April just before her final breakdown.<br/><br/>One wonders why Frank is so easily convinced by April to chuck his house and job and run off to Paris with her and the kids. After all, he screams at her for her illusions of becoming a great actress in the opening scene. But somehow she appeals to his earlier idealistic desires to be free and independent before the kids came along. In the blink of an eye, the empty and uncaring suburbanite who has no compunctions about bedding the new pretty office worker suddenly is transformed into a caring, self-actualized mensch who will go along with his wife's bold plan to go where no other suburban couple has gone before.<br/><br/>Don't despair, Frank returns to his vile ways quite soon enough. With a job promotion hanging over his head and the news that April is pregnant, he decides to 'sell out'. Aha, we've finally found out who the antagonist is in this film! Fortunately there is one bright note in Revolutionary Road and that is Michael Shannon's electroshock victim, John Givings. John is basically an ally of April since they both don't fit into society and are labeled as deviant (note that at one point, Frank recommends that April see a shrink!). Before Frank 'sells out', he and April have a nice 'heart-to-heart' talk in the woods with John who echoes the film's theme: people in suburbia might 'get' emptiness but April and (pre-sell-out) Frank 'feel' hopelessness. The non-conformist blesses the free-spirit couple for their 'bravery'. But once Frank takes the new job and decides not to go to Paris, he is the recipient of John's full wrath. A real person would have parried John's blows with perhaps a sense of humor, but since Frank is merely a stand-in for all the ills of suburbia (and hence American society), he comes off as arrogant, defensive and with a severe anger management problem.<br/><br/>The only truly enjoyable moment in Revolutionary Road is when John turns on April for a millisecond. After berating Frank, he whispers in HER ear and tells her in effect that maybe she's no great shakes either! The suggestion that maybe April is not an angel is short-lived. Before you know it, April has done herself in by means of a self-induced abortion. Our beloved bohemian is now enshrined as sacrificial lamb.<br/><br/>Ironically, Revolutionary Road is well-acted and directed. What's more the art design of the film, with its attention to period detail, is a work to behold. The score, while repetitious, is also haunting. But somehow the histrionics of the principal characters do not impress since people are not like that in real life. Stories about people living 'lives of quiet desperation' is not only a myth but 'old hat'. The 'Road' is more empty than the mythic society it creates and attempts to tear down."
"warren-1976","2","5","9","3 February 2009"," An Excuse For 'Acting'
","I have to admit, I went into this with a little trepidation. The trailers implied a film with little-to-no plot, and two people shouting and arguing a lot. Unfortunately, I wasn't proved wrong.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the idea of an interesting drama documenting the break down of a marriage and/or abortion issues, but Revolutionary Road has no subtlety or progression in dealing with these. Essentially, the marriage is already broken at the start of the film. They start to dream of a new life that will give them a fresh start and fail. The marriage then descends into collapse and the unintentional death of a character.<br/><br/>Of course there's all sorts of 'meaningful' messages here. The real question, is whether they're told in an interesting and effective manner. With the exception of the 'slight' hopefulness of the two leads moving to Paris, the film is utterly one-tone. The characters are never really established with back-story or through any other narrative method. In essence, all we ever learn about them, is: ""This is a suburban couple in the 50s. They shout at each other a lot and are apparently unsatisfied with their lives"" They even have a couple of children that appear briefly in one or two scenes as plot devices, but otherwise seem not to exist. It's as though they have been shoe-horned in after 90% of the film has been completed, to be causes for more of the 'dramatic' scenes between the leads. Obviously this is not the case, but the way it is filmed and told, it may as well have been.<br/><br/>Any messages this film may have had, are lost in the contrived plot and barely even two-dimensional characters. Yes, the basic 'facts' of the story are as realistic or unrealistic as you want them to be, but they are all bound up in a false and extremely forced package. A sign of good characterisation is the ability to think ""If (random event) happened to the character, how would they react?"" and being able to formulate some idea of your own, based on what you have seen and heard. The two leads in Revolutionary Road had no consistency of character at any point. They were just hollow shells for DeCaprio and Winslet to 'act' with.<br/><br/>The whole film comes over as a contrived mess. One of those movies that make the old mistake of thinking ""Lots of dramatic shouting, crying, and vacant long looks, equals good acting and drama."" Yet perhaps that was their main point. To give Winslet and DeCaprio a vehicle in which to indulge in melodramatic over-the-top acting, without lumbering any of the 'acting' scenes with the problems that can be encountered when you establish characters, or give them real reason to behave the way they do. The 'plot' was simply a device by which to have 'emotional acting' scenes for the actors to enjoy getting their teeth into.<br/><br/>The highlights of the film, and some of the few moments it comes alive, are when the somewhat disturbed character of 'John Givings' (Played by Michael Shannon) pops up to deliver some 'home truths' so-to-speak. Sure, he's a blatant device used to hammer home the film's plot points/messages in case we missed them while watching, but nevertheless, he easily becomes the most interesting character in the whole mess. Inadvertently (Especially in his final scene) his character truly sums up the utter banality and pointlessness of the whole story, and how shallow and empty the characters are. Another highlight, is the very final moment of the film when the character's father turns off his hearing-aid in order to blank out the inane ramblings of his shallow wife. Which again, sum up the entire film perfectly.<br/><br/>Perhaps Revolutionary Road is best summed up as the acting equivalent of a bland, plot less summer blockbuster with lots of special effects. Except in this case the 'effects' are Winslet and DeCaprio's 'acting' for the sake of acting, and once you get past that, there's not a lot left that's Revolutionary."

","Sam Mendes is back in crumbling family territory with this adaptation of a Richard Yates novel about the implosion of a family in early 1960's American suburbia. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the Wheelers. We see how they meet at a party and then we flash forward to Kate performing in a not very good local theater production which leads into a heated argument on the way home. From there we watch as the pair try to navigate their life together and in the suburban wasteland around them.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie I found this a tough slog. I never really clicked with the material for a variety of reasons and so found myself squirming in my seat. The main problem for me is that the film seemed more like a dress up affair rather then real people. Everything is spotless in the way that suburbia is always pictured to be, but never really was except when some people were having guests. Everything in the entire film is picture perfect and artificial. It could be argued that this is the way the characters see the world, but when it extended to Leo's office where there was nary a sign of any work on anyones desk I had to throw up my hands. Mendes maybe making a point but at the same time I found it all terribly obvious.<br/><br/>The performances are good with the exception of Kathy Bates who is so loud and obnoxious as to unbalance the rest of the film. I know that in some way she is a form of Greek Chorus but at the same time one had wished that she was a little less noisy. (Though it makes the final image more understandable from both the context of the scene it self and the film as a whole.) Give it a shot if you like the stars or like dress up tragedy."

","I saw Revolutionary Road this evening and to be honest before sitting down to watch it I was sceptical. Was this to be an American Beauty rip off? A blatant ploy for Oscar glory? In the end my fears were allayed, it's a very good piece. What makes this film are the lead performances, Winslet and Dicaprio are both outstanding. Their characters crack and crumble before your eyes. You believe completely in these wrecks of people, and as their lives go from one turmoil to the next you will them to make the right decisions and feel for them when things go wrong.<br/><br/>I felt that the main problem with the film was the plot. I have no quibbles with what does happen in the film it just to me felt that not enough happened in the 2 hour running time, it set its self as a look at a conflict between a married couple and that was its downfall. There is very little else other the arguments of a married couple and in the end that gets a little tiring.<br/><br/>I would though say that this film is well worth a watch, the performances are terrific and it is beautifully shot, I just don't think it is the seminal commentary on marriage it sets out to be."

","If you like to watch mundane, depressing people lament over their lives for two hours, you are in for a real treat. Bringing out morbid and highly unattractive performances from Hollywood actors seems to be Sam Mendes' strength, and in Revolutionary Road he has outdone himself. The characters in American Beauty are all sweet-as-pie, angelic beings of light compared to the protagonists here. There is no payoff  it's just two hours of cringing. Nothing beautiful is expressed, nothing valuable is preached, nothing heartening is communicated. I would sooner watch a 3 year old throw an hour long temper tantrum than sit through this again."

","While the film has all of the trappings of Oscar gold including a large marketing campaign, a top shelf cast and Golden Globe nominations it fails the biggest test: Watchability. After an intriguing first half hour the film seems to slip into a predictable pattern and by the end that pattern has worn out its welcome.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes is no stranger to marital drama. He swept the Oscars with ""American Beauty"" a film that made Kevin Spacey a star and was extremely accurate at mining the contradictions of upper middle class domestic bliss. The wild success of ""Desperate Housewives"" owes more than a small debt to that film. His follow-up ""Road To Perdition"" broadened the scope but at its heart was a study of the family. Turning his focus to a popular and critically acclaimed novel I must say that he falls flat this time despite the efforts of DeCaprio and Winslett, the pair that hold the record for the most successful box office champion of all time.<br/><br/>""Road"" is set in about the same time period as AMC's critically acclaimed ""Mad Men"" and is about a couple approaching their 10th anniversary. They live in a nice house and have two darling kids and are friends with other couples. The film suggests that according to the standards of the current zeitgeist they should be happy and content. But the script suggests that the pair once believed that they were ""special"" above the milieu of everyday life. Unforetunately there seems to be very little that is ""special"" about them unless you consider the husband's extramarital affairs at work or what would appear to be the increasing erratic behavior of his wife to fall into any ex halted category.<br/><br/>At first the aggressive banter between the pair seems jarring and somewhat unique if not totally captivating. But precious little happens in the story and we are left to chew on basically two performers showing us all of their chops and if we can draw anything from the finished product it may be that either Mendes is not that great of a director or maybe that these movie stars are not great movie artists at least not good enough to carry an entire film without any real support. DeCaprio seemed to blow away his detractors with his stunning work in ""The Departed"" but in retrospect the kudos may actually belong with Scorsese who helmed that project. I guess that everyone will draw their own conclusion but my guess is that simple deduction would place the blame on the performers.<br/><br/>The glowing reviews, award nominations and the cast will most likely bring the public in to see the film but my guess is that this Road will end up being less traveled than others."

Their lives then degenerate into a tale that no one wants to listen to. Such a transition is heart wrenching but strangely captivating.<br/><br/>The plot is very engaging and above all, real. What other film contains such a real life dialog about having children or not? Because the plot is so real, one can easily relate to it, making the film ever more engaging. It is ironic that the most real conversation they have is with a supposed lunatic. Maybe we are all living deluded lives, and clarity can only stem from lunacy?

","Revolutionary Road, helmed by American Beauty Oscar winning director Sam Mendes, could be the biggest disappointment of 2008.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong... the movie was good. It just... fell flat. Though pumped with emotional contact between the characters, it ultimately felt emotionless for me. Beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, though. Another fine cinematographic job from the master of his field.<br/><br/>What I wanted to be so much just couldn't be. Of course, Kate Winslet was great in the role, but I don't think this is anywhere near her best work, and it would be a shame to see an Oscar go to this performance when 2008 was such a wonderful year for the leading ladies. A nomination? Well, of course... but the win will not be deserved.<br/><br/>Now to DiCaprio. Though I fully acknowledge that the man can act, and in some cases very well, he just seems to me to be processing the same role. He isn't very versatile as an actor at all, and this role just held no challenges for him. Any number of actors could have pulled more from the role. The performance, though shouty, was really two-dimensional for me.<br/><br/>And now to the best part of the movie: the supporting actors. Michael Shannon brings his A-game to a very small but pivotal role in the story. He provides the climax so wonderfully, yet had to play off of an obvious screenplay. All that his character did was trumpet the whole message of the movie, and for me, the meaning of any great work is ultimately subversive and not blatant. Obviously the scene was required to provide a goal point, but still... this is the fault of the screenplay, which is very faithful to the book, which is probably where the REAL problem lies. This book was just not a book that adapted well to the screen, I think.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates clocks in a lovely little performance as Michael Shannon's mother, wishing to excuse her son's every fanaticism with a mental illness. A shame really, because Jon was such an interesting character, if completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>So, like I said, this was a good movie. Just one that was unnecessary to make. A rehashing of a story already told (by the same director), with several well-acted scenes, a wonderful performance throughout from Kate, a sub-par script based on a sub-par book, all shown beautifully by Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>A 6 out of 10 (but just barely)"

The premise of the film as a suburban couple who are unhappy with their lives. I guess the idea is that people might relate to it. It's the sort of film where people can see a bit of themselves in the characters. Maybe that's why it is so popular.<br/><br/>But if that's the case, why not just look in the mirror?"

","In one of the classiest pieces of stunt casting in recent years, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes reunites his wife, Kate Winslet, with her ""Titanic"" shipmate Leonardo DiCaprio to play the Wheelers in his screen adaptation of Richard Yates' novel ""Revolutionary Road."" It adds an appealing accessibility to an otherwise depressing tale.<br/><br/>The film opens boldly enough, spending just a few fleeting moments showing us how the Wheelers met before throwing us head first into their disaster of a marriage. April (Winslet) always had dreams of being an actress and Frank (DiCaprio), well, Frank always had some vague idea of living in Paris. The film chronicles their sad story. The Wheelers are meant to represent the post WWII generation who during the prosperous 1950's created suffocating lives due to dreams deferred in exchange for chasing the so-called ""American Dream"" that they never really believed in. Everyone else in the film is in some sort of love with the Wheelers and their picture perfect lives, but the Wheelers hate themselves, each other, their neighbors, and what they have become. It's a damning little portrait that has been painted before in literature and film, but never quite so acutely.<br/><br/>I haven't read Richard Yates' novel, but I am currently reading his collection of short stories which address many of the same themes and bear his hallmarks present here: cutting dialog, keen insights into the psyche of his sometimes despicable or just plain sad characters, and obsessive attention to details of time and place. In terms of the tone of Yates' writing, Mendes is successful in his translation. However, that tone that worked so well on the page doesn't always work on screen. We're never sure if we're meant to sympathize with the Wheelers or if Mendes wants us to view it as a dark comedy where we watch in sick delight as the popular kids who always thought they were more interesting than everyone else grow up to be horribly dysfunctional and cripplingly normal. Much of the audience I saw the film with laughed to break the tension during some of Mendes' trademarked ""uncomfortable dinner table scenes"", but we all watched in horror as the film spun out of control into its downer of a climax.<br/><br/>Ultimately one sits through a film like this for the acting, and it doesn't disappoint on that level. Taking a line from the film, DiCaprio is a ""cracker jack"" playing for the first time a husband, a father, and a hopelessly average Joe. Winslet is on more familiar ground, but never has she been given so much range to roam, and her director husband lets her run wild and free. It's a neurotic, brave, and sometimes questionable performance that is a rare sight to behold. At times it seems as if Mendes is directing a stage-play rather than a film, and he lets the whole cast scream and holler against his finely detailed period backdrops, but it's still entertaining for those who enjoy watching polished professionals (including Michael Shannon portraying a man on leave from an insane asylum in a perfect pitch) stretch their acting muscles.<br/><br/>One watches the grim dissolution of this marriage wondering if there isn't some subtext to explore with regards to Winslet and Mendes' own seemingly perfect Hollywood marriage. And as unlikable as they are at times, and no matter how much we would rather laugh at then relate to another human being, one can't escape the sickening feeling that there might be a little bit of Frank and April Wheeler in all of us."

","This is one of the worst movies i ever watched. Starting off nice, it soon deconstructs the golden era of the 50ies in which a man was still a man and a woman knew her role until it becomes emancipation propaganda. Kate Winslet playing a badly educated witch in a world full of liars and with a husband without honor and strength. This was the exception back then, 99% of the people lived happily. Who wants to see movies that show life as it should not be, in which you do not feel strong, feel better, look up to. I watch movies to feel better after i watched them, to let them strengthen my values and in the end myself; or to just entertain me. This movie cannot satisfy any of these desires, actually it makes me feel sad, depressed. I can imagine some lesbian feminists or maybe suppressed women may enjoy this movie due to the parallels to their lifes, but that's about it. A waste of Winslets and DiCaprio's acting skills."

","Leo and Kate's (and don't forget the wonderful Kathy Bates as well) reunion here in 'Revolutionary Road' from 'Titanic' reminded me so much of the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts's 'Pretty Woman' follow-up/reunion 'Runaway Bride.' In both cases, the originals they starred in were incredibly better and the latter films weren't complete disappointments, just not as great. Here we have Leo acting like Leo, but much better is Kate who shows so much depth to the lost housewife of the fifties who realized what little anyone else that lived in the area/time either saw or talked about: the 'Stepford Wives' effect. Of course, I'm not talking about robots, but they might as well just be. Men: grow, find a great, but boring job, marry, have 1 kid, get promoted, have another kid, repeat. Women: just do whatever the man says. I liked Kate in this movie because I truly believed her anguish, the lost feeling she had, the 'no-escape' clause she thought there was. If anyone gets nominated, it should be her. Everyone else, including Leo, might have just walked off the 'Mad Men' extras back lot. Overall, I liked the film and the study of the two seemingly (but really not) cardboard cuts of the neighborhood (or times); however it seemed to stretch a 20-page-novelette into 2 hours of film. And boy, did it really make me want to have a cigarette, and not because of any steamy scenes."

","Revolutionary Road is the new powerful drama from Sam Mendes. It starts off with April and Frank first meeting, they meet at a party and they start to have a conversation. She wants to be actress, but it turns out that she isn't that great, and Frank finds that out while watching one of her plays. Many years pass and it shows Frank at work, he's not too happy with his job, and apparently he's not too happy with his marriage because he starts to have an affair with one of the girls at his work. But then he goes home to find his wife and kids were throwing him a little 30th birthday party. But Frank and April are both sick of their current life, so after talking with each other they decide they need a new life and plan to move to Paris. Frank then starts to fade away from the idea once he gets offered a better job at his current work place, and then they find out something else that ultimately makes them stay in their current life. April isn't happy with this life though and she really can't stand this life anymore. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Kathy Bates, David Harbour, Kathryn Hahn, and Michael Shannon all star in this incredible drama.<br/><br/>The acting from the entire cast is incredible; I don't think there was even one bad acting moment from anyone in the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio shines out of this cast the best by far, I wouldn't be surprised if he wins 'Best Actor' at this year's academy awards, and I'm going to be upset if he doesn't at least get nominated because he definitely deserves it. He really stood out in once scene alone when he's fighting and arguing with Kate Winslet's character. Kate Winslet was also amazing, not quite as amazing as DiCaprio though, I can definitely see her getting nominated for 'Best Actress' though, I'm not sure I see her winning though, I could be surprised though. Kathy Bates was great for the parts she was in, she constantly appears throughout the whole movie, and the scenes she was in were great though. David Harbour was also really good; I really liked his character in this though, just the stuff that happened with his character was great. Kathryn Hahn was good, her character seemed to really freak me out though, just the smile that she had on her face throughout the movie. Michael Shannon was the best out of the cast after DiCaprio and Winslet though, I've seen him in some small roles before but I never really noticed that he had great acting though. I mean his role in this was pretty small too, but the parts he was in were just amazing, I was completely blown away by his acting. His character was supposed to be messed up in the head though, and he did a great job showing it.<br/><br/>The story for this was great; it started off a little slow though IMO. Some of this really reminded me of American Beauty, I think if you liked American Beauty you should check this one out, because it wasn't like exactly the same thing or anything, but the concept was sort of like American Beauty. I was glued to the movie right up until the last 25 minutes or so, I mean I think this has one of the best and most emotional scenes that I've ever seen in the movie, and it was towards the end. But I feel after that scene, the ending just gets dry right up until the last 5 minutes or so, and then it really got me interested in it again. I didn't mind that the ending was dry much though, because the rest of the movie before that really made up for the dry ending. The acting sort of stole the show from the story though, but that doesn't mean the story was bad or anything, just that the acting was amazing.<br/><br/>Overall I absolutely loved it, I think this is probably tied with The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as my second favorite movie of the year, but I still have quite a few movies to see from this year first though, so that may be flip flopping around some. Also like Benjamin Button, I think this is probably going to make it somewhere between the 20 and 30 spot in my favorites list. I think in the end I may end up liking this more than Benjamin Button though because I'm pretty sure that this will have a better rewatchabilty standard than Benjamin Button. This has to be like my favorite movie from Sam Mendes, I'd have to re-watch American Beauty and Road To Perdition just make sure though, but I'm still pretty sure. This for me actually lived up to the hype, because I was hyping myself up to watch this a little because I thought the trailer looked amazing and it definitely deserved it. I can also definitely see this snagging 'Best Picture' at the academy awards this year though, but if you're one of the ones lucky enough to have this playing at a theater near you, I suggest you go and see it before it leaves because it's definitely worth the price of an admission price.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","When this novel came out in 1961, with JFK in office and America at the zenith of empire, perhaps this story about the dark rumblings beneath the veneer of suburban normalcy was bold and original. But now? Almost 50 years later? It's been done to death, don't you think? <br/><br/>We get it, Mendes. The suburbs suck, and the American Dream isn't all it's cracked up to be. You already covered that territory once-- more deftly. Add to that: the 50s were a conformist prison. Congratulations, you've hit the cliché trifecta.<br/><br/>The timing on this one is especially bad given our current economic woes. The family lives in a beautiful neighborhood. Husband has a secure, not-too-difficult job and is about to be promoted. Children are healthy and happy. Looks pretty good from the edge of the abyss here in 2010. What's the problem? <br/><br/>The wife never became an artist!--not that she showed any evidence of possessing a speck of talent. Her neighbors are boring!--although they seem to be perfectly nice folks. Their trip to Paris where they were somehow to achieve self-actualization was scrubbed! Her husband turned out to be a rather ordinary fellow and not Cary Grant! Boo freaking hoo!<br/><br/>Take some of hubby's raise, hire a nanny, and then perfect your ""art."" Hell, Grace Metalious wrote Peyton Place under the same set of constraints without the raise and the nanny (during the exact same time period). No, not with this precious broad. It's Paris or nothing for her. <br/><br/>Is this movie trying to say that the wife's inability to grow up --i.e., deal with the responsibilities of life and diminished expectations-- was her tragic flaw? Or is it proposing that ""society"" and ""the times"" caused a non-conformist to destroy herself? It's hard to say, but given the emphasis on setting and period details, it seems to be the latter. Through the telescope of 50 years, it just looks naive and childish. A better theme would be: how do we find dignity and meaning in life once we realize we're not that ""special?"" But that's a little deeper than this shallow examination cared to delve. Much easier to blame the ""phoniness"" of ""society.""<br/><br/>The crazy son of the real estate agent was a clumsy contrivance to catalyze the conflict and hammer the audience over the head with the movie's theme.<br/><br/>The acting was good, given the material. The sets and cinematography were top-notch. It's a great movie to look at with the sound off. Beautiful really, which pushes the rating into respectable territory. Points, too, for at least addressing the most common of adult themes in a straightforward, un-ironic fashion. But in the end, it's rather ""fake-deep"" and superfluous with an unsatisfying ending."

Even though nut-case mathematician Michael Shannon bluntly shouts out many of the ostensible themes of the picture in an over-the-top scene, the thinking, open-minded viewer is left to guess, or decide whether the hellish marriage between thirty-something Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is the result of our stifling, conformity driven capitalist culture (I think I already used that line, but it applies) and/OR the result of a neurotic, narcissistic housewife whose unfulfilled, grandiose dreams destroy the lives of those around her. There's no question about the overall quality of the production. I'd say its the story of two people just smart enough to see through the empty, soul-sucking aspects of modern life but lacking the imagination to transcend it.

But ""Revolutionary Road"" is not only the typical story of a couple who buys a house, has kids, goes out with the friendly neighbor's and one day starts asking ""what are we doing around here?""...<br/><br/>Seems like no one knows the answer except a magnificent character, a neighbor's son who has a psychiatric problem.

Basically I wasn't sure if I wanted to check Mendes' fourth film, Revolutionary Road, but now I'm glad I was invited to see it, certainly I had a better second experience with a Sam Mendes film not to mention with a film with both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet playing the main characters. <br/><br/>Here DiCaprio gives another remarkable performance (not to mention Winslet) as Frank, a young man who meet his wife April (certainly played by Kate) at a party, who fought in the WWII and who works at Knox Business Machines, the same company that has Frank's father for 30 years as an employee. Frank and April, better known as the Wheelers are for all the people a beautifully perfect couple. When we meet April we, and Frank, knew that she was an actress, now she is a housewife, a mother of a girl and a boy, two kids that we barely see. Settle down, unhappy moments for our two main characters. We have in another couple (played by Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour) and in Helen (Kathy Bates) the closest persons to the Wheelers. That couple is the ""normal"" imperfect one, good persons but apparently not as special as the Wheelers and Helen thinks nothing but the same about the Wheelers, she admires them, she really likes them, she think they are special. Is quite interesting to see the reactions of these people when they know about the plans of our young and perfect couple, plans that give hopes to Frank and April, hopes and happiness. The point of doing those plans to feel again, their plans are to move to Paris, France, she will work, he will stay at home to find himself, to find what he really wants. Then is the same routine, Frank has to take the train to get to the office and stuff but there's something waiting, something planned, they feel special. We have a character that appears only two times, his mother says that he is at a mental institution and that he is an intellectual. Since his mother is Helen he certainly had heard many things about the perfect Wheelers, curious that when he finally meet them is when they announce to Helen (and to her husband  played by Richard Easton) that they are not going to continue living in Revolutionary Road. So John (Michael Shannon), the mentioned intellectual son of Helen, knows what means for his parents that the Wheelers are leaving the country and for both Frank and April he is the only one who understand them, who understand why they want to leave Revolutionary Road. So the first time we see John is basically an uncomfortable moment for his parents but not really for the Wheelers, John ends being the only character in our story that not only says exactly what he thinks but also whose words are true at least for the Wheelers. John meet with the Wheelers a couple of times, in both for the Wheelers he says the truth yet the reaction of Frank after hearing John is not the same at all in both moments. Famous critic Roger Ebert wrote this John Lennon phrase at the beginning of his review for this film: ""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans"". Here of course things happen to them after April says her idea to Frank and he says ""OK"", the unplanned stuff certainly comes, Frank wasn't waiting for something but this something came, now for him their Paris can be not in France but there in their country and not exactly because there is a Paris, Texas. We see both Frank and April cheating on the other, only Frank will confess this to April, why? with what purpose? He confessed his affair, an affair that started in the day of his 30th birthday, that day he came home and saw April and his children, they certainly congratulated him, was his day and the day he had sex with a work partner (played by Zoe Kazan), by then the Wheelers were still for the people the perfect young couple. <br/><br/>When I entered yesterday to the movie theater to see this film I had in mind that this was one of the five films nominated for the best picture Oscar, you know the poster of Revolutionary Road is similar to the one of The Reader but anyway I recommend you this new Sam Mendes drama, certainly the performances of those who leaved behind Titanic are enough to say that this is a worth watching film. Now checking I know that Revolutionary Road will be ""fighting"" for 3 Oscars, I go for the Joker."
"gyges03","4","3","5","29 January 2009"," Trudging down Revolutionary Road
","Revolutionary Road can hardly be called a film in any serious sense of the word. It seems more like a series of screen tests, some more successful than others. Both Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet emote vigorously until they appear to get severe hemorrhoids (fatal in the case of the Winslet character). Sometimes the only interest in this film is the exquisite 50s design. I think Sam Mendes is basically a theater director and seems to have taken no interest in the cinematography -the lighting is wildly inconsistent, sometimes sensitive and moody, other times like a mediocre British studio film. On the positive side and unlike the stultifying Benjamin Button movie it was only 2 hours long."
"Muzzy_Meat","Null","3","5","18 January 2009"," Much too dull, and much too drawn out
","I saw the trailer for ""Revolutionary Road"" while at the cinema for a different film, and I must stress that, the trailer alone had me blown away -- the potential of the story, the cast, even the beautiful Nina Simone piece in the background. Unfortunately the film did not live up to that beautifully crafted trailer but instead left me disappointed and empty.<br/><br/>Let me say, though, that the cast was so remarkable, and of course Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have an excellent and believable chemistry. Winslet delivers a wonderful performance, as did DiCaprio, although I must admit her performance overshadowed his by a long shot. Although I felt that DiCaprio was superb in his more intense scenes, other times when he was just playing a ""normal guy"" he was rather dull and almost corny. I felt that he didn't know how to act like a ""guy from the 50s"", and was left torn between two directions.<br/><br/>Secondly, I felt that the film was much too drawn out, and often during scenes it felt repetitious. There was nothing new or interesting between long periods of time, in terms of -- well -- everything. The dialog was the same, the character's reactions to each other were the same, even the settings and scenery never changed. When there's nothing interesting, I don't understand how as the audience we should be -- well -- interested.<br/><br/>I give this film a 5/10 for a great cast and fine acting. But otherwise, I did not enjoy it. Although there was substance, it just wasn't enough. It was much too dull, and much too drawn out."

","OK, I agree with most of the glowing comments about performance and filming. However, this is a film that never thinks beyond the most precious needs and desires of the white middle-class (self-fulfillment, anti-consumerism, etc.). The Wheelers are utterly self-absorbed, narcissistic people--whom the film wants us to sympathize with. The film's themes are commonplace: youth's lost dreams, women didn't have it great, conformity is not good, the Fifties were stultifying, consumerism kills the soul, etc. BUT ... this was an extremely exciting decade from another perspective. This decade saw the beginning of the modern Civil Rights Movement! (As I remember, there was not one minority featured in the film, not one.) Very interesting things were happening in the labor unions during this period as well. The Wheelers (and the film itself) really had an alternative to its narrow critique: looking beyond the confines of white suburbia, the woes of mid-level corporate management, and feminist critiques. The film should have included the social and political context of the 1950s--African Americans and the working class fighting for their rights. That would have been a more devastating critique of the Wheeler's life-style, and would have made it a much more powerful movie."
"yeah_baby_5","10","4","8","8 February 2009"," Very good and teaches us a little something
","I enjoy films that have a hidden lesson. American Beauty had one and so does Sam Mendes' new film Revolutionary Road. This is a very different type of film starring the two main cast members of Titanic. However, this is not a film about Jack and Rose from Titanic and if anything is the complete opposite type of storyline compared to Titanic. The film has a similar type of storyline to American Beauty, only this time it occurs in the 1950s. Based on history classes I have taken in the past, Revolutionary Road's portrayal of life in the 1950s is almost a dead-on match from what I learned. There is the stay at home mother with the working father, where the father is in charge of the household and everyone in it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Wheeler was interesting and most certainly takes a different approach compared to other films he has done. Kate Winslet's portrayal of April was excellent was definitely worthy of the Golden Globe she received. Michael Shannon's acting was terrific and there is definitely some competition for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. As a male this is not normally the type of movie I would see since I generally watch action films and comedies, however any male can learn a lesson from Revolutionary Road when the film is over. Also if you enjoy films by Sam Mendes you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Marital conflict is not a fashionable subject for movies nowadays - maybe it's because the old-fashioned subject of marriage is not that fashionable itself - but this story touches in every respect, there are really original ideas about intimacy, about how many things are to be abandoned in the service of a marriage, about whether the abandonment is tragic or not. Frank's rage, frustration and aggressiveness are interestingly countered by April's stillness and coldness, so that every single argue/fight hits the mark, emotionally speaking. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio are both really outstanding, they deliver confident performances dominating the film and creating at the same time a huge emotional impact (there's everything, impassivity, fear, anger, cries). This flick must intentionally impress the audience, it's certainly a sad story with a sad ending but perfectly written and acted."

","I saw this movie and thought it was really very good. Im surprised at the lack of Oscar hype, it is after all exactly the sort of film that gets that kind of attention and it doesn't have the usual excuse of not coming out in Oscar month (do we all really have the memory of a goldfish?).<br/><br/>I'm a firm believer in the human aspect of cinema and ""keeping it real"" and this really matches that criteria with people kept in a rut unable or unwilling to fulfill their dreams, hurting each other and themselves and left hating each other or coldly indifferent. This left an engaging thought provoking watch, which from the Oscar nominations I have seen for best picture, the Oscars this year have been lacking in.<br/><br/>Apparently the novel, by Yates, is near word for word the same as the film. The rest of his novels are along the same lines and i hope that some of these may be developed as well into film. At school i am studying The Great Gatsby and a Streetcar named desire which are written and based around the sameish time and these are a similar sort of domestic tragedies that are also fascinating.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","What an amazing film. First, I have to day that Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are probably the best actors of their generation. Their performances are deep, emotional and outstanding as they're able to portray this troubled couple and make you feel sorry for them. The way the different emotions cross their faces in a matter of seconds is truly award-winning. What takes you to that level of anger and boredom? What makes you think that moving from the place that is making your life miserable is going to change it? I don't know, but this is what Frank and April thought. They thought that by leaving to another country their problems and worries would fade away, but the truth is, they would just follow them. They never dare face the truth. As much as dysfunctional they were, there were other ways, easy and harmless, to deal with this situation. What started out well turned into a fantasy and a routine that drove each other crazy. And it seemed that April had an idea to make things right again, and it even touched Frank's heart, but their stubbornness and the great idea of leaving only made things worse. The sad thing about it is that someone whose mind what as troubled as their marriage was, was more intelligent to see the real thing. Once they were confronted, things got out of control. I don't know what drives a marriage to end up hurting each other the way they did. How they never thought of any word before saying it. I think that April married Frank as an escape of her failed career. Too bad it was too late for forgiveness. I haven't read the book, but the movie was fantastic. The score might be a little repetitive but it fits the story perfectly and you just can't forget the great supporting cast."
"scrabbarista","9","5","11","30 December 2008"," A Second Exceptional Family Drama from Mendes
","Sam Mendes should be pre-emptively awarded a Best Director nomination in any year he releases a film. Through four movies, he's the only director working today who has yet to make a movie that's less than a minor classic, though his dark sensibility admittedly makes his films difficult to watch repeatedly.<br/><br/>In Revolutionary Road, Di Caprio and Winslet give believable, fully human performances in the challenging roles of Frank and April Wheeler, a young couple struggling with their own lack of belief in the life they've chosen. The film shows beautifully, and often painfully, how every moment in life offers a crucial choice, and how the results of these choices can surprise and even devastate. The most impressive thing about RR is the weight and consequence imbued in the life of an ""average, suburban American family"" - the same weight each of us feels in our own lives. Di Caprio and Winslet deserve at least as much credit as Mendes for this, and all three are worthy of Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>From an artistic perspective, I would rank this as Mendes' ""worst"" movie, but the faults in the editing and script are so minor that were this any other director, they might not even be noticeable. All told, Revolutionary Road is a unique addition to the oeuvre of a young and already canonical director."
"chicagopoetry","9","5","11","27 December 2008"," A Modern Streetcar Named Desire
","Revolutionary Road is about as good as family drama gets. Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have wonderful chemistry, although in this case their chemistry is the formula to nitro glycerin. Seven Pounds attempted to bring us to tears with multiple manipulative tricks, but Revolutionary Road actually does it with a simple story, well acted, about a troubled marriage. The theme is the paths we take, why we choose them, and the chances we are given, whether we recognize them or not. This is a pure emotional roller coaster ride, as classic as A Streetcar Named Desire or Goodbye Columbus. Too bad it's not released yet, because DiCaprio certainly would be among Sean Penn and Frank Langella in the running for Best Actor Oscar, and Winslet would have taken Best Actress. The part of the lunatic neighbor was a bit overacted, which is the one and only reason I knocked a point off the perfect ten this movie otherwise deserves."
"Jennifer-Coen","10","5","11","26 December 2008"," A wonderful achievement.
","I was completely blown away at how brilliant the film turned out to be. It's my kind of film and I knew that I'd enjoy it, but it was more than just an enjoyment. It was a special cinematic experience that only a handful of films have provided for me. The very beginning started off the brilliance. The music, how April and Frank's first meeting at the party blended into Frank watching April in the play, the haunting argument during the ride home. The direction was fantastic. I love the fact that Mendes chose to shoot the film in sequence because I could just feel the characters' frustration growing and growing, everything getting worse and worse. The way Frank and April literally transformed in front of my eyes was perfect.<br/><br/>Speaking of Frank and April, DiCaprio and Winslet nailed the characters without any faltering or faults. Both of them were phenomenal. The facial expressions, the gestures and the line delivery were all spot on. DiCaprio was excellent - the amount of range that he showed, even just with his face, throughout the entire film was wonderful. He grasped the character perfectly and nailed every scene. One of his best scenes was when he finds the syringe in the bathroom and the entire argument that follows is perfect. He shines as Frank Wheeler - I saw expressions on his face that I've never seen before. He balanced the subtle moments, the frustration, the powerful yelling, and at times he didn't even have to speak. His eyes are so expressive. Leo truly unleashed Frank, layer by layer. It was so amazing to watch him bring this character to life perfectly.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is just breathtaking. I thought she was naturally subtle and haunting from beginning to end - when April proposes the idea of going to Paris for the first time, I could just feel her nearly bursting with excitement. This was a possibility of a lifetime for her, she actually was certain that she and Frank would start living again and then the whole chance smashes to pieces. I thought Kate was consistent throughout the film, and she shines even more in the second half which really just haunted me. Winslet shows layers of herself that I've never seen before, expressions on her face that I haven't seen before. She gave me the chills at times, for instance when April runs into the forest after the argument with Frank and we just see her lurking around in the dark from Frank's perspective. The transition into the next morning when she fights to hold her emotions back when she's making breakfast for Frank before he heads off to work was perfect. The scene that probably got to me the most was April's phone call to Milly just before the abortion, when she doesn't want her kids to come to the phone. She wants them to stay outside and continue playing happily, and then struggling to say 'I love them'. Winslet grasps the difficulty of trying so hard to mutter those words and I could feel her frustration. Extraordinary performance.<br/><br/>The two of them together was even more powerful. Their chemistry was so smooth and perfect. Their interactions during the arguments were quite bone chilling and haunting. <br/><br/>Michael Shannon also wowed the hell out of me. It's such an intriguing performance and when he's on screen, you can't take your eyes of him. He commands your attention and he was haunting. All of this just in, what, 2 scenes? His line delivery gave me the chills. Kathy Bates didn't have that much to do, but she was great and she fit the cheery yet worried as hell Mrs. Givings. David Harbour was pretty good as Shep and Kathryn Hann was solid.<br/><br/>The screenplay was wonderful but a few of the lines were kind of forced in a way. The actors handled those lines well though. Technically the film is beautiful. Thomas Newman never disappoints and he sure as hell didn't here. What a stunning score. The best track I think was during the whole forest scene, and when Frank is frantically waiting inside for April at night. Gorgeous cinematography as well, and Deakins also never disappoints.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone. It's such an astonishing cinematic experience."

"John_Truby","5","2","3","7 January 2010"," Beating a dead horse
","Revolutionary Road is one of those rare ambitious dramas Hollywood puts out during Oscar season to make it look like they care about people older than a teenager. They don't. If you want to see top drama, you have to go to American television, respected around the world for its excellence. I was recently in Paris to teach the 22 Step Great Screen writing Class, and all the press wanted to talk about - print, radio and television - was the amazing writing on American TV dramas like Mad Men, The Wire, and Lost.<br/><br/>Everyone had high hopes for Revolutionary Road, since it's based on a much-loved novel of the 50s by Richard Yates. But that just makes the film all the more depressing. And that's because the writing is shockingly deficient. This film is actually a fascinating case study for screenwriters and directors, especially when you compare it to American Beauty. Both films were directed by Sam Mendes. Both explore the sterility of marriage in the suburbs. But one is a modern classic while the other is a sincere but undeniable failure.<br/><br/>What's the difference? The script of course. These two films are yet another proof that the screenwriter, not the director, is the true author of the film. And when a film fails, we have to go to the script to find the causes.<br/><br/>Like American Beauty, Revolutionary Road bases its story on as ambitious a theme as a modern-day writer can take on: how do you live a meaningful life in middle-class suburban America? Suburbia promises that we're all the king or queen of own castle. But once you are living comfortably in that castle, are you really free? Is that the true recipe for a good and satisfying life? Revolutionary Road takes on that vast and complex theme full bore, and what power it has comes from a theme that challenges people where they live, and how they live, like no other theme can. It forces the audience to take a lifetime perspective on their own lives, and very few films or TV shows do that.<br/><br/>But an ambitious theme is also much harder to pull off. And Revolutionary Road's technique, its artistry, is simply not up to the task. In fact the film is so alienating in its techniques that it loses even those in the audience who really want it to succeed. Plot is virtually non-existent; it hits the same beat in almost every scene (to be fair, some of that blame must go to the novelist). This forces the dialogue to carry the story, something dialogue cannot do.<br/><br/>As a result, the dialogue in almost every scene is overtly thematic, on-the-nose and on the same subject: live your passion, escape your dull suburban life. We thought we were special, we want a better future, but we find we're like everyone else.<br/><br/>Okay, I get it. Mendes has said, ""It might be more difficult to distance yourself from the opinions of the writer and the filmmaker"" if the film is set in the present, whereas ""you never feel lectured to or instructed when you're watching a period film."" Not so. This shows a glaring lack of understanding of what makes great dramatic writing.<br/><br/>With such a lack of technical artistry in the storytelling, the question of course becomes why. As always the reasons become clear when we explore the story's structure, and especially when we apply the seven major structure steps. It turns out that the battle scene - the biggest and final conflict between the hero and the opponent - which usually comes at the climax of the story, comes here at the beginning. In the opening scene the two leads meet in a bar. Each is full of promise. In the third scene, the two characters, now married for many years, have a vicious fight in which they lay out every argument the story will express. In effect, the story is over in the third scene! In a good battle scene at the end of the story, the writer can and should make the competing values of the characters explicit. This is where the theme first pops in the mind of the audience. And it pops with power because until then it has been woven below the surface through the story structure. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how to express a theme powerfully, through a moral argument of action. In other words, by what the characters do in the story. Instead of sending a message, you move and inspire an audience from their core.<br/><br/>The seven steps are what make thematic power possible, because they are the way a good story develops organically. When you ignore the natural unfolding of these steps, as for example when you push the battle scene to the front, the thematic elements are flashed in big neon letters. The audience backs off. And the story has nowhere to go. A story is like a shark; it always has to be moving. When it stops, it dies.<br/><br/>Another way to see Revolutionary Road's failure is to see it as the drama of inaction. April's solution to her and Frank's suburban paralysis is to say to her husband: maybe you could go to Paris and find yourself. Sounds good, but it doesn't mean anything. I'm not arguing that this attempt to find meaning isn't real. Our lives are full of things we might have done, along with solutions we desperately construct that are as flimsy as tissue paper. But that doesn't make for good drama.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is a great example in story terms of beating a dead horse. I feel bad for the horse, but I wish I could have stopped watching a long time ago."

She has them herself.<br/><br/>The couple have 2 kids; however, they are hardly in the movie. That didn't make sense. I know at one point the kids where supposed to be gone somewhere, but the movie never said. And at other times, like when the couple would be eating dinner, the kids were missing.

","""Revolutionary Road"" is a not-very-good recapitulation of a certain mind-set about the 1950's previously explored by ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" ""Organization Man"" and ""Little Boxes Made of Ticky- Tacky."" Sam Mendes has been down this road before (American Beauty) and done it better. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is already past his prime as a high voltage star, and, although she was praised for her role in this movie, Kate Winslet is no longer an appropriate co-star for DiCaprio. She's a far better actor and their scenes together give off the dampest of sparks.<br/><br/>It's the premise of this movie that fails to convince me. Despite the critics, most adults in the 1950's were seeking high paying jobs (which did not bore them to death) and most couples wanted a home in the suburbs to raise their kids. True, the system was hardest on the wives. Many of them were college educated and struggled with the wifely routine that society imposed on them. The Feminist movement had not yet caught fire. When I was a young adult in the 1950's, college educated women stayed home to raise the kids but they also found an outlet in community affairs and other worthwhile activities. Most of the women I knew returned successfully to the work force when the kids were old enough. <br/><br/>It's not clear whether Winslet's character has been to college -- only that she has ambitions, first, to be an actress and, second, to quit the Connecticut suburbs for Paris. DiCaprio's ""organization man"" is also drawn to the Paris idea but two developments interfere. First, the wife becomes pregnant with their third child, and second, the husband is offered a substantial promotion.<br/><br/>The rest of the story is melodramatic and will not be summarized here. Kate Winslet has proved her mettle as an actor, and she does the best she can with a weak role. DiCaprio also does the best he can (which is not very much) with his role. And Mendes should have stood in bed. I awarded this a 4 only because of Winslet. She IS an amazing actress. Frankly, the worst thing about Revolutionary Road is that it was completely boring."
"EUyeshima","6","2","3","6 July 2009"," Desultory Look at Eisenhower-Era Marital Discord Showcases Sharp Work from Winslet and Shannon
","It took 47 years to adapt for the screen Richard Yates' celebrated novel of the struggles that a young suburban couple faces living within the constraints of Eisenhower-era conformity. Even now, the resulting 2008 film, as meticulously directed by Sam Mendes, feels so internally driven that the story may be better suited for the stage or even TV. In fact, it often feels a bit like an extended episode of the 1950's-set AMC series, ""Mad Men"", although the arguments between the protagonists bring to mind similarly visceral set pieces from Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Adapted by screenwriter Justin Haythe (""The Clearing""), the plot focuses on Frank and April Wheeler, an attractive couple settled in a Connecticut suburb with two young children and seven years into a dysfunctional marriage. The time is 1955 well before professional counseling and divorce were viable options. The one attribute that the couple shares is the disillusionment each experiences with their daily lives, a far cry from the worldly aspirations they had when they first met at a Manhattan cocktail party.<br/><br/>Initially a frustrated actress, April is a creative person who is suffocating from her suburban domestic duties, while Frank is an even more aimless dreamer who hates his sales job at an IBM-like company. The story turns on April's sudden idea to move the family to Paris, where she plans to work as a government agency secretary while Frank figures out what he wants to do. He tentatively agrees, but it is her mounting desperation to hold onto her dream of living a bohemian life abroad that points to their emotional unraveling. Extramarital affairs prove to be the least of their problems, as each becomes entrenched in a deepening inability to empathize with or support the another. Communication between them turns into mutual provocations of emotional abuse. Mendes returns to familiar territory here, as there are vestiges of his debut film, ""American Beauty"", in the often uncomfortable-to-watch marital discord he etches here. However, the tone is even more desultory this time with nary a trace of black humor to provide a counterbalance. All the period touches feel authentic with Roger Deakins' cinematography and Kristi Zea's production design contributing to an evocative feel that doesn't feel overly contrived. Thomas Newman's haunting score is another asset that enhances the dramatic elements.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that provides a showcase for its principal actors. As April, Kate Winslet (Mendes' wife) manages to make a fundamentally selfish character sympathetic by throwing herself fearlessly and honestly into the role. Her former ""Titanic"" co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio has proved to be an arresting actor in ""The Departed"", but his baby face and youthful demeanor really seem at odds with Frank's weakening emotional state and diminishing sense of self-worth. He comes to life during the many confrontation scenes, but he can't match Winslet's affinity with the heavy material. The supporting cast is solid - Kathy Bates (another ""Titanic"" veteran) as unctuous real estate agent Helen Givings, Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers' chipper neighbor Milly, David Harbour as her deceptively contemplative husband Shep, Zoe Kazan as Frank's gullible secretary, and in just two sharply rendered scenes, Michael Shannon makes Helen's mentally ill son a powerfully uncomfortable harbinger for the tragedy to follow. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a mostly interesting audio commentary track from Mendes and Haythe, five deleted scenes, and principal cast and crew members contributing to an adequate half-hour making-of featurette, ""Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road""."

Now, I regret adding it to my list.<br/><br/>I'm going to start of by saying that DiCaprio and Winslet are terrific actors with a lot of potential and talent. Unfortunately, they didn't show this with this film. Every or most scenes they had together were nothing but screaming matches that made me cringe. The most upsetting part was that neither character had no character development. None whatsoever. Winslet as a housewife...boring. DiCaprio as a man who provides for his family with a job he loathes...boring. The screenplay could have easily made these typical cookie cutter roles into something new and refreshing. But they didn't.<br/><br/>Adding Kathy Bates to the film didn't do much either (and I think she's a great actress too). Was she there to turn the viewers' attention away from the main characters? If so, it was pointless as her being there. Michael Shannon plays one of the most boring and typical insane character I have ever seen. Yet another pointless character to distract the viewers. But somehow, he got an Oscar nomination for it (which should have went to Ralph Fiennes in ""The Duchess"", IMO).<br/><br/>I gave this film 2 stars instead of one because I think Sam Mendes did a good job with directing. The art direction was good as well."
"blackburnj-1","6","2","3","20 February 2009"," Well acted, but hollow and derivative
","Sam Mendes's first two films (""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"") are two of the great American movies of the last ten years or so. The films, which examine, with great flair, the hollowness of the American Dream (though the latter has this in the background), have a new companion piece in the form of ""Revolutionary Road"". However, although Mendes is on familiar territory here, he doesn't manage to get anywhere close to the power of those films.<br/><br/>The film's story is familiar. 1950s suburban Americana turns into a living hell for a young bohemian couple. In short, it is something like an extended episode of ""Mad Men"". However, the driving idea behind the film is that this couple is trying to escape from their hell, rediscover the romance of their lives and flee to Paris. It is no coincidence then that Mendes has decided to reunite Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since they played the star crossed lovers in Titanic who embodied romance and the American dream.<br/><br/>The thing is that the casting is the most interesting thing in the film and that wears off rather quickly. The same old tired clichés are rolled out. The yearning neighbourly lust, the affair with the secretary and so on have all been seen before and nothing new is added. A few years back, Todd Haynes provided a far more effective and interesting piece in the form of ""Far From Heaven"" which examined the great prejudices and falsehoods that the fifties had wrapped up in them.<br/><br/>There are plus points. Winslet is fantastic, and should have been nominated for this rather than for ""The Reader"". DiCaprio is not as good as he has been, but Michael Shannon delivers a fantastic turn in the rather stereotypical role of the crazy man who sees past the charade. It is also stylishly shot (yet more excellent work from cameraman Roger Deakins) and looks very good.<br/><br/>However, it simply lacks a crucial element. It is very difficult to care for these characters. They always remain distant. Perhaps that is intended, but if so it is an error, because as the story unfurls in a predictable manner it becomes harder and harder to engage with them."

But there are a couple of arguments/fights that Kate and Leo have that are breath taking.

","You got to hand it to the two leads of this film. They may be better known for the love story Titantic, but this is a counter-history version, like as if what would have happened if they had survived the wreck but their relationship went sour.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is little to fault in this film. The acting is superb, and Kate Winslet is for me one of the finest actresses anywhere. There is little to fault her with this performance, I think it's even better than when she won the Oscar for The Reader (another dark film I very much enjoyed). Leo DiCaprio is also sublime here, and the pair on-screen are at the top of their game.<br/><br/>What we have is a couple who on paper are living an idyllic life. Based in the 1950's, the picture perfect couple live in a white picket fence dreamy suburban area whilst the husband works in a steady job where he is going places, and the kids are fine etc. Yet underneath it all the couple are deeply unsatisfied. The name of the film is really an ironic statement (joke?), and is the name of the road they live on.<br/><br/>A far-fetched & extravagant proposal by the wife to her husband to dump their current set-up for a fantasy life in Paris sets up the destructive trail as the couple's relationship disintegrates. Neither side is perfect or wholesome, and it's uncomfortable but disturbingly immersive watch to see how things pan out.<br/><br/>It's quite a cynical outlook on the reality of middle America, but the same story can be played out almost anywhere.<br/><br/>You have to hand it to the director who has taken the whole ""American Beauty"" idea (again) and transposed it all with another tale that peaks between the curtains of surburbia. The direction is great, the settings are all perfectly captured and the actors all fit the bill.<br/><br/>The only issue is the discomforting nature of it, which explains for its lack of success at the box office. It does drag at times, but it's not an action film. There is little if any humour and that makes it often even more difficult to get through. It's worth the effort though to give it the time it deserves.<br/><br/>It's a good stage play on screen, and from early on you know it will all end in some tragic way. What way? Well, I'd recommend that you watch it. Not one to watch on Valentine's Day with a partner but one to watch out for nevertheless."

","This movie had been on my watchlist for quite a while and I only watched it because it was about to leave Netflix, and I'm sure glad I did.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give outstanding performances in this movie about a couple who are not satisfied with their lives, and they take it out on each other. Then, a plan to change their lives dramatically fixes everything- just the promise of a new start in a new place is enough to take them back in time to a period where they truly loved each other. They had all the hope and dreams ahead of them that they could dream of and they were so excited.
I thought the acting was excellent, not only from the two leads, but by Michael Shannon, who was a strange, yet clear-eyed character.
Finally, I'm not a musician at all, but I thought the three-note piano piece that is played many times in the film is outstanding- it can be haunting, exhilarating, and hopeful and, in my opinion, is an understated but crucial part of the film."

However the plot and dialogue itself deserve a standing ovation. The story is about Frank and April Wheeler, a suburban couple with two kids who live the stereotypical suburban family life. However neither Frank or April are content with the lives they lead, and they both know this, and it shows displayed through a very toxic relationship shared between the two. Although one day, April goes to Frank chanting of the impossible... LIVING THE LIFE THEY WANT TO, discarding the norms society has set in place for them.

"lovaszi-peter","7","1","1","23 June 2018"," Abused, psichologically
","An outstanding drama demonstrating an awfully common problem of our society, which often isn't being recognised by the suffering party.
The drama has 3 main characters - April (Kate Winslet) the housewife, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), the main character and will talk about the third one later.<br/><br/>If you experience anything what you've seen in the movie, you are psychologically abused and should see someone specialised immediately.
Frank personalises the perfect abusive husband who knows all the trick how he can terrorise April without ever hurting her physically. But she doesn't give up, tries to change their life entirely, Frank gives the hope, agrees with April, but when he has to do action, he finds excuses every time. And again and again so he can let April down.
Well, this is not the first one of its subject. The third main character is John (Michael Shannon), who says out loudly the truth and is intelligent enough to analyse the main characters psychologically - ironically he is considered psychopath for doing it so in this 1950's society.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good movie representing important values, but not an easy watch. You might get confused about April's personality and behaviour, which demonstrates how much she suffers due to the abuse she has to take."

Some people are just more bohemian and flighty by nature. When these people try to mold themselves into what they think society wants them to be - it can result in disaster for all involved.

He's bored going into NYC for office work and has an afternoon fling with younger worker Maureen Grube (Zoe Kazan) on his 30th birthday. Their neighbor friends Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) are just as unhappy.

It is an unhappy watch done in the most expert way. It is seriously good work but it does make me sad. The other problem is that the kids are almost extras in this film.

"ThomasDrufke","7","1","1","23 June 2015"," It Takes Real Guts to See the Hopelessness
","We all know the pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic proved to be one of the most beloved romances in all of cinema, but if you are expecting more of the same, I would advise against watching Revolutionary Road. But the reality is, the film is very well made, and very telling of how the suburban 50's life might have been back in the day. But much like some other Oscar bait movies, Revolutionary Road is a film you definitely have to be in the right mood to enjoy, and is likely a film you wont ever want to watch again.<br/><br/>The film begins with the two meeting in a clichéd bar setting, but we really didn't even need that. Their relationship and history with each other is easily bought into. The two have simply some of the best chemistry between love interests we have ever had in cinema, whether it be a pleasant scene, or an overly dramatic one. The film does a good job of making you feel for the couple and their struggle to continue their marriage and raise their kids while also going through difficulties with DiCaprio's job. Both characters flaws are represented and in a way that doesn't necessarily make either more likable than the other. I think it's a tribute to both of these brilliant actors that they can make each and every one of the dramatic scenes (there's a ton) feel real and natural. The film flows in a way that you know where the characters are probably heading, you just don't want to believe it just yet.<br/><br/>The film centers on Frank's (Dicaprio) inability to want to try something new and his fear of failing. Failure never ruins someone, it's being afraid to fail that leads to their downfall. I thought that was well represented throughout the film. It's worth mentioning Michael Shannon's brief but important role in the film, and the impact that his character has on the rest of the film. To me, he served as the speaker of the audience's thoughts and opinions on these shells of human beings, for the most part. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the film enough to be noticeable, but there is an overwhelming amount of darkness and sadness that is pulled from the film. Like I said, it's a very good film, but it's just extremely difficult to watch.<br/><br/>+Both actors chemistry <br/><br/>+Beautiful to look at <br/><br/>+Look inside the 50's<br/><br/>-Sooooo dark and depressing <br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Revolutionary Road depicts the story of a 1950's married couple who, by all appearances are the ideal couple. However there are underlying problems in the relationship. Intriguing are the routine lives they all lived, in a Stepford Wives sort of way; like when Frank Wheeler's waiting for the train with what looks like 100's of his clones. His wife April is the typical 50's housewife. She reminisces of the time she and Frank met and how much she loved him and how she wanted that back. At this point things are so routine she desires a change or to feel alive again. Frank sleeps with a secretary in an attempt to also feel alive. April tries to liven things up by suggesting that they move to France; Frank once told her how people are more lively there. She talks about working and while Frank studies. They tell their friends about their plans, but they don't understand why they would want to move. Oddly enough the only one who is supportive, is John Givings (son of Helen, the Realtor who sold the Wheeler's their home), who was released from a mental hospital. While packing, April tells Frank she's ten weeks pregnant and that she has two more weeks to take care of it. Shortly thereafter he sees an apparatus used for abortions in their bathroom closet and confronts her about it. She advises him it's the best thing they could do with the trip nearing and for saving money, but he's against it. Frank is then offered a promotion but turns it down then later accepts it causing things to unravel. April realizes she is stuck in this fast track to nowhere and ends up sleeping with the neighbor Shep Campbell. Her and Frank fight and she tells him she hates him, he confesses about the other woman, but April is numb she doesn't care; she doesn't confess about Shep. Frank cannot believe his wife isn't happy with all they have and say the whole France thing was a childish idea to begin with. The argument escalates and he tells her he wishes she had gotten an abortion. She's devastated and runs into the woods with Frank following, but she wants to be alone to think. He drinks himself to sleep and when he awakens, she's cooking breakfast, looking as lovely as ever and being very pleasant, Frank is taken back by this, but is very pleased. She asks about his work and he smiles. You can see by his expression that he's so happy that she's interested in his work and illustrates, on a napkin, how a this particular piece of equipment works. When she says she's not sure she sees what he means, he looks disappointed, but perks back up when she says she does in fact see. She boosts his ego even more by telling him he should keep doing what he's doing because he's ""obviously good at it"". Before he leaves, he tells her how pleasant their breakfast was and asks if she hates him; she tells him no and assures him she still loves him. As he walks toward his car, she stands, loyally, on the doorstep watching him; he turns, smiles and waves. She waves back and watches him leave. Upon returning to clean the dishes, she bursts into tears. It's as if she knows she can no longer pretend to be someone she is not and continue this charade. She calls a friend and asks if they could bring the children back in the evening. Then April goes upstairs and pulls the abortion apparatus out of her vanity drawer. She removes her shoes and skit and closes the bathroom door. We then see her descend the stairs, barefooted, take each step carefully. She walks to the living room window and stares out at the sunny day as if things seem clearer to her; then you see the blood dripping on the carpet. The camera widens and you see her blood stained skirt and then hear her on the phone asking for help. The next scene we see Shep show up at the hospital and Frank is already there; he is crying and distressed. He tells Shep what the Dr.'s have told him and then says ""she did this to herself""; meaning she hurt herself. Shep goes to get coffee but just cries to himself before returning with the coffee, but when he does, Frank is coming out of the OR with a look of shock; April died. Of course everyone on Revolutionary Road goes on with life as usual. The Wheeler's are mentioned from time to time, but no one really wants to talk about them. Ironically, Frank moved to the city with his children and found another job. When April was alive he wasn't going to leave and tried to convince her that their life was wonderful, but after the tragedy, that all changed and he ended up leaving anyway. This made me think of all the couples who were and probably still live this way. As dismal as this film is, it really makes you think about one's own life and whether it's truly fulfilling or just an emotionless routine. I highly recommend it as it flows nicely without boredom and the setting really takes you back in time. I especially loved the clothing; it was a time when men and women took pride in their appearance and always looked their best. There's just a few cuss words, but that's it, even the sex scenes are done tastefully. The acting was phenomenal; particularly Kate Winslet's. I loved Michael Shannon's role as John, Leonardo DiCaprio's role wasn't as intriguing, but that doesn't take away from his performance; he's great in all he does."

","In this film Winslet and Dicaprio are at the top of their games. Their feelings toward each other are complex and deranged.

They simply put the bitterness they feel for each other in the back of their mind thinking it will go away and it may have. But when one key event takes place in the movie their bitterness evolves into hatred. Instead of continuing to fight the lie of what people think it means to lead a good life, which is what drew them to each other in the first place, they start to accept that lie causing them to drift apart in so many ways. Dicaprio and Winslet are one of the few that are able to so perfectly illustrate complexities such as this in relationships and marriage. Michael Shannon plays a very interesting role of a man considered crazy yet is the only one who agrees with the ""emptyness and hopelessness"" of their lives. He plays well but I feel as if something is missing from his character.<br/><br/>The directing of Sam Mendes is good in that the film brings you back in time. Yet the movie did not rise to what it could have been because of the writing. The film did not open up enough to fully capture the audience. The film stayed one gear and never seemed to switch off it. The couple of Winslet and Dicaprio seemed to be happy at one point but we barely get a glimpse of that.

Then one day, she suggests that they move to Paris as a means to rejuvenate their personal lives and their marriage.She plans to be the breadwinner by becoming a secretary of a major international organization,while he would have free time to find himself.In the end,their plans went for naught as April had an abortion and Frank admitted that he was having an affair which ultimately was detrimental to both themselves and their marriage.<br/><br/>Many people could relate to the couple's predicament due to the recession that the country is currently experiencing.The theme of the movie can be realistic as it can get.And the movie portrayed that very well.The acting was excellent as the two Titanic stars,Di Caprio and Winslet,were definitely honest in their portrayals as the Wheelers.Sam Mendes' direction was superb and excellent.Overall,this film is highly recommended and would definitely a great film for people these days."
"gashmanflirty","9","1","1","9 July 2011"," Cracking Performance from Winslet.
","I will be to the point in this review. Firstly i would admit approaching this film that i had hesitation in watching it because of the storyline. It came across as not having the ingredients to wow me. I felt that it might become slow and fade out. <br/><br/>However the result couldn't be further away. The performance from Kate Winslet i can without hesitation say was Oscar winning. It was immaculate. The way she portrayed the different emotions of the character was done fabulously well. Credit has to be given to the director, writer and screen play individual(s). I have seen Kate on a couple of times ( The Reader) leading to me resolve that she is a powerful female actor especially in the genre's of drama's & romantic/ sexually orientated deep movies. <br/><br/>Leonardo did OK/ good. The reason i rate him in this movie at a moderate level is because his character someone what infuriated me on occasions. There are times in the movie when situations escalate into unnecessary outburst & situations. This happened on a frequent occasions here if he had held back his tongue the result would of been better.<br/><br/>The soundtrack & its undertones i was really impressed by. It allowed the movie to flow and give continuity. This worked really well with the picture. The picture was of a really high quality. Looking at the budget of $35 for a drama such as this which would lead me to think that was a lot of money spent, it was obviously put to good use as nearly all the scenes were pretty much perfect.<br/><br/>The addition of the character of the character's Michael Shannnan definitely added that extra broadened input that elevated the movie. Moreover for him to feature in so little of the film (2 scenes ), and receive an Oscar nomination shows that his input was effective. In my opinion what he did for the film was to allow the character to become even more deeper about there emotions and expressing. FINALLY- the one bad thing about this movie was the ending. It should of ended with Di caprio running down the road (roll in the credits). The small extension i have to enthasise was absolutely unnecessary. <br/><br/>On the whole the story line and its fantasying points really created and excellent film to watch. It was definitely on about Di Caprio and Winselt. The storyline mentions the kids but don't really impact on the viewing. Its the relationship between the two main characters. Additionally in that respect the characters on the side like the house woman - 'Kathy Bates ' aide in the movies success but more over the whole theme and flowing of it. So yeh watch, give it a chance and you'll say yeh Oscar performance from Winslet and it was a good watch. Although not a fantastic it movie- it does not slow down in it's pace. And this avoided what i feared at the start."

","Having only just got round to watching this on DVD I am impressed. It's funny, thought provoking, emotional, intelligent and touching in all the right amounts and will ring true to many people who have been married for several years and are 'searching' for something else. Sam Mendes does a fantastic job of directing and the film is beautifully shot with amazing lighting in many of the scenes. In fact it's the setting itself that gives the intensity to much of the film with the house and Frank's job been oppressive to the point where the viewer is desperate for them both to escape. DiCaprio and Winslet are sublime and their chemistry sizzles on screen. The supporting cast are fabulous with Michael Shannon stealing his scenes as the son of Mrs Givings. All through this film you feel the quiet desperation of a couple who love and loathe each other at the same time and who don't know how to resolve either one of those things. The ending is as the rest of the film is, a look at life and how it has to continue under any circumstances and the final scene is a fitting tribute to marriages who make it and a nod to how they do that - in fact it made me smile."
"Eternality","8","1","1","11 April 2011"," Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives.
","Sam Mendes' journey as a film director comes full circle with his latest feature - Revolutionary Road, a motion picture that paints a bleak portrait of the American suburban life; a theme he has explored in his debut Oscar-winning film, American Beauty (1999) before embarking on a creative curve with acclaimed films such as the crime drama Road To Perdition (2002), and the biographical war picture Jarhead (2005). The British filmmaker returns to what he does best, weaving a story around drama-centric performances that open the window to human nature. <br/><br/>Since James Cameron's Titanic (1997), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, Gangs Of New York) and Kate Winslet (Little Children, The Reader) have embarked on envious, ambitious acting careers, establishing themselves as A-list actors whom are not afraid of tackling demanding dramatic roles. In Revolutionary Road, they are reunited as the Wheelers, lovers in a marriage which from a blissful start becomes increasingly strained along the way. <br/><br/>Their performances are a standout. Individually, they give commanding displays that are unfortunately not recognized by the Academy. But it is their performances collectively that is more impressive; their screen- friendly chemistry still remains after more than a decade. The star of the supporting cast is Michael Shannon, whose character John is a recently-discharged-mental-patient-who-obviously-has-not-recovered neighbor whose occasional awkward visits to the Wheelers together with his parents bring more grief and anger than jubilation. <br/><br/>There is a spectacular dramatic set-piece in the second half of the film that pits John against the Wheelers in a furious war of words. Although viewers are able to see it coming, the build-up to the film is extraordinary. Prior to John's visit, the Wheelers have a massively intense quarrel over marital issues which are interrupted by the visitors. Thus, the mood is set brilliantly for an inevitable bitter exchange of words of volcanic proportions. <br/><br/>For almost a decade, Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (Wall.E, Finding Nemo) has had a strong contribution towards the aural look of Mendes' pictures. In this film, the score is less distinct, but it is no less Mendes-resque. The last sequence casts a shadow of gloom and offers no glimmer of optimism, which means the film has the potential to end powerfully. However, it is not executed well enough to bring a satisfactory sense of closure to the lives of these people. <br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives. Well for most of us. While it may not showcase Mendes in top form, the film's intention is clear and it leaves us with a sour aftertaste: Are we too good for anybody? <br/><br/>GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blospot.com) All rights reserved."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","27 March 2011"," After the honeymoon . . .
","Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is a sad portrait of a couple collapsing under the burning question of what they really want from their relationship. I sat cautiously, waiting for his film to take the easy route, to find an easy answer to their problems. This was not to be. This is one of the most honest films I've ever seen about marriage and the emptiness that brings it apart.The story involves Frank and April (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) who meet at a party one night and discuss their future plans. She wants to be an actress and he doesn't have much idea what he wants.<br/><br/>They fall for each other and before you know it, they are Mr. and Mrs. Frank Wheeler, making plans for their new baby and buying a house at 115 Revolutionary Road, sold to them by nosy Mrs. Givings (Kathy Bates).This is the 1950s, the age of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, and Frank enters the workforce at a company that makes computer equipment. He isn't just the man in the gray flannel suit, he is one of many as we see hundreds of gray flannel suits charging through Grand Central Station on their way to work. April, meanwhile settles into the expected role of domesticity, fussing after the kids, making dinner and brooding over her station in life.<br/><br/>Frank and Alice are well aware that their destinies have been locked down into lives that are making them both miserable. Frank doesn't want to be a corporate stooge and April doesn't want to be chained to the stove. Neither wants to follow a long trail of misery into middle age so Alice comes up with a strange plan: They will pack up and move to Paris where she will work at the American consulate while he figures out what he wants to do with his life and puts it into motion. Basically, they will be switching roles.<br/><br/>Everyone tells the couple that they are daft but no one has the guts to break open the real reality to them. That is, until they meet John (Michael Shannon), Mrs. Givings' grown son who has just been released after spending some time in a mental hospital. The only thing really wrong with John is that he seems to have a knack for telling the unvarnished truth without sugar-coating. He forces April and Frank to take a good hard look at their situation and reconsider this goofy plan.<br/><br/>What follows is a case of marital meltdown. It is clear that the couple have been living an unfulfilled life and now that the Honeymoon is over they are desperate to figure out what to do about it. The problem is that real life keeps intruding and it only aids in pulling them further apart.<br/><br/>What comes of their marriage I will not say, except that it has the odd pace of real life. There is no phony construction of the plot here, nothing to manipulate or solve their problems easily. Their problems are are born from two separate, stubborn personalities. Their arguments are merciless and emotionally devastating. This is the first paring of DiCaprio and Winslet since Titanic and I am glad they didn't choose safe material. This film almost seems to suggest what would have happened to Jack and Rose once they got to America and started a life together.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Sam Mendes, who is an expert at films about characters who are stuck in a rut. He made Jarhead, about soldiers stuck in the Gulf War with nothing to do. And he made American Beauty which was another that exposes the undercurrents of suburban life. His best arena is focusing on characters desperate to escape their confinement. Revolutionary Road is his best film, a painful portrait of how the dance of dating and courtship can whirl a couple into a delusion that can't survive when real life sends their ideals crashing to the floor."
"Bolesroor","Null","1","1","22 February 2011"," Something's Missing
","""Revolutionary Road"" features Leo DiCaprio (who I like) and Kate Winslet (who I love) as Frank and April Wheeler, a married couple suffocating in the face of 50's suburban life.<br/><br/>Well, that's not exactly true... Frank seems only mildly frustrated by the limitations and obligations of being a husband, father and provider. It's April who is madly, fatally disgusted by domestic bliss, or even the implication. She's a poison pill who would ultimately rather die than settle for anything, at anytime.<br/><br/>Many other reviewers here have noted the stifling life of 1950's suburban America. Enough. The fifties were no worse than any other decade- they just happened to feature post-war prosperity and a repressive, hypocritical facade, the result of the emergence of television, which provided the first mirrored reflection of our own decaying values. If the fifties were so bad why hasn't domestic bliss been successful in the decades since? Has the divorce rate risen or dropped in the past half-century? The Wheeler's problems were deeper than the calendar date...<br/><br/>And therein lies the main problem with the movie. April is really the source of all the trouble here, and we never truly discover the root of her issues. She's introduced in the film as a slightly-emotional failed actress, but that doesn't explain her unending attempts at sabotaging everything she and Frank have achieved. Her pipe dream of moving to France is a double-edged sword: she's as disgusted when Frank agrees as she would be if he refused: there's no pleasing this woman.<br/><br/>April is handled brilliantly by the great Kate Winslet, but something is clearly missing in the character: what could make a person fight this hard against every natural instinct, every chance at happiness? It is never revealed. Her affair with her next-door neighbor comes too late in the film to provide any insight... if she had been cheating all along at least it might be possible to understand her irrational desire to move to Paris immediately. As it is we're left wondering not what's wrong with married life, children, and American values but what is wrong with April... and in this way the movie slips the track and never gets back on course.<br/><br/>The movie also loses points for the character of John Givings, played by Michael Shannon. He's the mentally-disturbed son of the Wheeler's real estate agent, and his nonsensical inclusion in not one but two significant scenes is undercut by his inexplicable fascination with the Wheeler's troubled marriage... It's like the Narrator stepping into the film to force a catharsis from our leads by confronting them with their own failings, and it stinks of Plot Device.<br/><br/>On the whole this is a good movie, photographed brilliantly by Roger Deakins, who uses haunting day-for-night effects and captures the beauty of suburban dusk. If Sam Mendes had solved April's character by revealing- or even implying- her bigger issues this might have been a classic. As it is the movie parallels the very lifestyle that chokes its protagonists: something's missing, and it's impossible to ignore.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"
"matrioshka","7","1","1","16 January 2011"," Uneven performances and dialogue, but solid overall
","The story is complex, emotional, multi-layered, and quite smart. Unfortunately it does not always translate in the acting, dialogue, or even the setting of the shot. I like all the actors in this movie, but sometimes Leo and Kate deliver their lines as two actors on the stage in a local production - just not convincing enough. The dialogue sometimes is too predictable, with flatness both in words and delivery. However, neither of these are so often as to ruin the movie. So overall the effect is still impressive. Michael Shannon is the only one deserving real praise - and rightly getting nominated for Oscar. A solid performer, but won't be remembered several years down the road, and is NOT the best of the decade."

","All I can say is that anyone giving this film a bad review, may be to young to understand the relationship on screen or fails to understand that the film portrays a very real insight into a lot of marriages. Anyone who has been married for a few years with kids or been through a divorce will relate to the Wheelers. Its a painful watch and an insight. I am sure that an awful lot of married couples came away from this film thinking ""its not just us"" fights and arguments are a consequence of any long term commitment, its how we deal with them that matters. A superb film and I found the two hours to be over too soon. What do we get at the very end when we see the old couple - a perfect conclusion! If you've been married that long its just easier to cope if you switch off."

","There is no denying the chemistry that exists between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. As a suburban married couple in Long Island in the 40's, you are immediately a voyeur in their life. The emotions in this film run the gamut. You have to give Winslet & DiCaprio credit for not going the total commercial route. The film is bathed in soft colors and the direction is top notch. That being said, this is not necessarily a happy story. Anyone who watched ""Titanic"" and feels they are going to replay that film will be disappointed. Ms. Winslet deserves the accolades she received for her portrayal, she is wonderful. Watch this film to see two A list actors work magic. Although it is depressing, it is worthwhile."

They're just great at tormenting each other as we see in two major screaming scenes.<br/><br/>The name April to me represents spring and the coming of flowers. April Wheeler as depicted by Kate Winslet is anything but that. She is a frustrated woman who thinks that by moving to Paris with Frank (DiCaprio) and their two children, they can start life anew. She defies the conventional times of the 1950s by saying that she will work in Paris while Frank gets the time to find himself. He loathes his job.<br/><br/>Complications derail their plan when Frank is offered a promotion and April becomes pregnant.<br/><br/>Something is terribly wrong when an emotionally disturbed man, the son of real estate person Kathy Bates, has the situation terribly correct. Is this a one flew over the cuckoo's nest syndrome? Bates looks like a typical elementary school principal of that period. She pretends to be friendly but inwardly harbors resentment towards the Wheelers.<br/><br/>The film is basically devoid of the true meaning of life. In fact, it seems to attack that very idea.<br/><br/>The fact remains that April Wheeler wouldn't attain happiness if she were in Paris, Shangri La or on the beach in Honolulu.<br/><br/>Remember when Bogie said to Bergman in Casablanca, ""We always had Paris?""

","Revolutionary Road a movie about A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children. Directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), this is an all drama movie that reflects the emptiness that some people have for not fulfilling their dreams in life and the desperate measures that it may provoke. The story is interesting, the plot is very well developed, it is very good set on the 50's era. It has a slow paced rhythm, you have to focus and have patience or you'll get bored. The cast is very good. In the leading roles we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Frank and April Wheeler respectively, both deliver very good performances specially Winslet, DiCaprio was a little overacted for my taste. Kathy Bates as Helen Givings gives us an excellent work and Michael Shannon as John Givings was so convincing that he earned himself an Academy award nomination."

","Frank: I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! April: It takes backbone to lead the life you want!<br/><br/>Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) works for the first time with his wife Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road, a heavy drama based on Richard Yates' novel. It also reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Winslet since 1997's Titanic.<br/><br/>Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) seem to live the perfect life with their two kids in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Frank has a job he doesn't like but is good at, while April put her acting dreams on hold to become a full-time housewife. But they feel trapped and unhappy and feel like there is a better life than what they have. Then April hatches the perfect plan: the Wheelers will start over in Paris, the only place she remembers her husband saying was worth returning to, where people felt most alive. No job awaits Frank there, in fact, he has no idea what he will do, but he will finally have the time to find out. April volunteers to support the family by applying for a good-paying secretarial job. They announce their plan to the world, but when they begin execution, complications ensue, values are tested, and the couple discovers so much more about each other that will forever change their future. <br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is intense, raw, painful and brutally honest. It has been called a humorless American Beauty, but it's so much more. It may be set in the '50s, but its message continues to speak to anyone in a relationship today. Technically, while the performances were terrific, it sometimes felt like the characters were mouthpieces on a tableau, as if in a play. But that itch aside, Revolutionary Road resonated with me, being in a relationship and having had the same thoughts as the characters. When April says, ""I saw a whole other future. I can't stop seeing it,"" you feel her desire and grief. You will also feel Frank's helplessness even in his volatile explosions. Even in their many conversations and yelling sprees, one might think that at least the couple communicates and are honest with each other. But in the end, there is a scene that at first confused me, but later on I realized its importance: how a couple lasts by showing how the other copes. It was a simple but powerful scene, perhaps depressing but real nonetheless."

"MOscarbradley","9","1","1","18 February 2009"," Where is the love ...
","Based on the novel by Richard Yates, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a bleak dissection of a marriage, circa 1955. It is also one of the best movies of the year, a tour-de-force for all concerned. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are April and Frank Wheeler who meet cute, marry and then regret it. They are an idealistic young couple with big ideas, (she aspires to be an actress), who settle for suburbia, the good life and a kind of genteel respectability. They dream of relocating to Paris but it's a pipe-dream from the start and it's April's idea. It is April who seems to be the volatile one, the unhappy one, though it is Frank who plays away. And, of course, they row; the row spectacularly to the point where blood could be drawn.<br/><br/>By now you may have guessed that Frank and April could be the younger versions of Albee's George and Martha, or going back further still, of Strinberg's Edgar and Alice, the only difference being that that they are still young enough to be still in love or, at least, in a form of love, romantic and unrealistic where every wound they inflict on each other is somehow made better by sex. How typical are April and Frank? I mean, how typical are they of their time and place? No-one seems to be happy; not their friends or neighbours, not the guys Frank works with in their dull, successful jobs in this decade of post-war prosperity. ""Revolutionary Road"" is, then, as much a critique of 1950's America, stunningly recreated in Kristi Zea's production design and Albert Wolsky's costumes, as it is a study of a disintegrating relationship.<br/><br/>Doubts, too, as to the suitability of DiCaprio and Winslet to handle such heavy-duty material are dispelled almost immediately. This is acting of the very highest order. Winslet's performance has already been showered with praise and prizes, (between this and ""The Reader"", this has definitely been her year), all thoroughly deserved. She must now rank among the finest actresses of her generation and among the best actresses currently working in international cinema. However, to my mind, Leonardo DiCaprio is even better and his failure to be nominated for the Oscar either speaks volumes as to the superiority of those who have been nominated, (and frankly, I think it is a better performance than Mickey Rourke's in ""The Wrestler"" and it looks like Rourke who will take home the prize), or the complete lack of insight on the part of the Academy who still look on DiCaprio as the boy pretender. He may have started his career as a young Turk, dipped a little in the middle with some dubious career choices, but now seems to have rediscovered his mettle. He just seems to get better with every movie and this is a career-best performance.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, without exception, are all terrific. Invidious, then, to single anyone out but mention must be made of Kathy Bates' real-estate agent, part pre-war dyed-in-the-wool, part post-war forward thinker. For too long Bates has been mired in caricature 'fat' parts so it is nice to see her finally get a role that requires some internal thought. Even better is Michael Shannon as her 'insane' son, let out for the odd afternoon from the institution where he has been receiving electric shock treatment. Like Randall P McMurphy his only crime seems to be that he disagrees with the status quo, (his mother describes him as 'an intellectual'), although his behavior, when invited around for dinner, does seem to contravene the rules of polite society when he attacks his hosts, (and is attacked in return). Shannon is an actor I am not familiar with but on the strength of this performance he is someone I shall be looking out for in the future.<br/><br/>If this, for the most part, extraordinary film does have a fault it lies not in the execution, which is superb, but in the content. No character endears themselves to us and at the heart of the film there is a coldness. What is conspicuously absent is any real feeling, other than a feeling of negativity and disdain. These are not people we would choose as friends or neigbours; to know them certainly isn't to love them and while their fate may be terrible, you tend to think that anything that happens to them is their own sorry fault."

","Sam Mendes, in an effective follow-up of sorts to American BEAUTY (I say follow-up because both films touch on the same subject matter), has created a film that is amazingly realistic and compelling, and examines life in Suburbia to the extent that most directors are afraid to go.<br/><br/>The acting by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is astounding and is reason enough to watch the film. It amazes me how neither of these performances was nominated for Lead Acting Oscars. DiCaprio portrays Frank Wheeler in a powerful yet laid-back manner, while Winslet as April Wheeler is simply stunning. By themselves, they are fantastic, but together they forge a combative and forceful on-screen relationship that is in no way comparable to the overly romantic one seen in 1997's TITANIC. The excellent acting is not only confined within the lead roles, as Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon do more than adequate jobs in their supporting roles. The latter was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Not much has been said by critics in terms of story/character development, but in my opinion, this is one of the most engrossing films I have seen for the Awards season. Likewise, not enough has been said about the score, which is effectively low-key with a hint of deep-set and ominous gloom; perfect for setting the overall mood of the film as it creates an uneasy atmosphere. The cinematography, camera-work, set design, and costume design were all remarkable, and the viewer would have felt engrossed in the 1960s atmosphere presented.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly captivating Motion Picture; one that should not be missed. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 166. Highly recommended."

But does that a good film make? <br/><br/>The story of the proverbial ""folks who live on the hill"", whose lives turn out to be much darker than any of their friends and neighbors would imagine, offered many opportunities for departure from past films and television shows. But this new Sam Mendes film does not take advantage of those opportunities and plunges instead down a path of self-destructive discontent that's too much of a predictable standard to feel revolutionary at all.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, this road is loaded with clichÃ©s about suburbia, the emptiness of middle-class existence, and the loss of dreams and individuality, all wrapped in the same smoke-booze-and-infidelity excesses as its more sophisticated television sibling.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio replays the same character we've come accustomed to seeing in his hands, all lava-like intensity and pain behind his child-like face. For my money, he gives an adequate but mostly unmodulated performance that is all tears ready to burst out of his eyes with every marital twist of fate. Weren't those mad men in the 1950's the ultimate experts at keeping it all in? Kate Winslet doesn't fare much better or much worse. But Michael Shannon, in a well-written part, gives the one performance that should be remembered at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Not the best from the director of the impeccable American Beauty. A 6.5 out of 10."
"gerrymcd","4","4","9","3 February 2009"," Dull Movie with Wooden characters
","I really wanted to like this film kate winslet is great in it but the movie just doesn't work as a film. Its characters are just not believable and the core of the movie is just so dull that nothing interesting happens. Just because actors make a good performance in a movie sure doesn't mean the movie is worth watching.<br/><br/>There's no doubt Di Caprio is a very versatile actor and a good actor like Winslet but the film spends far too long ith the same story thread that it just becomes dull.<br/><br/>The ""mental"" neighbour is a joke, its like a character they just added who could point out the mess and problems that Winslet and Di Caprios characters have. Its such a lazy, lame wooden character used to put some kinda ""realism"" into the movie that it just fails big time."
"pinknole05","10","4","9","24 December 2008"," Wow...that's all I can say
","Fantastic Picture! Several times throughout it I just could not believe the performances from Kate and Leo. Do not look at this movie merely as negative and depressing. To dismiss it as such would be to oversimplify to the Nth degree. What it is a brilliant work of art sculpted to perfection by everyone involved and I can not wait to watch it again. The raw emotions displayed in this movie just grip you from start to finish and you are engulfed by these people and their lives. When I heard about another pairing of Winslet and DiCaprio, I was wary to say the least. While I am a fan of both actors, I had grown up with the I Love Leo generation and did not think I could see past Titanic. Some might say that this is just Jack and Rose further down the line, but I respectfully disagree. You can tell that both of them have come so far in their careers and though I felt a little funny watching them together again, it quickly faded (even though Kathy Bates was in it too which I thought was funny). Please watch this movie with an open mind and heart and you will not be disappointed!"
"MrsRachel","8","3","6","15 February 2009"," Another fantastic and amazing movie of DiCaprio and Winslet.
","Revolutionary Road, it's an amazing movie, because of some facts: First we need to analyze the title ('Revolutionary Road'), I think there's no doubt that the title is perfect for the movie, because Frank and April's life is like a revolution, the ideas they've got aren't from 1950's people: dreaming about a different life, April wants to work and Frank doesn't, the abortion...things that aren't in line with the time.It's good to show that people had dreams and wanted to get them in these times.So it's positive. Next one of the best things in the movie is the different personalities of the characters, how they try to coexist with each other. Like April and Frank's personalities, they are opposites, this is why their lives end badly (remember April's death) and they cannot be happy (remember the way they treat their children), so they try to live in another reality, in a fictitious reality, which is not the real life, and they try to get their own dreams doing everything they can (like the abortion, to travel to Paris) but they can't, then is just all wrong, then the differences between them and the discussions appear. To combine and focus these types of personalities is a very difficult job, so I want to congratulate Sam Mendes who's an excellent director."
"dedoc1","8","3","6","8 February 2009"," Very depressing
","The most depressing movie I've ever seen. Represents a fusion of existentialism and Buddhism i.e. each of us is essentially alone, life is pain and suffering and life is meaningless and without purpose. Watching this film should be a requirement for anyone about to marry. I've also been told this movie will greatly benefit anyone going through the break-up of a relationship. No matter how much you are hurting, this movie will remind you that there's always someone in more pain than you are (hence makes you feel a little better) and that being single is a blessing - marriage is a curse which produces and maintains suffering.<br/><br/>This movie makes Kate Winslet's other movie ""The Reader"" seem like a light-hearted comedy in comparison. Thank goodness that everyone eventually dies as it appears to be the only way not to miserable.<br/><br/>Having said that, the acting is incredible and the movie portrays misery better than most."

","Director Sam Mendes does wonderful work. He takes his time and explores human emotions. And he did it very well with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Justin Haythe did a fine adaptation of the novel written by Richard Yates. The movie builds slowly as we come to know our two main characters. The disintegration of marriage is not a necessarily new topic. But here, there are some truths that are rarely expressed in movies.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is very good in this. He is becoming more mature with each new movie. I loved that he restrained his performance. it was somewhat muted, almost wooden and it works well with his character. it is so nice when actors trust our intelligence and know that we will get what they are going through without them having to ""show"" their emotions in every scene<br/><br/>Kate WInslet displays the fantastic acting gift that she has. She slowly comes apart. We see how she needs to get out of town and how suffocating it is for her. <br/><br/>The score plays subtly, yet powerfully underneath the scenes."

","Imagine if Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet character has survived ""Titanic"" and really made it alive to the newfoundland, America.

Oh, and the car love scene, also have one in ""Titanic"" but with a whole different atmosphere which increase the irony.<br/><br/>Di Caprio play a husband who have a boring yet well paid salesman job which he hate. Winslet play a housewife and a failed actress wannabe. Is this a trend lately in Hollywood? Same as ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" that life in US is a ""hopeless emptiness"" and people should move to the romantic Europe, Paris in this case to finally can ""live life"". And if you are forced to stay their big house, a small wood to have an afternoon walk, then what you can do is do a little extra to ""spice thing up"".<br/><br/>And hey, the director, Sam Mendes, who's work ""American Beauty"" is totally amazing, is Kate Winslet husband. And Winslet won another best actress from Golden Globe from this movie. Oh boy, Di Caprio must hate her a lot now, cause he miss winning any award both in the ""Titanic"" and this. But the truth is Winslet is amazing, her acting, expression and the sadness, agony in her eye really make us understand her character perfectly. And Di Caprio look like a boy not yet grown up, his acting is dull sometimes, and great in some scene. He's not that consistent, and I can't figure out in the dinner with boss scene, is his expression is mocking someone in his head, or thinking things over? In the 1950 Connecticut, apparently speaking out the truth although the horrible truth might distress the society, chasing dreams, running away from responsibility is consider insane, ands should be put in the asylum, for God shake. The property agent family with their ""crazy"" Math PHD son, and their next door couple is a nice touch, without them the movie won't be complete.<br/><br/>Adapted from a book by Richard Yates, and this is a story that will keep you pondering after the end. And wondering what is right or wrong? Maybe nothing is right or wrong, it's just the choices we made in life."
"harryandsally","3","3","6","19 January 2009"," missed the point
","This movie has missed the point. It has no faith in humanity or love. I wonder how Mendes feels about his marriage to Kate?? April Wheeler is a shallow character. Revolutionary Road has no more depth than a too-long play. The story has no meat and is not consistent. The only redeeming factor is Leonardo DiCaprio's outstanding performance--keep at it Leo--you are above and beyond the rest. The scene at the end with Leo and his kids really breaks your heart. At then end the plot ties back to the beginning with Kathy Bates' character talking about the new couple who has moved in to the Revolutionary Road house. But there is more to it than that, than just a replacement couple. So much could have been done with this story--more insight into the neighborhood, the house, the people. The lack of character development was a real problem with understanding and caring about April and Frank. There is more to life than this film shows."

","I am so sick of watching movie after movie bash suburban life as some sort of collecting bin for sellouts. Makes me want to wear an apron and pearls around the house just to be spiteful.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's penchant for choosing roles (and husbands who direct movies) that diminish the importance of doing what's right in life indicate am immaturity that will become more and more unattractive as her body stubbornly continues to age, leaving her brain behind. Selfish, unrealistic, and simplistic, her characters (and herself) seem so indulgent that I feel like I'm watching a 3 year old have a temper tantrum every time she's on screen. Kate, sweetie, growing up is actually incredibly freeing...you should try it.<br/><br/>The movie industry's obsession with mocking the American family unit, although quite transparent and cliché in movies of the last thirty years, has also unfortunately been quite effective. The nuclear family is under attack, along with the American dream. The Artistic Elite dance a jig at the realization that their incessant pounding in films is successfully ushering societal norms to their doom; rising divorce rates, out of wedlock births, and abortions continue to feed the Left's gleeful attacks on family values. Congratulations, Hollywood...the propaganda you've been pumping out for the last decades is coming to fruition, culminating with the sheeple's unquestioning adoration of tripe like ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Little Children"", to name only two.<br/><br/>The fact that one Hollywood couple (Mendes and Winslet) account for such a large majority of these types of films says so much about what I assume goes on behind closed doors in THEIR home."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","25 January 2009"," Great Performances
","Revolutionary Road (2008)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A suburban couple (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) find their lives getting boring and their marriage falling apart so they think a trip to Paris will give their lives a new direction to keep them going. I guess when you break it down this is a film about reaching the American dream of a family, kids and a nice house but then realizing it's not all roses and sunshine. To call this a depressing movie would be an understatement but there's no denying the power in the performances and the strong direction that keeps it going. Some might try to compare this to Mednes' American Beauty but I think the films are pretty different in their approach and what they're trying to say. This movie gives us two characters who quickly fall in love but soon find that love getting caught up in fights over what they plan on doing with the rest of their lives. I think people could look at both of their view points and see something different but at the same time the ending is done so brilliantly well that many people might be coming out of the theater angry, sad or perhaps both. The movie offers up a lot of tough questions about the responsibility of marriage, kids and loyalty but it never gives off any easy answers. Some might want to see Leo and Kate working together again but they might want to reconsider because this certainly isn't Titanic. I've been a major fan of DiCaprio's since I first saw him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and since then he's turned in a very impressive resume for someone his age. He adds another great character and performance to his resume and he remains one of the most interesting actors out there. There are two sequences that I won't ruin for people reading this my DiCaprio made my draw hit the floor. Both come towards the end of the movie when his wife tells him something that comes as a shock. I won't ruin what she says but the look of pain on his face and turning that into anger was something heartbreaking to watch. He adds so much depth to his character that you can't help feel his pain throughout the movie. Winslet does a great job as well and really nails the character, which goes through quite a few changes throughout the movie. There have been numerous performances of a housewife since the start of cinema but I must say the way Winslet plays the character is very memorable. The two working together just hit a homerun because there's not a single second where they don't come off as a real couple. Kathy Bates is in fine form with her supporting role as is David Harbour as a neighbor. Michael Shannon really stands out as Bates' rather strange son who was just released from a mental hospital. It's rather interesting that his character is considered the crazy one yet he makes more sense than any of the normal people. Everything from the cinematography to the set design are top-notch as well and Mendes perfectly holds everything together with his strong direction and key eye for knowing how to bring out the biggest emotions out of a few words. This certainly isn't an easy movie to watch but it does leave you with a lot to wonder about and that's something we need more of in today's cinema."
"jaredmobarak","10","3","7","13 January 2009"," It takes real guts to see the hopelessness  Revolutionary Road
","Here it is, the start of suburban sprawl. So many people will look at it as successthe ability to survive and raise a family away from crime, in a neighborhood that thrives on wholesome love and friendship. But as anyone can tell you today, most of that is a complete façade, a mask hiding the troubles and anger and regret that everyone feelsthat need for more, and a way out of the rut of living without living. What Revolutionary Road does is peel back that layer where it concerns the Wheelers, a young couple that is looked up to by everyone in their social circle. Loving, two children, a supporting husband, and a beautiful wifethey're the idyllic white picket fence dream. Except for the inner struggles both Frank and April fight each day, looking at their present and only seeing a future full of mediocrity and safety; the excitement of young love full of hope, where the sky was the limit, all but gone. Once that first child is born, you need to begin living for someone else, putting yourself in the backseat. Sometimes that life just isn't for all of us.<br/><br/>The novel for which this film is adapted from is also the material loosely utilized for the television show ""Mad Men"". While these two entities differ greatly, the underlying structural problems about marriage and the meaning of success couldn't be more similar. Sure Jon Hamm's Don Draper is a confident man that buried his past to become the man he thought he wanted to be and Leonardo DiCaprio is a beaten man stuck in a job he hates in order to be the husband he thinks he needs to be, but the end resultbreaking from their vows to add a little excitement and memory of life when all they had to worry about was themselvesis a mirror image of the other. Tightly wound and stressful to no end, Frank and April Wheeler are at a very dangerous crossroads. Finally getting on the other's nerves, beginning to think that maybe their marriage was rushed into after a chance encounter at a party, the relationship has escalated to shouting matches that attempt to get the other to snap first. It is only the hastily hatched plan of moving to Paris, starting anew with that fervor they both fell in love with from the other the first time, that gets them back on track with a glimmer of hope for the future.<br/><br/>Business is booming, the computer generation is burgeoning, and money has become the driving force for life. With advertising and sales entrenching themselves into daily routine, people are finding themselves brainwashed to the idea that a perfect home life means having the big house, nice car, multiple children, and dinner on the table each night. If that dream means working a job you don't respect or pretending your life locked inside your house raising the kids who forced you to move to the suburbs in the first place, well, you make do. As my favorite character, and probably the most important voice in the entire film, says, ""most people know the emptiness, it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Michael Shannon's John Givings, a friend's son, recently admitted to an insane asylum, hits the nail on the head. Most couples going through the motions know the void they are filling with material goods and lies to themselves and each other, but very few understand the fact that once you find yourself in that world, it becomes a descent into quicksand, almost impossible to find that joy you once saw in front of you so long ago.<br/><br/>This man's insanity also plays a huge role in the film due to the fact that, in my opinion, he is the sanest character here. He understands what it means to be free from the constraints of society, but for some reason humanity got lost on its journey, eventually deeming freedom to be an unattainable dream. To live without inhibitions is insanity while slaving away every last fiber of your being becomes the sane thing to do. This fact is shown completely naked through the eyes of DiCaprio's Frank and Kate Winslet's powerful turn as April. By discovering how much what she does hurts her, how much what her contemporaries say she should be doing destroys her will to go on, she slowly finds herself spiraling into depression, becoming vacant and hysterical. The final act, John Givings' last visit to the Wheeler house until the next morning's surreally off-kilter mood and action, is absolutely devastating to experience. You can't help but see yourself in their shoes, watching as the weight of conformity finally becomes too much to prop above the necessity to fly.<br/><br/>And Sam Mendes really gets every bit right, even those heavily debated subjects some people might not want to face. At first, I began to think how much could have been improved if say Todd Field directed this story, but after further thought realized it wouldn't have been as effective. While it doesn't contain the amount of humor the audience I saw it with thought, there are a lot of laughs included, both adding to the awkwardness of some situations and deflecting from the sheer dramatic gravitas portrayed at many moments. I especially loved the moments where Mendes slowed the camera down, just a bit, and superimposed a beautiful orchestral score above while muting the sounds of the actions on screen. Utilized when April and Shep dance at a bar and later during Frank's heart-wrenching experience of being completely helpless, this effect is successful and never heavy-handed. Sometimes it takes tragedy to wake yourself from the nightmare of solitude that you thought was a dream of happiness, and Revolutionary Road puts that revelation in your face, hopefully to watch now so as not to allow it to occur to yourself in real life."
"UncleTantra","Null","3","7","4 January 2009"," Five-star review
","Having read about the plot, I really didn't want to watch Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road."" But I figured that in light of an article I'm writing, I should see it because both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are lauded for their performances. It was just that the concept -- two people stuck in the American suburbs in the 1950s and hating their lives and taking it out on each other -- struck me as possibly the most boring thing in the world.<br/><br/>I was wrong. *Watching a movie* about two people stuck in the American suburbs in the 1950s and hating their lives and taking it out on each other is the most boring thing in the world.<br/><br/>I feel fortunate that I was watching it at home and could multitask on other things while it was playing. Otherwise it would have been two precious hours of my life completely wasted. As it was, I got to brush my dogs, trim their nails, vacuum my living room, and write letters to four friends.<br/><br/>I give these activities five stars, the movie none."
"Michael Fargo","7","3","7","2 January 2009"," A reluctant Stepford wife
","There is something missing in Sam Mendes' adaptation of the Yates' novel, ""Revolutionary Road."" I fault specifically the screenplay which is heavy on explanatory dialog. The characters are trying to explain to one another what's wrong, while the audience is way ahead. We see the problem, and then a secondary character comes in later and spells it out even more clearly..<br/><br/>The over enunciation of every word by both the leads is also peculiar. This sounds like a stage play that the two actors have over-rehearsed. And we're given all the ""high points"" of their arguments with little understanding of why they are drawn to one another or why one or the other just doesn't leave.<br/><br/>If we're supposed to condemn the ""system"" that has put them on Revolutionary Road, that has been left out. Their personal problems seem much deeper than whatever rat race a capitalistic society has trapped them in. I felt like any place they were headed, they'd be just as unhappy. Their lack of fulfillment doesn't much matter since we don't see that there's much potential anywhere. Particularly in Mr. DiCaprio's character who is a liar, hates and uses just about everyone around him, and then bullies his wife into being whatever he'd like. It's a particularly unpleasant performance by a usually gifted and affecting actor.<br/><br/>Ms. Winslet comes off somewhat more sympathetic, but the constant baiting of her husband in most of the fighting grows tiresome. My favorite moment (and it's a nicely held one by the director) occurs at a roadhouse when Ms. Winslet cuts lose on the dance floor and becomes reckless and seductive. It's a terrific moment for the actress and for the audience.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot since it would spoil what little there is, but the subject matter hinges on a lighting rod in today's political climate, and it's treated without much sensitivity.<br/><br/>Even the composer, Thomas Newman, who did so much for Mr. Mendes in ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" (two of my favorite films) seems repetitious and glib. Kathy Bates, however, really perks things up in her scenes showing even playing a one dimensional character can still be both artful and entertaining."
"screenwriter-14","10","3","7","31 December 2008"," An Acting Masterpiece
","I have waited for weeks for this film to open in Hollywood, here in Los Angeles, and finally today I saw the film. Dicaprio and Winslet take REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and from the first scenes I think I am back with WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? with Martha and George bickering and arguing with biting dialog. Then REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, because of its time frame, reminds me of the fabulous MADMEN, with that intensity and drama of its leading characters, until I look into the eyes of April, Winslet, and realize that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a story and journey of two characters with their own enemies to face. Every frame of the film and the scenes between Kate and Leo remind me of what that it must have been like in the 1950's, attempting to live that perfect American life, but in the end, you realize that the ""Donna Reed perfect wife and mother"" American character, is a falsehood, and that April is only hoping to find something better. The supporting cast of Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour is superb with characters that only add to the history which is building between the Wheelers.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes does give us hints of American BEAUTY, but in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, he directs a story of brilliant drama and intensity. With the final scene, you can understand how April must have felt in a suburban world of perfection, and lies."

","wow, this movie was great!!! this movie about a young, idealistic couple living in a 50s suburban community is sure to grab hold of you! Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing (as always) playing the husband, Frank Wheeler, a man who is disgruntled with his job, but trudges on to provide for his family. sure, he's not perfect and makes mistakes along the way, but who doesn't? i truly felt for this guy as he reaches out to connect with his wife at their hardest moments.<br/><br/>And Kate Winslet, oh, Kate Winslet. she radiates in this movie as April Wheeler, the young wife who wants her husband to be happy while coping with her own personal issues. like her husband, she is also not perfect, but they enjoy great chemistry together on the screen! her dialog delivery is perfect, and it is hard to tear your eyes from hers, as a thousand different emotions fly through them at any given time.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon is also worthy of noting, playing John, a poor, disturbed man who visits the Wheelers with his realtor mother (played wonderfully by Kathy Bates), as he copes with his mental breakdown that has landed him in an asylum. his scenes are at once amusing and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>alright, to be serious now. Sam Mendes has yet to make a bad movie, and this one is no exception. dark? yes. depressing? yes. Revolutionary Road is paved with harsh truths and difficult moments, but it is a beautiful film. Thomas Newman's score may be the best of the year, and Kate Winslet delivers what may be the best female performance of the year. go see it with an open mind, and let it haunt you afterwards."
"Jax0524","7","3","7","26 December 2008"," This ain't no titanic folks
","After finally seeing revolutionary road I have to say I was immediately blown away, Leo and Kate definitely delivered the goods I was mostly surprised at Leo's performance to be quite honest especially with him playing the role of a father and husband for the first time. He was phenomenal he brought out emotions that I've never seen him do before especially towards the end and his final confrontation with April, calling her a ""cold heartless shell of a woman"" and at the same time you can tell that he is absolutely hurt and crushed as he starts to break down in tears, it was both frightening and heart wrenching.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet was absolutely fantastic, I found myself in the end really sympathizing with April throughout the film a little bit more so than frank. April is a woman who wants something different out of life and refuses to give into conformity and is willing to escape it at any cost. She comes up with the impulsive decision to move to Paris and convinces frank that they should go, Frank agrees but due to unforeseen circumstances(April getting pregnant)Frank changes his mind and decides to take the raise that is given to him at his job at Knox. Of course April is extremely disappointed to the point of which (I think) she becomes a little bit of a sociopath. It becomes even more apparent when Frank openly tells her the truth about his affair with his secretary and she simply responds ""why did you? no, I don't mean why did you have the girl I mean why did you tell me about it?, is that supposed to make me jealous, or back into bed with you?"" There are times in this movie when you just want to call April a b***h but at the same time you feel sorry for her. the same can also be said for frank, he's sleeping with his secretary and yet you understand that he only wants to do whats right by his family and make his wife happy.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon who I think represents the truth of this film was excellent as well he plays the role of Mrs. Givings ill son who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. His character as ""crazy"" as he might seem to be he is the only character that bluntly puts the truth out for everyone to hear even if they don't want to hear it, especially when it came to his confrontation with frank as he tells him he may have knocked up his wife on purpose as an excuse not to go to Paris.<br/><br/>There are a few questions that did pop in my head afterward like, "" did frank really want to go to Paris?, did he purposely get his wife pregnant to avoid moving to Paris?, would the wheelers truly had been happy in Paris?"". My only complaint about the movie is the ending, it could've been much better, it also bothered me that Frank and April's children rarely were present in the film.<br/><br/>Overall I give the film a 9/10 and I recommend this to anyone"
"stareeswan","2","2","4","2 March 2017"," Overall, this was a depressing and disappointing movie that had nothing new to say
","I expected a good movie. The lead actors are well known and normally good at what they do, as is the director. How disappointing then, to discover that this combination resulted in a monumental failure to connect.<br/><br/>Tolstoy said that ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"" and I was willing to explore that premise in this movie. But it's difficult to care about characters that are so two dimensional. As the movie ended, I still felt that I barely knew the people in it.<br/><br/>There was no real storytelling here. There was literally no story. Just an unhappy couple lurching from one fight to the next throughout the entire movie. They are both unfaithful, immature and behave irrationally. Unfortunately, neither of them is likable or sympathetic. The R rating of the movie is justified by the frequent profanity, several sex scenes and the inevitable (by which I mean; you could see it coming a mile off), self-administered abortion.<br/><br/>April (Winslet) seems almost bipolar with her constant changes of mood, swinging from calm and loved-up to full-on screaming hate, at head spinning speed. Her solution to fix this mutual unhappiness, is for them all to relocate to Paris. But she'd forgotten the most important fact, that wherever you go, you take yourself with you. Sometimes it's not external factors that make you unhappy (or happy) it is what is within you. Eh. So she has a lackluster quickie with the neighbor (who is madly in love with her - poor bastard) <br/><br/>Frank (DiCaprio) is also clearly dissatisfied with his life, experiments with infidelity and is still no happier. After some persuasion, he goes along with April's crazy idea and there is a brief honeymoon period while they put together their plans for the move. But it all quickly falls apart again and their screaming matches resume.<br/><br/>The most interesting character was the man from the asylum. At least he said what he thought, not what people wanted to hear.<br/><br/>For me, the most disturbing aspect of this movie was something that seems all too familiar, a husband deciding for his wife that they should have a baby, when she clearly doesn't want one. I know, times and (men's) attitudes were different back then but the end result was not thus surprising. Frank deliberately waits until the last day of her 12 week of pregnancy has passed before he tells April he didn't even want the baby either.. when it is now too late to safely do anything about it. Nice. What was a woman to do then, if she didn't want the child she was carrying? Choices were limited and the risks very high. But women have always, and will always, try to make those choices for themselves, whether men want them to or not. I'd like to think some of the sadness he shows later, is because of those choices he made. But probably not.<br/><br/>The scene near the end, with April acting all ""Stepford wife"" preparing breakfast the morning after another terrible fight.. now *that* was really creepy. I was expecting her to have poisoned the food, or to suddenly get out a big knife and start stabbing Frank.. anything other than just sending hubby off to work with a wave. Then I thought, well maybe she's going to hop off to Paris (on her own or with the kids) that would have been perfect. that would have been a good conclusion to the movie, not a ""happy"" ending as such but still.. Go live the life you want lady!

"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","4","20 March 2009"," Road To Destruction
","Sam Mendes who had earlier given us the marvelous 'American Beauty' and the fantastic 'Road To Perdition' is now back with a harsh and disturbing portrayal of the intimate (or lack of it) relationship between a married couple. Though the film is set in the fifties, the dilemmas, moral conflicts, despair, depression and hopelessness holds relevant even for today's world.<br/><br/>Given the solid screenplay, Mendes does not waste time to contrast the relationship pre and post marriage. That one scene in the beginning is enough to demonstrate that these two people, who instantly hit it off, had dreams and aspirations. Soon marriage happens, and then children and thus their dreams are pushed further away until it becomes nothing but a distant dream. Frank works a 10hour/day job that he hates and April is the ultimate desperate housewife. <br/><br/>Mendes has an eye for visuals and 'Revolutionary Road' is no different. Every frame is stunning to look at. The cinematography and score only enhance the mood of the scenes. <br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet reunite after about 11 years, this time with something much more challenging than silly candy-floss romance. One can easily see how both have matured as actors. Although I did find Dicaprio to overact in several scenes and at times he's a little too weepy but his best scenes are with Winslet who delivers a very natural performance by depicting the despair and sadness of the ultimate desperate housewife. The supporting cast is commendable. Michael Shannon steals the show while Kathryn Hahn and Kathy Bates are good.<br/><br/>'Revolutionary Road' is quite daring with its stark portrayal of a marriage gone so sour that it has become poisonous. Mendes has been known to deal with risky subject matters and here too he gives it the right treatment. Had the script gone to a lesser director, then the 'Revolutionary Road' could have easily failed."

","Revolutionary Road (2008)<br/><br/>Top 5 - 2008<br/><br/>Sam Mendes revisits American suburbia after his Oscar laden masterpiece 'American Beauty' which beautifully examined the painful imperfections of suburban life of a middle aged couple in the late 1990s. This time Mendes takes us almost half a century back in 1950s America to examine the life of April and Frank Wheeler who move to a beautiful suburb away from the buzzing city. This is Revolutionary Road, an adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name.<br/><br/>With elegant camera-work by Mendes, powerful acting from Di Caprio and Winslet (and a host of other solid performances), sharp editing and cinematography, we get a haunting look at the standard premise of the post WWII American Dream. Except this time the dream goes all wrong.<br/><br/>April and Frank Wheeler have a very nice house in a comfortable suburb in middle class America. Frank has a stable income, April is a stay at home mother to their two children. All good? No. The film explores how the life of this couple is empty inside, with no hope - it is an 'elegantly devastating' motion picture as one reviewer put it, Mendes really masters the art of beautiful film-making.<br/><br/>Th story involves a number of character that expand the films dimensions and evolve with the storyline. This is an excellent film and in my opinion one of the top 5 of the year and should have been nominated for Best Picture and Director at this year's Oscars.<br/><br/>9/10"
"MomentaryParticle","9","2","4","31 January 2009"," Revolutionary Road: a film about Narcissistic Personality Disorder
","I haven't read the book Revolutionary Road, but from the reviews I have read, it is apparently about conformity, suburban life, marriage and the search for identity in 1950's America, and the effect that the social norms of the time had on people's psyches. Revolutionary Road the film, however, seems to go beyond a story about socio-psycho-dynamics and cross over into the world of full-blown psychological disorder. <br/><br/>As portrayed by Kate Winslet, April Wheeler is not merely a middle-class housewife suffering from ""suburban existential angst"" or struggling to find her identity; she is someone afflicted with severe Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and through the course of the film, exhibits many of the classic traits. Here's a list of NPD traits from Wikipedia:<br/><br/>1. a grandiose sense of self-importance 2. a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love 3. believes that he or she is ""special"" and unique 4. requires excessive admiration 5. has a sense of entitlement 6. is interpersonally exploitative 7. lacks empathy 8. is often envious of others or believes others are envious of him or her 9. shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes <br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder<br/><br/>More than just a period piece, the film Revolutionary Road can be viewed as an indictment of narcissism. <br/><br/>Early in the film, we see that April greatly desires to be an actress, but her acting debut is so disastrous that even she realizes that she has no talent and no future in the theater. Yet she clings to her elitist, entitled self-image as the years go by, without any apparent basis for thinking so. (Our society will tolerate pathological narcissism in our celebrities, of course, but not among the ranks of the talent-less.)<br/><br/>In reality, April is an isolated person with a distant, un-empathetic relationship with both her husband and her children. She can only relate to people who buy into her grandiose self-image, like her neighbors Shep and Milly Campbell. She eventually concocts a desperate, irrational plan to move to Paris to achieve something of distinction, in her mind, in order to bolster her flagging self-image.<br/><br/>Her husband Frank is also a narcissist, but his case is milder, lacking April's pathology. Frank is passive, and basically a lazy person; he ""goes with the flow"" in most of his life's dealings, including taking a boring job at the firm his dad worked at. He generally accommodates April's narcissism because it entertains him and feeds into his own vaguely-defined self-fantasy. As he goes through the motions of his life, even his affair with an office worker seems like a nonchalant diversion from ever-encroaching tedium and ennui.<br/><br/>A clue to April and Frank's narcissism is the furniture-like role played by their children. April and Frank are not loving parents; they're self-involved people that seem incapable of love. <br/><br/>Only John, the mental patient son of real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), had the gall to expose Frank and April's delusions  to devastating effect.<br/><br/>Frank and April are not the only psychologically-challenged characters in the film. Helen Givings is a narcissistic and neurotic basket case (it is no wonder that her son is a mental patient), making it up as she goes along, instantly revising her history with Frank and April when it becomes necessary to maintain her own fragile self-image and hollow values.<br/><br/>In the final scene, we witness Helen's husband Howard's method for coping with his wife's exorbitant self-indulgence: he simply turns down his hearing aid. In this closing scene, as Howard's eyes glaze over, the film restates it's core theme: that narcissism takes a heavy toll, both on the narcissist, and the lives of the people they touch."
"J_Trex","8","2","4","28 January 2009"," Good Adaptation of Richard Yates's Classic Novel
","When watching the trailers for this movie, I wondered why anyone would want to subject themselves to two hours of Leo & Kate yelling at each other. It seemed like the ultimate downer of a film, an uninterrupted stretch of ""The Bickersons"" on the silver screen. Why would an acclaimed Film Director like Sam Mendes and Hollywood luminaries Kate Winslett & Leonardo DiCaprio get behind this project?<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" by Richard Yates is one of the great American novels of the 20th century. Published in 1961, it was hailed critically but it didn't do well commercially. It was a bit too grim in its outlook for the time. This is the first time it's been adapted to film. While the movie is faithful to the book, the novel is much more than just another story of suburban malaise. The movie doesn't go beneath the surface of the characters as the novel does. From watching the movie, we really don't know much about Frank & April Wheeler, other than that they are unhappy with their lives. The book goes into much greater depth. This is the film's major flaw. Like ""The Great Gatsby"", to which it's often compared, the plot and its characters are secondary to the lyricism of the prose. It's very hard to capture this type of literary masterpiece to the big screen. Case in point: Coppola's ""The Great Gatsby"" was a critical failure, despite a massive film budget, big name movie star talent, not to mention Coppola himself directing.<br/><br/>That being said, I thought DiCaprio was great as Frank Wheeler. He really nailed the role perfectly. While Kate good as April, she tended to overact a bit too much. I thought her crying scene toward the dramatic ending was a bit artificial (after she made breakfast for Frank and he left for work) and could have been more genuine. I'm not sure why Mendes didn't do a re-take. It must be tough directing your wife (Mendes is married to Winslett). <br/><br/>All in all, an excellent movie and by all means go see it. My advice would also be to read the book before seeing it. That's not to say one needs to read the book to appreciate the film, but it does help gain a better understanding of the characters and the story."
"Pierre_Kirby","6","2","4","26 January 2009"," Unhappy Marriage: The Movie
","Revolutionary Road is Sam Mendes fourth (or fifth?) film, and as you can expect, the film looks visually exquisite. But I'm not going to start talking about cinematography here. I'm going to start talking about how Revolutionary Road is Sam's weakest film. The praise and hate the movie is receiving puzzles me. For starters, Revolutionary Road is a movie that depends on performances, not story or script; What you mostly see for almost 2 hours is two good looking people duking it out over their unhappiness, their wasted lives, their BORING lives, the chances they missed and wished they had, etcetera, etcetera. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but that doesn't mean that you have to 'get' the movie in order to hype it up for everyone else. As I said, the movie is about performances, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Two young people fall in love one night, get married, have children, and start to question if they really love each other. The premise of Revolutionary Road is based on a novel that I have no intention of reading, let alone comparing to the movie. Between infidelities and broken dreams, it is all about the 'realistic' aspect of the marriage between Leo and Kate, which is why I guess many people love this one. On the other hand, we have the requisite over-blown dramatic sequences which apparently turned off most of the professional critics and commenter's here in IMDb. I am in the middle.<br/><br/>I appreciate Sam's extreme attention and detail to the ups and downs of marriage, but what I don't appreciate is the little things in between. For some reason, we have Michael Shannon telling Leo and Kate the reality of the situation IN THEIR FACE, in order for them to understand what is really going on. Then we have an unnecessary love issue between the Wheeler's neighbor with Kate that goes on as subtle as Pink Floyd giving a free concert in Times Square. And an ending that teaches us that marriage is not what the magazines make you believe it is. Or the American Dream ads for that matter. After Jarhead, I really don't understand why Sam wanted to tackle this project in the first place. The script is incredibly simple, and it isn't as great as many people here are making you believe it is. What enhances the script, and the movie, are the performances, which are first-rate. I hate repeating myself, but it is the case I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is the talk of town this year, and I can see why, at least in this movie. Her performance as bored and depressed April Wheeler is fantastic on almost all accounts. But as fantastic as Kate was, it was Leo who definitely made me turn my head. He completely stole Kate's thunder, COMPLETELY. And in Leo's quieter moments is where he shines the most. Why the hell did he get snubbed? What the hell are the Academy smoking? I mean, is it really that hard to nominate a great performance? Jeez. The supporting cast is forgettable except for of course Michael Shannon. Out of the four scenes he was in, he stole all four of them. Who the hell is Michael Shannon? Quite possibly one of the most underrated actors working today, who alongside Ryan Gosling will definitely go places in the near future. Thank the gods he has a much deserved nomination.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is like some of the movies released this year (Gran Torino, Seven Pounds)- loved by many people, hated by many critics. As a big fan of Sam Mendes, this was sort of let down. The script wasn't anything special, and the movie is basically there for you to see Leo, Kate's and Shannon's performances, which is alright I guess. Far from being a bad movie, but it is also far from being a masterpiece. It is just an above-average watch that you will either love or hate.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

","The setting indeed takes place in the 50's but this story relates to me in a modern setting.I Agreed, much of this movie is hard to watch, it encompasses the ugly side of human spirit, and emotions that just wrench your heart. I did not realize the Director was Sam Mendes of American Beauty, another timeless classic. His ability to exploit the dark under belly of people is present throughout . At the time of viewing I kept asking myself why is this feel so emotionally charged in a sadistic way?. (It was clearer in hindsight.) The story commanded your attention. I could not look away. I was obligated and compelled to watch the story unfold. The movie is superbly presented,and the acting is top-notched. The feelings of love and hate and disgust I had for Kate and Leo. I don't think this was their best work but they make a fabulous duo,I never felt this movie was trying to hard to be real. This movie reminds me of a past relationship I had. A very real fiasco with two children ,mental illness, abuse, sad times, happy times vs bad times, and the bad times mainly won. The movie is so dark and emotion so raw and in your face. My stomach turns just watching this film. During the film I felt I was stuck back in this painful relationship. I was a bit relieved when the movie finally ended and I could walk away. This movie left me emotionally spent. The supporting cast are the diamonds in the rough,especially Michael Shannon ,who in my opinion stole the show."

","Revolutionary Road (RR) opens as a dreary 'American Dream' landscape that we are not only a part of, but forced to share. RR is intent on making us feel....that is, to which we are undoubtedly numb. Director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty fame) does not make the case that happiness is an illusion but the implication is obvious. The story takes a welcome turn when an antagonist, a former psychiatric patient played by Michael Shannon, ironically reminds the Wheelers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) that it's not enough to satiate life like an empty stomach; It has to be throttled and shuck like a tree until its fruits are given.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's character is afraid to risk the unknown while Winslet's sees no alternatives in 1950's social Connecticut. DiCaprio is compelling and Winslet is magnificent. RR is like listening to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album, you love it but you don't want to go back there too often."

","Director Sam Mendes, revisits the tedium of adult life in a way reminiscent of his other movie ""American Beauty.""<br/><br/>Set in the 1950's suburbia, Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) meet at a bar and instantly hit it off, they marry and acquire a modest house along revolutionary road. They seem to be a happy couple to the outside world but the lack of fulfillment from the ennui of adult life and their shattered personal dreams and aspirations slowly push their marriage into destruction. Forced to stick with a job he loathes and having difficulty comforting his wife after an unsuccessful stint as a stage actress, Frank starts an extra-marital affair with a co-worker. Kate for her part, starts to become irritable just looking after the house and their 2 children, and not being able to pursue her acting.<br/><br/>In an effort to get out of the stifling conformity of their austere married life, April asks Frank to leave everything behind and start a life in Paris (the only place worth living in, according to Frank) and finally ""LIVE"" the way they dreamed of before, not a care in the world, just enjoying a bit of their their individuality, their togetherness and their 2 children.<br/><br/>Everything is going according to plan and their trip is only a few weeks away, until an unexpected 3rd pregnancy stalls them, and to mess things further, Frank is now being offered a job promotion and a raise, with the 3rd baby on the way, the offer is a hundred times more attractive.<br/><br/>Frank thinks it's better to stay, Kate is devastated..<br/><br/>and down they go to the demise of their marriage...<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>This movie is not only tragic, it's almost depressing, the movie's no-holds-barred way of delivering its punches is so brutally honest it's scary. It's like a violent and repugnant defilement of something you have faith in-- married life.<br/><br/>Yet, it rings true, a conservative and by-the-mold married life is what most couples dream of. To marry, buy a house, have kids and have a job that pays well-- nevermind if the work sucks, so long as it supports the family it's OK. This has been ingrained far too long in society and an open challenge to stray from what is usual and common will be bereft of success, and will be met with skepticism---- at least that is what the movie is saying..<br/><br/>This movie therefore is too frank, and by definition almost always unappealing.. but there is wisdom in it, the wisdom that there is always an OPTION, that things can be done according to one's own standards and not society's.<br/><br/>It is hard, it could even be ""fatal"", but the most salient point of this movie is that--<br/><br/>""TRUE HAPPINESS"" is always just one choice away,,..<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I wouldn't really recommend this movie, because it's so devastating, but the leads are superb. DiCaprio's emotionally charged portrayal should have won him a golden globe, I can only assume that Mickey Rourke was UNBELIEVABLE in The Wrestler for him to get the golden globe instead of DiCaprio, and kudos to Winslet for winning 2 golden globes, one for her acting in this movie."
"Chris Knipp","8","2","4","11 January 2009"," Mid-century marriage meltdown
","The talented English stage director Sam Mendes has made another movie that focuses, like his earlier 'American Beauty,' on Stateside suburban discontent. This time his source is Richard Yates' acclaimed 1961 novel of the same name, whose action takes place in 1955. The movie reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (now Mendes' wife) for the first time since 'Titanic,' which turned both of them into big stars. All of which makes this a movie well worth seeing, and DiCaprio and Winslet, seasoned and proved now, give intense, balls-out performances, as do several in the supporting cast, especially the edgy character actor Michael Shannon. It doesn't all quite work as a movie. Despite performances that are a knockout, the movie feels perfect, yet empty. But the novel is a stunner and even delivered in this skeletal, overly theatrical form leaves you with plenty to think about.<br/><br/>'Revolutionary Road' is a passionate indictment of the roles of men and women in mid-century America and the conformism and lack of imagination imposed by the prevailing institutions. Familiar topics perhaps, but Yates' treatment of them is a seminal one. This will show you where Women's Lib came from. A memorable if artificial shot of an army of men marching down into Grand Central to work in Manhattan, all of them in hats, underlines the prevalent sense that middle class white men were as imprisoned as their spouses in their gray flannel suits, their air-conditioned nightmare, their other-directed conformity from which the only escapes were the liquid lunch of tee many martoonies, the quick rolls in the hay with sad little secretaries. The movie is good at capturing the outward shell; not so successful at penetrating within. The Fifties are dangerous ground for younger filmmakers, who have trouble seeing beyond the shiny cars and jaunty jazz.<br/><br/>Another, perhaps more insidious, defense was irony and detachment. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) seeks refuge there, while dabbling in martinis and secretaries too. He pretends to disdain his copy-writing job with a business machine company. For this same company his father worked for decades, unnoticed by executives, as a New Jersey sales representative. Frank, despite his disdain, which implies he envisions still better for himself, is on the way to a materially better life than his Willy Loman father. At thirty he drives a Buick, has this decent job, and lives with his pretty blond wife and their two young kids in a pretty house in Connecticut with lots of lawn. Their neighbor, Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), the real estate agent who sold them the house, thinks them a lovely couple. When April (Winslet) was dating Frank, she thought him the most interesting, different, adventurous man she'd ever met. They think of themselves as detached from their surroundings: intelligent, creative. He has spoken of living in Paris. She fancies herself as an actress.<br/><br/>But nothing works, because April and Frank are only pretending to be better than their surroundings and are both quite ordinary. The couple comes on scene with a major row after April has starred in an amateur play production that is a flop. In the novel, the performance of the play, and April's evident pain as it disintegrates around her, are described in excruciating detail, but the movie skips all that and cuts to the drive home. What is surprising is how mean and accusatory Frank is. He originally thought of nice and comforting things to say to April about the play, but that's all in the book, not the movie.<br/><br/>April cooks up the plan of moving to Paris. They will sell the house and the car. She has heard secretaries for international organizations get high salaries in Paris. She'll work to support them (presumably with a nanny for the kids) while Frank discovers himself. Frank very reluctantly gives in, and they go ahead with plans to move. April reassures the children they'll survive with fewer toys and new friends. The Givings bring their son John (Shannon), who's been in a mental institution, and while the Paris idea shocks his parents, he congratulates Frank and April on their decision to escape from the boredom of middle-class America. Then something happens, and it all falls apart. For one thing, a memo Frank writes as a lark gets him recognition from the top management and the offer of a promotion that's too exciting to resist. The verbal fights between April and Frank, fueled by endless drinks and cigarettes, get more and more bitter, until finally there is silence, in a chilling nice breakfast when April sees Frank off to work before tragedy strikes. <br/><br/>Frank is not an attractive person. He has neither talent nor character, and takes unconvincing refuge in being a smart-ass. He's a rotter, condescending toward his wife, a liar, a man too full of himself to possess self-awareness. DiCaprio embraces and embodies all that. The role of April is harder because she's repressed, hiding. Her earlier enthusiasm for Frank as the most interesting person she's met becomes pathetic when it's revealed to have been so mistaken. Ultimately the movie has trouble working as a movie because both its main characters are hollow shells. It would take a lot of prose (which is found in Yates' novel) to fill in substance around these shells.<br/><br/>The screenplay captures the main movements of the novel. But the exquisite cinematic detail, the precisely correct-to-period drapes, rugs, couches, suits, hats, and so forth, down to the overly-interesting artworks on the Wheeler walls, distract from the intense interactions. Must quite so many cigarettes be lit, cocktail glasses of gin quaffed? The movie's devastating scenes from a marriage would work better as a play with simple sets, without sprinklers and lawns and Buicks and Grand Central. Sam Mendes, as a stage director, may have miscalculated in seeing the screenplay as a series of intense scenes of dialogue and not perceiving how the movie-work surrounding these scenes of dialogue would undermine them."

","This is a difficult movie to watch because I think that the many messages will resonate with any and everyone. It's important to live our lives for ourselves, not for our parents, not for our spouses and not to let life pass us by. Once we stop we stop dreaming, we stop living. I know that sounds extreme, but this movie has made me reflect on all of the time I've wasted, who I've lived my life for and whether I've left things too long to change. It's far too easy to accept our lot in life and just run out the string in our mediocre and less than satisfying existence until we die. The Wheeler family, April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) are a couple that has moved to an ""idyllic"" small town to live out the ""dream"" but in reality, no one seems to be able to be true to themselves or to communicate and the dream is shown for what it really is, a nightmare."

"mukava991","9","2","4","31 December 2008"," masterful adaptation
","Kate Winslet again proves she can play suburban American housewives. LITTLE CHILDREN would have been enough, but granted, she reaches impressive heights as an intelligent but emotionally insecure young woman with bohemian tendencies who sees herself trapped in a stifling suburbia in this exploration of the dark side of the American dream. Almost as effective is Leonardo DiCaprio as her similarly dissatisfied office worker husband. Supporting player Michael Shannon is electrifying as John Givings, an eerily perceptive mental patient who upsets their fragile sense of equilibrium at a tense point in the drama. Kathy Bates plays Shannon's mother, a real estate agent/neighbor but seems to be retreading the character she played in ABOUT SCHMIDT several years back: friendly, loquacious, somewhat overbearing and very strange.<br/><br/>As he did in the highly overrated American BEAUTY and the flawed but under-appreciated ROAD TO PERDITION, British director Sam Mendes handles American material with style and steadiness. He has a well thought out sense of shot composition; the climactic scene (the details of which I will not divulge) with Winslet standing in front of her picture window is a case in point. Justin Haythe's screenplay persuasively retains the essence of the Richard Yates novel about people who don't know who they are, hook up in what they think or hope is true love and come to hate each other. The actors tear into their roles vigorously. There are many powerful moments and very few dull ones. Winslet and DeCaprio give it all they've got.<br/><br/>Among the layers excised from the novel is the emotional suffering of the Winslet-DiCaprio couple's children. In olden days most movies conveniently sent the children off to play, off to bed, off with a nanny after giving us an idyllic glimpse of them in order to establish the parenthood of the central adult dramatic personae. Few films ever convincingly integrated the messy realities of raising real children into their plots or dramatic situations. The same thing happens here. Just one nugget from the novel illustrating the harm done to the children would have strengthened the overall presentation. <br/><br/>By and large, however, this is a masterful adaptation."

I feel like viewers were left without much context as to where the children were.<br/><br/>P.S. I'm aware that their children aren't really a big deal in the film."

"canperincekster","7","0","0","7 January 2019"," Successful movie reflecting post-war existential crisis
","Revolutionary Road is a successful movie in terms of conveying its message with an acceptable level of cinematography and narrative form. The movie, mainly revolves around the post-war people and their existential crisis. However, more specifically, it deals with the woman that is trapped into the domestic space. This crisis is reflected as lacking the ability to realize his dreams for the man (Leonardo di Capri) and lacking the opportunity to realize itself as a free woman and promising actress for the woman character (Kate Winslet). Of course, as the ""backbone"" of the household economy, the man's inability, in turn, impedes the woman from pursuing her own path. Domestic duties and especially the ""child-making"" duty of the woman are seen as the main symbols of the woman's trappedness. Having a house, car and a child is seen as the sufficient causes to be happy and satisfied...<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie also represents the middle-class families' banality as whole. Although they seemingly have all the ""conditions"" and properties to attain happiness and they are seen as the ideal couple and family by the way, everything eventually becomes meaningless and aimless. At this point, the movie juxtaposes the projected life in Paris and the too ordinary life in the place where they currently live in the US. The name of the road and, thus, the movie attracts attention in this respect: Revolutionary Road. It is very ironical and creates a contrasting effect between the dreams and realities of the family.<br/><br/>The masterful performances of di Caprio and Winslet fit very well to this post-war crisis scene. The plot flows very well and presents these ideas in a tidy form. Most impressively, hints of the suicidal tendencies of the woman (Kate Winslet) from the dance scene on were very well placed into the plot.<br/><br/>As a result, Revolutionary Road, as a typical Hollywood movie, does not contain anything special cinematographically. If so, it could have been a very good and assertive movie both for the popular and intellectual audiences."

","Suffocating period piece explores the fickle dichotomy of American suburbia in the 1950s.

Failed actress and dreamer April yearns to escape their ordinary, stifling existence, while cynical realist Frank hates his job, frets over finances, and has been reduced to a product of his environment. Not exactly the dream scenario for the long-awaited reunion of DiCaprio and Winslet who were so compelling as star-crossed lovers in the epic Titanic, yet this is clearly a testament to their acting ability as they're able to faultlessly portray a relationship that's the polar opposite of what we saw on screen back in 1997.

"dansview","7","0","0","20 July 2018"," Glass Half Empty
","Unless we are terminally ill, prisoners of war or unemployed in the Third World, we usually have at least two ways to look at our situation in life. The couple in this film, who were apparently created by a book author, not a screenwriter or director, chose the ""glass half empty"" way. 
They had a beautiful home, healthy children, friends, and youth, but they were miserable because they thought life was supposed to be more romantic.
I don't think their dream of that way of life is illegitimate or stupid. There are people who live in bohemian cities, toil in the arts and don't have children, and that may be a satisfying way to go. I believe that these people could have made other choices besides marriage, kids, and suburban life. But that's what they chose.
Having said that we don't see any depiction of activities in the suburbs beyond the basics. Yet suburban people often do volunteer work, have multiple hobbies, go to church, and get into the city for the arts when they can. All of those things alleviate whatever inherent boredom comes with the territory.
All these people do is dwell on their misery. 
These dark commentaries on suburban life often focus on Godless sorts. People who believe that their own daily existence is the center of the universe often get disappointed when they realize that it's not. But they have nothing to fill the void. 
It's true what the other reviewers said that we didn't get much in the way of initial character development, but we did get a few basics and we heard more later. I thought the acting was good, but the scenes with the disturbed son of their realtor were too frequent and too heavy handed. They should have had one good scene of dialogue with him and left it at that. He was excruciating to watch. 
Don't be so sure that the film makers or author are mocking the 50s or suburbia. Through their characters they explain the pointlessness of thinking that some other romantic life is out there. For most of us this is all there is and that's o.k. The 50s or any time are what we make of them. None of the immoral decisions that people make in this film are considered cool. We see the guilt and anguish in those who commit them.
There's actually some great dialog including statements about immaturity, the annoying nature of over-talking and over-analyzing, and the fact that the grass is not always greener somewhere else.
Seven Stars. It was way too depressing to enjoy and lacked any balance in the form of say at least one couple that was genuinely happy and functional."

I am not sure how to describe this one for I feel I will not be able to do justice with it. So I would just say a couple of things.
First, it is by far among THE BEST drama movies ever made. Almost all the performances flabbergasting but Katherine Winslet's stands out. She has carried the whole weight of the film on her shoulders and never fails to impress us in any scene she is a part of. The altercations between her and Leonardo are captivating and give us the essences of the life of an ambitious couple and the thick and thin they have to go through. 
Second is the screenplay and dialogues which are simply superb. You will not want to miss even a single scene. I watched a couple of scenes twice or thrice also.

My husband & I watched this together, having been in unhealthy relationships in our younger lives (now in a wonderful marriage in our late 60's 70's). We both were saddened as we watched the well done development of their characters...the momentary hope...then despair & division. We both looked at each other, knowing that it wasn't so much about traditional marriage in the 50's ""burbs"" being the issue, as it was that they lacked tools in their tool chest. The tragedy was their inability to communicate effectively, love one another in a healthy way, and in our opinion...being happily married so many yrs...to have a spiritual foundation that helps people be close & forgiving. In this respect we felt sad watching because as some have shared-it is a dark & tragic film. Yet, we must say that they did a great job portraying the kind of road couples ""can"" go down in any scenario, not just traditional marriages.

","The dream is set: wife and husband with two kids will leave everything behind in suburban America and live in Paris where life and personal ambition can be achieved and, more so, felt. It's a dream. It barely rings logically now in the 21st century. So, how can it hold water during the 1950s? <br/><br/>It should first be mentioned that this is no Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet reunion with foggy window love on a sinking ship. Winslet's character, April Wheeler, is the one who brings up Paris, and it's up to her neighbors, her husband's coworkers, and her husband, Frank (DiCaprio), to accept the venture as reality. Whiskey, chain-smoking, and superficial conversation among plastic covered couches go against whimsical idealism with an Eiffel Tower on the side. This is an easy win for the 'burbs.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, but I also think it encompasses its own specific audience. If you enjoyed American Beauty, you are in for an enjoyably intense experience. Sam Mendes directed both, and, as a side note, Kate Winslet is his real-life wife. Mendes seems to be obsessed with what really happens behind the walls of so-called happily married families with white picket fences. It's not that he sees the suburban life as sinister; it's just too ordinary. We root for April and Frank, but we also know that a job promotion, a third child, and skeptic friends will pull them away from the dream.<br/><br/>Watching DiCaprio and Winslet, it is difficult to remember these were the two lovebirds in Titanic. Here, their on-screen relationship is more real and fragile. They are flawed, and it is useless to assign blame as each one is genuinely trying to keep the marriage together in a low divorce rate era. Along with their first-rate chemistry, Michael Shannon gives a humorous performance as John Givings, a neighbor just released from a mental asylum with more sense than anyone in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Revolutionary Road is a meticulous study of a marriage in crisis. It works best if the viewer is prepared for a tragedy to question, learn from, or simply embrace."
"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","17 April 2017"," Emotionally stimulating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet make this a rewarding domestic drama
","Revolutionary Road is an emotionally blistering drama that tackles on mature subjects such as infidelity, abortion, and the struggle of following life-long dreams. It is honest, it is poignant, and it offers somewhat uncomfortable message about the difficulties of marriage when desires are not reached. Director Sam Mendes is the leader of bringing about this potent domestic drama and reuniting 'Titanic' stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet as lovers. The romance between the two stars however, is slightly different story here. While the blockbuster film showcases the blossoming romance between Dicaprio and Winslet, this film goes the opposite route, and does so by tackling the sad, but significant issues that can leave marriage, or perhaps a whole family clinging on the edge of divorcement. With an intelligent direction by Mendes and profound performances by the two leads, this movie makes for a solid work of art. Set in the 1950s, the film revolves around Frank (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (played by Kate Winslet), a Connecticut couple who's marriage is in turmoil and are struggling to deal with personal issues. April is struggling as a theater actress and is stuck as housewife, and Frank is working a white- collar job that he desperately can't stand and is having an affair with his co-worker. When they make plans to move to Paris where both can fulfill their life-long dreams, they see what they believe to be the light at the end of the tunnel for their marriage. But can they overcome their personal obstacles including April's unexpected pregnancy to succeed their goals?<br/><br/>This film does not aim to tug at your heart springs, but it does offer a heart-wrenching truth about the fragility of the family when a couple's marriage reaches a dark period, especially when considering how high America's divorce rate has skyrocket in the past six decades. The story explores the dynamics of our lead couple as they struggle to come to terms with the obstacles bar from achieving their desires. One of the major aspects the story tackles is the idea of feeling trapped in a world where life is barred with seemingly endless limitations. The problem between the Wheelers is not each other, but their struggle to find a satisfying life in the suburbs. When they make a plan to move the family to Paris, that is when they become touched with hope for their domestic dilemma. But as the story advances, it becomes more and more evident that achieving you dreams is not always as easy as it seems. This accounts to some emotionally jarring revelations. Although the film occasionally slips into the pitfalls of utter melodrama, it is brutally honest is portraying the atmosphere of a broken family. And the helping hands behind the emotional resonance is Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet who both showcase true grit and powerful sentimentality in their roles, not perhaps not on the line with the chemistry they showcased when they were lovers on a sinking ship. The lead couple is greatly supported by Kathy Bates who makes for a tremendous role as their mutual friend who provides comfort in the dark days of their marriage. <br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is a powerful domestic drama sparkling with riveting performances and an solid direction by Sam Mendes who embraces the material with strong intellect. This is certainly not a happy ride nor does it opens doors to much humor beyond the arresting melodrama, but that is a rewarding piece of work."

","If you don't know it from experience, you know from movies that marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be. I used to fill the ranks of optimists who saw it as a whitewater rafting with a few rapids to ride when it's closer to drifting across an ocean of routine, punctuated by loud hurtful arguments and a few tender 'sorry' or 'I love you' to conceal the wounds. Films are never as haunting as when they reflect the turbulence of your own life. And watching Sam Mendes' ""Revolutionary Road"" was like a slap from my mirror.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are Frank and April Wheeler, young, loving and good-looking. They share everything: car, bed, house, lawns and kids to play in, but in their lucid moments, they realize their solitude. In a spectacularly directed scene, a wave of men with gray flannel suits are literally spreading over New York streets, The Knox building exudes some Billy Wilder's Apartment"" vibes while the crowd shots gives the film a surrealistic touch, channeling the famous Magritte painting with the men with bowler hats. Frank is like a lemming caught in a crowd and about to accomplish his daily suicide over the cliff, he sits down in his cubicle and can only gets his kicks by acting like a 'big shot' in front of an easily impressionable secretary.<br/><br/>April can breathe fresh air every day, but with the fathers at work and kids at school, suburbs look like ghost towns, a feeling of total emptiness is inevitable and ends up invading April. Frank is a face in a crowd who doesn't have time, April has time and space but she's tied to Frank. Both are married but terribly alone. Now, loneliness can be a door for as many rooms as opportunities, but in marriage, the door is locked and you're trapped in one room: marital, existential dead-end.April dreamed to be an actress but in the 50's, Hollywood was like TV, many called and few chosen. The film opens with a flop that draw the curtain on her dreams and after many attempts to consulate her, Frank finally lets this out and invites her to abandon this 'theatre' nonsense.<br/><br/>The couple buys a nice suburban house in ""Revolutionary Road"", their real estate agent, played by Kathy Bates who, have found the perfect house for the perfect postcard-couple. But we know what that facade of happiness can hide the ugliest realities. Sam Mendes made the great ""American Beauty"", a social commentary about the suburban American life, made of ersatz of contentment and where families could only lead carbon-copy lives dictated by consumerism and pretending to have a 'normal' life because they're too afraid to question the norm. But we're no fools, we see these men and women talking about kids, eating, sleeping or having sex but they're only making an effort to hide their disillusions.<br/><br/>In ""Revolutionary Road"", the roles are reversed, it is April, who suggests Frank to abandon everything and go to Paris, she'll find a job in the Embassy and he'll have time to figure out what he wants to do. Frank is tempted to a certain degree: he knows he has no talent, the only certitude is that he hates his job, that meaningless job he can't even explain in proper words, that sucked the life out of his father, making him swear to himself he'd never fall in the same death trap. But as a coach told me once, we're sometimes better than we think at things we hate, and Karma plays quite a trick on him by giving him a raise and a promotion. Frank is like a Lester Burnham in terms of awareness but not in the action and this is where ""Revolutionary Road"" stands out among the other marriage movies, this is one about inaction rather than action.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is about a wife who wants to go to Paris without a plan, and a man who can't because he's scared, they know what they hate and they share the same hatred, but there's a crucial difference: April won't go to Paris to be happy, she'll be happy if she goes to Paris, Frank anticipates and thinks the remedy is worse than the disease, he can't see that his wife gave him a tacit ultimatum, she reached the existential dead-end before him. It is very appropriate that the only person in the movie to tell the truth and to make sense is an insane man played by Michael Shannon. He can see the gateway to escape from the inconvenient truth, and sweeps off Frank's justification with a cruel verdict: ""you deserve each other"".<br/><br/>They know he's right but can't admit, and that's the terrible truth of marriage: it forces you to keep silent. The ending left me puzzled what's with that old man listening while his wife was babbling, but then I realized it wasn't random; the point was that many marriages looked exactly the same, forcing people to pretend to live happy. In the 50's, the American family model was the norm but looking at the way people smoked and drank and had affairs with their secretaries or neighbors, you realize that not much have changed, today, it's porn and Internet. The cures changed not the symptoms.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is more relevant than ever, it speaks devastating truths about bored office workers and desperate housewives, and as someone who actually followed his wife to a 'Paris' scenario, let me tell you that it didn't work either, I'm still figuring out what I'm made for and life is still routinely. So I can say that April and Frank were doomed from the start, and the tragedy is that they certainly loved each other.<br/><br/>I had just seen ""Romeo and Juliet"" recently (and the remake with Leo) and the more marriage movies I watch, the more I wonder if it the play had such a tragic ending after all."
"Veteransson","8","0","0","15 January 2017"," Devastating movie with amazing performances
","Sam Mendes returns with another picture following the lives of suburban families in America. In this one, the story is set in the 50's and takes place in Connecticut. No Kevin Spacey this time to steal the show, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make up for that. They respectively portray Frank and April Wheeler who form a couple after meeting in a bar and move to suburbs after April gets knocked up. The movie opens with this bar scene, where they both meet and April tells Frank that she wants to pursue a career as an actress. Next, we cut to a play April is in and from the look on Frank's face it wasn't a good one. The two of them get into a fight on their way home and it becomes clear that they aren't the same people that met in a bar.<br/><br/>The main themes of the movie, as it is mentioned in the movie, are emptiness and hopelessness. More precisely, the fight against it. We first saw Frank with some kind of confidence and excitement about the future on his face, but now he's not the man that would be noticed in a bar. As he goes to work he blends in with all the other men going to work, wearing their hats and gray jackets, just like him. He has lost his distinctiveness. April wanted to act but now has to settle for a life as a housewife. They are both unhappy, lost in the emptiness and hopelessness. The American dream grants everyone the right to the pursuit of happiness, but happiness is what the Wheelers struggle with, which leads to tensions and bad decisions within their household. <br/><br/>This particular struggle is depicted perfectly by Sam Mendes. You can feel and see the emptiness in their lives, also thanks to some brilliant performances. DiCaprio is perfect and gives one of his best performances, which says a lot. The way he expresses his frustrations was amazing, the way he desperately tries to hold back his anger reminded me of a cover trying to stay on the cooking pot while the damp of the coiling water pushes it away. Kate Winslet is as brilliant as DiCaprio is, she gives a devastating, but brilliant performance. She won that year an Oscar for her performance in 'The Reader', but she deserved it for this one as well. DiCaprio wasn't even nominated. Why, I do not know.<br/><br/>The movie is devastating, because it is so relatable. There are so many people living in their seemingly perfect lives, but desperately hoping for something more. Every year they grow older as their regrets start to accumulate. The Wheelers want to escape from this rut and decide to move to Paris, but deep down they know they're stuck, and will never become what they wanted to become back when they were young, back in that bar. Besides this devastating look on the suburban life, there are a few lighter moments. Sam Mendes luckily lightens the mood from time to time by pointing out the silliness of this suburban life in a subtle comedic way. Only, we could have used more of this. <br/><br/>Another strength of this movie, that simply has to be mentioned, is Michael Shannon. He plays this character, who's unfortunately only in the movie for a couple of scenes, that suffers from mental issues. If telling the truth is a mental illness, then this guy is a complete lunatic. With his character, the movie cleverly makes fun of the suburban families for being afraid of the truth to an extent that they send people who actually tell the truth for once to a mental institution. All right, there was something off with this character, perfectly portrayed by Michael Shannon by the way. It is however a shame that his character wasn't more present in the movie. The movie could have benefited from his refreshing presence.<br/><br/>The themes in this movie are intriguing and relatable, the screenplay did an excellent job in making us understand the inner desires and motivations of the characters. The cinematography was terrific as well, and so was the entire ensemble cast. Yet, somehow this depressing tone of the movie became a drag at times. Some lighter moments could have made this movie easier to watch. '12 Years a Slave' had also this continuous depressing tone, without any lighter moments, but still managed to be absolutely perfect. 'Revolutionary Road fails at this, because even though the overall message is devastating and conveyed perfectly, the story is unfortunately not interesting enough to make your care for 2 hours."

","Revolutionary Road (2008) is a movie that contains wonderful performances by Winslet and DiCaprio. I can't remember the last time I saw such wonderful acting! The intense fighting between the wheelers is so raw and real, absolutely nothing is held back in those scenes, which is the way it should be. Winslet and DiCaprio are the wheelers, who are a married couple with two children. Their marriage is on the brink of absolute disaster. Director Sam Mendes, who incidentally is Winslet's former spouse, directs beautifully here, he really captures the essence of this unhappy married couple, and the many problems they experience throughout the film. Many mature issues are tackled here, including infidelity and abortion. Kathy Bates is in the movie as well, she plays her role well, I mean what else could you expect from the great Kathy Bates. The script and dialogue is so wonderfully written, especially the dialogue between the two leads. Revolutionary Road is a very serious mature movie that is not meant for simple escapist entertainment. So if you are just looking to pass a couple hours by and be mindlessly entertained, then this definitely is not the movie for that. It is a great film that I 100% recommend, that is if you want a very serious, perfectly acted, well written movie. 9/10."

","In speaking of his classic novel Revolutionary Road, Richary Yates sees it as an indictment of 50s America clinging onto the modest living that would see so many families safely through the middle class years, not lavishly but comfortably enough. He is on the Wheelers' side of things, and even as he punishes them he sympathises and looks harshly on the neighbours who would immediately be trash-talking the moment their back is turned. When I first read the novel I was much younger and as such very taken by the Wheelers' attempted flight into the sun. Conformity is the mortal enemy of youth, and naturally I too was cheering alongside the pair as they tried desperately to escape the suburban prison that stifled them. But now, years on, I recognise that the story is more complex than that. In showing how glum the middle-class existence is Yates (however intentionally or not) also reveals how very broken and flawed Frank and April are. The couple have internalised a quarter-life of misery, regret and missed opportunities so thoroughly that they clutch blindly at the first chance of a change, no matter how little they have thought of the risks and responsibilities they are leaving behind. Like that first sexual encounter they revel in the brief fervour of the decision, and when that breaks down, foolishly and falsely in empty affairs. <br/><br/>At least some of this has survived the tricky process of adaptation in Sam Mendes' film. Unlike the similar American Beauty, which had the camera caress and lavish the open spaces and spotless canvases of the more prosperous 90s, in Revolutionary Road the walls should compress and close in on the Wheelers. The compositions are sharp all the same, but not inspired. Mendes can't recreate the subtext of the novel in any other way except through flashy and shouty dialogue, which merely simplifies the entire struggle of the family. He has cut the suffocating hum-drum of the Shep and Millie dinners, and missed a vital opportunity to showcase how the environment reinforces the behaviour of the inhabitants of Revolutionary Road and any other street, lane, drive or alley of Connecticut. Mendes has no patience. Instead of allocating time for this to build up to almost agonising levels, he takes the lazy and novel route: flashbacks. <br/><br/>This is the fatal flaw of the film, to assign different versions of Frank and April Wheeler and try to rope us in with false visions of regret. The opening is warm and cosy, the two glamorous leads meet cute and are instantly blubbering on about their various dreams and aspirations (and later whistle and frolic on the lawn after their big decision). And then throughout the film we pull back to when they were younger and feistier and had ambition they can barely recall today. This of course goes against everything that Yates stood for - he wanted the Wheelers to break free from the monotonous conformity of their surroundings, not be designated as special, shiny snowflakes that are held back by those around them. What this results in is the film going down entirely the wrong path, wherein the fault is not within themselves but rather a vague aspect of luck and destiny dealing them a less than completely satisfactory card that eradicates their potential. Mendes can't even delivery fully on that front; the film strains to convince us that Frank is really the 'fine mind' that has been wasted in corporate, although this may just be a delusion of April's. <br/><br/>Winslet is more than capable of playing such a frightened and boxed- in mother and wife; her body is in an ever-bowed position, fretting and rising just enough to put on a weak smile, all the while hiding her quiet desperation and intentions behind it. It is unfortunate that the editing lays her out to dry by needlessly forcing comparison with the past version of April, the graceful and straight-postured aspiring actress. DiCaprio explodes externally as necessary, although the writing betrays his character by portraying his affair as something borne of his natural charm and debonair (we've seen this before, in Catch Me If You Can, Wolf of Wall Street, and so on) rather than an inevitability of the setting. And Michael Shannon is a fine actor wasted in a hokey role (or dramatic device) that bears the ridiculous implication that only the disabled could see through the farce of the suburban American dream, although Yates must bear some of this blame for this. <br/><br/>If there is an inspired moment of change it is something that does not happen until we are well acquainted with Frank and April Wheeler. After a big fight they run off to their respective corners; April the home and Frank the hotel room. It is only after Frank stumbles into that kitchen that I remembered they had two little girls also living with them; so magnified is their desperation and their insecurities within their egos that it effectively pushes their daughters out of the picture. The moment is such a damning reveal of their selfishness, and the lengths of their blind devotion to the Paris dream that all other responsibilities, most importantly parental, are completely forgotten."

","This movie is a must see for anyone who ever had ambition to do something with their life, but got stuck with a job they didn't like, didn't have enough money to realize their dreams or who got bogged down by societal norms on what responsible adults should do once you settle down and have kids. If that's something you can relate to, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful depiction of human expectations, ambition, compromise, identity and disappointment. I bet everyone at some point has felt as lost as Frank about what their purpose in life is or as disillusioned as April about the meaninglessness of a nice house and shiny furniture. This is all of that, and it will hit you in the stomach.<br/><br/>Leo and Kate put out some really good performances, and even though at times April might seem a bit loopy or Frank comes off as a bit of a jerk, it is all very believable and the audience still empathize with both characters. That's great writing, when you can see the choices a characters makes and disagree with them, yet understand fully how they ended up at that bottomless pit.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the ones who prefer light entertainment, romance that conquers all or who are uncomfortable with the darker aspects of human behavior and psychology."

","Revolutionary Road (2008): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon: Another grand achievement by director Sam Mendes who recruits a number of key players from Titanic. Title hints at the false dream often followed that rarely prevails. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank whose job pays well yet leaves him unfulfilled. Kate Winslet plays April, a failed actress who desires a move to Paris yet her latest pregnancy and his promotion damper those plans. Well written yet conclusion is not overly satisfying. Directed by Mendes with many disturbing elements that render discussion. His previous films include such provocative pleasures as American Beauty and Road to Perdition. Much better solid acting by DiCaprio and Winslet on their second film, but like their characters in Titanic, they both end up in different places, only here it is a case of mental stability. Strong supporting work by Michael Shannon as the troubled son of the realtor who is blunt and unforgiving. Kathy Bates plays the cheerful realtor who attempts to welcome them despite her son's behavior. In many ways her disposition opens and closes the film. Michael Shannon steals his scenes as the high strung son of neighbors, and his behavior dictates a low level of comfort. Set in 1950's suburbia where the seemingly perfect lifestyle is a lonely road. Score: 8 / 10"

"brchthethird","6","0","0","12 January 2015"," American Beauty: The 1950's Version
","Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD would like to be a scathing indictment of 1950s America and suburbia but unfortunately fails to say anything fresh, and its satirical edge is remarkably dull. Still, there were some fine performances and individual moments that stand out, not to mention the excellent filmmaking on display. The story is about the Wheelers, a couple who live in the Revolutionary Hill Estates, a Connecticut suburban community. On the outside their life looks idyllic, but underneath it all there is a deep dissatisfaction and resentment that begins to manifest itself. The banality of suburban life is not a new topic in literature or film, and this film does a good job getting the surface details right in order to make its point rather clear. However, I didn't feel like it did anything I haven't seen before in other films, like THE ICE STORM and Sam Mendes' own ""American Beauty."" In fact, this felt a lot like ""American Beauty,"" with the exception that it was set in the 1950s. Even the score was reminiscent of the one for that previous film. However, that one had a more arty feel that this film didn't have. Still, despite the (ironically) banal subject matter, this film was well put together on every front, both technical and performance-wise. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job playing their roles, although there isn't too much depth to their characters at all. There were a few smaller roles that had familiar faces behind them, but they also felt under-developed. By far the best performance in the entire film was a small role played by Michael Shannon, the temporarily institutionalized son of the couple who sold the house on Revolutionary Road to the Wheelers. His couple of scenes have that acerbic wit and bite to them that I wish had been more prevalent in the overall story, which felt downright sterile at times. From a technical standpoint, the film is flawless and the photography was beautiful, belying the ugliness of the atmosphere projected by its characters. Overall, I didn't hate this film but I didn't think it entirely justified its existence either. It does a good job of portraying suburban malaise, but at the end of it you have to ask ""So what?"" Still it made for a pleasant, if unspectacular, viewing experience and was capped off with the perfect ending."

","Revolutionary Road is a very strong drama that focuses around the happiness, or I shall say unhappiness of a middle-class, married couple of seven years. While not reaching the heights of 1999's American Beauty, this film serves the same purpose. They both touch on the subject of the dour effects that some people have about their status and how they are not living life the way they want to. In other words, this film can serve as a prequel to the fore-mentioned film. But this is a well-acted, tense drama that stays true to the literary source novel.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes, who previously directed American Beauty, directs a film about a couple named Frank and April Wheeler. They are seemingly happy as Frank commutes to New York City for work and April is the typical housewife. But Frank despises his job and April is not pleased about how her life turned out to be. One day, she suggests moving to Paris. While reluctant, Frank finally agrees. But complications ensue which causes problems after problems and can the Wheelers survive these problems? <br/><br/>A film like this needs to rely on their actors and thankfully this film delivers. The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since their historic pairing in 1997's Titanic. They both are fantastic and their chemistry is as great as always. It's funny because in Titanic, you can see the romantic love. In this film, you can see the tough love. Michael Shannon delivers one of his best performances as the son of the realtors who suffers from mental issues. We also get good performances from Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, and David Harbour.<br/><br/>Overall, Revolutionary Road is an excellent film. It plays out to be a small-town drama, but it goes bigger than that. I liked how this film can be described as a poor-man's American Beauty. It essentially is, but they are both excellent, unique films. The cinematography and costume design is great and same can be said for Thomas Newman's quiet, but excellent score. This is a really good movie built around the talents of Leonardo and Kate. I rate this film 9/10."

","Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in ""Revolutionary Road,"" a 2008 film directed by Sam Mendes. The film also features Kathy Bates and John Givings.<br/><br/>It's 1955. Frank and April Wheeler have been married seven years, live in the Connecticut suburb and have two children. Frank works for a company that his father worked for, and he hates his job. April is a stay-at-home mom who wanted to be an actress.<br/><br/>While it might look good on the outside, this isn't the life either one envisioned. But April has an idea. They have enough money saved so that they can move to Paris, a city Frank loves. She can get a job as a secretary, which pays very well over there, and Frank can stay at home and decide what he really wants to do with his life. It sounds possible but maybe not practical, though Frank ultimately agrees to it.<br/><br/>Frank can't seem to find the right moment to give his notice; and then April discovers that she is pregnant. What now? There are lots of layers in this emotionally resonant, magnificently acted film. It's very much a story of its time for several reasons. The first is that it's obvious that April suffers from very bad depression. Though post-war psychological problems were recognized, actual depression, especially in a woman, probably wasn't given much attention. It was the returning soldiers who had suffered trauma who had the psychiatric focus. If by some means she had been discovered to have clinical depression, the medicine was horrible.<br/><br/>The second thing is that it was 1955. The ideas of picking up and moving to Europe with your family and the woman as breadwinner were outrageous back then. Now, not so much.<br/><br/>The third reason is that April at least had an artist's mentality and an artist's way of looking at the world. In this world, we have the practical and the artist, as in the O'Neill play Beyond the Horizon, where one brother is a farmer and the other brother is a poet who dreams of going out to sea. The problem is, there's no way to kill those attributes, and if you try, you won't be happy. April shouldn't have been married, shouldn't have been living in the suburbs, and shouldn't have stayed home.<br/><br/>Frank is more practical, though he'd like to be different, would like to do something he loves, if only he knew what that was. April thought he was cosmopolitan, adventurous, and that together, they'd be special. The idea that they're not special is something she can't tolerate.<br/><br/>This is such a fascinating movie about life's disappointments, punctuated with some humor by Kathy Bates as Mrs. Givings, a loquacious woman, whose son (Michael Shannon) has been institutionalized. When he meets the Wheelers, he has an uncanny way of speaking exactly the truth no one wants to hear. Shannon does a fantastic job in these disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>A shattering movie. I like to be entertained in films. I feel like we all have so much to reality to face, why not be able to turn away from it - but a beautifully realized film like this about dysfunction - somehow, I don't mind."

","Marriage is a beautiful and often stressful bond between two people that allows us to tests ourselves and express our love. Cinema reflects this but also focuses on the hardship a married couple can endure. Sam Mendes being the paperboy for this directorial role worked with his wife Kate Winslet and her old ""Titanic"" partner Leonardo Dicaprio in ""Revolutionary Road"". April (Winslet) and Frank (Dicaprio) Wheeler are a middle class married couple living in suburban Connecticut,1955. The two met at an elegant party years ago and have been in lover ever since. After they discuss their future plans, they find themselves being stuck in between and the opposite of what they thought they would be like. Frank is an overworked New York City businessman while April is a stay at home mom for their two kids. The couple soon realizes they must change their life as they quarrel and support each other throughout their battle. This film didn't live up to the extreme drama it promised and the rich writing I thought I would have heard. Instead, it is a slow-moving and mostly powerful look at a marriage that is similar to other marriages portrayed in other films. April and Frank are not enjoyable characters at all, and there aren't many supporting characters to allow us to escape from the two of them. Were stuck with them for the entire time. Sam Mendes doesn't keep his beautiful craftsmanship that he had in ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" in this one. He makes a dry film that focuses too much on the production design and not enough on a detailed marriage. The film isn't juicy enough in the sense that there isn't much moving about it and that not much happens until the last half hour to really grasp your emotions. Winslet and Dicaprio are brilliant actors here. The first hour and a half they give still performances, but the last half of and hour is pure dramatic acting with one particularly mesmerizing lengthy argument towards the end between the two of them. Dicaprio screams his head off where Winslet uses her facial expressions to shows her feelings. There is also a surprise cameo by Michael Shannon that will shock you. He speaks his mind and might even show what Frank and April are unwillingly wanting to say. This film shows an unoriginal marital story that has its strong moments and impeccable acting."

","Revolutionary Road is a 2008 American drama film, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, directed by Sam Mendes. This is the second collaboration between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who previously co-starred in Titanic. Her performance earned Kate Winslet a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a further three Golden Globes, four BAFTAs and three Oscars. The film is lavishly dark. It tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different. They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have."

These two actors are completely in sync with each other and it shows in the believability of the films they make.<br/><br/>I think that Alice was totally incapable of being the suburban housewife She simply could not continue when her dream of moving to Paris was destroyed. Honestly, I'm not sure why she did what she did - whether she intended to commit suicide or just terminate her pregnancy. It seems to the viewer that she had options, but a person in such a situation doesn't see the options and that is the tragedy.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the supporting actors, especially the neighbor ""Shep"" who was in love with April and could not express his devastation at losing her. The realtor's son John who is on leave from the insane asylum is marvelous and provides the role of ""Greek chorus"" you might say. Speaking the truth but in a non socially-acceptable manner.

","If you took Mendes' ""American Beauty"", then sucked the contemporary setting and satirical bite out of it, you would get this film he made nearly a decade later. That is not to say that he is overly-repetitious or that this is a bad film by any measure. It is a powerful, well-written movie with two Oscar worthy performances by two stars well-known for their romance on the Titanic. Here they play a couple on the opposite side of the love spectrum, two people growing sick of each other and their plain and boring lives. The drama that results is so realistic and so spastic that it will shock you. The only problem with the movie is its lack of timeliness. This movie would have been revolutionary had it been filmed in the sixties or even in the seventies, but with dozens of suburban angst films proceeding it, ""Revolutionary Road"", just like its two main characters is bound to get lost in the shuffle."

","Of course the last time Leo and Kate made a film together, they played youthful star- crossed lovers in a doomed relationship. Here, they are older and altogether disenchanted, although again the outcome is doomed. The former of course was ""Titanic"", for me an overblown, badly-written melodrama but here we have a warts and all examination of a stale marriage set in mid-50's ""I like Ike"" suburban USA, based on a modern literary classic. The special effects are certainly better in the film about the ship but I know which I prefer.<br/><br/>The film is an up close study of a marriage going wrong. On the face of it this youngish couple should be happy, like their neighbours seem to be. They have a nice house, he has a steady job, they have two kids and are considered the perfect couple. But like the song says, in every dream home a heartache and so it proves.<br/><br/>After dissecting the modern American marriage to a degree in ""American Beauty'"", Sam Jaafe (Winslet's husband at the time) gets the scalpel out again for this movie set some 50 years before. Some aspects however, whilst I appreciate they are in the original novel, don't work for me, in particular the introduction of the recently institutionalised son of an older neighbourly couple, who is there to point out the flaws in the Wheeler marriage which we presumably somehow mssed in the preceding hour. Add to that he uses some downright abhorrent phrases that only repel rather than enlighten with his parents saying nary a word against him.<br/><br/>I also feel De Caprio is miscast here. He looks too baby-faced for the part of the treacherous husband but Winslet does well as the frustrated wife who can only find release from her straitjacket with the most extreme of solutions. <br/><br/>Nevertheless the film has a gathering power as it builds up to its desperate climax and makes for strong, sobering viewing."

","How do you dissect a seemingly perfect relationship? How thin is the line between love and hate? Danny DeVito attempted an answer to these questions in ""The War of the Roses"". So did Roman Polanski in the controversial ""Bitter Moon"". Director Sam Mendes not only answers these questions but goes on to prove that every relationship feeds expectations, but the real question is how much are you willing to compromise to keep those ever so minute cracks from growing on that all too perfect wedding portrait.<br/><br/>Hypothetically speaking, what if a couple of young lovers where to survive a massive ship wreck over the icy Atlantic, get married, and settle down in middle class suburbia. What would their marriage seem like somewhere around the dreaded seven year itch? With absolutely no reference to the ""Titanic"", Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are cast together again, this time as Frank and April Wheeler, a perfect couple in the eyes of friends and neighbors. Frank is an average nine to fiver at a city office and April is a homemaker aspiring to be an actress. While the possibility of living the American dream seem far out of reach, the Wheeler's plan on moving to Paris for what would hopefully be a much better life. April would find a good job to support the family while Frank would reflect on his true calling. Though a simple plan, negative vibes soon start to tear the very fabric of their relationship. Some of these include disapproving and jealous neighbors, severely bruised egos and even the slight case of infidelity. To make matters worse, April conceives for the third time, throwing the metaphorical spanner into the works, turning what was once love and adoration into utter loathing.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Winslet does it again. A power house performance by the two leads would be an understatement, given this film was nominated for three Oscars amongst other nominations and awards. Add to that an ensemble lineup of supporting roles from Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Michael Shannon and even Kathy Bates (also starred in the Titanic). Film noir fans will welcome this remarkable movie from Sam Mendes, especially after his dark tale of a dysfunctional family in ""American Beauty"". <br/><br/>Couples watching this movie will find it hard to take sides. Both Frank and April are characters that could be any John and Mary. Adapted from Richard Yates' novel of the same name, costumes, sound track and cinematography are flawlessly integrated into a script that paints a vivid picture of what life leading up to the golden years was all about."

","Revolutionary Road is a stunning film based in 1950s America, yet it holds a universal message of love and life.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the struggling relationship of April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's a great reunion of these two, both portraying their characters' clashing emotions fantastically right from the start. I love how the film begins with an argument, foreshadowing the constant issues that the couple have.<br/><br/>The iconic book on which the story is based may explain the 1950s setting yet it almost gives reason for the entrapment that they both feel; today it would be acceptable for the couple to separate, whereas then it may have been frowned upon, forcing them both to stay in this 'endless hopelessness'.<br/><br/>The use of music works for both the ups and the downs of their lives. A creepy, slow paced, soft piano score which seems both happy and sad and, if you've seen the film before, reminds you of the traumatic ending the whole way through, heightening the sense of reality amongst the appearance of their perfect 1950s lives. I feel a connection to Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby with this idea; a lot of things in the 1950s are portrayed as idealised, people living their perfect lives with their perfect wives and children, but the reality is much more negative.<br/><br/>The use of costume gives a sense of uniformity, especially during the train station scene when Frank Wheeler seems lost amongst a sea of grey and tan suits and hats. It symbolises his inability to break free from uniformity, from the expectations that life has, an inability to become that 'something special' that Helen keeps saying they have. Frank seems as alone here as April does in her house on her own day after day. They both feel alone in their relationship and in their lives generally; it's as much a story of love which cannot work as it is a story of the expectations people have of what their lives should be, and the inability to break free from this. It gives the audience a universal message of the struggle for happiness in both love and life and, as quoted from the film itself, the fact that 'it takes courage to live the life you want.'"

","To me, Revolutionary Road is a movie that reflects upon the difficulties some couples face in their relationships with each other. In this film, even though at times the Wheelers expressed hatred to one another, I do not think that their love for each other disappeared; I think that it just got camouflaged in the many problems that the couple faced. This is evident in one of the fight scenes which leads to April running out into the woods, but Frank runs after her, showing that even though he said nasty words to her, he still loved her. Otherwise, he wouldn't have cared where April was or where she was running off to.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes in this movie were emotional and sad to watch. The ending of Revolutionary Road was one such scene. One of the most powerful scene in this movie was seeing Frank running away from the hospital when April tragically passed away after trying to abort the child she was carrying for more than 12 weeks. Frank's running at that point symbolizes how much April meant to his life, and how her death was so emotionally traumatizing to him.<br/><br/>As usual, Leornado DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both incredible actors, and through their passionate acting, they bring to life the difficulties that the Wheelers face in their 1950s life. Both Leornado DiCaprio and Kate Winslet become so emotional at times through their acting, that myself as a member of the audience can almost feel the difficulties that they are having in their lives and in their relationship together. I believe that Sam Mendes really chose the ideal actors to play in this film, and not too many actors can act in the incredible way that Leornado and Kate performed in. <br/><br/>Overall, I rated this movie a 9/10 because it was so real, so passionate, and an amazing movie!!!"

This novel is about the lives which was true in 1950's and its true in every era, its timeless. The dreams of ordinary middle class suburban peoples, their lives around their houses and dreams. But the same people wanted to achieved those dreams and try to fulfill those promises but in the end, they forced by every possible circumstances to live the lives they hate about. They have to work to the place they hate about it, but they just cant control those things. AS THE LIFE IS A DIAMOND, AND ALL THEY HAVE TO LICK THAT DIAMOND EVERYDAY AND LIVE. Some people cope better by lying to themselves and some people couldn't cope in best possible way and like their dreams their lives will shattered in thousands pieces of glass. Frank cope and understands the practicality of his life and his family life, he worked hard at every opportunity and already compromised to the life, to the future he has to end up with, but his wife tried another way out, the whole new future and wanted to give a try, a try too hard and when she sees no hope of that future and that dream she took extreme step. As far as movie is concern Sam took the book and made the movie as close as possible, he literally took back to 1950's. Acting wise, well, I was hoping a brilliant performance by Kate by all means and of course she performed brilliantly, but the one actor who did more than his fare share of role, it was Leonardo, he just blow me away with his acting. He acted so well, in the role of Frank that, you will feel sympathy, sorry and sorrow for Frank and Leo made it possible.

","""Revolutionary Road"" is a brilliant ,engaging and a devastating movie(with a great direction) ,near to perfection, from one of the most original and amazing director(Sam Mendes).It is based on a beautiful and touching book from Richard Yates. What I found interesting is the portrayal of the broken dreams of Frank(Leonardo Dicaprio in an under-appreciated stellar performance)and April(a terrific performance by Kate Winslet)and their struggles. Of course,there are not totally positive or negative characters(although April can be cruel in a way that Frank can't be)but overall I believe that both of them are simply too selfish to admit clearly what's wrong with them.The story is a clever example of people that are not capable to live a seemingly wealthy existence, in particularly April who shows ominous signs of mental illness. Sam Mendes is one of the best director.His movies are honest and occasionally shocking. He's not afraid to bare the souls of the characters he describes.The script is truly great and allows the actors to display their abilities.For his terrific performance Leonardo DiCaprio was not even considered for a Best Actor nomination which I consider a real shame since the role is very demanding and he completely disappears inside it.Kate Winslet shows once again why she is one of the best actress of her generation and she wasn't nominated for an Oscar just because she was up for that award with another great performance in The reader.The supporting cast adds very much to the general beauty of the movie.Michael Shannon and Kathy Bates are just priceless. The picture deserved an Oscar nominations for Best movie and Best director given the polished work Mendes did,one of the most daring and competent director we have.My vote is 8/10."

This is a great movie with superb acting, music score, scenery, costumes, set design - everything top notch. I saw The Hurt Locker recently and found that movie so utterly depressing. This movie was not. I believe the whole point of this movie is to ask those deep philosophical questions of oneself such as, what makes you feel inspired and alive every single minute of everyday? What's your ultimate purpose in life? What motivates you? What makes you special? Personally, I found this movie very helpful, and for me, the moral of the story is this: Life continues no matter how hopeless it feels. I would suggest watching A Serious Man after this movie."

Richard Yates book and Sam Mendes film is perhaps that, but it does offer insights you usually won't get from most media in this country. i never read Yate's American classic, but i do know Mendes, and viewing things from a hard perspective is what Mendes does best. look at 'American Beauty' and what excellent but hard, stern film that was. not all of America lives up to Walt Disney's idealistic vision of this country. not everything is okay with suburbia, marriage and the ""American Dream"".<br/><br/>it's a little spooky when the only character in a play that seems sane is the crazy guy. beautifully played by Michael Shannon (was he nominated for this? he should have.)and it's equally disturbing to think death is the only way out.<br/><br/>so much of the film is summed up in the end scenes where the couple next door decides ""we won't talk about the Wheelers again"". classic case of American denial."

","I'll try hard not to reveal too much about the plot, but I know I'll slip, so see the film first if endings are of utmost importance to you..<br/><br/>I must admit that the first time I watched Revolutionary Road(RR), I commented to others that I did not find the experience a pleasant one. Thank heavens I did not allow my initial response to a less than typical 'Hollywood ending' to prevent me from giving the film a second screening. Upon reexamination, I have concluded that this is truly one of the most intense, gripping and thought-provoking dramas of the last decade (or beyond).<br/><br/>A second viewing afforded the opportunity to watch, with great interest, the absolutely masterful performances of Winslet and DiCaprio, supported ably by a wonderful cast. With RR, the acting is the key. Of course Sam Mendes' directorial effort showcases these performances and brings Yates' epic novel critiquing 50's suburban life into sharp focus.<br/><br/>The era of the mid 1950's is very well presented in this film, with a great soundtrack, spot-on architecture, sets and costumes. It helps set-up a love/hate relationship with that 'innocent' decade while allowing the story to play out in contrast. Tunes from the film,including another Oscar caliber theme by Thomas Newman and fifties hits like Crying in The Chapel and Count Every Star haunted me for weeks, finally leading to a purchase of the soundtrack. DiCaprio, now a mature actor far from the boyish Jack, is paired again with his accomplished co-star from Titanic, Kate Winslet, in the role of Frank Wheeler. Wheeler and wife April (Winslet) met in the post WWII years, shared dreams of great futures and shared a disdain for typical suburban life before settling, themselves, in suburban Connecticut. What follows is an examination of how differently these two handle leading what they once regarded as dull and generally inferior lives. April is emotional and passionate about her early ideals while Frank seems to have learned to accept 'success' in the white collar world. At times, April seems to hate her spouse for abandoning early shared dreams, while Frank desperately wants to retain April's love and respect. Some emotionally supercharged scenes ensue.<br/><br/>I must mention one co-star in particular. Kathryn Hahn is amazing as Milly Campbell, the Wheelers' next door neighbor and spouse to Shep(David Harbour), Frank's best friend. Both do a tremendous job portraying the typical, happy suburban couple with insecurities and passions restrained in a way unthinkable to April. Hahn is worth watching closely in key scenes where the Wheelers share some unconventional plans to regain their lost goals. Her facial expressions are priceless.<br/><br/>If you appreciate fine acting,intense adult drama played out in harsh reality,RR is for you. Even if you saw it once and reacted negatively to a rather shocking conclusion, watch it again and simply enjoy the professionals who act a true masterpiece. Leo and Kate have never done better."

","For a British director Sam Mendes seems to have a great understanding of American culture and he has a great interest in the darker side of American culture. Mendes reunions Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio for this dark, gritty piece of Americana set story.<br/><br/>Winslet and DiCaprio play April and Frank Wheeler, a unhappy married couple that live in 1950s East Coast America in the suburbs. April was a failed actress and a housewife whilst Frank is an unhappy salesman for the same company his father work at. Outwardly people thing they are the perfect couple with a nice family; but no one knows what happens behind closed doors. Desperate for a chance April suggest to Frank moving to Paris so he can find himself and be happy in the city of live. April has plans on how the move would work and the two make serious preparations to move the family abroad. But event conspirer against April's plans and whilst the married couple have a brief period of happiness their relationship becomes very strained.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is an actor's film: it is filled with excellent performances with DiCaprio and Winslet at their best. They are believable as the couple of the piece and this is such a realistic scenario about how a relationship going wrong. The supporting performances were excellent, with people believing the illusion of the Wheelers and the other character seeming to have a need for it. This is most evident with the female characters Helen (Kathy Bates) and Milly (Kathryn Hahn).<br/><br/>Mendes handles the material, trying to balance out both April and Frank's good and bad part and they both change amongst themselves as the protagonist and the antagonist. He gets the best out the actors and his skill behind the camera adds to the power, like when April has to make a phone call and the camera moves away and April gives the audience a voice-over. Mendes could have easily have shot the film in a dark hand-held style which is popular at the moment. Yet Mendes kept he kept the film well lit and its offers a great juxtaposition of the nice setting of suburbia and the darkness of the relationship. There are excellent themes in the film, there is the idea of broken and unfulfilled dreams, an important aspect in some of American literature like Of Mice and Men. There is the obvious film of a relationship going wrong, with the people starting a family and creating a home just because it's the normal thing, not because it's the best thing to do. As well the film looks at the idea of illusion that people will put up to protect themselves and other people believing it. Revolutionary Road was very much like American Beauty, looking at the dark underbelly of American suburbia, but this time, set in the 50s.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is very strong for the most part, they could have shown a little more about how the relationship broke down in the first place and the children did not play a big a role as they should have.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is a melodrama: but it's an very good melodrama and sometimes that is what the audience needs."

Every problem they have, the man starts some discussion and the woman tries to avoid it, in contrary to the usual, a typical change of roles.<br/><br/>Years later he keeps working in an unpleasant job while she is a housewife with two children.

He is the one that understand the hopeless emptiness that rule their hearts. However it seems that the emptiness is stronger in the woman than in the man.<br/><br/>The woman than acts like an actress in her real life.

This decision was foolhardy but I think he could convince his wife to go on vacation first, or something like that. He couldn't just say her plan, her dream was silly.<br/><br/>The main problem between the couple is that April dream about glamour and Frank was more realistic, more grounded.<br/><br/>Something I liked very much in the movie is the acting of Kathy Bates and the fact that she smokes a lot, even when pregnant. That was realistic because the time of the movie is around the fifties.<br/><br/>Something I didn't like in the movie was that even though they are parents of two children and some of their problems is because of them, the kids rarely appear in the screen. Other thing I didn't like was the scene he tells her wife that he has cheated on her.<br/><br/>But overall I liked because the movie makes you think. Sam Mendes is really nice."

Is an ordinary life worth giving up the chance to be someone special?<br/><br/>Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) are a happily married couple. Frank is a dreamer, and wants to go back to Paris because people are ""alive"" there, but after April became pregnant, they moved to the suburbs to live a normal life. But April is not happy as an ordinary housewife, and Frank is just as miserable having ended up in a job that he swore to avoid. So they decide to move to Paris so that they can live the life that they were ""meant"" to. But are they willing to take that chance?<br/><br/>In 1997, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet created one of the greatest screen romances of our time in ""Titanic."" Eleven years later, the real life best friends have returned on screen together in an entirely different kind of film. It is a credit to their skill and versatility that Frank and April Wheeler are NOTHING like Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt-Bukater. DiCaprio and Winslet are wonderful in their roles. Both are trapped in a situation that they hate, but can't escape.<br/><br/>The other actors vary, however. Kathy Bates is miscast as Helen Givings, the only person who really seems to have fully bought into this sitcom-ish life. Bates is a good actress, but she's not right for the part. A cynic might say that this was to draw on the popularity of the ""Titanic"" connection, but I doubt it. ""Revolutionary Road"" will not appeal to that crowd, and the two leads are a strong enough appeal anyway (but with Hollywood, you never know...). Michael Shannon is excellent as John, Helen's son who was in the mental hospital for his opinion that this life that everyone seems to be living is a delusion. Shannon has made a career of off-the-wall performances, but this is one of his best. Unfortunately, the character sometimes comes off as a writer's construct than a real individual, and Shannon is unable to solve this problem. Of special note is David Harbour, who plays the Wheelers' next door neighbor and friend, Shep. It's a passionate and heartfelt performance, and it should grant Harbour some notice.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes already peered behind the white picket fence in ""American Beauty,"" which I have not seen. But there has been no greater criticism of the delusion portrayed by the classic 1950's sitcoms like ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"" than ""Revolutionary Road.""

","As I settled into this movie, I began to sense a feeling of familiarity (I caught it a few minutes into it) with the subject matter, then I realized the setting and time-frame were not present day, they were, in fact, back in the 1950s. At first it seemed like an ordinary run-of-the-mill period piece, but as I allowed myself to be absorbed by the movie's theme and subject matter, I realized that it was quite an interesting story after all. In fact, it was, at times, disturbingly realistic, as I can speak from personal experience, having grown up within that same time period, when life was 'supposed' to be simpler. When I came to realize it was from the same Director as the film ""American Beauty"", I knew why it held my attention so, because this man can really tell an interesting story and is quite impressive as a creative artist. I won't say it was an entertaining experience, as the subject matter is not your typical feel-good fare, but it is a very compelling movie that I intend on watching from the beginning, and then over again, because it was so interesting. It is also much more plausible in terms of realism than its predecessor, American Beauty. Great job Mssrs. Mendes, DiCaprio, Shannon and Mss. Winslet, Bates et al!"

","I believe that it was in early 2008 that I heard that a new film was coming out that would be pairing stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on the screen together again, 11 years after they were the king and queen of the world in ""Titanic"" (1997). That long wait happens again in the 2008 film ""Revolutionary Road.""<br/><br/>Now I'm a guy and I'm a sucker for romances, so that when I heard that the power-couple of ""Titanic"" were teaming up again for a new film due out later in 2008, you can bet that I waited with eager anticipation to see this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, in all likelihood, made film history with ""Titanic"" by becoming probably the new Hollywood screen couple. And while the two are together again in the Sam Mendes-directed ""Revolutionary Road,"" they are very much the complete opposite of the characters they made famous 11 years prior in ""Titanic.""<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is an adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates, and concerns the Wheeler family, spear-headed by Frank (DiCaprio) and his wife April (Winslet), who live with their two children in a lovely New York suburb. Remembering that the two are the opposites of the characters they portrayed in 1997, their marriage is very much on the rocks from the opening moments. Set in 1955, they live a picturesque life as a picturesque, perfect American couple, you know, the type of unique American family that all the rest of American families should try to be like.<br/><br/>Things couldn't be any more farther removed from the truth.<br/><br/>Frank hates his job as a lowly tech salesperson, and has often dreamed of better things in life. April is pretty much the ideal housewife who does the incredibly simple task of making a decent home life for her family. April soon comes up with the idea that in order to get what they both want out of life, that it would be nice to move to Paris, France, and try to start over. She'll get a job as a secretary, she says, while Frank will stay at home with the kids and try to figure things out. It's a lovely dream, but a highly unrealistic one, and soon numerous factors (internal as well as external) come out that threaten to tear this already faulty family unit apart.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not one to really jump on the bandwagon of the latest Hollywood flick that's primed to sweep the Oscars. However, I found ""Revolutionary Road"" to be something that is a little bit higher than the usual Hollywood drivel. I found the missing link in most Hollywood pictures purely in the star-power of the two lead performers. It was a sight to see DiCaprio and Winslet together again. (I might as well as proclaim them as my ultimate, favorite screen couple.) That they're together again under different circumstances and playing vastly different characters than the ones they immortalized in ""Titanic"" is part of the experience. I found their characters to be brutally honest about themselves and inherently imperfect, but full-blooded and really life-like; essentially, they're real people here.<br/><br/>I like Leonardo DiCaprio. He is one of my favorite actors. He has shaped up in the time since ""Titanic"" to become one of the film community's most versatile and talented performers; he is no longer the ""King of the World"" boy-toy he was in ""Titanic's"" hey-day. (When is this man going to win an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe?) Kate Winslet proved to be the real winner here, since she won a Golden Globe for her performance here (as well as an Oscar for ""The Reader,"" which I haven't seen, but I say she should have won it for this film, too). Her performance is honest to begin with, but halfway through takes a turn down a much darker route that was totally unforeseeable by anyone in the audience.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is a real movie, a real movie that is full-blooded and smart. I should have said this way earlier, but I had to watch the film for a college class recently, and it was my first time seeing it. I have no idea how I missed this movie while it was in the theaters. But I was glad I had the grand opportunity to see what was one of the best - if not the best - drama films of 2008.<br/><br/>10/10"

","REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a challenging work, in that it is based on a novel written by author Richard Yates back in the early 1960s. It is interesting that the film version appears now. The movie is intriguing and worthy, almost a poetic exposition of some of the sociological observations of the late C. Wright Mills, so it's not an easy cruise. But it's very good, a bold piece from director Sam Mendes.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are Frank and April Wheeler, an upper middle class Long Island couple whose marriage has gone sour as the dreams of a life in the arts or pursuit of life of mind have succumbed to the career realities of mortgage payments, children and upper class mobility. The setting is a relatively prosperous Long Island suburb during the 1950s.<br/><br/>Frank Wheeler is a junior level executive for a business machine company, and spends many of his lunch hours drinking and commiserating with friends. The tension between he and April leads him to dalliances with secretaries, and the audience is witness to a manipulative trist he has with a 19 year old receptionist who falls under his ""charm"". April spends most of her days caught in the domestic trap that all too many women knew in the mid-1950s, housework and daydreaming about days gone by. At the beginning of the film, we see her performing in a community theater play that is poorly received by the audience, and she remains frustrated by the abandonment of her theater dreams.<br/><br/>Bored and alienated by middle class suburbia and the quiet presumption imposed by neighbors caught in a similar bind, Frank and April decide they're going to sell the house and move their lives with their two children over to France. And, as fate would have it, this dream emerges at the exact same time that the company Frank works for decides that he's a bright new idea man, and offers him a big promotion. Frank is now caught between his undefined personal dreams and the possibilities of real material advancement. April, who knows desperately that she wants something much different then the life of a suburban housewife, but, who like most women of that era, rarely is allowed time or space to develop her ideas about who she is, clings wildly to the escape plan. Frank is a stormy individual caught in the casual lies most men from the professional classes in that era were bought into, and he frequently takes advantage of the enhanced isolation that is driving April nuts through engaging in abusive tirades.<br/><br/>The film becomes deep tragedy over an unwanted pregnancy before its end, but along the way, some rather penetrating commentary on the Wheeler's situation by the son of a neighbor who has been struggling with mental illness lights up the Wheeler's reality better than either of the protagonists can, burdened as they are by the deceptions of careerism, extramarital dalliances, and parenting roles that neither of them really seem to want. The atmosphere of the piece, then, is like a high summer day on Long Island, humid with a high chance of rain. The viewer knows that some sort of cloudburst is going to come, and there's not much surprise when one of life's lethal downpours arrives and reshapes the lives of the central characters. All the same, Winslett and DiCaprio and their supporting cast carry this difficult piece quite ably. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is a keeper."

Myself I would have liked to seen them get to Paris and feel the same way they felt when they were in the US. This film is set in the 1950,s so there are no doctors perscribing anti depressants which I think would have helped the character April and Frank we see in the film used alchol to a great deal.All in all a very moving film about the ""American Dream"". As far as the ending of this film I was expecting a major train wreck.

","I have not read the novel, nor, I believe, anything else by Yates, though I would like to. From what I understand, it does not delve as much into the female lead as this does. I knew that I wanted to watch this from the moment I saw the trailer, and it did not disappoint me in the least. There is so much poignancy and so many brilliant observations about human psychology, nature and relationships in this, and, without knowing with certainty, I can imagine that they can be traced back to the author of the book. This is immensely realistic, as well as rather authentic... it really does feel like something out of the 50's. The plot is compelling all the way, and it develops well throughout. This is well-paced, there is not a boring moment to be found. The characters are credible, well-written and deep. Every role is well-cast, and DiCaprio and Winslet(who seems capable of exuding a ton of emotion with as little as a glance of her eyes) are flawless. All of the acting performances are spot-on. This is engaging and impeccably dramatic. You can't help but sympathize with the pair's struggle against conformity. This is not for those who see films as being escapism, as you might expect from anything by Mendes. The editing and cinematography are excellent, and the look of this is not glamorized. There is infrequent strong language, a little sexuality, and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and informative commentary track by Sam and Justin Haythe(who adapted this for the screen), a well-done featurette, and deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director's thoughts on them. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10"

A friend of mine had told me, that it was one of the best movies he had watched in 2009. While some movies suffer from high expectations, this one didn't. It's high class drama (if there is such a word/phrase), dark and really ""brutal"" (not in an explicit kind of way).<br/><br/>Acting wise, Kate and Leo really give their best, but they have strong supporting cast to play with.

","Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play April and Frank Wheeler who reunite on screen for the first time in eleven years since the acclaimed blockbuster 'Titanic'. However this time their doom is not a famed ocean liner's decent into the Atlantic but of a marriage descending into the stultifying stillness of suburban life in the 50's. The character are dreamers if you might who don't see their house on Revolutionary Road in Conneticut as a sanctuary but as a prison in which there is no escape. Sam Mendes was the perfect choice as director as the film deals with similar themes to his Oscar winning film 'American Beauty.' His direction is perfect as the audience is never allowed to step back and examine the damage which fate has brought upon the two characters. Instead the camera is constantly on the two leads faces not missing a single reaction that is crucial to the understanding of the motivations of these strange but hauntingly normal characters. There is a possibility that audiences maybe put off by the two characters because they don't play for sympathy, they are too good as actors to do this and their honest performances reflect that because if the actors were to play for sympathy it would be missing the point. Us as an audience live in a day now where free-thinking is widely accepted and acknowledge. Not stifled at first glance and if the actors played for empathy then we would be taken out of their predicament. We as an audience must accept that in another time these two character could have been happy but sadly their fate is doomed in this adaptation of Richard Yates novel - perhaps one of the finest pieces of American literature."

Although initially hating the movie after I saw it, I came to realize that their performances were so convincing that I, an objective member of the audience, became so emotionally involved in the lives of the two fictional characters on screen before me that their pain became unbearable to endure. I watched as their marriage crumbled more and more rapidly before my eyes not too far into the movie. The flashbacks were effective as they portrayed the ""american dream"" the couple were striving for prior to the horrendous fallout. As the movie progressed, so did my emotional attachment...leading me to the heartbreaking ending. Be warned that this movie is NOT TITANIC! There is NO timeless romance for the ages. There is NO Rose and Jack. There is NO happy ending! You will get great performances accompanied by the great writing and directing. I will NEVER watch this movie again in the remainder of my life!

","Without going into the plot of the movie as many of the comments from this website have impeccably done so already, I came away at first blush that the writer and author of this story - Richard Yates - provided a moral about relationships in a marriage and how fragile they can turn out to be, when couples, who impose an emotional overload upon each other in their marriage, are doomed to failure. Leonardo and Kate's performances were excellent and well tuned to the moral behind this story. The most telling to me was the final scene between the senior couple - Howard Givings ( Richard Easton ) and Helen Givings ( Kathy Bates ) - when Howard subtly revealed a good deal of anger at Helen during her trash-talk about the Wheeler family, but then thought the better of it by tuning her out by shutting off his hearing-aid. Richard Easton's performance from this scene was the most telling about the entire movie as far as I was concerned. Perhaps I was reading too much into this scene about avoiding emotional overloading a relationship."

","It's the 1950s in the United States and Frank and April Wheeler meet, marry, have two kids and purchase a picturesque house in the suburbs. This attractive young couple seems headed for a realization of the America Dream, but they understand too late the compromises that they must accept to get there. Frank is in marketing for Knox Business Machines where he goes every day dressed in a suit and tie, wearing his fedora. Sitting in his cubicle day after day he comes to feel that this is not what he had in mind for his life. Meanwhile, on the home front April is feeling the boredom of the daily routine intensely oppressive. Instead of admitting that maybe life is not going to turn out to be as glamorous as envisioned in some unspecified fantasy, April has the idea that she and Frank can break out of their perceived drab existence by moving to Paris. She convinces Frank of this idea and right then you know that rough times are probably ahead, since neither of them has the ability to think far enough ahead to see what such a move would entail. They have arrived at one of those node points in a relationship that, once a big idea is on the table, and under serious consideration, it's going to be difficult to back off of it or go forward with it, particularly if the idea is not supported equally. Maybe Frank and April's experiment could have been performed, but when the complications of a promotion for Frank and April's pregnancy arise you realize that the marriage is probably doomed. <br/><br/>This is a film where you drop in on some people and get to know them well and see the tragic consequences of their decisions. Frank and April get so deep into their misadventure that they can't right the ship by the time they grasp their situation. There is some keenly observed dialog, like Frank's comment, ""Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control."" The actors are up to the task with the highlight being Michael Shannon playing John Givins, a truth-telling ex-mathematician who is suffering from something like Asperberger's syndrome. His dialog is so trenchant that you have to recoil from it in sympathy with Frank and April. When Givins pointed to April's obvious pregnancy and said, ""I'm glad I'm not going to be that kid,"" I was stunned that someone could dream up such a cutting remark.<br/><br/>The period details like autos, furniture, dress, and street scenes are strikingly well done. While Frank and April's story may have been more common in the 50s, it could easily be translated into a contemporary setting, except for one crucial detail. In contemporary America April could have made a case for a legal second trimester abortion under a doctor's care, based on her mental health. I don't know the intent of the book, but this film makes a case for pro-choice.<br/><br/>There are things to be learned from watching this. If you are on the path to marriage, then it can be a cautionary tale; for all others, it can prompt candid reflection on where you are and where you are going."

","A dream interrupted abruptly before dawn. Hopes that the long-awaited break in the daily conventionality of a 'life miserable, sleepy, unsatisfied. Ten years on from 'American Beauty', Sam Mendes has again a picture of family and its subsequent disintegration filtered through an apparent normality of the facade, which actually hides concerns and falsehood. Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler are a couple middle-class New York in the Fifties, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an employee, April (Kate Winslet) an aspiring actress. The couple lives with two sons in a comfortable residential dwellings. Their frustrations are as crazy splintered and in fact, at the earliest sequences are seeing anything but edifying skirmishes that follow one another seamlessly. From the novel by Richard Yates 'Revolutionary Road' is an intimate and thorough investigation of the couple's relationship, set in a context, the fifties, so conformist as to be cloying and fake and plastic. Anxieties and fears of a young couple are well masked by a layer of total hypocrisy. The individual aspirations are unattainable goals victims of unavoidable constraints: one can not be what you are. We are allowed to dream, but as long as you keep our feet on the ground. Because in fact this is the crux of the film, where there is division between good and evil, victim and executioner, the only 'guilt' which is attributed to Frank and April is only that he believed it possible to materialize their dreams. For a moment. Endless moment. The American dream does not exist because it never existed, is simply unattainable utopia. Circumvent stereotypes, Sam Mendes enters with skill in the folds of American society, showing a disarming realism and 'objectivity disconcerting: the filmmaker happens to be English, but America knows more of an American himself. And among wild trails, pettiness irrelevant (he who betrays an 'insipid secretary, she is totally indifferent to the news because now no love for him) nothing is what it seems, where even sex is an outlet, a foothold to cling with the aim only to externalize their inner frustrations and drive: eloquent in this case the scene of intercourse in the car. A world where a boy with mental problems (the good Michael Shannon, Oscar nominated) and even the most lucid of all, the only voice out from the pack, but note the fact, fits with sincerity perspective through this sentence: ""It takes the liver to see the void, but It takes a lot more to see that there is hope."" 'Revolutionary Road' is a film slow and introspective, the time taken, in which everything is determined with extreme precision, photography and soundtrack to contribute effectively to the performance of individual sequences, especially the last, shocking and inevitable, in which the emotional tension explodes in a paroxysm becoming almost unbearable. Leonardo DiCaprio is very good, but Kate Winslet is amazing: so real, tangible. Gives the best interpretation of his career identifying himself with monstrous emotion: his every subtle gesture is thus a demonstration of impressive physicality. Commendable. A vision in the original language in this case and for a film focused primarily on the dialogues is almost necessary. 'Revolutionary Road' is a film disillusioned, gloomy, dreary, weary because so truthful and current, the Fifties serve as a perfect disguise of contemporaneity. You can live without dreaming, resigned to a life of mediocrity common and routine, if you do not need to change the city is still dead inside, do not need to have children and raised over then condemned to unhappiness. We Open the eyes then, a new day is looming. And the harsh realities of life to annihilate us."

","Revolutionary Road is the story of a couple in the suburbs of Connecticut. April (Winslet) is an aspiring actress whose dreams had never worked out, and is now a stay-at-home mom and wife. Frank (Dicaprio) is the man of the family, supporting his wife and kids with a job he hardly likes and a life he finds, in his own moments of pure bliss ""hopeless emptiness"". Other characters are also of vital importance in this movie and add so much depth to it. There is John (Michaeal Shannon), a ""supposed"" not-well i.e. mentally insane person who is the son of next-door neighbours Helen& Howard Givings (Bates& Easton). There is also the war-time veteran friend of Frank, whose name I miss, and his wife, which seem, but are not really happy.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!<br/><br/>Story goes that the main couple had dreams. Frank wanted to see the world and live in Paris, and April wanted to become an actress. Frank wanted to feel emotions, and maybe that is why April married him. April saw in Frank a man who could live out his life the way he wanted, and she could follow suit.<br/><br/>However, things don't turn out well, dream-wise. April and Frank end up having kids, moving to the suburbs an empty life. Emptiness and shallow, and as John puts it so vividly and truthfully in front of them, they should feel sorry for themselves because they had not followed their dreams, like they had promised, though never said, they would. Dreams take hold of them, and they grow apart. Both have affairs, are cold to each other, and say terrible things to each other and make terrible mistakes which they can't get back. Things turn for the worse when April, in a bid to free herself of the life she supposedly hates, performs an abortion on herself. The family falls apart. Frank moves out of the neighbourhood, and is now spending as much time as he can with his kids.<br/><br/>What strikes me in this movie is the realism of the past it portrays. These people are only 50 years or so away from us. They have cars and speak the same language and feel the same emotions, but at times seem distant, as for eg the way women are treated then. Yet at other times, they are so close to home, with the same social problems that couples nowadays have. Affairs. Kids. Emotional upheavals due to work. Neighbours and friends being...just neighbours...and friends, as in putting their own interests in front of yours for the sake of friendship and selfishness. And what happened to us wanting to be big and make a difference in this world? It is all gone? Families are torn apart. Can we be happy? Can we go on?<br/><br/>The answer is simple. Of course we can. Because that is what we do. We live. We die. The cycle goes round and round. We have problems. We deal with them. We think wisely. We educate ourselves. We deal with them. We rationalise, because in my opinion, that is the only way forward. And if we can't achieve our dreams, it is all right. We live by what we have, by the kids we are bringing up, and trying new things and doing things out of the ordinary. Heck, you don't have to go to Paris to live. You just have to live with yourself and the ones you love, and only then they would mean the world to you, and the rest of the world mean nothing. This is I think what the message of the movie is. You try so hard to reach your dreams, and you get confused along the way. You hurt the ones you love, because you think they don't understand. But if you life, then life opens up to you. You become happy, just like Frank did at the end of the movie with his smile, watching his kids of the swing. Though not not extremely happy, or laughing his head of, he was content. I am not saying that is how one should lead one's life. I am just saying that if we are dealt a certain card in life, we should handle it to our best, and in my opinion, that would make us happy.<br/><br/>Brilliant performances by Leo& Kate, and Michael Shannon, and all the other actors& actresses. Leo& Kate give so much depth into their characters that at times, it is very hard to read what they are about to say or do. Honestly, who would have thought April would go on with the abortion at the end of the film? I personally thought: either, she is going to commit suicide, or talk it out with Frank, or live out the rest of her life like that, the ""perfect"" household wife. Her resoluteness during the breakfast scene (perfectly played out) made me wonder whether she'd whoop out the knife the moment Frank pulled out of the driveway.<br/><br/>Music brilliant. In stark contrast to the horrific scene before and after April's abortion. I'm not an expert on decorations, but I believe the 1950s suburbs was nicely shown here.<br/><br/>A brilliant movie to watch& watch again. Good talking points and good education, because that is how we move forward. We educate ourselves on problems we have or might have, so that when situations come, we know how to handle them responsibly. And trust me, those scenes from the film are real. And they happen to everyone of us. If they haven't, just you wait and see.<br/><br/>9/10 for this movie. I felt the smoking scenes were just a bit too obvious here. But that's just my opinion. Again, education."

His character of John Givings as sort of the Id personified was probably the most difficult part in the film and he just did an outstanding job. I could go on and on,just don't make me ever see the film again."

","It's the mid 1950s and Frank and April Wheeler are not so much facing the seven year itch in their marriage, but more an opening wound from which forms a chasm of despair that is luring them in.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is a tough sell as a piece of entertainment, in fact it's probably best to sell it as a tough uncompromising expose of a drifting suburbanite relationship. Adapting from Richard Yate's misery laden ""classic,"" director Sam Mendes and his team have crafted an actors piece that is as rewarding as it most definitely is a downer. Full of deceit and sadness, it's only really with the complexities of the characters that the discerning viewer can be pulled in to the perspectives of the protagonists. That this occurs is testament to the acting ability of both Kate Winslet {April} and Leonardo DiCaprio {Frank}. Arguably two of the best actors of their generation, they each give it such believability, such desperation, it offers up an anti-dote to any effects driven picture rising up the current DVD sales charts.<br/><br/>Clinically directed by Mendes, and given a lush 50s sheen from Roger Deakins visuals, Revolutionary Road is a must see of modern era, dramatic, dialogue driven films. If one is likely to want to see it again after viewing it is questionable. The DVD sales will make for interesting reading I feel. But once viewed it's unlikely that you are ever likely to forget having let the piece get under your skin.

","It opens at a party, where the two main characters meet each other. Then it flash forwards to a play, where Winslets character just performed an awful acting performance, and the two main characters lash out on the side of the road on the way home. Then the title rolls. And after a while, you think that there isn't a better scene than that. But soon it happens. The movie is about a plan to put a marriage back together, but after an unplanned pregnancy, a few affairs, an new high paying job for the husband. And then comes the scene, after a long roller coaster ride of drama and high hopes, where a man who is virtually mentally ill exposes the perfect couple as seen in public for what they truly are. DiCaprio can't handle it, yells at him for feeling insecure for being exposed. The man tells Winslets character he feels bad for her but at the same time, thinks she is awful as well, for putting up with everything and how she let her become a ruined human. He leaves, saying he feels sorry for himself, but says that there is one person in the room he wouldn't want to be: the unborn child. After he leaves, the eruption starts, and the fight escalates into the woods. It's the perfectly acted scene of this half of the decade so far. And what happens after is just unbearably unbelievable and at the same time, irritably true to life. Revolutionary Road will not necessarily corrupt or destroy your view on the perfect 50's life, but instead it will make you realize what a lie that lifestyle is, and help you realize why we are here now. Winslet and DiCaprio are not only at the top of their game, but at the top of the entire game (that's every actor in the world, thank you). They stick with you and eat you alive. Don't expect any comfort."

","This movie has elicited many ""10s"" and lots of ""2s"" from our trusty IMDb readers. That is always interesting to me. A performance is called ""bad community theater"" stuff by one viewer, others hail the movie's performances as ""great"".<br/><br/>I'm guessing that the depressing nature of watching a suburban couple bemoan their seemingly OK life, and the internal strife of that conflict, is insightful for most, painful for some and irritating for a few.<br/><br/>I generally watch movies to be enlightened, entertained or educated. I'd be hard pressed to say this movie did any of those. But, I was enthralled by the performances, which I considered to be as good as they get. A scene of the corporate ""clones"" departing the 'burbs for their corporate jobs was sensationally filmed, stunning in is scope and set the tone for the ""robotic"" view of suburban life the author/director chose to hang their story on. But this point of view is not enlightening. Kate and Leo, as the struggling suburban couple, argue with the intent to injure, but after reflection, seem to still have the core of affection that originally brought them together. They fight hard, re-group, create a plan to break away and then deteriorate again as the plan slips away.<br/><br/>It's not much of a plan. Quit their present life and head to Paris. She'll work, he'll find himself! Other than they are not the ""special"" people Kate envisioned they would be, there isn't much to escape from. Is Leo droning out a living? Sure, who didn't! It was post-war USA. But then he's offered a promotion that seems a bit exciting to him, so maybe things are looking up. Kate can't even verbalize what makes them ""special"" and why they should escape their ""trapped"" life, other than they just should.<br/><br/>I felt the movies' ""big cheat"", was the role of Kathy Bates' son. An accomplished mathematician, he is deemed different, institutionalized and apparently brutalized. He has had 64 shock treatments for a condition that doesn't appear to warrant such drastic treatment. But, that's life in the 50's. Offbeat is insane. But, he is presented as the person with the real insight! Is it the author's point that 64 shock treatments help see life more clearly. The character gives us the key insightful line in the movie when he proclaims that many admit to the emptiness of suburban life, but that ""it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" In his only other scene he makes a proclamation to Kate that seals the movie's final fate. Perhaps his unfiltered take on life makes the character viable, but I thought it was too extreme, too convenient. And the use of ex-marital activity by both was intriguing. In both cases it was to feel something, anything! <br/><br/>But, I'm babbling. The movie was a well performed downer. We watch a painful slice of life. In fact, if you get the DVD make sure to watch the deleted scenes. The director may have left an Academy Award nomination for DeCaprio on the cutting floor. He has two incredible (i.e. -- not ""community player"") scenes that were left out."

It's a beautifully realized film based on a 1961 novel by Richard Yates, although the screenplay is somewhat choppy. Mendes does an excellent job of evoking a period where life seemed to be simpler, but, as always, there were people who had to fight personal demons. Winslet and DiCaprio are terrific as the volatile couple, with the former seeking escape from her mundane existence while making life hell for the latter. Standouts in the supporting cast are Bates as a real estate agent and Shannon, funny and scary, as her mentally disturbed son. Newman provides a rather haunting score."

","Praising individual performances seems such a trivial tribute to this masterpiece... but boy do they deserve praise! I did not bat one disinterested eyelid while watching this dark insight into 1950's East coast suburbia. The quintessential American dream - an adorable young couple, a house on a manicured lawn, kids playing, summer trappings, friendly neighbors - in stark contrast to the debilitating internal conflict and crumbling foundation of the focal social construct - the married life of Frank and April. Sounds clichÃ©d but so is breathing and eating. How did we get here? Start with a layer of sweet-talking, charm and maybe physical chemistry, knead that into a wedding cake mix, pile on top of that foolishly optimistic unfulfilled personal dreams, cover with social pressures, appearances and innocent children's futures and top off with self-inflicted guilt brought on by impulsive behaviors. Sprinkle the need for caring and being cared all over that concoction and add a dash of desire to feel important. That is surefire recipe for disaster even on its own, but when a mentally 'unstable' John Givings (Michael Shannon) projects piercingly true insight into what issues are really at play versus what the protagonists fool themselves into believing, it is accelerated into a hopelessly fast and explosive meltdown. I am inclined to wonder though, if the setting of this movie was 2009, would things have turned out differently. This movie will haunt me for days to come. Bits and pieces are certainly lodged permanently in the psyche."

","""Revolutionary Road"" reunites ""Titanic"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a story about a couple who become unhappy with where their life is and decide to set off for Paris. Leo plays Frank, a business man who is becoming increasingly bored with his life and has realised he's not where he wants to be. Winslet plays April, a stay-at-home mum who still yearns to become a great actress (her character, not Kate Winslet) but realises that part of her life has probably passed her by. One night April confronts Frank that they should up and move to Paris, a place Frank loves and that may enable him to chase his true dreams. At first Frank comes up with all the negatives, but soon realises ""why not!"". They start making plans but things get railroaded when April gets pregnant and Frank gets offered a way better job with a lot more money. Will they still chase their dreams, or will their responsibilities keep them home? Something different, as the movie leaves it to you for the most part to decide whether life is about chasing our dreams, fulfilling our responsibilities...or a bit of both. Well acted and a good story, but it got a bit too silly for my liking in the last 30mins. Worth a look."

","In Titanic, Kate and Leo were the achingly romantic, star-crossed lovers who would meet again in eternity. In Revolutionary Road they show us what might have happened if the couple survived.<br/><br/>It's late 1950s American suburbia and he's settled into a similar deadening job in sales, at the same company, as his father and she's an unhappy, stifled housewife who once dreamed of being an actress. Along the way, both have meaningless affairs to relieve their boredom. Attempting to save their marriage, she devices a desperate plan to escape their narrow, regimented 50s existence -- they'll sell everything, take their life savings and move the family (they have two kids) to Paris, where he can take time off to ""find himself"" while she works as a secretary at NATO or UNESCO to support them.<br/><br/>This dream is shattered by her unplanned pregnancy (termination is not an option for him) and his recent promotion at work. What happens then is the unraveling of a marriage and a life.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for faint of heart. It's long, very slow-paced (a BBC production) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for this pair. This is a far different couple from the lovers in Titanic. And, thank God for that because in this film both actors get the chance to demonstrate the true range of their talents, as well as again, the powerful chemistry they have together on screen.<br/><br/>There are uniformly fine performances by the supporting cast, with Michael Shannon the standout (and Oscar nominee) as the emotionally disturbed son of friends, whose insanity grants him the freedom to be the sole voice of truth in this repressed suburban hell."
"jkysharma","9","0","0","6 June 2009"," Winslet & DiCaprio
","Sam Mendes' latest offering is, at long last, an adaptation of Richard Yates' book of the same name. I've heard a lot about his book (haven't read it) and would have thought that it merited a scramble for the production rights. Having seen the movie, I can't wait to read it. At a time when there seems to be a paucity for good scripts in Hollywood, a film about personal struggles and showcasing the monotony of daily life is a rarity. This has to be right up there with the best of the films on the 'American Dream', shown in its stagnation nevertheless. Reading up on the praise showered by contemporaries and critics alike on Yates' book, the magnitude of the task dawned upon me and anyone will acknowledge that it takes a team like this to do justice to the source material. It does, with some members of the cast walking away with the laurels, none more so than Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>To say that she stands at the apex of her profession, unchallenged, would not be stating too much. Her April Wheeler is passionate, constantly challenging the fabric of stillness that overhangs the setting and the one person in the film who harbors the founding thought of the United States – hope. Watching her during the silent moments of the film is an exercise in getting floored repeatedly. In an inspired piece of casting, Leonardo DiCaprio plays April's man Frank. Representative of men from a time when everybody craved a security blanket, here is an actor at the top of his craft and still getting better.<br/><br/>This film also completes a circle of sorts for the two. In the interim between Titanic (1997) and Revolutionary Road (2008), their careers have been fulfilling for the actors and fans alike. Together here, they make for immensely compelling viewing.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon as John Givings is the surprise package of the film and I couldn't help thinking of 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', another quintessentially American film. In the sense that, if he's crazy, it's only because they say so. Also, it probably takes an out-of-the-box thinker to comprehend April and Frank's plans. Another performance worth treasuring for it doesn't get much of screen time.<br/><br/>Mendes brings his gift for ushering a sense of balance to proceedings and making it look natural. This may not turn out to be as memorable for him as American Beauty but the movie is all the better for it. Thomas Newman's score, the costumes by Albert Wolsky and the art direction by Debra Schutt and Kristi Zea add considerably to the film.<br/><br/>This one kept me awake for a while after the credits had rolled. This particular representation of the American Dream may not be relevant any more but the themes of conformity, loneliness and frustration hold true."

","Revolutionary Road: 9 out of 10: The strangest complaint about this movie is that it is painful to watch and too realistic. For example one critic exclaims “It's unbecoming -- and it should be worked out in private, not in a movie theater."" another claims.“This is a movie about two people in pain; the last thing they need is for Mendes to turn his cool camera on them."" This is a serious depiction the disintegration of a marriage. Why should we be expecting musical numbers? Are we so used to “everything will work out” American movies with big name stars that we now demand successful conclusions? If you have, you ever sat through a Holocaust film or a movie involving a dog named Yeller you know the eternal truth .This is not going to end well. Kate Winslet gives an outstanding performance; this should surprise no one. (The fact she actually keeps her top on, for once, may raise a few eyebrows however among a disappointed throng.) Leonardo DiCaprio’s performance is her equal in every way; and there is no denying in those 15 odd years after Titanic that these two stars have even more chemistry than before. The rest of the cast is also beyond top notch with Kathy Bates as a venomous realtor, a particular stand out. Sam Mendes’ direction also shines. He keeps the camera pointed at both the actors and seemingly their characters souls. In addition nobody uses focus and character placement better than Mendes. Each frame seems its own work of art The plot is simple. Winslet and DiCapiro are married with two kids. He works in a dead end job in Manhattan, while she takes care of the kids and lives in quiet desperation in suburbia. If there is a problem with the set-up, it is that women in the audience may be noticeably envious of Winslet’s lifestyle while the men may hanker for a do nothing, three martinis, fling with the secretary, job. Life in the fifties, at least for the white, upper middle class, does not seem very bad on the surface. That said the yearning and the subsequent disastrous consequences seem all too true. Winslet and DiCapiro fight like real couples do. Starting small and quickly hitting at each other’s hot buttons. Winslet has the emotion heft in the arguments, and comes across as the stronger person; wounded by life. DiCapiro, ironically, only has the fact he is right to keep him afloat. (Moving to Paris would solve nothing, he is as trapped as she is, and neither of them is special.) I do have a couple of nitpicks with Revolutionary Road. The conveniently disappearing children are a problem. Director Mendes trots them out for a few scenes in the middle of the film but honestly, they are never underfoot, and as real children is when marriages disintegrate. In addition, that fact that Winslet’s Stepford wife routine does not raise DiCaprio’s eyebrows towards the end of the film raised my eyebrows. He seemed a little more clued enduring the proceeding to let that pass by unnoticed. I did recognize the arguments that couples have, as well as the quandary of following your dreams rather than being happy with whom you are. (Following your bliss can lead to much misery in real life; both for yourself and those that love you.) Then again, we have only one life, so how should we spend it. I do not see this argument between flights of fantasy and a practical life being solved anytime soon. However, as short as our time on Earth is, I cannot help but recommend spending two hours of it in the company of Winslet and DiCapiro. Revolutionary Road is simply one of the best films of 2008."

This movie goes after those couples who just want to have an interesting lifeeven though they have everything but just do not know how to live a calm n simple lifethere are very few characters in the movie and all reflect on the society we live inbut one character that stands out is the mentally ill son of a Realtor.he has the perfect face and voice modulation for such role.also towards the end Kate's role gets into a shape which makes you a little scared just like the way you might feel during the last part of good horror/thriller where you do not know what happens next. Kate's face just has that devilish look on her face which keeps coming on and off the frame and makes it all the more scary. The best thing about the movie is the raw anger which I have not seen in a movie in a long time, usually special/visual effects are used to show these in Hollywood action/science fictional movies but this one just has raw human emotionsperfectly done by Kate and Caprio.

And they do not love each other very much. It’s the opposite- they are depressed and desperate about the monotonous life they live. This is exactly what is the film trying to say us: it makes the contrast between make- believe, which is created by the society and honesty (truth), which... which is always there, but nobody knows why. This contrast is unbelievable shocking and for the audience sometimes also ironic and, of course, fascinating. These two „values“ are „fighting“. Which one will win? The more sociable.

","I saw this movie last night and was looking forward to see it with such actors as Decaprio and Winslet. Although conscious of the period I had trouble to cope with over articulated, almost stage like dialog, perhaps a contradiction in term from me as I wish so often speech was clearer and so miss so much of dialog in many movies!<br/><br/>Some praise the acting, to me it was a little more like ""days of our life"". I could not feel much spontaneity from the characters as if someone was whispering the lines for them to utter. Many have criticised the children absence, this one of the remark our group made during the viewing. So although it had something to retain your attention I think the name of the actors was the main drawing card. Having said this I think this particular theme and its treatment would have been better served with actors not so popular. I started to read others comments with the default filter (set to Best first) and was, I was going to say ""surprised"" but not so, rather filled with a feeling of ""what did you expect"". Although there were some comments I did think rather fair, they did not reflect my feelings. So I turned the filter to "" I hate it"" and there I found that there were quite a few people who shared my appreciation of this film. At both end of the spectrum as usual there were exaggeration. On the flip side I enjoyed seeing those great stars even on the day it did not tickle me pink. The fact it was a depressing story did not bother me, I like a laugh and a bit of action, but I also like people struggle story very much too, and I then accept it's not always a happy ending - just like in real life. So let's say it's not for all taste."

April and Frank live in an idyllic American suburb, in house set among trees, they have two kids. All is nice, neighbors adore them, even (Kathy Bates) the Realtor who showed them the house loved them...These are the appearances. Frank (Di Caprio) hates his job, but accepts it as a given and when April (Winslet) suggests that he should quit he is willing to take her advice.. go to Europe into the unknown. He was really going to do it, quit and go, until...opportunity intervened...for a job with more responsibility and more money...and perhaps less boredom. This was an ego trip for Frank. And yet --in a situation that is upside down from what anyone would expect-- April is unhappy, and this unhappiness is so entrenched that it will finally lead to disaster and turn a career turn into a family disaster. Sam Mendes has done it again. After brilliantly depicting the hell of family life in an idyllic suburb in 'American Beauty,' he managed to reinvent himself in Revolutionary Road. He was helped by his extraordinary cast and by a good script, but still... Winslet is very good in depicting April's step-by-step descent into madness, and she definitely deserved the Golden Globe, and perhaps even the Oscar (but wasn't nominated for this movie). Actually it is hard to judge who is the better actor between her and DiCaprio, but I guess hers is a more difficult role because of her frequent mood changes.

","With Revolutionary Road, the excellent Sam Mendes delivers his most powerful and gripping movie since his debut, American Beauty. Coincidentally or not, both of these dramas hit similar themes and their protagonists also share a lot in common.<br/><br/>Suburban couples whom, on the surface, are seemingly perfect but in in reality are growing apart, trying to define or redefine their existence, having doubts about their lifestyles? This summary can be applied to both films and yet, it would be a terribly inaccurate injustice to say this film is ""just like American Beauty"".<br/><br/>The story is definitely its own, so are the characters. Mendes' direction also really sticks to the movie rather than being formulaic. He is better than ever, ever image, every moment, every emotion perfectly captured. DiCaprio and Winslet? They nail their parts as a couple, the Wheelers. It's just perfect, nuanced, authentic.<br/><br/>With all these people on top of their game and an interesting premise, Revolutionary Road could have easily been a 9, perhaps even a 10. Alas, the screenplay has significant flaws. For one, a few lines are weak. Nothing major but still. More importantly, there seems to be something missing. The whole pointlessness of their existence not made so clear, for instance. And then, there's the Wheelers' children.<br/><br/>Yes, our suburb couple has children but where are they, exactly? Not really in this movie, unfortunately. I realize that with a director like Mendes, few things were probably left to chance and this was probably a deliberate, conscious decision. Perhaps as early as the screenplay, or maybe in the editing room? Whatever the case maybe, it's a weak point and prevents the movie from having the punch to become a TRUE, long-lasting American classic. I'm talking top 100 movie of all times. Had this movie been extended by 15 minutes or so (which would be entirely reasonable given it's actual running time) I think much could have been explained and the final third of the movie, as well as its resolution, would have had even more impact.<br/><br/>We're still left with powerful characters and another movie that is fodder for us viewers, about the apparent inescapable cogs of the wheel of our lives.<br/><br/>Do we really need to live in such standard ways? And more importantly, if we do, is it instantly wrong? As usual for Mendes, he explores those black and white questions and shows you the wide palette of gray between these two extremes.<br/><br/>Kudos to Mendes, our two leads, as well as the supporting cast and Mendes technical team. The weakness of this movie is Justin Haythe, whose sole other screen writing credit is the laughably bad ""The Clearing"". There just aren't that many Alan Ball around to write perfect stories."

","This is the first review I write here - that doesn't have to mean it's going to be a bad one. The thing I'll try here is to show what I would've done differently if I had been the director. Intrigued - then read on! The strong things: the camera department has made a good show - along with some OK music it makes the film very moody overall. That's one good thing. Then, the performances are mostly quite strong - but there are a few exceptions, I will cover later. The dialogues are mostly believable and the script holds enough changes to keep us intrigued.<br/><br/>Here is what I would have made differently: 1) I would have changed some actors. The girl Frank has an affair with, is simply much less attractive than his beautiful wife, for most men, so that is not believable at all. She wasn't such a special character, too.<br/><br/>2) Another acting thing: the woman of the other marriage coupled played beyond bad. So: either changing the actress or trying one's best to get a passable performance.<br/><br/>3) I would have changed one line: that ""Leo"" didn't know ""Kate"" wasn't in Paris. When you are married, you should know about such a thing, so that is NOT realistic.<br/><br/>4) There was a scene where the charismatic ""crazy"" man was completely blurred despite talking. Could have been a tried way to do sth. original, but what is original isn't necessarily good. That's the only weak thing about the cinematography, though.<br/><br/>5) Some non-linear time changes, e. g. going back, or foreshadowing would have made the film even more interesting. I probably would have changed the script here a bit, but it is okay how it is.<br/><br/>6) In my mind there is another thing I don't remember. If I saw it a second time, there would maybe be more thing I notice that would be better off changed. Oh, maybe that there weren't enough close ups in such an intense, ""closed"" kind of drama, but it was another thing I tried to remember.<br/><br/>Overall, a fine film with some flaws that aren't quite tragic enough to leave me feel the film I just saw was mediocre. It HAS the typical Mendes-feel, although he hasn't quite made a lot films yet. Looking forward to seeing more, though.<br/><br/>This is an 8.4 for me, so not nine, but really a bit better than the average eight. Can I recommend this movie? Yes, a lot."

","This film could have been a melodramatic mash and it is not. In fact the situation and the various developments make it quasi-tragic. Tragic because it is the story of a totally impossible epiphany for a couple who is living in our modern society. There is no escape from the present programmed and even pre-fabricated life in which we all live. We have practically no freedom of choice. The only freedom of choice we do have is to refuse a possible promotion, a potential chance in this life, and we will end up on the dump, the manure pile. There is no choice because we have to pay for the house, the car, the children's education, and so many other things. There is no real choice because our psyches have been pre-determined into accepting the small little tiny wee box that has been attributed to our life. Our psyche is always opportunistic and it always goes the way the wind blows. Even a simple accident, like an unwanted pregnancy, the result of a negligence as for preventive protection, the result of going out bareback when it is well known we are supposed to go out covered, if we want to really have a choice, becomes the direst tragedy of all times. But we are in such a formatted life that we forget something because ""they"", the big brothers of this brave new world, have mesmerized us into forgetting. There is no simple way out, there is no way out at all. Any attempt at trying to evade the consequences of this event will lead to an even worse catastrophe, like death, or suicide, or death by suicide or suicide by death. Tragic indeed. I will also add that the main two actors are outrageously outstanding. They play their anger, their disorientation, their psychoses, their schizophrenias even with such realism and conviction that we may think they are playing their own roles, their own parts, their own private fate and destiny. It is true the cameraman is also quite prodigious. The way he takes the profile of Di Caprio when this one is supposed to be stubbornly refusing any move brings out this stubborn-ness revealed by the very line of the forehead seen under that profile angle, a Neanderthal or apish profile indeed. It is such details that make an actor and a film remarkable. It is true too that the insane, deranged son of the real estate agent is truer than nature, more prophetic about this society than all the Bibles of the world, than all the Freuds and Marxes of this low, low world of ours.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
"DICK STEEL","7","0","0","6 April 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Revolutionary Road
","It's been some twelve years since James Cameron's Titanic sealed Leonardo DiCaprio's heartthrob status, and everyone's been wondering when DiCaprio and his co-star Kate Winslet would once again grace the screen together with that kind of on screen chemistry and magic that made thousands relive that cross-Atlantic adventure tragedy over and over again, effectively retiring James Cameron (until this year of course with his 3D film Avatar) since the film powered past a billion dollars in box office receipts.<br/><br/>With tongue in cheek, I thought this Sam Mendes movie offered audiences a peek into how Jack Dawson and Rose's lives would have been, should they live through that night to remember together, and settle down in the USA. The free-spirited Dawson would find his life now quite the bore as compared to his free-wheeling days of a drifter, now rooted to a nine to five job he doesn't believe in, and lives his life like a robot only to pay the bills. As for Rose, she being stuck at home as a housewife also doesn't seem like the life she thought she signed on for, with the realities of matrimony settling in to demolish notions of a once daring romance.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio reunites with Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates too!) in Revolutionary Road, that on the surface looks at how the familiar has crept into the lives of a married couple, and beneath the veneer and belief of their neighbours, theirs is a union slowly disintegrating, not that they do not try, but probably tried too hard, and where indifference start to rear its ugly head to destroy passion and love. We see how both do things that will ultimately hurt and betray the sliver of trust that's left, and how each manipulates the other in subtle ways in order to get what they think they want.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film was centred around their joint decision to uproot their family (and the children whom we rarely see) and move to Paris, so that DiCaprio's Frank would be able to live out his dream, of finding out his true calling. This would mean selling all their assets, crossing the steamship the other way round (which I chuckled at, and wonder if we're really going to see that at all), and having his wife support him (because the Europeans pay secretaries exorbitant salaries) while he mucks around for inspiration to life. This would also mean bidding Sayonara to his dead end job, until Murphy so decides to throw a spanner in the works with Frank gaining much needed recognition.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's April seemed to be the all-sacrificing wife, until her frequent breakdowns seem to cast doubts on her sanity, having to fight like mad with her husband, only to put on a more cordial front every morning at breakfast. One can only guess that she's doing her best to keep things from breaking down, but there's only a limit to how many holes you can plug with your fingers. In fact, the film develops at a pace with which paint dries, and comes alive only when Frank and April trade verbal blows, with hurting insults flying both directions with the threat of physical violence always close by.<br/><br/>It's about the hypocrisy that we are aware of, yet choose to play the social charade and getting a kick out of laughing at the fakeness of it all behind closed doors, behind other people's backs. The games we play with the intention to hurt will sometimes backfire on ourselves too, and it's almost always never a good thing to be doing something to hit back at the other person, one whom you know you love. But rectifying it head on also means that it's time to give it up, but preferably done so in a more civil manner compared to dropping the bombshell and hoping for an expected reaction.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the madness of it all, it takes an ex-mental patient character John (played by Michael Shannon) to become the voice of reason in an insanely fake world that both Frank and April find themselves in. In being crazy, he's granted the excuse to cut through the nonsense and say things as he sees fit, and has some of the best lines in the movie but also being the most accurate in the reading of the characters' expressions. If you think both Frank and April have words that hurt, pay attention to the wise sayings of John.<br/><br/>Based on a novel by Richard Yates, Sam Mandes managed to bring out the best in the chemistry between his two leading stars. Between them, age has not been kind to Winslet, while the additional lines on DiCaprio's face makes him all the more mature, though retaining his baby-faced looks that even made it to the insults their character trades.<br/><br/>Just when everything starts to meander around the themes it set out to explore, and treading in dangerous ground in being too convoluted for its own good, the parting shot was quite verbose in summing everything up quite nicely, in that it pays to switch off at times, or most of the times if you will, in order to keep things as status quo without the opportunity of being misread that you're uncooperative, or unwilling to lend a listening ear. Very poignant, and chillingly real."

","A decade ago Kate and Leo helped salvage the bloated monstrosity TITANIC with a magical chemistry that made their love story touching and important. The chemistry sparks anew in their first screen reunion though for the characters they play here the magic has been draining from their lives. Frank and April Wheeler are a middle-class couple living in Fifties Connecticut with their two children. April's the home-maker while Frank is a sales executive with a machine-manufacturing company in New York where his late father used to work. Their early dreams of being something special have failed to materialise. April, increasingly chafing against domesticity, seeks an outlet in amateur dramatics but everything goes wrong on the night and her confidence is shattered. Frank's attempt at reassurance on the way home she construes as condescension and they have a blazing row.. Frank's approach to his job is a mix of detachment and disdain but leaves him too far into his own comfort-zone to want to break out of it and he takes the opportunity to begin an affair with a receptionist. It's his birthday, as it happens, and he gets home late to find that April and the kids have prepared a party for him which pricks his conscience and brings him to tears.<br/><br/>April's last-ditch idea to revitalise their relationship is for them to uproot permanently to Europe where she would get a job as a secretary in a U.S. Government agency leaving Frank time to ""find himself"". As his own view of what this might entail seems pretty vague he endorses the notion half-heartedly to keep the peace but when she finds she's pregnant again and he's offered a promotion at work the pipe-dream goes the way of all the others. Back in her trap April makes her own opportunity for extra-marital sex with the guy across the way who secretly fancies her. But it's the unwelcome intrusion of another neighbour into their fragile hearth and home which exacerbates a night of crisis for the pair with April staying out in the woods alone. On what proves to be their final morning together she acts out deliberately and calmly the perfect scenario of the dutiful and solicitous wife before Frank leaves for work and she goes on to trigger, with resolution, an appalling tragedy... Richard Yates' densely-analytical novel, first published nearly fifty years ago, gets a bit oppressive and over-written at times in its relentless dissection of motives and self-deceptions to the extent that its characters begin to feel like specimens under a microscope. And I was less than impressed, in both book and film, with the crude device of the lunatic neighbour. John Givings is an institutionalised man who's had shock-treatment and is released part-time to his family. His mother insists on bringing him along on visits to the Wheelers where his increasingly sardonic and tactless observations - like parting a spider-web with a meat-cleaver - cause Frank to finally rear up and give him a roasting. The mother tearfully protests ""He's not well, Frank !"" which for me tips the thing for a giddy moment into farce because it kept reminding me irrepressibly of dear old Spike Milligan. (He'd wanted ""I told you I was ill"" written on his gravestone but they'd only allow it in Irish). Spike was off the wall too but he was also a comic genius. This fellow's just obnoxious though some in the audience found him amusing.<br/><br/>This blip apart, Sam Mendes' magnetic film offers us air and space - I loved the image of the commuters in their trilby hats pouring into the streets - while honouring the text with precision and a remarkable subtlety perfectly reflected by the two leads - the ever-present conflict between what they say and what they feel, what they think they want and what they're prepared to settle for - or finally not, in April's case, bringing a climax of almost unbearable poignancy."

","This drama is so well made and both Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet are so exceptionally good in their dramatic interpretation that I often forgot I was watching a movie. Leonardo di Caprio really excels and you cannot avoid empathizing with his character. <br/><br/>The director of American beauty does another brilliant job at depicting the frustration of leading an ordinary existence and the devastating consequences that a desperate need to find a way out might lead to. This time though with an emphasis on drama and tragedy; there is no comic relief here to help you hide from the pain. Revolutionary road is a movie that explores the inner struggle of trying to reconcile the dream of doing something extraordinary with our lives with the perspective of inevitably conforming to what everyone else does. In the second part of the story all the way to the ending an ominous thriller-type atmosphere bleeds into the drama and by then you are totally enveloped in the character's lives, anxiously waiting to find out how they will end up.<br/><br/>This part might contain spoilers:<br/><br/>After the inebriation of finding each other, getting married and having children, husband and wife find themselves becoming the ordinary people they had promised themselves never to become. Leonardo di Caprio's character is an intelligent and imaginative man who has a job he hates and Kate Winslet's character is an actress turned housewife, suffocating at the idea that their dreams may have been lost forever in their middle class existence. In an attempt to escape the hopeless emptiness they feel closing in on them, she suggests a drastic change. They decide to throw caution to the wind and take off to start a new life in Paris, where people ""really live"". Their plan injects new energy into their relationship and into their dreams but the euphoria is short-lived, as life takes a series of twists that will change their future for ever."

","Let me start by complimenting Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet on their brilliant performance in this movie. In my opinion, Leonardo deserves a commanding nomination for some awards too following his role in this film. They made their roles come alive which made their stories very believable. Michael Shannon who played John Givings in the movie did a good job too.<br/><br/>This movie shows a couple (the Wheelers) that decides to do something which most of us know is an option we commonly ignore at the back of our mind. They opt to escape from the constant predicament of what everyday life has to offer- the jobs, the people we associate with, the house, the surroundings. So, almost all of us can easily relate to this story as having thought about how constant life can get at one point or another.<br/><br/>The movie shows us how Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) deals with the ups-and-downs of what life throws at them. All these prove to challenge their relationship even more so.

"pyrocitor","8","0","0","20 February 2009"," Disconcertingly mirrors its subject matter - attempts to be different, but ends up disappointingly the same
","Familiarity need not always be a bad thing. The concept of film genres would be essentially void without a cultural recognition of visual and narrative patterns trends establishing a sect of films. Moreover, many cinematic works incorporate the notion of cultural baggage, using familiarity with previously established conventions to add emphasis to or to subvert contemporary efforts. However, the notion of baggage can also work towards an opposite effect, making narrative material which may have once appeared fresh come across as repetitive and unoriginal, devaluing an otherwise quality film. This proves to be exactly the case with Sam Mendes' adaptation of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road. Attacking the film's formidable quality would be senseless, yet the consistent sense of unoriginality ensures the film never quite attains its desired effect, despite it being a stunningly powerful attempt. <br/><br/>Yet perhaps this concern with familiarity should hardly come as a surprise, as the concept had encircled Revolutionary Road right from the casting of its two leads. Despite the promised subversion of the timeless love story offered in Titanic, the film's marketing and hype banked very much on the reuniting of co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the hope that the chemistry and spark between them would go on as much as their hearts once did, leading to a potential case of cultural expectations overshadowing the effort in question. The same goes for American Beauty director Mendes once again digging up a dark undercurrent to supposedly sublime suburban life. Such a combination of factors makes the fact that Revolutionary Road is such an excellent film in itself feel almost like a shallow construction of a success, as the film appeared so tailor made to be nothing less that its own quality appears to paradoxically seem unsatisfactory. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the familiarity of the film extends beyond its cast and crew, as the subject matter derived from Yates' novel manages to do what it does exceedingly well while somehow managing to find nothing new to offer that countless other depictions of 1950s married life had not already unearthed. This adherence to convention becomes difficult to navigate - on one hand, Mendes might be seen as making a critical comment on the desired homogeneity of the time through ironically making use of 1950s stereotypes and familiar narrative arcs. Yet at the same time, the film exudes a continual sense of award baiting self- importance, an implied attempt to elevate it to the level of 'high drama', from the neatly pristine period exteriors and pastel coloured costumes to Thomas Newman's wistful, tinkling piano score which appears to be directly plundered from his previous work with Mendes on American Beauty. The continual sense of the 'serious, important film' Revolutionary Road seemingly set out to be, in turn makes it feel less serious and important. <br/><br/>However, such a wave of criticisms need not overshadow what is fundamentally still an incredibly powerful, moving and classy piece of work. Mendes' directorial capabilities have lost none of their stunning emotional clout, and he demonstrates a disconcerting skill to casually manipulate audience emotions. Whether provoking cries of frustration towards the annoyingly chirpy neighbours and their inability to come to terms with the Wheelers' plan to break out of suburban conformity and begin new, more fulfilling lives in Paris, or the crushing emotional anguish at the notion that such a beacon of hope may not end up becoming a reality, do not expect to shake the flooring aftertaste of the film for quite some time. Similarly, master cinematographer Roger Deakins' use of tight framing within close interiors creates an exquisitely subtle yet unbearably uncomfortable sense of claustrophobia, perfectly coupling the barely perceivable silent emotional scream of repression pervading the film. Finally, the film's unexpectedly unorthodox yet somehow fitting final shot is so mischievously welcome that it just about merits seeing the whole film in itself. <br/><br/>Despite the hype, the genuinely masterful performances generated by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot be ignored, their shining chemistry both during romantic interludes and hysterical screaming fits creating a supremely affecting piece of interpersonal drama. Few sights are so disillusioning as seeing the enthusiastic, hopeful spark in the eyes of DiCaprio at the film's opening being replaced by a flinty, critical stare painfully shortly afterwards, encapsulating the impish youngster being swallowed up through a desire to fit in with the environment surrounding him. Similarly, Winslet's eyes denote a harrowing sadness which similarly becomes increasingly deadened, to the point of the viewer being hard pressed to avoid tears themselves, conventional narrative or not. The tremendous performances of the lead duo are well supported by the efforts of Kathy Bates, gleefully irritating yet crucially heart wrenching in turn as the Wheelers' chirpy neighbour. The explosive Michael Shannon barely holds back from chewing the scenery as Bates' son, recently released from a mental hospital, with Shannon's caustic tone perfect for his nonconformist character's bitter rants. Finally, Dylan Baker is a wryly delightful presence as DiCaprio's alcoholic co-worker who hides from the dismally monotonous workplace through drinks and witty criticisms.<br/><br/>Despite being a class act on all fronts, Revolutionary Road is in essence just as cinematically hollow as the lifestyle depicted, offering little new to offer regarding its subject matter. Nonetheless, the exceptional cast and powerfully measured direction cannot be ignored, nor can the film's lingering emotional clout. Yet, one cannot help wishing for untrod territory to be explored, or at least for Mendes to stay away from suburbia for future cinematic offerings. <br/><br/>-8/10"

","""Revolutionary Road"" is director Sam Mendes's squeal to his ""American beauty"" in a thymic sense, with a variation. From the original theme of what you see on the surface is deceptive spins the second subject: living with you own mediocrity (or failing to live with it, in a more literal sense than you may care to see). <br/><br/>One scene at the beginning says all: a suburban train station filled with men on their way to work. The almost endless shades of grey and blue on the suits and hats of this army of middle-class office workers in the 50s make for the most aesthetic frame you have ever seen on a movie screen. But if you replace these eye-pleasing shades with black, this place can be transformed instantly into a suburban train station in Japan. It's a universally recognized fact, neither complimentary nor detrimental, that Japanese thrive on conformity in public. Conformity feeds anonymity, and often mediocrity. Turning back to our original scene, can the same be said for the American counterparts in the 50s? Well, at least not for our protagonist Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio), not initially anyway. <br/><br/>The ""Wheeler couple"", the other being aspiring actress April (Kate Winslet) is all but admired by everybody in their suburban neighbourhood as a model couple  young (just turning 30), two lovely kids, refined and well-liked in both work and social circles. What more can you ask? But that is only what meets the eyes. As an actress, she has never risen above ""unsuccessful"". And while his earns enough from his job to support a decent living standard of a suburban middle-class family, he starts to be haunted by the vision of following the footsteps of his father: working twenty years in the same company towards a dead end with nothing to show for when it's all over. <br/><br/>That is the basic premise and the rest of the story serve to manifest what is evident at the outset. The plan to for the family to move to Paris to make a new start brings a period of joy and expectation. The noble suggestion comes initially from April who intends to support the family (on generous salaries offered to secretary positions by NGOs in Europe) while Frank and take time to discover his talents, whatever it may be. Frank's initial determination is clouded when offered a good promotion by the big boss. April's unexpected pregnancy finally kills the plan. Irreversible damage, however, has already been done.<br/><br/>The two most significant scenes occur at the beginning and the end of the plan, not literally but metaphorically. A couple (neighbours, and the wife also the real estate agent through which they bought the house) asks Frank and April to spend some time with their son John (Michael Shannon) who is about their age and just received a partial discharge from a mental institute. It is John, an intellectual (with a PhD) and a mental patient, who really understands their aspirations, both Frank and April agree. Although it is just a brief social meeting, they have from John encouragement and support never forthcoming from friends and neighbours. Subsequently, announcement of abandonment of the Paris plan sends John into such a fit of outrage that he starts hurling insults at them. This is the most ironically revealing scene because these insults from a madman have the precision of a surgical knife, cutting open and exposing their heart. This is the real beginning of a tragic end.<br/><br/>While is has seem for a while that Frank and April are on the same frequency, that is an illusion. Frank is, in the depth of his heart, not truly discontented with the status quo. The promotion offer is all he needs. April, on the other hand, is stifled beyond the point where she can bear. Perhaps her own failure as an actress is the root of the problem. But in any event, she is the one that truly cannot live with her own mediocrity.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie is in the strong script and superb acting, particularly Winslet whom her loving husband in real life, Mendes, must have enjoyed directing. While he lets the actors do their part mostly, occasional use of the camera has good dramatic effects: angled shots, manipulation of focuses, reflections in mirror, characters frame in windows and such things. The entire film is shot is a warm, golden hue, which makes it so much more ironic, particularly in what must have already now become the famous ""the last breakfast"" scene which sent the worst shudder that I have ever experienced in a movie down my spine."
"RResende","Null","0","0","17 February 2009"," filling with emptiness
","Sam Mendes can do little wrong in my book. He envisions things cinematically, and he is always able to propose a mood, and transcribing it into film. So his films are always about a mood, and what he tries to do is something i value a lot: basically, the film, as a medium, should reflect the film, as a content. The film passes its characters urges, expectations, disillusions, onto us.<br/><br/>That's what we have here: emptiness. The film is about shallow characters, ridiculous hypocritical lives, unhappy people, afraid of facing their unhappiness (""no one ever forgets the truth, you only learn to lie better""). The story is meaningless for the facts in themselves (maybe the novel had a social impact in its days), what makes it worthy is the mood it suggests, that the film completes.<br/><br/>So the set up is quite simple. Mediocrity, middle class useless life-styles. Assumed and accepted lack of ambition. Paris as the synonym for self-superation (""it didn't have to be Paris""). Kate's character learns about her own frustrations, and that triggers the whole drama. Now, watch how this simplicity is transcribed to visual terms: -very few sets; the house, the woods, the working place, and a few more with little screen time. -the stupidity and shallowness underlined in every dialog, except for the lines of Winslet's character and Shannon's. -the simplicity in the cinematography choices. And the outcome of that, so effective. Watch the film, and check what you have of it in you, just a few hours after... nothing, just a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, frustration for something is missing in the film. Just like Kate's character was feeling. Get it? Kate is one of the finest actresses these days, the role here was a struggle between personality and submission, will to transcend and routine. She understood it so well.<br/><br/>Two interesting things:<br/><br/>Kate and Sam: actress/director couple. Both are interesting as artists. There is love. We can check it, frame by frame. Ted Goranson always remarks on husbands directing their wives, and i get it. It's a sort of extra motivation. Beyond the artistic urges and intentions that triggered the need in the director to create this film, we have a layer of extra-passion for he wants to bound his art to his love. It's a beautiful concept, truly.<br/><br/>We don't have Conrad Hall here. I missed that. OK, the intention was to make a highly simplified film, so strong iconic images were not so much the kind of game Mendes wanted to play here. But i miss the poetry of light, the poetry of understanding bodies, and body placement, and faces that Hall had. We have much to appreciate from what he left, but He and Mendes were so perfectly connected in the two projects where they worked together, that i get the sensation that some pages were not written as they should. Pity. Roger Deakins made a competent work here, me referencing C.Hall is not a depreciation of this film's cinematography.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

Whether Winslet's ""April"" had little talent as an actress or it was just wasted where it was exercised, pearls before and among swine, isn't clear. (Though hubbie Frank, played by ol' Leonardo DiCaprio, sure did go on about it in an annoying case of verbal diarrhea.) But, damn, I'd sure love the little woman to clasp me around the knees, and urge me to forsake gainful employment to ""find myself"" in Paris, where she'd support mebecause I am just that wonderful thing: a man! But Frank only reluctantly buys in, and especially after he takes a mistress and is offered a promotion at the office, it's clearer than ever that Paris is for Aprilit's her only hope for an alternative to decades of Stepfordian drudgery. Michael Shannon provides great, dark comic relief, as the son of a neighbor on furlough from electroconvulsive therapy (shock treatments) at a mental hospital.

","I loved this film, and I'm disappointed that it didn't receive more Oscar nods. I suspect it resonates more with women, than men. Not only are the roles of wife/mother/social being/etc. timeless, but I felt the crux of the story was April's descent into madness. She was not a well woman, and I see so little written up about it. She was not just dreamy-eyed about escaping the suburbs, but suffered from some sort of mental illness. I felt for her, and I agree that she was stronger than Frank, but her instability brought the couple's dynamic further down. Dreaming of dropping out, adultery, frustration over kids and suburban monotony are all part of (mid?) life, miserable as it may be at times. Frank tried to deal with them, though constricted by an exasperating, energy-draining wife. The 50s sets, costumes, etc. were beautiful, making the film more inviting to sink into, and I really appreciated everyone's performance. At first I, too, felt that poor, ageless Leo may be out of his league (I think that every time I see him, but then he settles into the role and, in no time, I am totally believing he is Howard Hughes!). And I noticed Frank's aging, too, or was it angst-ing? The Michael Shannon thing is a little lost on me. I just don't see that brief role as such a stretch. They say playing crazy is easy, but I say that Kate Winslet's slow slimmer to the pit of despair would be impossible for the average good actress in Hollywood to portray these days. And P.S. I would have preferred to see Kathy Bates get a nod for her role."

","Adapted from the acclaimed literary novel by Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road is very difficult film either to like or to easily dismiss.<br/><br/>Richard Yates, in writing his book wanted to compare the brave revolutionary spirit upon which America had been founded to the spiritless conformism which had taken hold in the 50's as a result of McCarthyism, where people clung to safety and security at any price. The demise of April and Frank Wheeler's relationship and the price paid for the conformism of their contemporaries is meant to symbolise the last flicker of a dying American flame. Sadly the film, despite being truly well done, delivers no such comparison.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes adaptation is certainly stylish, perfectly detailed and brutally honest. Kate and Leo are both excellent, the art design superb and Roger Deakins captures it all with his usual cinematic eloquence. It's all very high calibre stuff but yet I found it really hard to like or find anything new, relevant or meaningful to me in this melodramatic story.<br/><br/>In fact in the 21st century that I inhabit, I'm not sure any of the themes of Revolutionary Road have relevance. Perhaps in another context, perhaps in another film they might, but to spend two hours with April and Frank and their crowd, however beautifully portrayed they are, is to spend two hours with horrible shallow stereotyped people more in love with their ideas about life than anything else including themselves or each other. Who on earth, however brilliantly the film is made, would truly want to spend a couple of hours getting bogged down in that mire when there are other choices.<br/><br/>I wanted to like Revolutionary Road, the filmmakers have tried to give me stuff to like, and I did like most every aspect of how it was made. I just didn't relate to the people or the situation it was about and cared nothing for this story. More than anything I want to watch films that make me feel something. Sadly this revolution was just not up my road."

","I am 61 years old. I watched this movie with empathy reminding my 30s. Both husband and wife have strong upward desire but not contented. The husband seems he does not like his boss and his daily job. Thus they make their own big turning point, which is to sell everything and move to Paris, where the wife will work with high wage and the husband will seek something truly deserves to do. What a bold idea. However, while they are preparing for it, unexpected turning points come from outside. The husband's case is that his job is recognized and he is offered a new position with very good salary. For men, recognition and promotion are so attractive that all of dissatisfactions so far can be forgotten. I will not disclose what turning point comes to the wife to avoid spoiler. Anyhow, this is the story of a couple who lives on the road of symbolic name 'Revolutionary Road' and tries to make a revolutionary change in life, but faces unexpected turning points. I recall my wife and I had similar events in our 30's too. That is why I wrote I watched the movie with empathy."

","I didn't like that film. It appeared to be about an unhappy couple drifting apart because of their personal problems. That's something that always has gone on in real life. It might appeal to some people but I can't really handle real life tragic events like that. The ending was worse where April decides to abort her child and died in the process. Her wanting to do that was one thing that was breaking up the marriage. Abortion was apparently illegal in 1950s but there were people running there own abortions or worse aborting their own children. They were not trained medical people and some women died in the process. Some people take an interest in that but I prefer fantasy. I have taken in interest in history as well when it's about something that really did happen.<br/><br/>Titanic starring the same actors wasn't the best of films. It appears to be a made up story set on a real life ship. It at least shows what happened to the ship, people saying it can't sink, how it hit the iceberg, the damage caused, not enough life boats and what happened as a result.<br/><br/>In general I'd say both actors have been in better films."
"commandercool88","10","3","8","4 January 2009"," What happens to a dream deferred?
","'Revolutionary Road' digs and picks at a truth so awful and ugly that hiding it or pretending as though it doesn't exist is no longer an option. It is a festering sore below the surface. Ready to explode.<br/><br/>A 1950s Americana suburbia. Quaint little houses. Charming people. Green lawns filled with young rambunctious children. It is the image of desire, of success. But what goes on within those walls when the doors are closed to curious neighbors? What happens when the charming life you lead is anything but? A lie. A carefully constructed, well-manicured lie.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes leads the star-studded adaptation of Richard Yates' novel. It is an explosive observation of suburban life gone astray. Frank and April Wheeler find themselves playing the part. Doing what society tells them is the proper thing to do. Get married. Settle down. Have children. It is the life neither of them wanted. They abuse each other emotionally. Rip each other apart. Tear each other down. Because there is no one else to run to. No way out. No more fake it till you make it. 'Revolutionary Road' is a tragedy. A full-blown suburban tragedy.<br/><br/>The reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find the two under very different circumstances than 'Titanic'. These are two extraordinary performances from two of today's greatest screen talents. They hold no punches in this haunting tale, exploding with powerful emotions that help make 'Revolutionary Road' one of the most explosively entertaining pictures of the year. These are two individuals stuck with each other. Desperately looking for a way out. Putting on a show even to each other, pretending and promising that everything can be okay. And Winslet, who has been criminally passed up for an Oscar five times now, gives this performance everything she can. It is an absolutely devastating but profound role.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is no stranger to suburban turmoil. He directed 'American Beauty' with a fierce satirical eye. This time around, there's a much more suffocating sense of dread. It's a brooding atmosphere that intoxicates the senses, and 'Revolutionary Road' has a lot to say about this so-called American dream. Michael Shannon finds himself in the role of a mentally disturbed man, the son of the Wheeler's realtor. He makes keen observations about the world around him, and while his condition render his words as insanity, there is an undeniable truth to them. All the lies, all the emptiness. 'Revolutionary Road' is a downer, but difficult to argue against.<br/><br/>Hot to the touch, 'Revolutionary Road' stirs the pot and turns traditional expectations on its side. It's a disturbing tale of isolation and hopelessness. Mendes begs the question, at what cost? At what cost are we willing to put on this charade? To pretend to be something we aren't? It's one of this year's very best pictures, something that will leave a heavy shroud over you that's shockingly difficult to shake off.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

It's slow to take off, it's filled with expletives and lines that sound way too scripted. At the end of the movie, I just sighed and thought, ""well that's just too bad."" I think the director tried too hard to make this movie as it would occur in real life. That's great, but along with the ""reality sucks"" concept of this movie comes the eye-drooping mediocrity of the lives of the two main characters.<br/><br/>Kate and Leo do an excellent job of acting, though.

","Winslett is such an impressive performer because she manages to convey a natural., yet confident tone to her performance. I have rarely seen anyone show pain, despair, and confusion with so much conviction, without calling attention to the technical details, as some of our most outstanding performers do. She never seems to be acting; if it is almost as watching a real person on screen, and this make the impact even more powerful.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is a dark odyssey for both leads. It never really explains how the trap caught, or the level and origin of the dissatisfaction experienced by just everyone in the film. There are many unhappy people here, but the big tragedy is that of the Wheelers, a couple that seems who have everything, yet they seem to be desperate for a new dream, and reaching that dream is an impossible task because they don't truly know what is stifling them, or what they really want.<br/><br/>It takes an insane man to reveal and voice their feelings, and this is the beauty of the way the story is told. Because a ruined mind/soul is the only voicing the tragic nature of everyone's pain; it's not heeded, and the impact of that scene just speeds up the descent into even more tragic developments.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is touches us. Still our frustrations and reactions are still bothering us because we have not experienced any cathartic release. The ending is bound to upset the majority in the audience, as it destroys the illusion of a time that embodied perfection in society and simplicity in the home. It is as if we hate what we are discovered but are still fascinated by it. ""Blue Velvet"" was an experiment, and it successfully opened the door, yet the souls of the freaks seem detached. In ""Revolutionary Road"", the people seem normal, stuck in a pleasant and normal situation that has gone wrong, but it is just realistic enough to make us feel that it could happen to us, too.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is a phenomenal and disturbing movie, a strong artistic plunge into a world that we know exists but we can't find the courage to deal with."

","Wow what a brilliant film! Scarily real and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to (but would never admit it). Top class acting all round and possibly an Oscar-worthy performance from Kate Winslet. <br/><br/>Revolutionary Road shows the dark side of the stereotypical American dream - Married with kids in a nice big house in suburban America with a good job you love and driving a nice car. This 'American dream' is just an illusion that people convince themselves is where true happiness lies. When those people achieve this dream they realise it's not actually what they want in life, and therefore has the opposite effect. Their reaction is to convince themselves that it's what they want and they are in fact happy. I can truly believe this happens to a lot of real people all the time.<br/><br/>One thing I love about the film is the amount of irony, especially John Giving's (Michael Shannon) character of being a mentally ill man who says crazy things, who in fact is the only sane character in the whole film. He says what he's thinking and what he sees, where everyone else is superficial and delusional. <br/><br/>Very underrated film and I believe the people giving it a negative review don't understand it because they are too narrow-minded and naive - much like most of the characters in the film. To those people: watch the latest Transformers or Fast and Furious film as it's probably more your taste :)"
"zeedunn","5","2","5","25 July 2009"," What's the Point?
","I thought this movie should win the award for most depressing movie of the year. They could invent a new category with this film in mind. This movie is my worst nightmare come to life. Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) play a married couple in the 1950s. We understand that they are perfect for one another, but their marriage is horrible. They tear each other down and say awful things to one another. They are two wounded people bumping up against one another. They don't talk about these problems and instead focus on the surface problems. They have bought into the lie that ""this is as good as it gets."" One day, April decides that good enough isn't good enough and she wants a change. She decides she can find that life in Paris. If they would only move to Paris, then they would be happy. Frank agrees and then later changes his mind. They don't move to Paris and fight even more. The movie is this couple fighting the entire movie. Instead of talking to one another, they decide to have affairs to numb the pain of their lives. They tear each other apart until there is nothing left.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this is a well-made and interesting movie. I was riveted the whole time, and my heart was beating fast the entire film. I'm not really sure why that was. Needless to say, it was intense. The acting was superb. Forget about The Reader, Kate should have received an award for her performance here. The same goes for Leo. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, and I always will. I have loved him since he was a little squirt on Growing Pains. Both of these actors can show the torment they are feeling with one look. Then, effortlessly, they cover it up to hide their pain.<br/><br/>That would be enough, having two lead actors work this kind of magic, but the supporting cast is perfect as well. John (Michael Shannon) is perfect as a tortured mathematician whose had shock treatments. He is like an oracle who can only speak the truth, even though no one wants to hear it. There is never a dull dinner party when John is invited. The next door neighbors say much more when they are not speaking.<br/><br/>All that being said, what is the point of this movie? I am trying to imagine someone trying to spin this to a studio . . .<br/><br/>Storyboard guy: Okay, Joe, so there's this married couple, you see? And their both young and beautiful. They meet, get married, and they're miserable.<br/><br/>Joe: Mmm-hmmm.<br/><br/>Storyboard: One day they decide to move to Paris, but the husband, see, he changes his mind, and they don't move to Paris.<br/><br/>Joe: Mmm-hmmm Storyboard: Then they are still miserable, you see? Joe: Mmm-hmmm, but it ends okay, right? Storyboard: No, it gets worse.<br/><br/>Joe: Mmm-hmm. Well, I'm sold.<br/><br/>It's not a movie that will make you cry. You just feel empty, and wonder what the heck just happened.<br/><br/>What do we learn? Don't get married? Is the moral really you should have moved to Paris. Let's just get real here. It wouldn't matter if they lived in Paris or not. Neither one of them could admit their fears to one another. They never helped each to grow or took the time to reach out to one another. And that's the trap they couldn't escape, not suburban America."

","Could somebody please tell me what is it about? My first hypothesis is that the film illustrates a thesis that couple who believe themselves superior to everybody else end badly. Perhaps; but it is hardly worth making a movie about. Otherwise, I was at loss as to what was the plot of the story. She is frustrated in her role of a housewife, but it is not her husband's fault that she miscalculated her professional talents. Her lack of realistic assessment of herself and the situation is dramatically emphasized by her revolutionary plans for life: completely unrealistic. Besides, what is it that her husband is supposed to find when he seeks himself? My second hypothesis is therefore that the film is intended to illustrate the harm done no doubt to great many young people in the 1950s by the existentialists' myth of an ""authentic self"", which sits somewhere deep in us, to be dug out. What is more, the husband does actually get an interesting job, a job that, as we now know, has a brilliant future. Further, his infidelity is difficult to understand. We, the Hollywood clients, know that powerful men have romances with their secretaries. But secretaries choose powerful men, not zeroes in cubicles. An alternative template is therefore a passionate outburst of love, but both seem to be doing it rather of boredom, if anything. Nothing against Di Caprio and Winslett  they are playing well, but what are they playing?"

","What happens if/when you look in a mirror and can't begin to admit that you don't really like what you see? <br/><br/>Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road is a relentlessly bleak and compelling experience that can't be called an ""entertainment,"" but it's powerfully disturbing in ways that *art* can sustain, where ""conversations"" tend to die sudden deaths. <br/><br/>The Wheeler's are a 1950s married couple, complete with two kids and a house in the ""cozy"" CT burbs; but, like most of the repressed denizens of that day, they are failing at the ""Ozzie&Harriet""(TM) life, where 1+1 is supposed to =1 (""his"" one). <br/><br/>This house turns out not to be much of a home. <br/><br/>Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslett) are wholly disconnected and miserably incomplete. (The bedding on the sofa that April tends to in the first scene of her daily domestic ""bliss"" telegraphs that they haven't been sleeping together and not even in the same room.) <br/><br/>The two came together at a Bohemian ""Village"" party shortly after the close of WW2. Frank was an infantry veteran of the ETO, but remains a boy-man, floating from job-to-job and possessed with a ""charming"" frankness about himself. His only real ambition, besides not winding up like his Old Man, is to make his aimless, male prerogative bachelor ends meet. April was an aspiring actress with mildly diva-ish pretensions. April considers herself ""special,"" superior to the herds of lemming-like '50s conformity. She thinks she sees in Frank the most interesting man she's ever met and extrapolates that to also mean a kindred spirit. What Frank sees in April is the most stunning woman at the party who's willing to enter into his conversational orbit. It's a match filled with both promise and peril. <br/><br/>Bun in the oven, the two marry and assemble the customary pieces of life needed to Play House, still fueled by a young and otherwise untested love. As they travel down a road of material practicality, though, safety becomes conformity and deep disenchantment. Whatever ""special""-ness they might've thought they shared got lost along the way. <br/><br/>Frank and April become almost exactly like all of the other suburban drones that they once considered themselves to be vastly superior to. April, as it turns out, might not be an actress, after all, for all of her formal studies. Frank is an Ad Man working for the same Gray Flannel company that his Old Man once toiled for over in Sales. <br/><br/>April is the more desperate of the two, because her days are filled with the small trials of raising of two children in the isolated social barrenness of a not-quite-arrived suburbia. The kids rarely turn to Frank when he's home. Frank has the daily diversions of his commute into NYC, the shallow banter of his co-worker AdMan flacks and the distractions of the secretarial pool. April feels trapped. Frank is feeling 30. Each seems to have only the other to blame for their predicament. <br/><br/>None of the ""others,"" who also inhabit this story, who don't openly aspire to April's personal sense of ""specialness,"" are altogether pleased with their own lives, either, but they repeatedly choose resignation. <br/><br/>This is a time when women were routinely *diagnosed* as being ""hysterical"" (as if it were a XX-chromosomal disease) and social non-conformists sentenced to ""funny farms"" and electro-shock ""therapy."" Nothing at all wrong with Society, so all problems have to be individual. All of these details serve to illustrate the hairline fissures in custom and culture that would erupt in the decades to follow. <br/><br/>Frank and April each embark on their own extra marital affair. And, even in that, April's options prove to be more desperate and less superficially gratifying than Frank's. (Think three-minute wonders here, and April's refusal to even pretend that Shep has anything to do with ""love."") <br/><br/> ... <br/><br/>Do any of us know even one couple, today, that's in the grips of a Wheeler-ish predicament? <br/><br/>Have any of us ever bellowed, or muttered, any of the caustic lines in the film toward anyone that we claim to positively care about? <br/><br/>Does any husband, today, turn up his iPod in order to tune out his wife and/or the kids? <br/><br/>Which is worse? An act of martial infidelity or all of the tiny little deaths/failings in a committed relationship that come before? <br/><br/>Even if women truly have more personal/individual choices available to them, today, than they did in the 1950s, don't almost all of these come with additional burdens, stemming from perniciously persistent gender roles that have more to do with sociology than biology? <br/><br/>When women, in particular, are made to suffer, are men immune to any/all collateral damage? <br/><br/>These and other questions raised by this film make it either a riveting watch or completely obtuse. <br/><br/>There's no way to see RR and remain unmoved. <br/><br/>I praise the terrific acting of Winslett, DiCaprio and Shannon (as the lone, sanely astute commentator in this brutally tragic story). I also credit Mendes for his direction and Haythe's screenplay adaptation of the Yates' novel, despite the role of Frank being so internally pared down. <br/><br/>This is a very tough film to have a shallow conversation about, because it is whithering social commentary, none of which is safely buried 53 years in *our* past. The contradictions depicted in the film are very much alive today, dressed with more modern veneers, as we face a real possibility of entering into a Great Depression II of our own collective making and *continue* to question a woman's right to reproductive choices. <br/><br/>This isn't the best film of this year, in my book; but it's a must see and quite possibly a litmus test for where we are in our own lives today."

","I was absolutely haunted and troubled after watching Revolutionary Road. I thought it about all night and thus didn't sleep much. The story is troubling since it can very well be something you or someone you think wouldn't, could be actually going throughthe Special family. <br/><br/>The movie starts off harsh and you know it's not good to be begin with. When they rally around their hopeful thought of escape via Paris, you want to think that it will turn out well for them or at least they'll rekindle that some happiness again. Of course that was temporary but you wouldn't think how gruesome it would end. <br/><br/>I was thinking about who to blame, and I lean towards April. She's closed off and temperamental. Though they are both unfulfilled in their lives, she has the hardest time because she has nothing going for her that she wants. She tried being an actress and failed. She's been domesticated and she has hated ever moment of it. Experimenting with herself with the high degree of risk means she get out of the ""can't leave, can't stay"" conundrum that she's faced with. It's such a tragic fate for her, but it was her only option. <br/><br/>Frank tried to the best that he can. When he finally was presented with his purpose, he was happy to stay where he was and open to his promising future. I think he's like most men during that era working, family oriented and fine with the ""ordinary"" day to day life. I don't think April needed Paris, but she needed to find her purpose. The crazy guy provides the vocal narration and while I do agree with his comments, his frankness was a bit over the top that made the film too much. A dab of his smart jabs would have been enough. <br/><br/>April's final scene with her back turned to the audience against the beautiful sunny day and the blood forming on her skirt! Simply anguish!!! This is the vision that made a lasting and distributed impression of the movie. Very well done."

","I've always thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was a very underrated actor, although Titanic probably puts a lot of people of the scent of his acting skills, it is quite anomaly in his acting career, most of which is exceptional. For example, before Titanic he had a very interesting role in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape', in which I didn't even recognise him and only realised it was him when I saw the credits, he was that believable. I think in his case he is in some people's eyes restrained by his youthful physicality but nevertheless, does possess range, charisma and authenticity in abundance.<br/><br/>I thought this film was astonishing - very difficult to watch at times, as the arguments were so real, ferocious and sprawling. But I found it was in that starkness and reality that the compassion of the film came through, as it was so unblinking in confronting such difficult and ego-ridden issues. The characters were so believably self-contradictory, and confused, it was just like real life! I think this film might come across as a bit of a drag if you expect to be entertained rather than very hardly prodded. This is the type of movie that does invade your head space, but without providing any simplistic morality or easy answers. The plot is inconclusive and leaves a lot of unresolved tension, and it's definitely a film that asks more questions than it answers. For that reason I really liked it, but I can understand that others who see life as considerably less fraught with tension might wonder - what's all this fuss about?!"

","I just finished the screener version of this movie and I was impressed. The script is one of the best adaptation of a novel I have seen since The Godfather. The acting is on target in every scene and the editing does not disappoint. If you read the book you know the story and it plays out well here, but with more emphasis on April than Frank. At about 50 minutes into the film on a stroll through the woods with John Givings the main axis of the story is told. With the revelation that April and Frank are to move to Paris John asks ""So what do a couple of young people like you have to run away from ?"", to which Frank replies, ""Maybe we are running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here."". John then muses ""Plenty of people are onto the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."". The next day (53:16 in the film) Frank is offered a better position in his firm. What will he do ? Frank isn't the man that April fantasized that he was when he returned from WW II with visions of Paris, a dream she has that makes her better then her surroundings, but leaves her empty like the vacuum tubes in the new Electronic Computers Frank decides to sell instead of escaping with April and their family to Paris. This is a movie that will appear deeper to those with more life experience than those with less, but certainly would be one to watch at many different points in ones life. Bravo to the filmmaker, cast and crew on the best effort (In the countless hours of screener I have watched this month) I have seen."
"happyendingrocks","5","2","6","9 June 2009"," A movie for people who love watching people argue.
","Let's get this out in the open: Sam Mendes' American Beauty is an absolute masterpiece. This is the sole fact that led me to set aside time for this film even though I heard nothing but bad things about it.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road isn't a bad film at all, but it is inherently pointless and depressing. If you consider those negative film traits, you probably won't enjoy this too much.<br/><br/>You're probably going to hear that the acting on display is superb, but one would suspect that most people only say that because Leo DiCap and Katie Win are SUPPOSED to be great actors, therefore everything they do must be fantastic. They're not bad here by any means, but nothing in this film rivals the output of your local theater troupe. This isn't really LeoKat's fault; they're given very little to work with here.<br/><br/>We don't need to recount the plot here... You already know that this movie is about an unhappy couple. What's really missing is any source for their unhappiness. Without basic character motivation, it's hard to get too invested in their squabbles, and since all LnK do here is fight, that leaves the viewer wondering a bit why we're seeing what we are. The meager hints of the couple's malaise involve general dissatisfaction with their stations in life, which hardly seem enough to spark the two-hour cheating and screaming fest that unfolds here.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that Leonardo DiCaprio still looks like he's 12 years old. Not the dude's fault, and I'm not trying to be a jerk, but it's just rather strange to absorb the image of this man-of-the-house world-weary soul when said soul looks like a Junior High school lad trying on his dad's suit.<br/><br/>The ending is particularly perplexing, as the focus shifts to secondary characters we didn't get to know well enough to care about. There is some minor symbolism at play in the fleeting moments, but nothing that leaves the viewer with any sense of reward for their two-hour journey.<br/><br/>This film is best recommended for fans of LeWin who salivate at the prospect of these two gifted actors yelling at each other for transgressions ranging from infidelity to mediocre acting. This is not another slag at the stars' performances; the first argument we see in this film is indeed about KateSlett not being a good actress.<br/><br/>Where the catharsis comes into play here, I'm not sure. I'll concede that it's possible I missed the point somehow, but I think it's equally likely that Mendes truly thought that putting the pair who led Titanic on the screen together again was enough, and that he didn't need to make them interesting, or even likable, for us to follow them through another masterful study of failed human relationships.<br/><br/>KatLeo's characters in this film are miserable excuses for human beings, and whatever they get they kind of deserve. Since this film is ostensibly meant to make us sympathize with the tragedy of their crumbling union, Revolutionary Road is pretty much a failure out of the gate.<br/><br/>The two hours you'll spend here could be better spent watching American Beauty again instead. The asphalt here is nice and shiny, but this Road doesn't lead anywhere."

","Playing a business equipment salesman in the 1950s--a husband and father of two whose life has become a depressing rut--Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't quite have the chops here to portray angst successfully. The 30-year-old blues appear to have arrived too early for the actor (even Richard Burton had to wait a while before the marital blahs wore well on him). DiCaprio works commendably hard under Sam Mendes' direction, furrowing his brow and keeping his voice in a lower register, but he still looks like a kid in his suits and hats. Kate Winslet (reunited with DiCaprio after their successful pairing in 1997's ""Titanic"") plays his housewife-spouse, and looks terrific in her '50s wardrobe even if her character is almost impossible to reach (she's either too stony or too talkative). This prestigious-looking adaptation of Richard Yates' novel is rather like a Douglas Sirk melodrama with the central issue missing. It is purposefully glossy and plush, yet the argumentative digs and disappointments which crop up between this immature-acting couple are supposed to be far more edgy and provocative than those found in Sirk's potboilers. One might be forgiven for wondering what the hell is eating away at these two; opening with a fight scene in front of their car at night, I felt DiCaprio's Frank and Winslet's April were eons away from George and Martha of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Winslet simply cannot eke out a tangible character within this sterile format (one wants to like her April solely because Winslet looks so beautiful, but April has far less dimensions than most heroines). The husband's job, the couple's plans for the future, the neighbor next-door who harbors a secret crush on the unhappy Mrs., all contribute to making this portrait an interesting journey--but is it a worthwhile, moving experience? I don't believe so, not with these leads and not with Justin Haythe's callow screenplay. ""Revolutionary Road"" (terrible title!) promises to be a heady exercise; it has the impeccable production and slick sweep of a good commercial movie for grown-ups, but Mendes instead offers us selfish adult children and endless bickering. Give me Sirk any day. Three Oscar nominations: for Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor, Albert Wolsky for his costume design (deservedly so) and for art direction. ** from ****"

","If you are interested in entertainment then get an ""Iron Man"" or something like this – and this is not to be taken as a reproach, sometime we need just mindlessly relax. However if you would like to entertain meaning of your own life and re-examine its fundamental principles then this film is for you. Yes, this is Oskar-price material, in all respects, and I did enjoy it very much and not likely to forget any time soon. This is not mindless and manipulative, self-serving sludge, but something you can take home with you, keep and use it to improve your own life.<br/><br/>The ""Revolutionary Road"" is not necessarily a street name; rather it is an attitude toward life. And so what if Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) are both seem to be an ""ordinary people""? They loved the house on ""Revolutionary Road"" - understand this as a symbol of self-creation. When we are young we are all 'potentiality', we are a blank slate to be filled with anything. Soon we settle and stop dreaming, stop examining our lives – this is like death. After a while, Frank's and April's lives became rather mundane, not 'revolutionary'. This became the physical death of April and the emotional death of Frank. Although Frank physically survives and now dedicated his life to his children, his responsibility to himself, as individual, is unfulfilled and there is no future for him as a person.<br/><br/>The only authentic person in this story is Bill (Michael Shannon), who's happened to be psychotic and who undergone 27 shock therapy treatments, correction that society administer to make one socially acceptable; after all we can not just allow anyone forget their responsibility, don't we? He comes to the ""Revolutionary Road"" and feels at the right place, until Frank and April veer off this road. He's like their self-consciousness, unwavering and brutally honest; self-consciousness they would violently banish (Frank almost hits him and April is also angry at him). The fact that he is psychotic is another confirmation of his symbolism as anti-social construct of human psyche.<br/><br/>The film does not answer any specific question, it only raise and examine issues from several perspectives. It strongly asserts that we must treat our lives very seriously, not just live them. It is not that we need to give up everything and move to Paris, no! Paris is not a place, it is a state of being where you still have dreams of self fulfillment and constantly reexamining your life seeking meaning of your existence. When other people allude to Frank and April that, literally taken, moving to Paris, is ill conceived, they are neither wrong nor shortsighted. Literally moving to Paris will not solve any problem; moving to 'Paris' must be done psychologically, as an act of self-reevaluation. And it is not a matter of responsibilities toward people you love, its most of all responsibility toward yourself, to know that you are not settled (i.e. dead) but actively seeking meaning of your existence, that you are 'full of life and blood' as Frank said – for if you stop this process you are also not very good for the people you love.<br/><br/>Another interesting feature of the film is that it considers both freedom and constraint as dialectic opposites. Some people operate well and are very creative and fulfilled while constrained by a situation. You can always strive to be the best you can at you job, or be a good mother or father. Social constraints are not necessarily evil. For instance, look at the constraint of a religion – it is dogmatic but within these hard set canonical boundaries there is a great opportunity to improvise and achieve great results. On the other hand, some people can not deal with any constraint. Such people either create their own rules or are perpetually miserable while forced to live by rules of others. The former are the stuff from which great people are made of, the latter are eternally miserable. <br/><br/>These are different facets of the human condition which is an essence of our nature. This film quietly and seriously deals with these important issues. It is a worthy addition to our path toward better self-knowledge."
"Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","9","2","6","8 January 2009"," An incredibly HEAVY & ACCURATE portrayal of the greatest obstacle in life
","I guess Sam Mendes is a pretty dependable director. This is a near perfect movie. <br/><br/>One of the heavy, sad themes of the movie is ""letting go of your inner child"". There are people that are fortunate enough to be put in positions that allow them to keep this part of themselves alive for their entire lives, but the truth is that isn't usually the case.<br/><br/>The movie is a tale of 2 wonderful, creative, intelligent people basically being torn to pieces by everything that forms our world. In the end, I feel that behind it all, if Kate and Leo's characters were allowed to do exactly what they wanted to with their lives, they would have stayed in love and in a healthy relationship until death. Unfortunately, life does not always allow people to do whatever they've always dreamed of doing. That rarely seems to be the case, sadly enough. <br/><br/>So here, you are presented with the demise of their love story. Yes, it is as depressing as you would assume it is and as depressing as people tell you it is. <br/><br/>This movie sums up the biggest obstacle in life. <br/><br/>What is ultimately the most dependable source of happiness in life? LOVE. What is the number one obstacle that gets in the way of making LOVE last? LIFE ITSELF. Everything else...<br/><br/>It's a heavy movie and it certainly isn't going to make you feel great, but HELLO, this is a realistic portrayal of just what is going on every day. This is a struggle that ANYONE with a heart and a brain has to deal with, and therefore it is a universally powerful film. <br/><br/>Of course there couldn't be much better candidates to star than Leo and Kate, they both made it beyond believable. Viewers complain that they couldn't get into the movie because they didn't like the characters - I think they need to realize that even the best people can go into psychotic, helpless, horrible phases once life has them by the balls. <br/><br/>I also loved ""the lunatic"" who wasn't a lunatic at all just simply a man who had the world figured out a little too intensely and could see right through it, therefore had lost his desire to be a part of the system. Unfortunately there are people like all over the world. It's unfortunate that sometimes the most intelligent ones are the ones who lose the desire to maintain a ""stable life"". In the 50's I don't think this was as common as it seems to be now, so I guess they put him in a loony bin for his views... I got along with him great though!!!<br/><br/>Sam Mendes knew exactly what he was doing. That's all I have to say.<br/><br/>Blaaaaaa this movie just tackled so many of the most powerful and engaging things in life that I cannot stress how good it was. I could go on and on but I'm going to stop myself right here. I want to see it again, right now. God dammit."

","""I'll never let go jack, Ill Never Let Go"". Those were the last words that Kate Winslet said to Leonardo Di'Caprio just over 10 years ago in the film we all know as Titanic. A film which would be known to almost every human on earth. 10 years later the first words that would rekindle the on screen duo would be ""So what do you do?"" ""Im Studying to be an actress"" would be the reply.<br/><br/>Here is my REVOLUTIONARY ROAD review.<br/><br/>First off, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is not a movie for everyone. The movie is extremely slow and all it does is focus around a married couple living in a suburban community in the 1950's. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes who also directed the Oscar Nominated film American Beauty. My first complaint being that i felt this movie was just a little to much like American Beauty only set in a different time period, but i loved that movie so this was just as good to me. I just wish Sam Mendes could come out of the box a little bit and try something a little broader.<br/><br/>Frank and April Wheeler are both around 30 with two kids who think that they can escape the traps of existence they have chosen. The movie begins with them meeting at a party and then goes straight to the marriage Frank works at a job he hates but continues there because the money is decent. April is an ""actress"" who believes she is destined for better things. One day April comes up with the idea just to drop everything, move to Paris and live the rest of their lives their. She can work as a Government secretary and Frank can ""find himself"". April later finds out she is 10 weeks pregnant. Could this stop them from going to Paris? Will they ultimately just be stuck on REVOLUTIONARY ROAD for the rest of their lives while Frank works at his crap poor job? What keeps them together? Is It Love or something else? The story of the characters was absolutely amazing. Some scenes I could not turn away from. I just sat there an gazed in trance at what was going on. The last 30 minutes of the movie really stand out. It was the last 30 minutes that I could not stop thinking about for a day. And the last scene in the movie. It has the Givings (neighbors) talking about Revolutionary Road and the new family that lives on the road. It is a scene that ends the movie perfectly, because it shows what could have been had things gone another way. I can not reveal what i mean by this exactly to those who have not seen the movie. But for those who have, they will know what i am talking about. It basically shows how the wheelers would have been had things gone a different way.<br/><br/>The viewer should know in the first 15 minutes if it is going to be a movie that they should walk out of or stay and see what it has to offer.<br/><br/>The movie is called Revolutionary Road because that is the road that they live on. My thoughts to the reason given for the title is because the movie is not just about Frank and April but about their neighbors and friends. The movie is Extremely realistic to most romances. Being married is not all about the high life. People cheat on each other. People like to try to act like the perfect family around others and then go home and be the exact opposite. That is life. This is what makes the movie brilliant. After viewing the movie i honestly did not know how i felt about it I knew the performances were amazing. All of them I would say Leo delivers the performance of his lifetime, and so does Kate. I really hope that it finally knocks her the Oscar she deserves.<br/><br/>To be honest though, to me the most noted performance of the whole movie is actually by Michael Shannon. Michael having done most villainous roles or quick cameos really puts it all into his character. Michael plays John Givings who is a mathematician and has been hospitalized for insanity due to his genius thoughts and the fact that he says what everyone else wants to. It is his character to me that really opens up the movie and at times will make you laugh and get away from the dark moments surrounding the character. This goes back to the part where I talked about the title coming from the characters. John is the son of a couple that lives on Revolutionary Road and they try to act like they are perfect. They go over Frank and Aprils quite often and never mention their son until he gets out where they must confess that he is not right in the head and then actually have them meet with Frank and April. Later John has a scene with at the dinner table that i think should be remembered for a long time.<br/><br/>The movie is very dark. The moments are dark. It goes deep into relationships and it goes deep into suburban life. This may be why it reminds me so much of American Beauty. The movie was so deep that as said before i did not know how i felt about the movie. I literally was thinking about the events and actions in the movie for the whole next day. I rate this as one of the best movies of 2008. It was so deep and dark.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10. But like i said it is not for everyone. Only for those who are really into the development of characters or deep stories. I guess if you like American Beauty then there is a 80% chance you will like this as well."

","25 January 2009. ""Revolutionary Road"" is easily one of the more complex and inconsistently brilliant movies flecked with flaws this year. It is both stunning and irritatingly frustrating in its delivery. From the beginning ""Revolutionary Road"" recklessly and immediately jumps into an overly quick and much too brief a dive into a passionate relationship between Leo DeCarpio and Kate Winslet and then cuts to Kate Winslet's somewhat questionable but deliberate performance on stage as her character's ambition as an actress. Suddenly we are then transported into the future where we see our ""perfect couple"" with the requisite two children who seem to be conveniently missing for most of this movie. There are snatches of what seem to be flashbacks in order to provide some meaningful continuity and emotional connections which may have been better suited to a linear chronological presentation (as the flashbacks seem to disappear a third of the way into the movie). Kathy Bates is wonderful in the first half of this movie with her nuanced performance.<br/><br/>The plot, screenplay attempts to be strong and edgy and at times it appears to succeed, yet some of the dialogue, especially the heated arguments between Leo and Kate seem awkward and artificial at times. Nevertheless, the substantive plot points are solid and meaningfully presented as difficult dramatic elements that are successfully performed on screen. Yet for all the dazzle and flash, it is difficult to believe that the values and implicit directorial outcome of this movie might not be stained with a dislocated overlay of contemporary 21st Century morality over the actual 50s mentality and value system.<br/><br/>In order to make his big point and climax in the movie somewhat like ""American Beauty"" (1999), ""Revolutionary Road"" has its big scene that is not quite as satisfying because the movie continues on trying to make a statement and tie up some loose connections that even begins to resemble a horror film ending where the whole experience could repeated over again and again. While the basic statement of this movie might be legitimate, it doesn't necessarily seem consistent with the reality of the 50s and the outcome and some of the script appear to be more dramatized and made up and imposed on the societal norms of the 50s.<br/><br/>Who is ""crazy"" in this movie is an interesting question. Whether childish, rash notions of finding oneself here or elsewhere is the point and whether one can actually find one's self by relocating somewhere else without first examining one's inner demon's first is questionable. Overall, this movie is powerful, compelling, but appears tainted by some questionable editing decisions (one brief scene where Kate Winslet is looking away from her house instead of at it after a flashback regarding how wonderful the house seemed to reduce the emotional flow of the scene), some questionable dialogue choices and arguments that feel somewhat flat, and the imposition of basic premises regarding the culture of the 50s our assuming we can impose our beliefs of today onto it."

","This film shows us the comfort of western life, a hoax with which we teach and say that people should be happy. Also see two pairs actors and couple of friends who comply with the system established. The performance of the actors is good, although I have trouble seeing Leonardo Dicaprio otherwise gives me the feeling that always makes the same role in all his films and continue along the same line. The best thing about the film was Michael Shannon, in his role as crazy, dropping truths ... to what extent is crazy? Do you consider crazy out of the system?. In summary Revolucionary Road not a great movie, I expected more. All that said, I do not think that is a great movie, it is not the masterpiece it could have been. I think the film tiptoes through some problems and some solutions also affecting drama film which may not be entirely relevant, but I for one can not stop and take them into account missing your consideration."

","Fine acting by Leonard d' Capri and Kate Winslet that deserved applause in most scenes. Kate definitely deserved the Golden Globe.

The movie was realistic. <br/><br/>I don't personally find enough revolution on the road taken by the director for this romance-drama. No definite plot for this movie something like 'sex' followed by 'smoking' followed by 'swearing' followed by 'drinking' followed by 'hate' followed by 'despair' etc. .

"paul2001sw-1","6","1","2","21 January 2012"," What is the point of Leonardo di Caprio?
","Sam Mendes 'American Beauty' was in my opinion overpraised: the script, a satire on suburban life, had its share of funny and perceptive moments, but ultimately pulled its punches. The director is back on the same territory with 'Revolutionary Road', only this time, his story is set in the 1950s. The look and feel of that decade is immaculately reconstructed (though were American kitchens really this modern?), but the tale is sadly simpler than his previous film, and amounts to little more than the assertion that suburban life is rubbish, even for the prosperous. There are few unexpected twists to the script, a ponderous and over-present background score, and to make it worse, Leonardo di Caprio plays the male lead. I can understand that when he was younger, women found him cute; but as an adult actor, he never fails to disappoint, decorating every role he with the same self-important whining. To me, he's an unappealing protagonist and fails to command my sympathy. The truth is, not everyone can direct films for a living, and if you can't, a life in the suburbs is probably as good as any. Of course, that's not to say that everyone is happy there; but the darkness in human hearts does not come from real estate and a garden, and I didn't see much insight into the deeper causes here."

","The Wheelers are a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates whereas April (Kate Winslet) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. April's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Emasculated, he has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April suggests a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of exhilaration and April desperately wants him to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the comatose corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of (supposedly) living dead in their midst?<br/><br/>Eleven years after their mega-hit ""Titanic"" (1997), Kate and Leonardo reunite for ""Revolutionary Road,"" released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty whereas Leonardo is a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.<br/><br/>I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent ""Snow Angels"" (2007), the potent ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) or the masterpiece ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989), but ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my core criterion for evaluating any flick. In quality and theme, it's reminiscent of ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990).<br/><br/>Like ""Joe,"" it's a slyly offbeat drama despite being about American conventionality. The best parts involve Michael Shannon as John, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their suburban paradise are crazy (big surprise). But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really crazy. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war ""paradise,"" and rebelled, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Some important questions are raised: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is there more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.<br/><br/>Some have suggested that the film is one POSSIBLE outcome if Jack had survived the end of ""Titanic"" and married Rose: The once spirited, carefree Jack settles into the robotic grind to pay the bills while Kate is left frustrated at home in suburbia. Regrettably, it's overall mediocre due to the unengrossing characters and their story, which of course links to the theme its espousing.<br/><br/>Yet it does have flashes of greatness and it makes you reflect on its points. In some ways, the same message is addressed in ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon,"" to a lesser degree): rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams. The difference is that ""Dead Poets Society"" (and ""Grand Canyon"") accomplished this with absorbing stories whereas ""Revolutionary Road"" doesn't. Generally speaking, that is. Yet it's still worth catching if its themes trip your trigger.<br/><br/>The film runs almost 2 hours and was shot in Connecticut & New York City.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"

","Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are a young married couple living with their two kids in Connecticut in the 1950s. Their life is basically fine, but both long for more: he is disillusioned with his steady but boring office job, while she feels suffocated by the quiet life of a housewife. To escape their dull reality, April suggests they move to France and start over there, finally realizing their old, buried dream. Although initially excited about the idea, Frank and April soon have to face many difficulties life throws at them – the move to Europe starts seeming less and less sensible. Is there any way to overcome their desperation?<br/><br/>The Wheelers' idea seems laughably idealistic at first, but the feeling of being trapped by the endless responsibilities of respectable life is easy to identify with, and in the end their planned move is not at all difficult to understand. The ironically bright and sunny cinematography and the fact that the story is set in the narrow-minded 1950s add to the mood of deadly pleasantness too. The most telling of the scenes may be the conversation where April explains that she never wanted to get out of her life, but in it.<br/><br/>One of the film's main assets is the acting. Especially Kate Winslet performs her part with masterful precision; every small emotion comes to life on her face without ever looking unnatural or exaggerated. DiCaprio does a good job too, but his credibility as a serious adult is sadly diminished by his youthful, boyish looks (perhaps a cliché criticism, but I cannot ignore it). The Wheelers' situation is also reflected to their family friends Shep and Milly who are implied to be going through similar sentiments but with less self-confidence; David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn convey this feel of unspoken envy with ease. Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mentally unstable former mathematician, also deserves a nod for his portrayal of the seemingly aggressive but ultimately bitter and self-pitying speaker of truth; so does his on-screen mother Helen, played by Kathy Bates.<br/><br/>Together DiCaprio, Winslet and director Mendes craft a well-made drama that evokes memories from Mendes' first hit American Beauty (1999). Especially the haunting music at the end of Revolutionary Road immediately leads thoughts to Lester Burnham and Co. but the emphases are different in both films. Perhaps the newer film could have used a little more of element of surprise to raise it into the master class, but it is an enjoyable, if forlorn, tale of anxiety at any rate."

There is no story arc beyond what your assumption would be from that first fight. Nothing unexpected happens, and no one changes in the film from the people you see in that first fight. It is so boring I was willing the time counter to move faster. If it weren't for Kate and Leo starring in it, I would have turned it off, but felt an annoying obligation to watch, thinking maybe there would be something more just around the next corner. No such luck.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road left out the revolution and revelation while promising expectations that never get delivered. Yes everyone has dreams and some people are fearful of reaching for them, some settle and are happy with that and others can't abide settling.

","If ""Revolutionary Road"" were a theater play it could have been written by some Eugene O'Neil, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Sam Shepard or Travis Litt. <br/><br/>Indeed, it fits perfectly well in the row of American family drama written for the last decade. ""Revolutionary Road"", in some aspects even seems like it is a mixture of plays from above mentioned playwrights. Certain moments are reminiscent of some ""Death of a Salesmen"" by Miller e.g. Frank Wheeler's job, working at the same place where his father has worked for twenty years. Some other moments remind of ""Buried Child"" by Sam Shepard, especially with the symbolism of nature, fertility and the rejection of the own child. Tenessee Williams' play ""Stairs to the Roof"", however, seems to be the most relevant play for this film. Wheeler working on the ""15th floor"" of some business building, his unsatisfied life with his desire to escape and his unfaithfulness to his wife are just a few similarities to mention. With all these resemblances, one could argue that this material was never intended to be produced as a film. But Richard Yates, the writer of the novel, obviously liked the idea and Sam Mendes, known director since ""American Beauty"", liked it as well. <br/><br/>And so, this Hollywood-product came to surface. ""Revolutionary Road"", in some constant tension between fantasy and reality, between naturalism and some surreal, absurd, does indeed, achieve some great moments of high tension but due some weak moments of acting, especially by the wrong-cast of Leaonardo Di-Caprio and the film's (the studios?) wish to stay ""mainstream"", ""Revolutionary Road"" fails to prevail this tension and simply falls apart into the simplicity of some exaggerated narcissism piece.<br/><br/>Mendes's decision, the use of several one-shot scenes, allowing it's actors to unfold their capabilities and the audience to be closer to the protagonists, could've been some courageous act but Mendes does not seem capable to fully stretch the scenes in its dramaturgy and push them towards a even longer and provocative tendency. Therefore even longer transitions still turn up as some hasty, impatient cuts. Maybe it was his in-confidence in acting, maybe it was simply the difficulty to wrap up initial moments of the novel and leave others out, and maybe it was just to fulfill the American audience desire for faster cuts. Whatever reason it was, it caused to lower the tension of the film, it's directness and it's power."

They never felt as if they fit in and it's also why they were partly attracted to each other in the first place. This films marks also the reunion between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their first since Titanic. Those two turned out to be a few of the greatest actors of their generation and not only are they fully in control of their amazing acting gifts, their chemistry is undeniable. The rest of the cast is completed by fine actors especially the disturbed former engineer. I compare to Titanic but it's more intimate than epic, more suburban drama than romance although there's a fair bit of it that encounters the pitfalls of convention, hypocrisy and fear of change. Revolutionary Road is much closer in spirit to American Beauty by the same director. <br/><br/>It's based on an 1961 novel but I found that most of the issues explored are still valid today. Perhaps not how Kate Winslet's character would act in the second half (although it's understandable for the period) but more how certain values and peer pressure can create obstacles preventing us from reaching true happiness and how people react to it. Actually, beyond the couple's conflict, it's the clash of different values that was fascinating to me. It's very dramatic in parts but also subtle emotionally and psychologically. None of the characters are outright bad, they're just human and flawed. I was engrossed by the story and the characters. If there's a slight weakness, it would be that not enough time was spent on showing exactly how the 2 main characters thought differently than the rest of society. I also see how some viewers might be bored by the limited scope and ticked at some of the personal actions taken. One of my joys was to guess what would happen next at certain pivotal events and trying to guess what was taking place inside the character's heads. The dialogues were great, sounded right and were delivered perfectly. The production design was top-notch and nothing seemed out of place or anachronistic although I'm not a specialist of that era. I think Revolutionary Road was indeed one of the best dramas of 2008 and it deserved all the accolades it got.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5 out of 10"
"Gunn","8","1","2","28 September 2009"," For what it is, it's well done!
","This is not a movie I'd want to see when I'm in a downer mood. I do get the film's message, that marriage can be a struggle for some. Being a single guy who never married, sometimes I wish I'd married and other times I'm glad I didn't. Watching this film I saw what a struggle it can be and back in the 50s divorce was pretty much scorned upon. So many people lived loveless marriages. Many made the best of the situation. Most folks I know seem to have adapted well and make the best of their marriages. To this day I see very few couples holding hands or snuggling up. It seems that marriage isn't what it's cracked up to be for a lot of people or is it that as people age they're less affectionate, at least in public. Revolutionary Road begins with the initial and strong attraction between the principle characters. Was it love or just physical attraction? As the marriage goes on they settle into the ""American Dream"", a nice house, a well paying but boring job, two little beautiful kids. After the marriage all is well until the monotony moves in. They make plans to move to Paris, kids and all, to fulfill their dreams but then reality hits them and she becomes pregnant. They grow tired of each other and everything gets worse. There are reasons for all of this and they are evident. Sam Mendes has put a beautiful, but very sad story, on screen brilliantly. It takes place in the 1950s and the art direction is fabulous. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as is the supporting cast. Thomas Newman's music score is perfection as is Roger Deakins cinematography. I prefer happier, more uplifting films but I must admit that this is a very good film!"
"bluekarma06","8","1","2","17 September 2009"," Powerful but Flawed message...
","Yea, this was a powerful movie about an young unhappy 1950's suburban couple. Was it the husband who made it thus or was it the wife? Was it her insistence on them leaving and re-sparking the idealism that attracted them in first place? Was it her dreams that she couldn't let go of? There is an old saying that ""wherever you go, there you are"". Bottom line is you can't hide from yourself. You can run to Paris, but when you get there you soon find out that it isn't the people or the place that makes you what you are, but it is what you are already! Yea, she wanted to become and actress, but would she of been a better actress in gay Paree? So often we think things will be better somewhere else, that the grass is greener. Hey, grass is grass no matter what color it is! Everywhere you go in this world, people are dealing and coping with life. No one can predict what might of happened in Paris had they moved there. When you dream, you mostly dream about the good stuff, the post card scenery but you forget that even in Paris they have slums. I liked the film for its performances but the bottom line is that you choose your life. You choose it every second. You can't UN-choose it or choose it in advance. You get what you get. All the crying and whining and complaining won't make a difference because when you get somewhere else, you will find plenty to complain about there after the novelty wears off. The subtle yet brilliant ending with the older couple and the husband that turns down his hearing aid as his wide babbles on, as his way of dealing with his life was probably missed by most viewers."

","Malaise, disappointment and dreams destroyed in 1950s suburban Connecticut. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates are together again for the first time since sharing a ride on the classic TITANIC. This time a tense tale of a young couple whose rosy and perfect relationship steadily deteriorates after a cancerous bitterness invades their new upper middle class home on the hill on Revolutionary Road. Frank(DiCaprio)and April(Winslet)always saw themselves as special. Everyone that knew them treated them special. Their high ideals start crumbling with jealousy, meaningless bickering and infidelity. Depression and lack of passion contribute to faded hopes and their abandoned young dreams. It seems that the only one that makes sense anymore is their friend and real estate lady's(Bates)son (Michael Shannon), and he is a certified mental patient. Not being able to find the love that once was pales to life-changing tragedy. Be aware of the possibility of a tear or two and the unraveling of your last nerve. This is not the happiest movie of the year."
"r0cko723","6","1","2","8 June 2009"," Good (but not original) premise devolves into melodrama
","I was with this one through a good third of the film or so -- maybe even half. I'm a sucker for existential stories -- you know, stories in which one or more characters take a time-out from the sequence of events that inform and rule our daily lives and stop to consider the end game. Mendes was gold with ""American Beauty."" Well, I think he went to the well a few too many times with ""Revolutionary Road."" Yeah, it's another road. ""Road to Perdition"" was a road, too. Having gone down the road to perdition, did I need to take a re-run with another unhappy story in another time and setting? Not sure. Maybe. I appreciate Sam's move to bring it home (or at least a little closer) to something the average suburbanite could relate to. But the themes in Revolutionary Road have already been run through the grinder, and much more eloquently and effectively, by a writer named John Cheever. Sure, he worked in a different medium -- fiction on the page vs. cellulose -- but he got it right on the suburban malaise meter. He could have a crazy man come to an Episcopal church to crucify a rebellious teenager for the sins of the father: namely, conformity to prepackaged standards and adherence to values that seem obviously pointless. But still, when I watched the last half hour of "" . . . Road,"" I just wasn't buying it. The flick asks us to buy into the proposition that everyone deep down knows the sick deal we've all been dealt and everyone is really, really torn up about it but almost everyone represses that understanding or whatever -- and that the unfortunate courageous few, very few, who take a look at the parameters of the human condition head-on are bound either to cower down and put on the plastic mask or are doomed to freak the heck out. Sorry, but that's ridiculous. You can take a trip to your local poor part of town (like where I've lived most of my life) and, if you have a few minutes to chat with the locals and don't get your asterisk kicked in the process, you'll find that our world is full of people who understand that the bill of goods we've been sold from day one is a piece of fecal matter. They don't go around freaking out. Newsflash -- existential despair isn't a novelty. Plenty of us have it. We don't go daydreaming about running off to Paris because of it."
"gradyharp","10","1","2","7 June 2009"," Formulas for Happiness and why they Crumble
","A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one. Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors. All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true. <br/><br/>Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future. Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group. From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage. The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble. <br/><br/>Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film. The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise. Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable. This is a sad story that has no redeeming end. Well worth the attention it has received. Grady Harp"

","I really admire Winslet and DiCaprio as actors. They're both fabulous in every their role and they had wonderful chemistry in Titanic (which my friend literally forced me to watch:-) They were great then and they are even greater now, but something's missing. I don't know what – storyline is good, Sam Mendes is great director (although I doubt he'll ever make better movie than American beauty), Kate and Leo were spectacular, but... I wasn't fully satisfied with the final result. I don't mind it's slow and I don't think it's boring like most of the people with negative reviews. Let me say that I've watched Taking Chance the same day (and this is the definition of slow paced movie and most people comment that it's boring because nothing happens from the beginning to the end), but this one grabbed my attention and my heart, although I can hardly (if ever) relate to it's subject. RR has a subject I can relate (although not from personal experience) but I didn't felt sucked in... Kate 10, Leo 10, Mendes 9, Revolutionary road 6,5"

Now I can never watch Titanic, unless my memory were to be erased. Movie disappointed me too, by the way. Revolutionary Road, that is, not Titanic, since that could never please me anyway.

Because the trivia of Revolutionary Road on this site contains spoilers about Titanic."
"yris2002","9","1","2","29 March 2009"," thoughtful, intense, lucid, superbly acted
","The movie is about conflicts inside marriage, about the illusions and disillusions marriage brings about, as often, in any time, but I think Revolutionary Road is much more deeper, as it penetrates into the conflicts inside human nature itself. April and Frank, after seven years of apparently happy shared life, have to come to terms not only with the real quality of their marriage, but with their personal and individual sense of frustration, being Frank a thirty-year old man, a husband and a father, who still hasn't found out what his real passion is and proves to be weak and immature, April having abandoned all her dreams to become an actress and feeling entrapped in her own perfect house. Thus becomes marriage a sort of comfortable, although painful, alibi, which allows both of them to find a reason for individual dissatisfaction outside themselves, shifting the real reasons from their inner self to some external circumstance in their life, in this case marriage lived as a burden. As a woman, I saw the whole story through April's eyes: her exterior coldness and self-control hide such terrifying anxiety and depression, overcoming her till the final choice of committing suicide. I think that her condition is still more difficult than Frank's, given her troubled and painful relation to maternity, a very delicate theme handled in the movie: when maternity is lived as a moral duty, as a solution to individual and marital conflicts, the woman is the one in the couple who suffers this condition more deeply than man, since she is torn by the love she ""must"" feel for the creatures she has born and the reluctance towards the condition of being a mother when she didn't feel like to, simply because not every woman is to be a mother. Wonderful acting is offered, I would say as usual, by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, capable of conveying true emotion, but also the whole cast deliver outstanding performances. Particularly striking is Michael Shannon playing Shep Campbell's role: he reminds me of a ""Shakesperean fool"", who, relying more or less uncounsciously on his mental disorder, conveys explicit but terrible explanation for Frank's and April's condition of weakness and hypocrisy, directly in front of them, a sort of inner voice of their conscience who dares say explicitly the sense of death stirring inside their family and their lives. I think the movie is absolutely worth seeing, because it gets to the real core of human nature, in a direct, intense, and extraordinarily lucid way: a movie that must make everyone think, since it confronts many questions concerning not only marriage but the complexity of human nature, with which every human being, now and then, consciously or uncounsciously, sooner or later, has to come to terms, and the result of this confrontation is, as often real life shows, not always soothing and positive."
"daugaard4-1","10","1","2","19 March 2009"," Wow...
","When I first heard of the film I was told to await one of the best female performances ever seen, so my expectations for Kate Winslet were, of course, enormous. But after the film had ended I was in awe, she out blew my expectations! and that is, for me, very very rare. What makes this film so fantastic is the details and the acting, which I have never seen so sincere in my life. Mendes must be given huge credit for letting the development of the characters happen in a continuous way, so that you never lose faith in your characters. His many descriptions of norms of society and the ways of implementing them in the movie are amazing as well. Truly one of the best directed films I've seen. The film represents themes seen in every day life and is timeless in its actuality. Anyone who has ever stopped to think about the life they are living and planning to live MUST see this film."

"Philby-3","8","1","2","24 February 2009"," Sad suburban tale
","The 1950s in America look in retrospect peaceful and prosperous years, despite the Cold War, but many citizens found the security and comfort of suburban living claustrophobic, especially those who had fought in the Second World War and embraced danger. Richard Yates captured these anxieties in his 1961 novel with his ""perfect couple"" Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet). Ironically it is April, once an aspiring actress, who wants a change from bringing up their two lovely children in their leafy suburb in Connecticut even though Frank is bored by his city job in machinery sales. She sells him her idea of working in Paris (""the one place overseas you said you really liked""). But it involves her working at the US embassy as a secretary (at fabulous money) while Frank has a sabbatical, supported by his wife. Frank's mates in the office don't think it's such a great idea and Frank starts to have doubts, as well as an affair with his secretary. Then April becomes pregnant again. <br/><br/>Without giving away the story, it can be said that things do not work out for our protagonists. Americans like happy endings but Richard Yates (and Sam Mendes) are not about to give them one. The period is beautifully invoked; I was reminded of Todd Haynes's tribute film ""Far from Heaven"" (2002) which refers to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk (""All that Heaven Allows""). The minor characters are also a delight, particularly Kathy Bates as the local real estate agent and Michael Shannon as her brain damaged but brutally frank son. But this is nevertheless a sad story. Being a child of those golden years of parents who didn't throw over the traces I don't remember much unhappiness, but I do remember that people who did not fit in rather stood out  respectability had a narrow range. <br/><br/>The following two decades saw a revolution in personal relationships and a reassessment of the role of women our society. It's hard to say if Yates and Mendes are blaming society for their character's ills or blaming the characters for passing up the opportunity for more freedom. Perhaps both factors are at work, but there's no doubt people became less timid in the next decade. We feel sorry for Frank and April but at the same time annoyed they do not break out. Revolution might well have been the better option."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","1","2","29 January 2009"," Powerful stuff.
","All right, let's get it out of the way. I counted about four Titanic references. How many did you count? The casting of Bates, Winslet, and DiCaprio, the steamer trip to France, making love in the vintage car, and the close-up of Leo's hands while drawing a diagram in front of Kate at the breakfast table. Despite the fine quality of this film, I could not help but notice these things, and I'm sure most other people will, too.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road is another attempt by director Sam Mendes to show a darker side of the typical suburban American marriage. Though this film won't quite garner the awards that American Beauty did, it is still a film of that same quality. The film deals with a young suburban couple during the 1950s who are coming to a crossroads in their lives. Frank works in the city doing an office job that is meaningless to him. While he's away each day, his wife April tends the house. It is a nice house for a young couple. They have two children who are often off screen and are treated more or less like additional furnishings of the home. Any depth of relationship between the Wheelers and their children is not explored in any way. Early in the film we see April participate in a community playhouse type of production that is universally panned by all that see it. This scene is there to show us how her dreams of becoming an actress are forgotten very early in her adulthood. One day April suggests to Frank that the two of them give up their stale suburban existence and move to Paris. She can do secretarial work while he figures out what he really wants to do with his life. Pretty much everyone they know pans the idea, thinking it foolish. But Frank and April at this point think the joke's on all of them. They are really serious about this Paris thing, and everyone who doubts their dream is simply lame and emotionally dead. Just before the move, two big developments send reality crashing down on Frank and April. Frank is offered a considerable promotion from work, and April learns she is pregnant. From here on, the whole facade of their marriage and even reality itself comes crashing down on them. One argument after another tears the two farther and farther apart. Until finally, tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>The film kind of took me by surprise. I, as a proud life-long bachelor expected to relish in their emotional pain an arguments. But as the film went on, and things got more bleak I found myself really feeling bad and caring for these two. I WANTED them to find an understanding and be happy. But once everything was out on the table, the two had clearly burned any bridges they could have used to come together once more. Kate is wonderful as always, and this was Leo's best work since that big film that made them famous. And Oscar nomination not withstanding, I felt the mentally challenged character was a little bit contrived. Sure, he's good in the role, but I just didn't buy the role itself. That it took a crazy man to be honest with the Wheelers... I just didn't buy that they'd even let him in their front door. Even as a favor to the real estate lady. There are affairs to be had by both Frank and April, but they are not the cause of strife. Just symptoms. I'm sure most couples of today would divorce for even 10% of the problems between these two people. Maybe their biggest mistake was ever thinking they were special in the first place. 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"Panterken","7","1","2","29 January 2009"," Uneven melodrama with terrific performances.
","Revolutionary Road features such astonishing acting that you almost forget to keep your critical eye focused on the film as a whole. I have to begrudgingly conclude that Mendes' work fails to break a whole lot of new ground. <br/><br/>The comparison with American Beauty isn't completely fair since there's a fifty year gap between both, that's especially important for the concept of ""the American dream"" and the role of women in society. April's ache stems partly from her obligation to be a housewife. ""The American dream"" in the 1950's seems to consist mainly of martini lunches, monkey suits and ""darling"" houses on wide avenues. In American Beauty, the same goes for Carolyn's version, but Lester considers juvenile values holy, the laws of rebellion, freedom, rock'n'roll and recreational drugs. <br/><br/>Both of Mendes' films are poignant but unquestionably Revolutionary Road isn't half as relevant as American Beauty. Mendes' work isn't diminishing in quality, but it is stagnating. RR definitely outranks the passable Road To Perdition but never outclasses American Beauty, except maybe for the astonishing confrontation where Di Caprio's freak out made my heart stop for about half a minute. I believe it's only fair to hold every new film up to the light of an artist's best work. He does seem very skilled at bringing out the very best out of his cast, Di Caprio, Shannon and foremost Winslet impress . Especially the scenes where she lashes out at Frank are great, those wide, ruthless eyes are really against her natural acting style of more warm, genial characters. <br/><br/>The scenes with John Givings were subtle (and welcome) comic relief from the constant tension between the couple, and his observations helped the audience understand the relationship better. The dialog did well in cutting to the chase without being too theatrical. David Harbour performed admirably but neither his side character nor any of the others worked for me. They're purposely over the top and clichéd, which worked much better in the black comedy of American Beauty then it does in this serious drama.<br/><br/>Another problem for me: the lack of ambiguity. I realize April has an unstable nature, but she is by no means bipolar. She was right in all arguments, though her obvious flaw is the cowardice of avoiding confrontation( which destroys a marriage in the long run). I suspect the film's intention was to spark dialog, as in: some agree with Frank, others with April. I did not feel it reached that goal at all. For a movie dealing with such a poignant moral problem, it should have been less black and white. The plot was by no means completely predictable, but I knew from the instant they talked about going to Paris that he would get an opportunity at work and that she would get pregnant. I wouldn't dare claim I guessed how the third act would play out, I'll be honest, that shocked me. <br/><br/>The characters were so unlikeable, it felt like watching a Neil LaBute movie sometimes. April had some admirable qualities but I only felt sorry for Frank and the other characters caught in suburban hell. Maybe they should have granted us one or two scenes in between the meeting of Frank and April and the play, scenes of a happy marriage. I desperately wanted to empathize with the characters but had a hard time doing so. Another problem with the story for me, was the expected heavy drama at the end. The movie would have done just fine without the tacked on ending, cutting right after the breakfast scene.<br/><br/>All things considered, Revolutionary Road means a step in the right direction for director Mendes, and a confirmation of his exceptional talent, but it's not the timeless classic American Beauty is and I hope the director can live up to his dwarfing theatrical debut someday."
"potterj","7","1","2","28 January 2009"," Watch Fellini Instead
","With a first rate cast, cinematographer, score composer and his own fine direction, Mendes' latest project is tantalizing because it does such a good job rendering the blind intensity that accompanies so many failed couples as they discover and try to grapple with their failure. However, the implicit explanation for the failure of this couple (and the corresponding kind of moral failure portrayed for each of the individual lives in this marriage) has no plausibility, and thus the film's accuracy in portraying the mutual misunderstanding and emotional confusion of Frank and April Wheeler as they face up to the realities of their lives is largely wasted. It is not that one cannot imagine people who, feeling trapped in comfortable but uninteresting lives, get desperate about their situation. While the self-congratulatory ring of artists depicting such bad lives (artists we know wouldn't be caught dead living like thisartists like Terry Zwigoff come to mind) is a bit much, it is the utter implausibility of *these* two people, neither of whom has more than a *vague desire to be special*, getting this histrionically desperate at the prospect of living a life no more special than that of anyone else that ground my suspension of disbelief into dust. April, the most desperate of the two, has made a run at acting early in their marriage and proved no good at it. But she still wants to believe there's something special over the rainbow, and so badly, we are supposed to believe, that she is willing to uproot her own life and those of her entire family to take her husband to Paris, where his own utterly vague, intermittent, and apparently alcohol-related desire to live in a 'way that seems to matter' can be tested at long last. Neither of them can articulate what it is they hope to gain or even *experience* if this longed-for world comes to pass. And in that respect, these are just like the vague dreams of a 12 year old. Whatever else, they are not the natural result of a deadening but comfortable life in late 1950s east coast suburbia for people who have a little more 'lift' in their boots than their fellow man and woman. I have not read the corresponding novel, and hope it doesn't try to make the case for this absurd proposition, but clearly Mendes is prepared not only to believe this kind of nonsense, but to make very expensive art promoting it. It's a nice Oscar vehicle for his wife, and there are some good scenes, particularly those with Kathy Bates and her electro-shocked son (who in this piece plays a cross between soothsayer and Greek chorus). For a far better movie that deals with the same subjects, try Fellini's ""Juliet of the Spirits"". I'm not sure Juliet is real, either, but in that movie you *believe* she is (and care what happens to her)."

","I read the novel by Richard Yates a little while ago, and I must say, Sam Mendes & Co., did an excellent job at paying an enormous tribute to this American masterpiece.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Yates would've been very proud, even if much of the emotional wallop written so profoundly in the book, wasn't completely translated onto film. The novel left me gutted, raw, totally blown away by its shocking intensity and excruciating truths. I felt almost the same way after watching this incredible film, however, the experience wasn't nearly as visceral for me. But then, books have a way of gripping our senses much more palpably than cinema at times.<br/><br/>This film was superbly acted. I cannot overstate this enough. However, the pace of the film left me feeling like I was reading ""cliff notes"" of the novel. Like we were given only a skeleton of Yates' fleshy, meaty, gut-wrenching tale of 1950's suburbia. <br/><br/>Kate and Leo are very much at the top of their game here. The fact that neither one of them got an Oscar nom for their respective roles in this heartrending film leaves me profoundly perplexed. They both acted their butts off! I am pleased that Michael Shannon got a nom for his amazing contribution, but the sheer audacious exclusion of a Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress nomination leaves me fuming. The Academy needs to seriously (and quickly) buy a vowel.<br/><br/>The novel stands the test of time. It is remarkable. A literary masterpiece in every single way. It's amazing how Mr. Yates' words continue to reverberate after all this time, and I'm certain he would have been very, very pleased with the powerful resonance of this film."
"kos-27","8","1","2","24 January 2009"," Mainstream cinema with a touch of existential agony
","It makes me sad when a movie had the potential to be outstanding but only turns out OK. I was looking forward to this movie because I loved the novel. It had everything: a good story (the most important element), a good director, talented actors. Yet still the result didn't reach the books complexity, intensity and subtlety. <br/><br/>Why is that? I think it's not enough just to take the written dialogs and put them 1:1 into the movie. The written material should have been better elaborated to visualize the depth of the agony. Too many times words were chosen instead of other visual means - or just silence. Sometimes less is more. If you compare it to The Hours (the middle story with Julianne Moore) you see how the characters are better expressed in a shorter time frame and in a more subtle way.  <br/><br/>I liked more the first part of the movie that nicely built up the tension and set the stage. The second part, the final exchange of blows reminded me more of a boxing match (with words and punches) than of a subtle existential denouement.   <br/><br/>The actors  were good, but not great. I liked Di Caprio's performance almost more than Winslet's, but neither of them could truly reveal the deepest secrets and fears of of Frank and April Wheeler. Sadly the result was too superficial, too conventional in its dramatic outline without any risk taken- almost too flawless.  <br/><br/>It should be seen as an elegant and fairly successful piece of mainstream cinema whose main credit is to to give viewers something to think about and as an impulse for the brilliant novel to be read again.<br/><br/>Not bad but not strong enough."

The Wheelers thought that they were special, somehow superior to the drones of classic suburban America that they began living among. Perhaps it was the realization that they were living such a dull, unimpressive life that made them feel superior, but in the opening stages of the film they slowly realize that they have stopped being outsiders and instead have become just another uninteresting couple in this uninteresting world. To open themselves back up to life and that superiority, April creates a dream fantasy to move to Paris and they both buy into it for as long as they can.<br/><br/>This dream of Paris, however, is just a band-aid for a wound that won't stop bleeding. For a little while they live on a high, basking in the glow that this fantasy has brought them. But soon they realize that they can never escape this disaster of an existence that they accidentally slipped into too long ago for them to even remember what made them so interesting in the first place. Their despondency with life quickly turns into aggressive hatred towards each other as they fall further and further apart in a series of brutal arguments that only get worse and worse. The tragedy of this film, and these characters, is that in the end they don't hate each other. Frank and April Wheeler love each other deeply, but that love is so strong that the only way to distract themselves from a life they never dreamed of living is to turn such a strong emotion into unimaginable hatred towards each other. They are in love and want to be happy together, but everything in their lives succeeds in driving them further and further apart into an ending that shook me to the core.<br/><br/>Of course, when it comes down to it, this tragic tale of suburban misery is an actor's showcase. And boy, what a showcase it is. I've seen a few people express hate for the film and it's performances because they feel that it was all too melodramatic and scenery chewing. But I personally think that's the genius behind these performances. Not because the actors are melodramatic, but because the characters themselves make their own arguments melodramatic and explosive just so that they can feel something. These people are craving for something that they can never have, a kind of life you would see in the movies. And if they can't have a happy life where they travel around Paris having fun, they can at least feel alive in the most tragic way possible by taking out their aggression on each other at every turn. All of the shouting and flailing of the arms, I think that was all in the realism of the characters and their need to shout louder and be more theatric than the other person. They used this explosiveness to establish dominance in the argument and relationship and in that respect, the performances were flawless.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me a few times this decade, but his performance in this picture makes his past work look like child's play. Hell, he makes the rest of the actors in this piece seem like amateurs. He steals every second of this film with an explosive, emotionally powerful performance that served to devastate, terrify and move me all at the same time. A brutal portrayal of an ultimately sympathetic and tragic character and without a doubt one of the best performances of the year. Even though DiCaprio completely steals the film, that's not to say that the rest of the performances are anything but sensational. Kate Winslet is the perfect match for his talent in the arguments of these characters and each of them provide their own level of internal fear and external explosiveness. Michael Shannon has been an actor who I've admired quite a bit over the past few years, stealing scenes in all of his films while he went unnoticed and underrated by the world at large. Needless to say, when I found out that he had a performance with Oscar buzz in a prestige picture like this (a performance that would eventually earn him an actual Oscar nomination), my expectations were pretty high off the bat. He took those expectations, ran with them, and then shattered anything I could have expected from him. His performance is absolutely frightening and I couldn't be more pleased that his talent is getting recognized all over the place, especially by the Academy themselves. His explosive argument with DiCaprio's character unsettled me in a way that few films ever have, and that was based entirely on the flawless performances from the two actors."

","This movie is incredible. It is much a cross between Labute's ""In the Company of Men"" and Mamet's ""Oleana"". If you are a fan of either of these movies you will likely love this movie. However, if, like most others, you haven't seen either of them then ask yourself if your idea of a good time is watching two intelligent people in a state of existential dread over the meaninglessness and routine nature of life rip either other apart verbally in the fashion of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe"". If not, avoid this film.<br/><br/>Like DiCaprio's early work with DeNiro in ""This Boy's Life"" this film is all about an intellectuals struggle to find his voice to carve out a life, to follow his dreams, or to give up and accept the forces that, Mendes' so vividly relates, tend to move us to obscurity and mediocrity. Namely waking up to a life in a job you hate, with 2.3 kids and living in suburbia filled with routine drudgery and your typical 50's June Cleaver types as neighbors. It is depressing. It is painful to watch. Yet it says so much about the daily grind that so many of us go through. We run the rat race, move up the ladder... but for what?? To one day find out that all our childhood dreams are only that... dreams that have faded away with the new day.<br/><br/>Without giving away details about this movie, let me just say it is like a couple on the brink of divorce going to see a world renown therapist. Once in the office, the man relates an intricate story to the therapist detailing all his wife's failings. The therapist nods and agrees and the man feels validated. Then the wife takes the floor detailing all the ways her husband has let her down. Again the therapist nods and agrees with all her points. At this the man jumps in and says... ""You said I was right... Now you are saying my wife is right. We can't both be right."" Again the therapist nods and agrees.<br/><br/>Similarly, this movie is all about the delicate nature of truth. Some of us devote our live's to it. Other's dummy ourselves down in order to live in peace with those close to us. We tell little white lies to protect those we love... but lies build and soon we are lying to ourselves and have lost our moral compass. Some of us are so devoted to our version of the truth that we seem crazy and are committed to a mental hospital... but truly there is a thin line between genius and insanity and this movie all takes place along that line."

"zetes","7","2","7","11 January 2009"," Well acted and made, but it's really just a turgid melodrama
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple. When they met, they were idealistic youths, but when they arrive in the suburbs, he working in sales and she a housewife, life seems dreary. The film offers no new insights on marriage or life. It is set in the 1950s, so you might think it's like, say, Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society. But, no, Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its '50s setting. I think it wants to be more universally about marriage. It's set in the '50s, I think, so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together. So, taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part. The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience. Or me, at least. The film isn't that bad in the end. The acting is quite good, especially from Kate Winslet. Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon, I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written, mostly concerning his character, who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person. The film is very gorgeous to look at, thanks to Roger Deakins, and I liked Thomas Newton's score (he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008)."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","1","3","1 September 2010"," So-so
","Like the book, the film starts off abruptly, and tosses us into the maelstrom of the Eisenhower era marriage of Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet), dilettantes without any chance to connect with nor care for these characters. Both end up having affairs, both dream stupidly of running away from adulthood to live in France, but Frank is a bit more grounded, and after he is offered a promotion, and she gets pregnant with a third child, they decide to stay put. He comes to realize that there is nothing special about him, save perhaps for some sales talent, but April- a failed actress- clings to the delusion that she is special, but she's a Joey. The only person with any insight into the couple (shallow and predictably Hollywood as it is) is John Givings (Michael Shannon), the nut job son of the real estate agent, Helen Givings (Kathy Bates), who sold the Wheelers their home. She, in turn, is a petty busybody with a long suffering husband. Howard (Richard Easton). The other major characters are Shep and Millie Campbell (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn), the Wheelers' neighbors, and the young co-worker (Zoe Kazan) Frank seduces. In the end, April suicides by giving herself an abortion, and Frank moves away. There are minor differences from the book, but the film ends with the same moment, Howard Givings turning down his hearing aid as his wife gossips on about the Wheelers and the new couple she sold their home to.<br/><br/>In fact, in both the novel and the film, the defining quality one sees is cowardice. Both of the Wheelers are cowards, in that neither seems to fully want to recognize that they are ordinary people, with ordinary lives and ordinary responsibilities, although it is April who is the biggest fool. Her only oppression comes not from the suburbs (oh, how bad it is to live in peace and security!) but from her own overweening sense of self-importance, even though she has never accomplished a thing of note. Her idiocy (and I'm not even counting her drinking, smoking, and extramarital sex while pregnant) even goes so far as to cajoling Frank, in soap operatic nonsensical fashion, into abandoning their lives for Paris by cooing that this will let him be a man; as if Hemingwayvianism is the only way a man can be a man: working at a job to support her and the kids is not enough proof, apparently.<br/><br/>Overall, Revolutionary Road, the film, is at about the same artistic level as its progenitor novel, with a few more pluses and minuses. That its flaws were not corrected falls on the shoulders of Mendes, who has a tendency to make didactic films that proffer vacuous platitudes, while its pluses seem to be immanent in the fact that a lost era's sensibilities and styles can be more easily and quickly conveyed via visual art rather than the written word. As an adaptation, the best way to have brought out the book's strengths would have been to eliminate all the clichéd melodramatic moments and focused, instead, on a single event in their shared lives, then explored the characters more deeply. That adaptations do not do this more often is puzzling, since, as an adaptation, there is that very license to adapt the damned thing! That means reducing flaws and maximizing good qualities. Instead, however, Mendes is content to let his characters, incapable of rational thoughts beyond clichés, prattle on and on and on. But, fear not: take a cue from Howard Givings and."

In the 1950's I was just a few years younger than this couple & also lived in a middle size city.<br/><br/>I cannot remember any persons in my age group back then acting like this couple did.

I remember that era as being a glorious time to live & raise a family..<br/><br/>Yes we smoked & drank a lot BUT not to the extent this couple did.<br/><br/>In the film Micheal Shannon plays a neighbours adult son, just released from a mental hospital. To me he was the sanest person in the cast,He just was ahead of his time speaking out on subjects.<br/><br/>The acting by Kate & Leo is good. They just were not a likable couple especially Kate Winslet's April. She was a selfish, controlling b****, What she does at conclusion, made me lose whatever remaining respect I may have had for. Leonardo Dicaprio's, Frank, also was not someone I would have wanted as a friend, I would even have trouble consoling him at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Now for what I did like in the film. they did recreate the period as far as settings, costumes etc. Aside from Micheal Shannon's performance, I must comment Zoe Kazan (Elia Kazan's granddaughter) he is the young secretary that Frank has an affair with.

","Revolutionary Road, is a drama centered around the lives of a young suburban couple, in the 1950s. Frank Wheeler and his wife April, have been living out the American dream, as proscribed by 1950s social expectations. Frank has a decent job as an executive, which has allowed him to comfortably support his wife and two children. <br/><br/>There's trouble in paradise though, when April urges Frank to quit his job, which he hates, and move the family to Paris. Once in Paris, April wants to work at a high-paying administrative job, for the Parisian government. She is willing to support the family herself, while Frank takes time off to 'find himself'. <br/><br/>Skeptical at first, Frank warms-up to April's plan. But after being offered a lucrative promotion at his company, Frank becomes conflicted about moving away to Paris. Meanwhile, April admits to Frank that she no longer loves him. All emotional hell breaks loose in their marriage, as Frank confesses to having a fling with his secretary. And April then has a brief tryst with her neighbor's spouse, in their car one evening. <br/><br/>Things are further complicated in Frank and April's relationship, when April becomes unexpectedly pregnant with their third child. Feeling stifled and trapped as Frank's wife, April doesn't want the baby. And she's willing to take desperate measures, to end her pregnancy. As their marriage completely unravels, Frank and April come to realize the terrible compromises that they've both made, in order to conform to the absurd expectations of American life in the 1950s.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both well-matched as the stars of this movie. Leo radiates a compelling charisma, as Frank Wheeler. Leo makes the viewer believe that Frank Wheeler should be destined for better things, than his mundane work-a-day life. Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, does manage to outdo Leo's performance. Kate emotes with a skilled precision, giving enough of herself in each scene to be believable, without going overboard.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of this film, turns-in decent performances. Especially Kathy Bates as the Wheeler's simpering neighbor, Helen Givings. And Michael Shannon gives a standout performance, as Helen's son John, who endured brutal, and unnecessary psychiatric 'treatments'.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road gives viewers a glimpse into the ridiculous, oppressive existence of '50s suburbanites, and the gruesome effects that it had on their lives. After watching this film, all I can say is how thankful I am for the 60s!"

"rjyelverton","5","1","3","4 February 2009"," An impeccably staged, detached tragedy
","Why do we not sympathize with the Wheelers? ""Revolutionary Road"" is a tragedy, but we find little sympathy for the Wheeler family who bring about their own dissolution. If you cannot connect with a tragic figure than you are merely a voyeur. For the audience, there's no catharsis and no tears. We are merely clinicians or scientists, observing. Cold and detached. If the Wheelers were placed in the same setting with the same stimuli, the results would be the same. What lesson do we learn from this film? The Wheelers should never have gotten married.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is with director Sam Mendes detached style. The lighting in his scenes is just so. The set dressing, make-up and costuming impeccable. He can put together a beautiful image with the best of them. (See the beautiful, but similarly detached ""Road to Perdition."") There are some nicely constructed moments in ""Road"" involving parades of faceless businessmen coming to and from work. At key moments, Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) nearly disappears into the cloud of drones or stands apart from them. Winslet and DiCaprio deliver intense performances that were undoubtedly taxing--there will be shouting--but we are always watching them from afar.<br/><br/>There is an invigorating moment, late in the film, when Mendes switches to a hand-held camera--almost always used to amp up/signal a rise in tension--and lets his film go a little. We are suddenly there with Frank and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) and the film jangles the nerves. Distractingly, the score for this so similar to the one created by Thomas Newman for Mendes' ""American Beauty"" that you might swear the two were one in the same. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a bit of a curiosity. An impeccably staged, detached tragedy.<br/><br/>(Michael Shannon is getting some awards season notice for his role as the film's Jester. He's good in this, but even better in this year's deep-fried, low budget drama ""Shotgun Tales."" He was also the best part of the adequate Oliver Stone film ""World Trade Center."")"

","Anyone who has ever been married knows exactly what this couple is going through. Some spouses won't actually vocalize their disagreements in the same way, but they'll feel it. The main characters are faced with a crisis when they realize that their lives haven't turned out the way they had hoped. They got married, had kids, and were forced to make sacrifices. The husband found a job that's unfulfilling. The wife had hopes for something better than suburbia. But, now they are both trapped because of their responsibilities.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The wife hatches a plan that will free her and her family from this trap. But, circumstances make their plans impossible to accomplish and their hope for a better life dissolves. While the husband is willing to deal with the changes, the wife is devastated and takes her own life.<br/><br/>This isn't the only marriage with problems. In fact, in their circle of friends, they stood out as an example of a great marriage. They were supposed to be the best. But the higher you are on the social ladder, the farther you fall.<br/><br/>The real message of the movie is that marriage is a trap. I didn't really understand this until one of the last scenes where we see the interaction between Kathy Bates and her husband. The only point of the scene seems to be that every marriage has problems. Every marriage is miserable. The higher you are and the greater your expectations of married life, the harder you will crash.<br/><br/>I don't agree with this message, but the movie was a good portrait of what every marriage is like. There are other answers to these problems besides moving to Paris."

"meeza","8","1","3","17 January 2009"," Mendes mending more marriage hearts but with a slick revolutionary style!
","Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film ""Revolutionary Road"". The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. ""Revolutionary Road"" should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is ""gibin"" us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with ""American Beauty"" and does an encore with it in ""Revolutionary Road""; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through ""Revolutionary Road"" it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say ""mental revolution"" it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through ""Revolutionary Road"". **** Good"

","Walking into the theater to see ""Revolutionary Road"" with some friends of mine, I expected nothing more but a remarkable performance by long lost co-stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. I was given much, much more than I paid for. Although the film adaptation doesn't hold a candle to Yates' actually story telling, Winslet's and DiCaprio's exceptional portrayal of Frank and April Wheeler really take you straight to 115 Revolutionary Road and give you a front row seat to possibly one of the greatest screen performances of 2009<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is that kind of movie that not only teaches us a truth we don't want to believe but shoves it in your face all at the same time. It's very unfortunate that the film couldn't live up to the novel it was based on, but it came very, very close. The script, flawed as it is does give its main characters a certain life to them that draws its audience in, but soon once an audience member accepts the invitation they don't want to stay because of what they see; the truth. Despite the very familiar premise of the story, ""Revolutionary Road"" does what most martial dramas aren't anymore; they make the audience leave the theater with a lesson learned. Mendes makes you really question the assumed sophisticated living of fifties suburban life.<br/><br/>Simply put, DiCaprio and Winslet carried this movie all on their own. This being the first movie they've worked on together since ""Titanic"", I came with high hopes but also some doubts. I felt that their performance in this movie wouldn't even come close to falcon punch of a performance in Titanic. I have no hesitation to say that their work in this film surpassed their performance in Titanic in all aspects. The chemistry they established in Titanic really was shown in this film. Even as their characters hated each other, you felt the heat of passion that radiated from their scene work. Also, I tip my hat to the surprising performance of Michael Shannon portraying the clinically disturbed ""John Givings"". He really did justice to the part he was given; I was utterly convinced by his performance. I think it's safe to say that the cast of this movie is what brought to the level it's on.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the whole family, but this a film that should be seen nonetheless. Don't go to this movie with fascination of a story in mind, come for a soon-to-be classic performance of two incredible artists."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","1","3","17 January 2009"," Brooding with intelligence and thoughtfulness
","Sam Mendes' fourth feature in ten years is a harsh and thoughtful look at Richard Yates classic-novel with the same name. It stars Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since 1997's Titanic, though anyone in hope of experiencing the epic love the two last performed on screen is in for a big lackluster, because this is a torn and frayed piece of love with tragic outcomes.<br/><br/>The directing of Mendes is likely 2008's best, he is with huge thought using his leading but also importantly supporting actors, to painfully reveal layers of emotions - and although there are few real close-ups, it gently but with firmness paces scenes that gives the audience time to linger and feel with them. The score of Thomas Newman is intense and goes deep into the soul of the characters, it tightens the screws of something that's already unbearable. Shot by master-cinematographer Roger Deakins the film glows in a palette of hard realism, but also the lyrical glare of the novel.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is truly turning into one of the finest in the acting elite, his incredible run of great performances the last few years is here again a proof of his maturing and fantastical acting-skills. Winslet has already anchored her Golden Globe, as she again showcases herself as one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Worth mentioning is also the terrific performances by the supporting cast; Kathy Bates (always great), and the neighbor-couple Milly and Shep (Kathryn Han and David Harbour) and off course Michael Shannon as John Givings, a retarded man who comes just in time to see behind the shades ""happiness"" in April and Frank Wheeler's ""special"" marriage.<br/><br/>REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is among 2008's best films and is a depressing look at life with a brooding reality that makes it a difficult and ponderous experience."

","Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio): ""You are an empty, empty, hollow shell of a woman. I mean, what the hell are you doing in my house if you hate me so much? Why the hell are you married to me? What the hell are you doing carrying my child? I mean, why didn't you just get rid of it when you had the chance? Because listen to me, listen to me, I got news for you - I wish to God that you had!"" <br/><br/>Nothing ""revolutionary"" about Revolutionary Road, a period piece about a '50's couple in decline after moving to the burbs. I can confirm the creatively deadening effect of moving from city to country, even at a time when the American Dream included lawns, garages, flower beds, and conventional neighbors. Director Sam Mendes gets it mostly right.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio's Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet's April Wheeler dream the dream and act on it in 1955, he with a business sales job and she staying home with the two kids. Her epiphany that they should move to Paris eventually persuades him they are living a ""hopeless"" and ""empty"" suburban idyll. All this is the usual slam of the vapid 50's, yet Mendes brings his especially trenchant appreciation of America to the screen as he did in American Beauty, only here it is more realistic and less romantic.<br/><br/>Mendes had the memorable red roses image in American beauty; he does it again with shots of Frank in his fedora going to work with all the other drones in fedoras. Mendes is helped by fine performances from his leads, whose universe has expanded considerably since they were on the deck of the Titanic.<br/><br/>Most of all is the poignancy of today's mortgage crisis, in which the seeds are sown through the discontent of a couple considering themselves not unlike the others but falling into the wishes that lead to frustration and loss. Such is the stuff of an unhappy movie about a happier time that I remember but young artists could never know."
"Monotreme02","9","1","3","11 January 2009"," A visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama
","If one thing can be said about Mendes, it's that his career has been very eclectic: although all three of his previous movies have depicted distinctly American themes, each was in an entirely different genre and setting. With Revolutionary Road, Mendes comes full circle with his first film, American Beauty, and explores similar themes but with far more subtlety. It is this subtlety that I felt was eventually the film's biggest flaw, but we'll get to that later. Let's start with what was good, in the film, and that gives us a lot of ground to cover. As with his previous films, the production value is truly second to none. With the costume and set design, Mendes has managed to flawlessly capture Eisenhower-era American suburbia of the 1950's down to every little detail of the period. And second-time-collaborator Roger Deakins provides a startling, subtle-but-beautiful visual look for the film, perfectly capturing both the period and the contrast between its diffused, sunlit posterior to the stormy, tremulous interior of the lives of the protagonists.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple but allows for the profound, in-depth exploration of themes. While Mendes' previous films have appeared broad, well-known ensemble casts, with this film he goes a little subtler, and aside from his two main players the cast are mostly unknowns. That said, he was blessed with his two leads, who are two of the best actors working today and also two of my favourites: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who worked together for the first time over 10 years ago on Titanic, have proved that they have grown up significantly since the cruise liner disaster movie. Their performances are simply riveting, and they truly bring the fairly simple story of the film to life. While DiCaprio, an actor who has really been rising recently in terms of the quality of his projects and the range of his acting, delivers a striking, dramatic, visceral performance; and yet, distinction can be made that, in my opinion, Winslet out-acts DiCaprio: I haven't read the original novel but from the movie I got the impression that it was more about her than about him. So with Winslet taking center stage, she really delivers on a tremendous level. She nails everything from body language to subtle character quirks to the large, bombastic, dramatic fight scenes, and delivers a performance so poignant and resonant that one can't help but admire her. The thing with Winslet is that she does this with pretty much every role, which is why she is such a good actress in my opinion.<br/><br/>So what's the movie really about? Well, I saw it as an examination, a breakdown of the American Dream. The classic meaning of that term is divided into three major categories: liberty, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness. The film seems to shoot this very mythological idea of the American Dream down, and depicts a situation in which one category comes in stead of the other: in order to be free, we must release ourselves from the obligations of financial success. In order to be rich and prosperous, we must give up our freedoms and liberties in life. And happiness? I felt that the film dealt most with happiness, as both freedom and prosperity seem to contain a little bit each of that third category, but in both cases true, complete happiness seems to be a compromise in both cases. What is the meaning of happiness? Shouldn't two beautiful children, a large, cozy home and financial security also ensure happiness? Or must me always seek more from life? Both characters in the film are adulterous, but they also both find out that infidelity is not an effective escape from their unhappiness. One gets the impression, that even if the characters would end up moving to Paris, they would be unhappy there as well, and what fuels their temporary happiness seems to be the fantasy of getting away, and not the actual act.<br/><br/>With Revolutionary Road, his fourth film, Sam Mendes has crafted yet another visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama; the performances by DiCaprio and Winslet are simply phenomenal, and while the plot seems simple, it contains complex characters and explores deep, rich themes. Here within lies Revolutionary Road's biggest flaw: Mendes has explored these themes of the meaning of the American Dream before, in his debut film and the utter masterpiece American Beauty, and I felt that the former film explored these themes and delivered that message far more effectively than this latest one. Where Revolutionary Road was restrained and subtle, American Beauty went all-out and held nothing back. And it is this very repetition that restricted this film to being good but not the masterpiece I was hoping it to be."

","This film will resonate on many different levels with everyone who sees it. And I hope those who see it, who maybe loathe their husbands , like Kate Winslett's character does, have the courage and strength to run away as fast as they can. Do not settle for 2 or 3 martinis every night, or a trip to the jewelry store for another piece of bling, or a trip to a psychiatrist for happy pills, or empty meaningless affairs. Hit the road and run run run far far away.<br/><br/>The scene that is in all the trailers for the film showing April (Kate Winslett) taking out the trash reminded me of a story a friend of mine told me. I once asked this friend why she left her marriage.<br/><br/>She said, ""one morning I woke up and took the trash can out to the street. I looked down the street at all the other trash cans and homes with well-manicured lawns and realized at that moment this was not the life I wanted."" She left her husband and their mid-western life behind and moved to Laguna Beach, California. She never looked back.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie had many Madame Bovary moments for me. The only difference is that April really loved Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) in the beginning. Another difference would be Emma Bovary's desire for a show house and show things to prove her worth in society. April does not seem to care about material things or the status quo, in fact she rebels against it.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates plays the real estate agent who sells the lovely home on Revolutionary Road to April and Frank. Her crazy son, with a PhD in mathematics, is the wisest man in the film. He sees right through the frustration in April's life.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directs this film. He also directed American Beauty. An excellent choice since both show nightmare suburban lives. Different decades, but nightmares all the same.<br/><br/>Adapted for the screen by Justin Haythe from the book by Richard Yates. Kate Winslett and Leonardo Di Caprio give award winning performances. Kathy Bates is great as the real estate agent. Her crazy son John (Michael Shannon) is only on the screen for a short time,, but an award winning appearance in my humble opinion. This is the first time Kate Winslett has worked with her husband, Sam Mendes.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I came very close to a life like April's while I was living in New Zealand. My ex-fiancé is a wealthy real estate developer who owns half of downtown Wellington. I am so glad I had the strength to board that plane that flew me far far away and on to new beginnings."

"Reel_starz","9","1","4","24 January 2009"," An emotional and dramatic insight into the 'American dream'
","When I read the book last summer, I was mesmerized by Richard Yate's unsentimental, realistic portrayal of suburban life in the 1950s. He presented a young couple whose dreams of happiness and excitement are grounded by reality and responsibility. What is so unique about this story is the fact that the feelings that the couple (Frank and April Wheeler) experience could apply to anyone, no matter where or when you live. Unlike many stories set during this time period, Revolutionary Road is still relevant today.<br/><br/>All this is perfectly captured in Sam Mendes' startling adaptation. Like in American Beauty, he does a magnificent job of bringing out the emotions of the characters and conveying the hopelessness of their situation. The characters are all flawed in various ways, but Mendes effectively turns these flawed people into three-dimensional, realistic humans that we ultimately come to care about - at least that's how I felt. We can identify with their hopes, fears and desires and we understand what feelings motivate them to take make sometimes drastic, even immature, choices. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the two leading characters, seem to effortlessly take on the mannerisms and personalities of their respective roles. Before the first ten minutes are over, we completely forget about their idealized romance in Titanic and they BECOME Frank and April Wheeler, a tragic couple torn apart by their clashing hopes and dreams and their inability to fully understand each other the way they had when they were younger and full of life and optimism. Both of them bring just the right intensity and emotion to their scenes, and we forgive them for their mistakes and flaws because they are quite simply human. Although the entire supporting cast is good, the main standout is Michael Shannon as John Givings, the son of a 'friend' of the Wheelers who is currently residing in a mental institute. He brings the perfect blend of brashness, confidence and magnetism to his character and it's satisfying to see that his work is being recognized. He manages to convince us, simultaneously, that he is as insane as they say yet, perhaps, that he is saner than any of the other characters. Providing the heavily dramatic and uber-serious movie with an occasional comedic moment, Shannon proves here that he has the acting chops to match the daunting, impressive presences and talents of DiCaprio and Winslet.<br/><br/>In addition to a top-notch cast, Revolutionary Road boasts a subtly beautiful score, dazzling cinematography and fine costumes that truly represent, not only the time period, but the entire tone and message of the movie. Also, while making a few detours, the script stays faithful to the novel it is based on and does an excellent job of translating the book's feel, even though much of the emotion and drama in the novel comes more from the narration, what the characters are NOT saying, as opposed to the dialogue itself.<br/><br/>All in all, while it might not be for those seeking an uplifting escape from reality, Revolutionary Road is a poignant, deeply thought-provoking look at life in the suburbs, a failing relationship and the complex labyrinth of the human mind."

","It has been a long time since a movie made me laugh and cry and sit on the edge of my seat all in 2 hours. I have never in my life gone online to comment on a movie and I made an account just to comment on Revolutionary Road. I have not read the book, so I cannot compare, but this movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster of behind the scenes suburbia. I couldn't believe how I got sucked in to the acting of this movie. I almost felt as if I was their and I was fighting for them (and with them). All actors did a phenomenal job and I would recommend that if you want to spend your money at the movie theater, which for how much it costs is such a risk of disappointment these days, this is the movie that you must go see."
"dennisjerry","Null","1","4","13 January 2009"," Preferred Little Children
","The anxiety and disappointment of fading dreams linger throughout Sam Mendes' suburban nightmare, Revolutionary Road. The fear of expiration dates on the Wheelers' dreams cast gloom on their lives, especially Kate Winslet's April. Sam Mendes has traveled down this road with his Oscar winning film, American Beauty. In some ways, one could argue that Revolutionary Road is a prequel to American Beauty. Sam Mendes covers similar themes in both films-- broken marriages, the suicidal blandness of the suburbs, lack of career fulfillment and the paralysis of conformity. Revolutionary Road wants desperately to feel like a great film, and at times it is very powerful, but by the end the audience is exhausted. The film is an unrelenting assault on the Fifties; one might think that Sam Mendes has declared war on the decade. He and the screenwriter, Justin Haythe, have done a pedestrian job of adapting Richard Yates' 1961 novel. The film joins a number of truly great films that have covered the bleak and dark world of suburbia such as Franks Perry's 1970 film, Diary Of A Mad Housewife, Alan Parker's 1982 film, Shoot The Moon, Ang Lee's 1997, The Ice Storm, and especially Todd Field's 2006 masterpiece, Little Children.<br/><br/>I would have given the best Actress Oscar to Kate Winslet for the Madame Bovary Book Club scene in Field's, Little Children. As Sarah Pierce, she was perfect and her character is so far gone and delusional that she thinks she is Madame Bovary. It is a commanding performance; perhaps, a lifetime milestone. Roles do not come along like that very often, but Winslet took it and created one of the most intense characters of the year. Any film which follows Little Children is going to suffer by comparison. April Wheeler is not that very different from Bovary or Sarah Pierce. They are all women who wanted more from life. Yet, this is not the only character that Kate Winslet has played this year that seems to be in a prison of her own making. Hanna Schmitz in The Reader is another character that is trapped by the choices she has made. To be very honest with you, I have very little empathy for either one regardless of the terrific performances by Kate Winslet. <br/><br/>What is very interesting about the analogy to Todd Field's, Little Children is that Todd Field had originally planned to follow up In The Bedroom with Revolutionary Road. Instead he chose to adapt Tom Perrotta's novel, Little Children. Both films and the novels they are based on compliment each other greatly. I can see what attracted Field the Revolutionary Road in the first place. Tom Perrotta addresses similar suburban unrest in Little Children. Tom Perrotta and Richard Yates explored the emotional turmoil and desperate yearnings for something more substantial in the lives of bored suburbanites. What makes Revolutionary Road so interesting is that Yates wrote his book in 1961 and it took place in the 1950's. Even at the dawn of suburbia, Yates was willing to take a stab at the emptiness of sprawl. I am grateful that Todd Field chose to adapt Little Children instead of Revolutionary Road. I like having Little Children as the meat between the two Sam Mendes films about suburbia. Todd Field's film impressed us as did American Beauty. Revolutionary Road comes with so much advance hype that it cannot possibly live up to its advanced publicity. I am beginning to think that Little Children, like There Will Be Blood, is one of the great American films of the decade. For me, Little Children haunts Revolutionary Road in the same way that Anatole Litvak's Night Of The Generals haunts Bryan Singer's Valkyrie and in the same way that Whit Stillman's Barcelona haunts Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Here is the thing-- Todd Field did it better with Little Children than Sam Mendes did it with American Beauty. Given what Todd Field was able to do with Tom Perrotta's novel, I can only imagine what he could have done with Richard Yates novel. It is not that I think Sam Mendes is a bad director. He hit gold with American Beauty. I think The Road To Perdition is better than people give it credit for. Jarhead read better as a memoir than as a film, but the film has several great performances. Going back to the suburbs should have been a triumph for Sam Mendes, especially since he is finally directing his wife. I still think Todd Field, David Gordon Green or Paul Thomas Anderson could have made a truly epic film of Yates's novel.<br/><br/>And as nice as it might be to see the Titanic lovers together again; I kept wondering how much better it would have been to see a young Tom Courtenay and a young Julie Christie playing Frank and April Wheeler. Or could you imagine Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor playing these roles. The insanity and intensity of the performances would have been overwhelming.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon steals Revolutionary Road from Winslet and DiCaprio. He sees through April and John immediately. At first he goes along with the couple's battle against suburbia's emptiness, but then he sees through their corrosive self-deception. John is no different from Jackie Earle Haley's Ronnie J. McGorvey in Little Children. It is always the outsider, the misfit, or the criminal that is the most sane and rational person in these films.<br/><br/>I am not sure how sympathetic one can be to the plight of the Wheelers I am all for following your bliss in this life, but something does not ring true in the film for the time it was made. The idea of escaping to Paris may feel dated by today's standards, but that is not the film's weakest flaw. Frank Wheeler has a successful job. And right now that is a luxury many Americans do not have."

Their boredom with mundane activities of married life and ""emptiness"" of daily life is well understood by John Givings (played by Michael Shannon). Michael Shannon did an extremely good job as a certified lunatic with a PhD in mathematic who is recently discharged from psychiatry unit. The interaction among three main characters in the movie is based on the concept of a thin line between sanity and insanity. Kate Winslet is extremely talented and lovable ( Titanic, Little children, even not so popular Holiday and this year Reader).

It's ironic how the two get together in this film to tear that image apart and portrait the reality about our every day commons lives, marriage and the conventionalities we evolve around. The problem with these couples is buying the marriage-deal with a mindset of both not having lived their lives fully just yet. The moral is educating young people to stop idealizing relationships and encourage them to develop restrain instead of getting entangled in situations where they must catch up with too many things all at once (their personal ambitions, their jobs, their kids, their marriage, their inner frictions ...).

"framedcomposition","9","1","4","4 January 2009"," A Road Ending In The Crash of The American Dream
","If there is one thing that Sam Mendes seems to put across in his movies is that the American Suburbs are the last place you want to be. In American Beauty he introduced us to cast of characters who were anything but upfront about themselves and their inner desires. In Revolutionary Road it's a no holds barred grudge match with Sam Mendes in one corner and the image of 1950's American lifestyle.<br/><br/>From the absolute beginning the movie doesn't wait to dive into the issues of marriage and discontent. The movie doesn't build like American Beauty but hovers around in the same tense area throughout the film. These people are unhappy and no one is sugar coating it.<br/><br/>I would have given the film ten stars but it felt a bit manipulative at times. Constantly we are given images of misery and elusion to deep depression being experienced by the neighbors. Also the dismal existence of the 9-5 commuters and company men lined up in their dreary cubicles. We also get a glimpse into the mind of the non-conformist 50's mental patient. A tool used to show how in that period in American History people were conformed or suffer dire consequences. The dialogue is poetic but a bit too introspective for a young couple who are non-English majors. At times it feels like a propaganda film against the suburbs that Sam Mendes seems to have a distaste for. In the film there is no middle ground. It becomes either salvation or imprisonment forever in the torture which is the middle class existence.<br/><br/>Sam is a master of his craft and this film shouldn't be looked over. Although by the end of the film you feel the director has struck a heavy tone; You rise or fall and hope to god that you don't fall."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","3 January 2009"," DiCaprio and Winslet at the top of their careers makes for a standout film
","It's amazing to see where Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have gone since ""Titanic"" and it should only be fitting that they reunite in a film the demonstrates the full extent of their talents. The wide range of emotion, the external and internal struggles--without them, this film would certainly flop into obscurity, even in the hands of the talented Sam Mendes (""American Beauty""). ""Revolutionary Road"" as a script doesn't carry enough strength. It's dialog-heavy and even melodramatic at times, even if much of that dialog is responsible for adding most of the film's depth. But DiCaprio and Winslet are so commanding and convincing that you're taken by their story and Mendes brings the best out of both of them.<br/><br/>The timeless duo play Frank and April Wheeler, two suburbanites in the 1950s who have bought into the American ideals of the era despite their every inclination not to. Frank works a job he can't stand, April wishes she could be an actress. The film is the typical suburban conundrum: a contemporary-minded couple desire to grab life by the horns in a time where responsibility, family, practicality and self-sacrifice are the highest of values. Frank and April each wrestle with this in their own ways and it results in a lot of highs and lows for their relationship in the film.<br/><br/>Winslet is amazing as usual. Her inner-monologue is about the strongest of any actress in Hollywood. How she can communicate personal conflict and emotion to the audience with her expressions is astounding and in a film where she plays a woman who feels one way but is pressured to behave another, she really gets to shine. She is beautiful, enticing and tragic at different points and then all at once.<br/><br/>DiCaprio achieves the same effect in his own unique way. He's always been able to portray a roller coaster of emotion and playing a man who is sensitive, a bit neurotic, but also quick to defend his manhood, he has to convincingly change his emotion. He succeeds and he has to, because Frank does this a lot. His most striking strength in this film is the sensitive side in the calms after he fights with April. It's chilling how real it feels from him.<br/><br/>But as talented as these actors are, the parts are highly demanding. They fight, a lot, and about the same stuff, over and over again. Toward the end, their fights elicit laughter from the audience because of how over-the-top the two are forced to react to each other's piercing insults as they fly off the handle. The film needed more external stimulus of conflict, not conflict stimulated mostly by characters' thoughts. There's only so many beautiful angles and close-ups of faces that Mendes can do with a camera to maintain interest. Perhaps the point is that the Wheeler's drive themselves insane due to the nothingness that surrounds them, but films need more than that to engage us sometimes. They rarely interact with their children in the film, which would seem imperative to understanding part of their sacrifice, for example, and it would give them so much more to actually do.<br/><br/>The film is quite tragic, but certainly relatable. Whether its fighting with a spouse or the feeling that you're going to let life slip away because you've chosen a certain lifestyle. There's plenty of time during the film for reflection as you evaluate the arguments and decisions and decide for yourself whether they are settling or need some change. <br/><br/>One standout character is a man recently let of of a mental institution that the Wheelers meet as a favor to a their realtor (Kathy Bates). It's the realtor's adult son, played by Michael Shannon, who provides the film's irony--he sees the Wheelers twice, affirming their choice to make a change at first and exposing their flaws the second, digging at the contradictory roots of the film's two-faced subject matter. Shannon steals his scenes with both self-deprecating humor and by delivering his poignant lines with great strength. Why is he noteworthy in a cast with such incredible talent? Because his scenes are so refreshing in a film that is so densely wrapped up in conversation with itself, that relies on riding the coat tails of the intense emotion depicted by its characters. ""Revolutionary Road"" is nothing short of thought-provoking, it just needs to more energy and a grander purpose and that's something two of today's best actors can't entirely remedy though boy do they come close."
"brennerdj","8","1","4","29 December 2008"," Seven and a Half Stars--Good Adaptation of a Great Novel
","A Reviewer from Los Angeles, CA Minor Spoilers Director Sam Mendes creates the right sensory environment to showcase the acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio by filming on location in NY/NJ/CT, featuring Thomas Newman's cascading score and background music from early 1950s jazz and vocal r&b. DiCaprio looks a little too boyish in the opening scenes, but settles nicely into his mature beyond his years character within the first 30 minutes. He overplays some of the big emotional moments, but mostly captures the emotional nuance of Frank Wheeler's despair. Winslet, with her bottle blond hair and overly precise American accent, at first looks and sounds all wrong for April Wheeler, a character similar to Mad Men's Betty Draper. Despite my reservations, her performance won me over with its emotional resonance from the mid-point of the movie onward. Many actors,including Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, Dylan Baker, Richard Easton, Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour, shine in smaller parts which provide some comic relief in this emotionally taxing drama."
"jboothmillard","6","1","5","6 January 2012"," Revolutionary Road
","From Golden Globe nominated director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead), the leading actress's then husband, it had been eleven years since the stars of Titanic had worked together, and this is an all together different mood of film. Basically Frank Wheeler (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) met April (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Kate Winslet) met each other at a party in the 1940s, and after he secures a sales career they get married, and 1955, they live in 115 Revolutionary Road, Connecticut, and have two children, son Michael (Ty Simpkins) and daughter Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins). To many people, including their friends, real estate business worker Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) and her husband Howard (Richard Easton), and neighbours Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) and her husband Shep (David Harbour), they seem like any regular happy couple with a good suburban family life. But Frank and April's relationship is troubled, as she has failed to achieve her dream to be an actress and is forced to be housewife, and he is working in a New York City office job he hates, it has become a repetitive lifestyle and the passion is fading. One day, thinking it will make things better for both of them, and possibly the whole family, April suggests they should move to Paris, France, a place that Frank once said he would love to live in since he enjoyed it so much, and at first this sounds a big decision to make. As part of the plan to move, it would mean April would be the one bringing in the money from working a high salary secretarial job for a major international organisation, leaving Frank free to decide about his options and what to do, and after initial concern he agrees it sounds like a great idea. They tell all that would need to know about their plan to move to Paris, and there are mixed opinions from those, such as their friends they have known for years, and especially from Frank's work colleagues. Circumstances change for him, and even though he has never liked the work he does, it has been considered most satisfactory, he is even being offered a promotion with higher salary, and with April pregnant again there are second thoughts from him. She is contemplating having an abortion because of the tension between them, and this angers Frank so much that he concludes moving to Paris is a decision and dream too big to make a reality, and he accepts the promotion at work. One night April has Shep coming onto her, but she denies his advances, and the next day Frank admits to (apparently) having an affair with his office assistant, hoping his wife will have some sort of reaction, but she responds by saying that it no longer matters as she does not love him any more. That night they have the Givings round for dinner, including their troubled son John (Oscar nominated Michael Shannon) joining him, and John really lets rip about his opinions about Frank apparently getting April pregnant on purpose, and the friends run out in the heat of the moment. Frank and April have another big argument as well, to the point when she runs away, and after trying to get her back going after her, he goes back feeling low. Next morning they seem surprisingly calm having breakfast together, their moods improved, but right after Frank has left the house she takes the horrific action to give herself an abortion to the baby that has developed after a few weeks, but this proves fatal for her. Frank is hysterical in grief because he knows she killed herself killing the unborn baby, but apparently he continued to work at the company with the upcoming computer technology, and devoted all his time to his children. Also starring Happiness's Dylan Baker as Jack Ordway. Both DiCaprio and Winslet are extraordinary being so realistic in the domestic environment, and they really emphasise that life cannot be perfect as they come to terms with the heartaches thrown at them, it works really well because you can relate to the hardships they face, and the dark hard hitting material such as unwanted pregnancy and abortion doesn't disappoint to grip you, it is most watchable period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","Revolutionary Road was another in the very crowded period ahead of the awards season, rolling into UK during a very busy January/February period for ""worthy"" films. Some of them were genuinely good and some of them were perhaps cosmetically worthy but weren't as good as they were been touted as. I caught this one of the awards bunch after Oscar and Bata were out of the way so I wasn't really concerned by these matters while watching it. Being set in a suburb of America in the 1950's, it is no surprise to anyone to learn that people are trapped and perhaps a little unhappy with their cosmetically ""perfect"" life Â– this is territory that has been covered before and covered well, to the point where it is hard to believe anyone in this setting/period was ever happy with their lot. Frank and April are a couple with young children, he is a salesman in a job he hates and she is a housewife. We are shown a little of their past and meeting but mostly we are put straight into the middle of a relationship that is being stifled and the two of them are short with one another at least. They plan a way out of the trap they feel stuck in but, while the details may not be obvious, you do sort of know the vague arch that the narrative is about to take.<br/><br/>In itself this is not a problem because the scenario being familiar doesn't mean that everything about the film will be as well. In the sweep it is important to note that the film does work as being a quite realistic and depressing vision of long-term relationships. As such it engaged me and I did really enjoy the film and it seemed to move very quickly. This is different from saying it is brilliant and perfect though, because it isn't. The narrative arch doesn't allow much empathy for the characters and this appears to bleed into the scripted creation of them because I never felt like I was allowed to be inside the marriage at any point and that I was always watching things from the side. This problem is minimised though because both of the lead performances are very strong when they are given the chance. DiCaprio and Winslet play very well off one another and their convincing relationship made a lot of things work.<br/><br/>It is almost a shame then that the narrative does tend to find bigger things for them to argue over other than minor comments or gestures, because in these moments the film and the actors are at their most convincing. When people feel trapped or want out of a relationship, not only do you have the big fights but you also have the pointless niggles and fights over nothing that are all fed by the bigger issue. The film did not create enough of these (the scenes after the play were the closest to this) and the bigger things do feel more melodramatic without these. It doesn't help that, to get the bigger thoughts of the characters across, the script uses Shannon's Givings to say things out loud. His performance is good but his character and his use within the film is weak and he never feels like a person so much as an easy device pulled in to help the writers.<br/><br/>Visually the film looks good, It doesn't quite have the feel of the period in the way that Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven did but it still works. Costumes and sets deserved credit while Mendes and Deakins work well with the camera without channelling Douglas Sirk. Indeed Mendes does direct well but he doesn't seem to have much love for his characters, letting them go at one another with bitterness without really seeking to understand or feel for them. Maybe I'm putting too much at his feet in this regard but I did get the impression of him sitting back rather than being involved.<br/><br/>Despite my problems with it, Revolutionary Road is still a good film, just not the brilliant one that much of the awards hype suggested. The ground has been covered before and there are problems with the approach and the script but it still engages and depresses as it should. DiCaprio and Winslet are both very good and, as a bitter cynic, I did enjoy seeing them acting out the logical progression of their ""love"" in Titanic. Not a perfect film by any means but a good solid entry in the suburban-misery genre (and it must soon qualify as a genre)."

Kate Winslet in this movie wanted her husband to pursue things he was passionate about, to see life to feel alive. As a women she did see herself and people around her going through these phases of repressing their talents to fit in and lead a normal life. When a women grows up, experiences around really affects the way she would think and feel about relationships and people, and to protect their vurnerablity they tend develop different thinking through their experiences. Which actually resulted her to have less concern towards fulfilling her Gender roles. Her love for her husband convinces him to take it up see it as a good for their marriage to keep it alive and to bring change for the better. As they challenge gender roles and take up a step ahead to go on with the plan to move to Paris. People around them starts to comment about their choice they made, but still their bonding is strong that they hold on to it. Since they challenged gender roles, to go Paris and Leo to experience to feel alive there, where Kate will be working. This is about switching the gender roles to overcome the stereotype and support each other. In this brave step their gender identity itself becomes their weak point stopping them to go Paris as Kate becomes pregnant and Leo's man ego stop him to quit his job completely. When kate actually realises this situation, it just made her feel all alone in this choice. Which just made her feel to think her pregnancy acted as a bar for them to go to Paris and she tries to abort herself. In the end can we say that to define a relationship or marriage is it just the way of limiting ourselves to fit in around people and societal expectations or trying to overcome the gender stereotype but supporting each other's dreams and desires remines to be answered yet."

","While watching this film I indeed got the feeling this is the female version of american beauty. Then the credits rolled in & the director is Sam Mendes...so that fell into place. 
From the theme through the cinematography & the script (when we were young we were full of hope...and laughed at everybody that was like we are now) this is a rehash of AB but still the director shines the light at a bit of different angles, showing different variations of the characters emotions. 
Kate Winslet gave a very good performance but in my opinion DiCaprio was terribly miscast. Or terribly directed. His manic-depression kind of role was awkward and over the top. Perhaps we're supposed to relate with April more than Frank but in AB Annette Bening was totally relateable even-tough having a smaller role.
Mendes really knows how to treat this subject and apparently likes it enough to do it over again (this coming from a man who's life is I guess not quite like his main characters...)
Last point I'd like to make is regarding the film name. Like AB it packs a lot of meaning & perhaps some anarchist pointers for the real people out there."
"lee_eisenberg","10","0","1","21 March 2017"," choose the right life
","Sam Mendes had previously focused on the falsity of the suburban lifestyle with his Oscar-winning directorial debut ""American Beauty"". He returned to the topic with ""Revolutionary Road"". Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play a 1950s couple who abandoned their dream jobs in favor of a suburban lifestyle. Neither the husband nor the wife feels fulfilled. When they consider a change of pace, it exposes not only the flaws in their lifestyle but also in their relationship. And I mean with dire consequences.<br/><br/>Suburban Gothic is a common theme in cinema. I have no doubt that what the movie depicts happened more often than we might think. Indeed, there are still instances of people giving up on their dreams to do what they think that society expects of them.<br/><br/>Both DiCaprio and Winslet put on fine performances, as I expected. Far removed from their ""Titanic"" roles, their characters start out close but feel more and more distant from each other as the movie progresses. To be certain, there are some unpleasant scenes in the movie (but they do add to the plot). Also appearing is Leo and Kate's ""Titanic"" co-star Kathy Bates as a hypocritical realtor. Like ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Save the Tiger"", the movie offers an acerbic look at the supposed idealism of the American dream. I recommend it, but remember that it's not an uplifting movie."

","Richard Yates' seminal novel Revolutionary Road, published in 1961 has become one of the quintessential books to understand the post-WWII America with all of its virtues (the promise of a better life, the notion of happiness being attainable by achieving economic abundance, the society and communities as emotional anchors), but also its flaws (the shallowness of a society more concerned about economical success, the fear to see beyond and look for a change, the lack of ambitions and dreams or how they get lost in the way in order to seek comfort.<br/><br/>Frank and April Wheeler have a life other people would die for: a beautiful house in the suburbs, two charming children and they're beloved by their neighbors. Together, they're gonna make a plan to escape from this suffocating and lifeless environment. This is how April finds the perfect solution: they'll sell the house and then move to Paris, where they can find their real purpose in life. Things, however, won't be so easy, as Frank starts to have second thoughts about this idea after he gets promoted at his job, and April is not willing to give up her dream, for it represents her salvation from misery.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes assumes the challenge to bring Yates' provocative prose to the big screen with a very faithful adaptation (penned by Justin Haythe), that remarkably recalls that feeling of ""Hopeless Emptiness"" described by Yates, which ends up devouring silently not only Frank and April's mettlesome minds, but also the ones from the people around them (even if they're not fully aware of it).<br/><br/>Thus Mendes develops a subtle, but emotionally powerful work, backed up by admirable production values, such as Roger Deakins' enticing cinematography, Thomas Newman's delicate music and Kristi Zea's eye-catching production design, that perfectly captures the 50's atmosphere without making it obvious nor redundant.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet find not only an excuse for a long-awaited reunion, but also a perfect vehicle to deliver vividly affecting performances as Frank and April Wheeler. Leaving behind the ghosts of Jack and Rose, they succeed by embodying the souls of two lost people trying to find out who they really are and how they drag each other into a spiral of regrets and frustration.<br/><br/>Along with them, there's a superb supporting casting, featuring Kathy Bates as Helen Givings, the real-state agent enthralled by the Wheelers' ""immaculate life"" and Michael Shannon (in an Oscar-nominated performance) as John (Helen's son), and emotionally disturbed man, who ironically is the only one able to see Frank and April's distress and will become the voice of truth when everything falls apart for them.<br/><br/>Just like Mendes' Oscar-winning debut American Beauty, this movie is a harsh and effective dissection of life in American suburbia, which by the way hasn't changed that much in over half a century."

Isn't it every well-known path a revolutionary road? I hope that I will not insult someone with this - the spirit of Europe loves expressionists and expressionism, while on the opposite pole there is spirituality which finds life there cheap figuratively and literally. From the one side you can hear laughter and from the other sad crying which is capable of being happy because of the unhappiness of the others. But which one where is it? This movie shows the moment of exhausting of a relationship and the different points of view capable of supporting it. To believe on someone else's promise or to believe on your own? And if to be grown up means to give yourself up... I will not make conclusions instead of you. And about this to be wondering to keep your unborn child or not, or for the abortion in general, about this I will never change my opinion.<br/><br/>The moments in the wood were showing the unmistakable calculations of the elementary mathematics of truth. In its hard for reading signs, the under-questionable or without-questionable everyday life stays behind. To stay in the moment of falling in love - to state your love again and again.

No, the entire movie has nothing funny about it, it is all a huge spiral down the drain. As sad and twisted as the film is, it is extremely well filmed. Mostly the final scene with Kate is a very moving and powerful scene if you have some knowledge of women history. You will know that back then there was no real contraception and that if you were pregnant and didn't want more children were considered horrible people. The final scene is the most touching to me. Otherwise, the entire movie has no real point aside perhaps showing the mentality of the 50's.

Yes, it was sad and tragic, but I don't know why I couldn't feel that magic that I felt watching Titanic. The fight scenes were intense and that were probably the parts that delivered the seriousness of the situation, but except for that it was a pretty weak story.

","More than ten years after TITANIC, Leonardo and Kate Winslet are together again and now everyone gets to see exactly what might have happened if the couple had survived the boat going down. Hahahaha!!! And while there is nothing romantic about their reunion, they are REVOLUTIONARY Road's one true revelation. Winslet is remarkable. She is subtly but always at odds with herself inside. She wants to love her life, her husband, and on some level, she does. But she is also yearning and desperate to feel alive. DiCaprio is a bit shaky but while April's hand is less than reassuring, Winslet's hand lifts him and elevates his performance to nearly the same level as hers. To watch the two of them go back and forth between being hopeful for their futures and dismally resigned to a lifetime of unhappiness is a ride well worth taking and one that will certainly leave you dizzy by the time it comes to its harrowing close.<br/><br/>The problem with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is that Mendes seems more concerned in presenting the Wheeler's as a symbol for the greater point instead of allowing them to just be the relatable characters that they are. Frank and April are special. When we begin to buy into the idea that we are just like everyone else is when we become just like everyone else. When a film tries to make a point instead of just allowing the point to make itself is when a film takes on an importance it did not earn to start.

If the structures are a little to tight, there are hardly ways out except for Paris and getting knocked up by a friend.

Frank and April are more perceptive and innovative than those around them, and they believed that they didn't have to live that life to be happy. They could move to Paris and do whatever they wanted.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road was not a straight road, and although it never really twisted or turned, it did curve.

The actors were at their best performance I have seen to them so far, and there were many great roles by Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio, you will agree. I like Leo, but I couldn't believe he is capable of such act. I am not familiar with other director's works, so I can't compare, but the entire piece feels very different from the load of of the Hollywood movies, despite being in the same format. Michael Shannon was brilliant - hell, there is no single mediocre performance in this move, despite there is of course some marginal roles.

The battle is held for the freedom of the soul; it is a rebellion against mediocrity and the greatest tragedy people face everyday. It is a movie that raises many questions regarding Life and what people do with it.<br/><br/>I believe that a movie like this can't do anything else, but leave a bitter taste in one's mouth because it depicts exactly what we don't want to face.

This movie captures the prison in which women may have found themselves being married and attempting to fulfill the stereotypes of what a woman was supposed to be in the 1950s. Kate Winslet captures the hell she is living, and allows the audience into her tormented world, even if only briefly. You feel for DiCaprio's character at times, but realize that both of them are victims of their era, not of each other.

This was the whole theme of the movie and I couldn't have asked for it to be better. Leonardo and Kate were acting gold and were completely believable together.

Winslett is fine as April but her character is very complex and almost too ambiguous to really understand. She speaks in a strange and restrained manner which withholds her from the action. That is not to say it is wrong, but rather it is unusual in movie terms.<br/><br/>In fact Winslett's April Wheeler is the crux of the story. It's hard to know whether their marriage is bad anyway, or if moving to Paris will solve anything. April Wheeler has creative instincts as shown early on by acting in a play, which are frustrated. Husband Frank Wheeler is like thousands of people who say they have a novel inside them but in fact they concede their vague and possibly vain ambitions by increments as they manage day to day life.<br/><br/>It is a shame that this story ends badly as if they, and no one, can ever win the battle to escape the 'burbs, the job, the predictable and inauthentic business life.<br/><br/>The device in this story of having a 'crazy person' tell the truth serves a plot purpose but is not very stylish in 1961, when the book was published..

Revolutionary Road is undeniably sad, but there's a complete lack of those ""tug-on-your-heartstrings"" moments. It's all brutal and true to life. That's what makes the movie so compelling. You can't watch it, without thinking about yourself."

","The movie is weak and the story seems flat and not revolutionary on screen. Just not involving any more. The ending is just ugly and seems uncalled for. You feel so little for the uninteresting characters that it is just leaves one totally unmoved at the end.<br/><br/>Casting is weak: Kate Winslet always comes across as slightly British. She looks too much in control to freak out. Leonardo doesn't come across as a man just an old looking boy and a rather puffy faced one at that. Sam Mendes might want to rethink casting his wife when she doesn't suit the role. <br/><br/>Mad Men is much better. Don't bother with this ugly and depressing movie."

","I read this novel in college. It was absolutely biting then and I have kept it with me for over 30 years. The movie is so painful to watch. I remember the fifties and their sterility and the roles people were expected to play. A few years had past since the end of the war and people were happy just to be bored. April (Kate Winslet) is ahead of her time. We know this because the talk she talks is stunning to the neighbors. He plans to embrace bohemianism make most around her think she is crazy. DeCaprio tries hard but thinks she is also nuts. There is so much angst in each scene. Some of the people who have found fault with this film are judging these people with criteria based on contemporary life. It was so much duller then and so were the people. They chose to be dull. This sets up a powder keg. The ""Wheelers,"" rolling forward, have the respect and admiration of all those around them. He is handsome; she is stunning. They have two beautiful kids. His job is tiresome, but he apparently makes a little money, enough so he wouldn't have to work for six months if they went to Paris. The best scenes are when the realtor who sold them the house on Revolutionary Road (certainly an ironic title because nothing revolutionary happens) brings her bipolar (perhaps) son to visit. He is the real spokesman for the movie. The crazy guy who really knows what is going on. Anyway, this film cuts to the heart, showing people who have failed to but heads with the realities of their time. The acting is quite good though it is really hard to like either of the characters much. Silence is another main character. It's like a grim reaper when it appears."

Things slowly get darker and more serious and leads to a disturbing ending.<br/><br/>This is NOT a feel-good film. It's dark and unpleasant but it is an incredible look at the dark side of the picture perfect American suburb of the 1950s. The cars, clothes, furnishings and music are right on target. The acting by the leads is incredible. DiCaprio explodes in his role. He's miserable and slowly gets angrier. He's downright terrifying! Winslet had the much more difficult role of his wife but she's brilliant. You see her crumbling inside and trying to hold herself together. Just incredible. Everybody is good but a little extra credit goes to Michael Shannon playing the dangerously crazy John. There is some humor though. I got a big kick out of one woman who smokes constantly in the movie even when she's pregnant!<br/><br/>There are a few missteps. This does have its slow parts and the kids the couple have seem to disappear completely for long periods of time.

Unfortunately, this is a story that is played out everyday by men and women who live together in reality. Frank has no idea what he has done to cause April to stop caring for him, after all, he really loves her, does his job as the supporting husband, and even tries his best to understand her. Yet, despite all he does for her, she is still unphased, and could care less about him. For Frank, April's resentment towards him is unbearable, because he does not know what he did wrong. Frank even blames himself for April's absurd behavior, but it is really April's self-loathing that is ruining their lives. The end pretty much sums it up for Men who want to stay in a relationship.

","Perhaps it was just me overlooking how trailers tend to inflate a movie to something bigger than what it really is, but I really did have hope for this movie. It seemed epic and heart-wrenching, like a classic that could make you cry every single time you watched it. Sadly, however, it did not impart an impact remotely as strong as I expected. Don't get me wrong, it had its high points. The storyline is sound. The acting, the emotion, absolutely riveting. My dissatisfaction only spawned from how short it seemed after it ended. Something was not right. I was so captivated with the trailer, it might as well have been a short film itself. But the movie...the transition, the build-up of conflict...it could have been better. The ending would have been the fantastic cherry on top, would have absolutely torn me apart had I just fallen a little deeper in love, become a little more entangled with the characters and their plight. If only they had been developed a little more. Additionally, I found the musical score to be severely bland.

She also brought nuanced acting to her performance, though her accent slipped occasionally. DiCaprio, on the other hand, in my opinion, over acted horridly, displaying anger, confusion, passion, all by shouting and glaring.<br/><br/>The pacing was tedious - too many lingering shots of people staring off into their souls; too many cars pulling into driveways. It felt as padded as a 1960s bra.<br/><br/>Zoe Kazan in a small role as DiCaprio's office fling was a pleasure, but there were too few of those.

","This is Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first reuniting for a film after ""Titanic"" and they both give a fine performances in ""Revolutionary Road."" The story tells the lives of a young couple living in suburban Connecticut who decide to risk everything to pursue their dreams. Frank Wheeler(Leonardo DiCaprio) is comfy with his lifestyle although he hates his job, April Wheeler(Kate Winslet) is the wife that wants to escape from Revolutionary Road and has fantasies of starting somewhere else, maybe Paris. So they want to break away from the ordinary-but can they do it without breaking apart? This film is a bit over dramatized and a bit over acted while showing the life of a family living in a suburban home in 1955. Some may not like the portrayal of the suburban life in this film, cause it makes it seem like suburban hell. And many people would rather live in a suburban area over ghettos, trailer parks or no home at all where some working class neighborhood where the cops make routine visits in order to quell common disruptions cause of the danger. And how some people would rather live in suburban areas not because of superficial things but because the neighborhood they are living in might be dangerous with gang members, drug addicts and other hopeless people. Which doesn't seem to be the case for the Wheeler family. But the film did do a good job of portraying suburban life as a false, materialistic, repetitive life. So it's forgivable in my opinion, the work to live and live to work life style that's become so normal in modern society. And did a great job portraying 2 lovers who are trying to break free while knowing they are not special in anyway. Now I sort of get why this film didn't do that great in the box office. People usually go to the movies in order leave reality for a few hrs, and the film does bring back a lot of the harshness of reality. No one in this movie is portrayed better than the other, Frank and April are equally selfish and is desperate to have a taste of the fantasy life but you can't help but feel sorry for them. It really did a great job portraying the downfall of a suburban family and it shows how it's a mistake to have kids because having kids ruin the chances for a couple to be happy, which I sort of agree with while others might be happy with having children, maybe. April Wheeler look at her third unborn child as a parasite, in fact she seems to dislike her children while trying to convince herself that she still loves them, maybe a part of her does. But she smokes while pregnant and even goes as far to give herself abortion with her own hands. It really showed the realities of human nature, like even if they smile at you and act all friendly they should not be trusted cause they will gossip when you have your back turned or dead. It even portrays the Wheeler's marriage ending up being nothing but lies and distrust, which applies to a lot of other marriages as well. So yes it is a realistic movie that shows the downfall of a family living in a suburban neighborhood in 1955, but it just wasn't that interesting and sort of dry, which might have been the point. The main highlight was John Givings(Michael Shannon) who has a illness, give or take. Which makes him speak his mind constantly while spouting just about anything that he feels to be true, and the outcome can be extremely rude, but satisfying to watch. Since it shatters Frank and April's fantasies and snaps them back to reality which they tried so hard to deny. Not that I have sympathy for people that have mental illnesses and commit crimes and get away with just a tap on the wrist or anything. But he was most definitely the highlight of this film. All in all, it was like watching a play, a depressing and yet pretty good play. I can't help but feel a bit of irony out of the ending to ""Revolutionary Road"" since in ""Titanic"" one of the two lovers die first. In this one the death roles seems to have been switched, even if this one is based on a novel. The theme of this film is ""Everyone wants out. Everyone wants in. Everyone﻿ wants to want...To want nothing is to have everything.""<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"pontifikator","9","0","1","5 October 2009"," Powerful and subtle
","This bleak, bleak film was hard for me to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely mesmerized me as Frank Wheeler, and the supporting cast was phenomenal. Kathy Bates and Kathryn Hahn were heartbreaking; Michael Shannon was alternately dead and manic as the certified insane version of Frank and April Wheeler (April was played by Kate Winslet). But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Frank meets April and they get married. April has dreams of becoming an actress, but she's lousy. Leonardo DiCaprio's attempt to soothe April while blowing off her ambitions was utterly believable. DiCaprio's Frank is a shallow jerk with no soul and no ambition. I didn't know DiCaprio was this good. ""Revolutionary Road"" shows their lives together in the Fifties, as they end up in the march of grey flannel suits in grey, sterile lives. Shannon's character, John Givings, gives voice to their hopeless emptiness. Frank and April make a big decision to blow it all off, move to Paris, and live a happy, fulfilling life. April actually has a plan, and it looks like she can pull it off. Her dream of being an actress may have foundered, but getting out of the rut of suburban Connecticut, office life in Manhattan, and forced parties and entertainment definitely looks doable. <br/><br/>The characters in this movie are relentlessly human. From the beginning, Frank has no real appreciation for April's dreams, but he eventually realizes she's a human being with some feelings. They have two kids, and Frank wants to be a good father to them, and succeeds for the most part. He's not perfect; neither is April; but who is? As the years pass, Frank seems to be more aware of April's needs, less inclined to dismiss her. I watched their ups and downs, but there was a serious note throughout that kept me edgy, upset. Thomas Newmans' music echoed the tension without being tense; his theme was brilliant, spare.<br/><br/>The picture of life in the Fifties shown in this film is stultifying, claustrophobic, suppressive. One had to give parties, one had to dress correctly, one had to say the right things (""Oh! You shouldn't have! This is _too_ good!"") - one had to conform. Frank had the peer pressure of conforming at the office, and April had the wifely peers pressuring her at the home. This kind of pressure makes diamonds. Or it crushes souls. It was a pressure that welded Frank and April into one crushed soul.<br/><br/>April doesn't seem to realize consciously her need to get out of the Fifties; Frank doesn't have that need at all, but he goes along because he intuits that it's a requirement. April has their tickets, their passports, and their dreams all in her hand, ready to go. She even has her job lined up. She'll support them while Frank looks after the kids and looks for work. I watched April's happiness with dread. It's the Fifties. Wives didn't work. Wives didn't support the family. Winslet's April has the brains and the ambition, the soul, that Frank lacks. But it's the Fifties. There's nowhere for her to go with it. There's nowhere for a woman's dreams.<br/><br/>""Revolultionary Road"" is powerfully subtle. And the end I was left drained. Empty. There's no Hollywood ending here. I kept thinking of Rick telling Ilsa, ""We'll always have Paris."" In ""Revolutionary Road,"" I knew they'd never have Paris."

It didn't seem like they really knew how to end the movie properly; overall it was a well acted flick.

"michelasp","9","0","1","6 August 2009"," A movie that touches the soul
","I recently watched the movie The Revolutionary Road, a drama about an unhappy married couple living in the 50s. Sam Mendes paints a picture of American suburbia, reminiscent of a world well into the industrial revolution when people felt the benefits of a booming economy. Indeed in the 1950s the American economy was the strongest in the world. Keeping up with the Jones' was a part of life, as was hypocrisy, intolerance and the dried-up imagination which often went hand in hand with the consumerist, work-driven lifestyle, where the women were pushed aside to make way for the bread-winning man. The latter theme is excellently portrayed in scenes such as the rush hour at the train station where men bustle through as if taking over the city, and at Frank's office which is completely male dominated apart from a handful of female secretaries. The reaction of their conventional friends when April (Kate Winslet) and her husband Frank (Leonardo Di Caprio) announce that Kate will be supporting the family in Paris speaks volumes of the place of women at the time. The dried-up imagination is lucid when the friend exclaims ""what for?"" when told they will be emigrating to Paris. <br/><br/>I love a film that does not need only words to convey its message, and this movie is one of them. April's strained body language when her dreams of moving to Paris are shattered, the shots of the lifeless empty rooms with dull furniture and the brown and gray suits of Frank and his wearisome colleagues depict a pervasive ""hopeless emptiness"". The whole scenario spells insipid, and when Kate and Frank excitedly discuss the possibility of leaving this depressing existence behind for a new and interesting life in exotic Paris, we as viewers are intrigued. We want them to pack up and go and we look down on the conventional couple that will be left behind to rot in their unsavory, bigoted existence. Ironically it is the mentally unstable John Givings who seems to see through everyone's facade, and pushes them all to face their truth. ""Hopeless emptiness. Now you've said it. Plenty of people are onto the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Despite the dramatic turns in the plot, it is the simple images like this that stick – Frank dressed in his suit standing next to his car and waving to his wife perhaps thinking that if he acts like everything is alright and normal, it will be. There is a clash between the adventurous and bohemian and the practical and rational approach to life, whereby you do as is expected of you, and life is defined by your success and place in society. It is a movie that hits home because of what it encourages us to ask ourselves, a rhetorical and age-old question that influences the course of all our lives and is easily a fodder for debate: what is our meaning in life?<br/><br/>The title is an irony that you may find follows you throughout the film. 'Revolutionary' conjures images of the young and fitful - restless souls that seek to change the world. Yet Kate's dreams are stifled by the 'oh come on, stop it' attitude and her tragic end dashes our own hopes for their new found purpose in life. Most of us will be left disappointed after already having decided that Anne's words and a prevalent message of the movie meshes with our own belief: ""It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank."""
"webmaster-3017","8","0","1","20 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Revolutionary Road
","Tagline: A bravo effort that keep us dreaming <br/><br/>Review by Neo: It's been too long since the pairing of one of cinema's most successful pairing ever in the film, Titanic. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have aged considerably since their last outing, but there are no doubts that both have learned and matured in their respective craft of acting. Not to mention, watching the two acts together, seems more like seeing a family in the neighbourhood arguing against each other, than actual acting. It is this dramatic pairing that made the film works and combining this with Academy Award winning director of American Beauty (Sam Mendes), and the illuminating script based on a book by Richard Yates which all contributed to the success of this film. True, that despite Winslet being the younger of the two, looks much older than the baby faced DiCaprio, but both puts in an incredible display of domestic, yet flawed characters, who are struggling to find their inner soul and ultimately their purpose of life. Living in the conservative age of 1950s, in an era of McCarthy's witch hunts and an age where people seems to live within the boundaries of their comfort zone, Revolutionary Road, portrays difficult and relevant yet ageless ideas through the eyes of two characters, Frank and April Wheeler.<br/><br/>What made this movie so relevant, despite the fact that it is concerned with the conservatism of the 1950s, is that history repeats itself, whether you like it or not. Not unlike myself, sitting in an office, working on things that I do not have a fascination in, is hardly inspiring or noteworthy. It is true though that in today's society, people need money to survive and out of the millions of people, not everyone can earn a living and do what they like and enjoy. Living a dream is possible, but it isn't easy. That's not to say that working in things you do not enjoy doing is easy, as it is not, but as the saying rings so true – to pursue a dream is difficult, but letting go is harder. Revolutionary Road works because, it relates to reality, it questions the status quo, it defies the convention and empathises on just how difficult it is just to live and survive.<br/><br/>In what I would say as a more Oscar worthy performance than her display in The Reader; Kate Winslet steals the show in an illuminating display of a conflicted character that is torn between her role as a traditional mother and her lifelong dream of something better, something more interesting and something closer to her dream. Winslet is a dreamer, who longs to be romantic, but when her relationship with Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) becomes more and more distant, there is a certain uncertainty and sadness within her eyes that made her character different and ultimately allows the audience to take her side, even if she alludes to the stage of cheating. There is no doubt that Winslet and DiCaprio both hits off each other in an impeccable manner and their timing, chemistry, eyes, contact are just seamlessly natural to endure.<br/><br/>Likewise, DiCaprio does not put a foot wrong and it's been a while where it is so difficult to find any fault in one's acting. Not unlike Winslet, Leo is a tormented soul, but rather than like Winslet, he is more willing to except his surrounding and the responsibility of taking care of his family as the head of household. Leo has come a long way since Titanic and there is no question that he has gone one better in each film and every year thereafter. He was catchy and standout in Catch Me If You Can, defiance in Aviator, conflicted and smart in The Departed, it is pretty certain by now, that DiCaprio will be able to play any role thrown or given to him. He is the kind of actor that creates a sense where he is impossible to dislike, and certainly in the scene where he explodes at his wife at home. The scene in the forest could easily have been hampered by overacting if played by a lesser light. This is a competent display of acting and I am somewhat disappointed that DiCaprio is not recognised with a nomination for this fine display. <br/><br/>Although it is not always true, but director Sam Mendes manages to counteract the ideal of an American Dream. It is rather ironic that we have to work hard in our lives, most likely in jobs that you would never have dream of becoming in order to reaps the rewards in the future of going on a holiday, relaxing on the horizon, showering yourselves with gifts or wants. At the same time, Mendes is a realist or perhaps writer Richard Yates is, as after all, we all need to eat, survive, before we can truly enjoy ourselves.<br/><br/>All in all, the Revolutionary Road is not a movie that will leave you satisfied and content about the where we are in our lives, but rather allow the audience to dream a little, live a little and feel a little. Life isn't all about work and therefore it is important for everyone to be able to find a balance, between the need to survive and also the wants that provides us with hope, an aim and perhaps a purpose to live on. Before we all become, corporate robots, working mechanically on a routine task on a day to day basis, take a moment to remember what you used to dream about, what you used to want and at its very core, what do you want in your life. Personally, I know what I want, and despite being struck at this corporate desk in breezy afternoon, I haven't stopped dreaming and nor should you either  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","I personally found it a bit unfortunate that the movie is titled ""Revolutionary Road"" because that gave me some unfounded thoughts about its content. In fact it is the name of the street where they buy their first home in Connecticut in the 1950s, as did many New York city office workers who commuted by train.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Frank Wheeler in an office job that clearly doesn't offer him any challenge. He undoubtedly works there because his father before him worked for the company, in sales. But it is a job and it allows him to pay the bills. Probably common among this type of worker.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is his wife April Wheeler who has aspired to be an actress but instead has settled into being a suburban housewife with a son and a daughter.<br/><br/>But the movie actually starts 7 or 8 years earlier when they catch each other's eye at a social mixer, and each immediately finds the other fascinating. The thrust of the story is built on this, often young people get married for a type of fascination that soon fades away and which must be replaced by a totally different set of circumstances that link them and allow them to remain a happy couple.<br/><br/>The couple, now in their 30s, remain seemingly happy but each has a type of wunderlust that distracts them at times. For Frank it may be the cute young secretaries in the office pool. For April it may be the thought of getting out of Connecticut and into something more appealing.<br/><br/>A change of direction comes when April is looking at old photos of her husband, in Paris during the war, and reminds him that he had said Paris is the place he would really rather be. She has this idea, if they sell their home and use their savings they can move to Paris, she can get a job as a well-paid secretary working for a US Embassy and he can leisurely figure out what he really wants to do with his life. But is she really doing this for her husband, or is it more for herself?<br/><br/>This is a good family drama, set in the 1950s but could have been set in more modern times. Virtually every married couple goes through at least some of these things on the road to a long-term relationship. It was fun seeing Leo and Kate together again, 12 years after ""Titanic.""<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Even though Frank and April had not been 'close' in some time one evening they have passionate sex in the kitchen, during the time they were planning the sale of their home and their move to Paris. Ten weeks later April tells Frank that she is pregnant, but she thinks she can safely have a self-abortion. Frank is mortified, that she would think of killing their unborn child, and even wonders if she even wanted the two children they already have. Meanwhile on a lark Frank does something flippant at work which turns into a great idea, and is offered a big promotion and raise to join a group in the very new field of computer sales. All this gets them to re-think their plan to move to Paris, plus when Frank confesses he had a brief affair with a secretary April tells him she doesn't care, she doesn't love him anyway. They have a big fight, April seems to get over it the next day, feeds Frank before he goes to work, she performs the self-abortion at 12 weeks with tubes and a suction bulb, she bleeds, and even taken to the hospital she does not survive. Frank is never the same, he resigns to working and taking care of the kids."

","Director Sam Mendes best known for his work behind the camera in American Beauty (2000) delivers a powerful and poignant film. The story revolves around a young married couple Frank and April Wheeler played to perfection by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet (she won the Oscar) who are desperately trying to break the conformity of 1950's living. Technically this film is astounding the shots are done beautifully the lighting creates all of the right moods and the score is just haunting. Also the emotion of the script is felt by the way that Leo and Kate play off of each other, I think that Leo has been coming into his own over the past few years with films like Blood Diamond and The Departed but for me this was definitely the best performance of his career. Kate did an outstanding job and like I stated before won the Oscar for last year, anyway see this film you might not enjoy it but you will definitely remember the journey down Revolutionary Road."

With the consciousness of getting far away from the initial goal of life, they feel desperate and decide to leave, start over at where their dreams begin. However, it was once again being proved, reality comes bigger than everything.

","It takes a while for a director to make a really good film. By this I mean a film that not only contains visual beauty or technical mastery. These where things that reigned all over ""American Beauty"", ""Road to perdition"" and ""Jarhead"": but the first one was too wise about its limits, it believed it was better than it really was; the second one was too cold, too exquisite and the third one failed to grab the viewer completely (even when Jake Gyllenhal did his best efforts). With ""Revolutionary Road"", Sam Mendes enters a whole new world; the world of a film that arouses feelings on the viewer: the world of a really good film.<br/><br/>This new world is in a way also a world he knows. The film is set in the suburbs, where the Wheelers, Frank and April (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) make a living. Also in a way, the context is different than the one Mendes worked with in ""American Beauty""; it's the 1950's and things were decidedly different, but the core is the same: a hell that's waiting to make an appearance in a pleasantness that doesn't seem right. The scene before the title appears could very well be ""the first day of this couple's life"", but the language in Justin Haythe's script (adapting Richard Yates' novel) lacks Alan Ball's philosophical and sometimes pretentious search of meaning.<br/><br/>However, even when I want to, it's not fair to say ""Revolutionary Road"" is the better version of ""American Beauty"". This film has something the other one didn't care much about, and that's how we see ourselves in someone else's eyes; or even better, why do we have to see ourselves in someone else's eyes. The Wheelers are a couple without convictions. They do what they do in life because it was the best they could get and they chose not wanting more. A nice, well paid job for Frank, two lovely kids, the role of a kind housewife in the hands of April This is what the neighborhood knows about the Wheelers: Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) thinks they are adorable, so does their friend/neigh bout Chep (David Harbour). Yes, it's all true, but the viewer is allowed to experience a little more.<br/><br/>The tension is developed inside a big house that Roger Deakin's cinematography captures as an unbearable scenario. Mendes works this from every angle possible: outside the house the tension can be sensed, but never comes to life. Without mattering who they are sharing company with, after a first fascinating discussion in the middle of the highway, every argument occurs indoors. There's one scene in which Frank chases April through the woods, shouting mildly, but it doesn't become more than that. In the house, however, passion flies through the walls; among the couple, with the children nearby and with two particular visits of a peculiar human being called John (a very good Michael Shannon).<br/><br/>So? Which one is it? Do we have to care about what the people around us think? Are we making our own living or are we just satisfying someone else's wishes? And whose wishes are those? As I said, this last film by Mendes makes room for emotions. Much has been said about Winslet and DiCaprio's reunion after the success of ""Titanic"", and the fact is that their work here is brilliant for the opposite reasons that made their chemistry possible in James Cameron's film. There, they couldn't be together, and the passion and the relationship was almost platonic; their encounters lasted nothing. Here, they are already together, and the relationship has lost, with the years, a passion that's still passion. But it doesn't want to bring them together; it's a passion that's tired of trying to keep alive something that's dying. Thank God that DiCaprio one day decided to make only good movies, because when he wins in intensity there's no one who can beat him.<br/><br/>With these two fantastic main actors, technical mastery, beautiful (almost excessively correct) visuals, intriguing score (yes, Thomas Newman) and the mentioned intensity, Mendes may not even know why he's done his best movie. It's not in the screaming, the crying and the suffering of two people that's explicated to the bone. The true greatness lies -and I think the director wanted people to think this of all his movies but never achieved it- in everything else: in the silence, the looks of everyone involved in the tale, the decisions the characters take and we work so hard to figure out why. That's what strikes us deeply: the rest only increases the hit."

Maybe instead of moving to France, leaving all their friends and family behind, they could have stayed and affected their friends and family (society). Don't throw up the WhiteFlag just yet-kind of styles. Great film to bring up a major topic like Humane Social standards. BTW, Michael Shannon's performance as John Givings, as the French say: 'Tour De Force!' I want to see Part II called 'The Crazy Guy from Revolutionary Road'. Maybe get Kal Penn & John Cho to Direct.

","Sam Mendes make an adaptation on Richard Yates novel into a movie, and pairs the couple who melted the hearts of millions with the 1997 blockbuster, Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet had a reunion in Revolutionary Road, which finally, Jack and Rose has become husband and wife, under the name of Frank and April Wheeler.<br/><br/>Set in the suburban of Connecticut during the 1950's, Revolutionary Road is an exploration on a couple seeking a better life, which is to fulfill their dreams by migrating to Paris. One can easily compared Revolutionary Road with Mendes first big screen work, American Beauty (1999.) Frank and April settles in Connecticut, with a big house, 2 lovely kids, a job that has no problem putting bread on the table. However, Frank do not like his job, while April is drowning herself in sadness when she is unsuccessful in becoming an actress. Things take a drastic change when both decided to migrate to Paris, with 2 issues hindering their plans: Frank getting a promotion and April getting pregnant. What falls ahead of them are countless challenges on their relationship of an unhappy matrimony.<br/><br/>One will never be disappointed with any movies from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, since both has never delivered disappointing performances. With their outstanding performance in Titanic, Revolutionary Road will never disappoint anyone who is expecting more from the couple.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes discussed the issue of an American dream turned sour in American Beauty, where he introduces a failed husband seeking a breakthrough for himself, a wife who wants to break free from a loveless marriage, a daughter with growing up issues, infidelity, erotic dreams and drugs. Things take a turn in Revolutionary Road, where similar issues were discussed.<br/><br/>Together with the scores composed by Thomas Newman, one could see the shadow of American Beauty in Revolutionary Road. The husband having a quarrel on the dinner table, the wife who wants to fulfill her dreams at the expense of her husband to a neighbor who is a former mental hospital patient, we could easily see the linkage between American Beauty and Revoultionary Road.<br/><br/>While American Beauty begins with an brief introduction of The Burnham's family and their neighborhood, Revolutionary Road begins with how Frank and April knowing each other in a party. The next scene begins with Frank and April, now a married couple, facing the problems they had in their marriage. Mendes is taking a twist in terms of presentation for both movies discussing similar issues.<br/><br/>Just like the environment in Revolutionary Road, it was peaceful and calm, where one would slow down their paces and enjoying what is around them. Mendes handles the nature of the story and present it in a way where one will not feel much harsh elements in Revolutionary Road, compared to the straight-to-your-face reality featured in American Beauty. This can be told by the unexpected ending for the movie.<br/><br/>Sailing down to Revolutionary Road is not as disastrous compared to taking the maiden voyage in Titanic. While one will wrench in Titanic, they will appreciate the beauty of Revolutionary Road, which will not be easily forgotten."

","In the cinema certain historical periods seem to become associated with a particular set of ideas. Thus a 1960s setting is often used (as in the recent ""Doubt"") as shorthand for ""clash between traditional conservative values and progressive modern ones"". The 1950s, by contrast, are often seen (as in ""Far from Heaven"") as a period of stifling social conformity when conservative values went unchallenged by progressive ones, particularly in proverbially conformist suburbia.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" set in a Connecticut suburb in 1955, is not a remake with a period setting of ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes' earlier film about suburban life. That film is, among other things, a satirical black comedy, combining satire with a character study of the leading characters and a philosophical exploration of the meaning of happiness. It contains surreal or supernatural elements, being, for example, narrated by the ghost of a dead man. ""Revolutionary Road"", by contrast, is more realistic and tells the story of the tragic disintegration of a failing marriage, treating its characters as rounded individuals rather than simply as objects of satire.<br/><br/>The two films, however, do have something in common. Like Lester Burnham in ""American Beauty"", Frank Wheeler seems, superficially, to be living the American dream as a fully paid-up member of the middle class. He has a career in marketing, a charming house, an attractive wife and two young children. Beneath this façade, however, Frank and his wife April are deeply unhappy. April is dissatisfied with her life as a housewife, and Frank dislikes his job.<br/><br/>Two things happen on Frank's thirtieth birthday. He begins an affair with a secretary from his office, less through sexual desire (she is less attractive than April) than through boredom. When he arrives home, however, April makes a surprising proposal, namely that they move to Paris, with April working as a secretary to support the family so that Frank can discover what he truly wants to do in life. After initial reluctance, Frank is won round to this idea, but then two further events cause him to have second thoughts. Frank's talents are noticed by a senior executive in his firm, who offers him a promotion to a better-paid position. April becomes pregnant with their third child, and Frank informs her that in the circumstances it will be better of the family remain in America.<br/><br/>Lester is in many ways a flawed individual, but I suspect that most viewers of ""American Beauty"" will sympathise with him rather than with his cold, snobbish and neurotic wife Carolyn. With ""Revolutionary Road"" I suspect that their sympathies will be more evenly divided. Mendes avoids the standard clichés of portraying April as a free spirit and her husband as a complacent bourgeois conformist, or of arguing that the only life worth living is the bohemian one. Frank is dissatisfied with life not because the suburbs are intrinsically dull or because he is temperamentally unsuited to life as a businessman but because his talents are not recognised at work. When he receives his sudden promotion, he realises that he is doing a worthwhile job which will enable him not only to support his family but also make a wider contribution to society. His main fault is that he has failed to realise just how unhappy his wife has become.<br/><br/>April is not a bad person, and has genuine causes of unhappiness, rooted in the social codes of the period which frowned upon married women, especially married women with children, from working outside the home. Nevertheless, she is portrayed as having faults of her own, rooted in intellectual snobbery and what might be called the ""grass is always greener"" mentality. She believes that she and Frank are unique and special, too good for the life of the suburbs. She sees the proposed move to Paris as the solution to all the family's problems without considering whether this is what Frank really wants. After this move falls through she too has an affair, with their neighbour Shep Campbell, even though he is precisely the sort of suburbanite she normally despises; his main attraction for April is that he is not Frank.<br/><br/>The film reunites Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet for the first time since ""Titanic"". Although I never really liked DiCaprio in his heart-throb phase in the nineties, ""Revolutionary Road"" confirms the message of ""Catch Me if You Can"" and ""The Aviator"", that he has matured into a fine actor. As for Winslet, her husband clearly knows how to get the best out of her; she really deserved the Oscar for this film, not for her technically proficient but soulless performance in the very overrated ""The Reader"". Frank and April are, despite their faults, both such vibrant, likable people that we find ourselves desperately wishing in our hearts that a happy ending will be possible for them, even though we know in our heads that the differences in their personalities make that unlikely.<br/><br/>The title is deliberately ironic; ""Revolutionary Road"" is the name of the street where Frank and April live, but there is little revolutionary about their lifestyle or that of their neighbours. Nevertheless, the film is not really a satire on suburban life; Mendes was no doubt aware that when the cinema indulges itself in anti-suburban satire the result can look uncomfortably like snobbish humour at the expense of those little people unfortunate enough not to have the telephone number salaries enjoyed by Hollywood moguls and stars. It should rather be seen as a moving human drama. DiCaprio himself said of it that ""There's rarely a movie nowadays about people and their normal struggles to find happiness in their life"". He is, of course, right about the rarity of such movies, and good ones on this theme are still rarer, but 2008 produced at least two excellent examples, ""Revolutionary Road"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"". A pity that Mendes and Eastwood did not receive more recognition from the Academy. 8/10"

","Revolutionary Road is probably most known for its long awaited reunion of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The duo last met in 1997 on a doomed cruise ocean liner in the phenomenally famous blockbuster Titanic. Ironically enough, in 2008, the sinking ship in this situation is their marriage. Through a series of violent arguments and morally questionable behavior, Frank and April Wheeler play the exact opposites of Jack and Rose. Instead of being driven mad with affection for each other, they are stuck in an unhappy relationship being driven mad by all the restrictions that their stagnant lifestyle imposes on them.<br/><br/>Trapped in the confines of 1950s suburbia, the Wheelers are living with their children in a quiet little house on a quiet little street. April stays at home and Frank goes to the office. Every day, though, things progress more and more into disillusion as the two start to wonder where their hopes and dreams went. Their lives have been restricted to boundaries of their seemingly picture-perfect life, but on the inside, the strains of commitment and ennui have weakened their relationship significantly. The film is somewhat of a mockery of how we are all forced to hide our problems and put on the old dog-and-pony show to make us look nice on the outside, while behind closed doors there are struggles no one can imagine. Things start looking up for the Wheelers when April suggests that they move to Paris and finally do what they've always wanted to do. An unexpected pregnancy, though, prevents them from going and so begins a slow, downward spiral that's painful but fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>The performances of Kate and Leo are arguably the strongest of each of their careers. There's, objectively, nothing to criticize about them. So much pain and emotion flies between them that just watching the Wheelers exchange words is exhausting. Even though their characters are constantly hurling insults at each other, there's still an innate chemistry between them that makes them mesmerizing to watch on screen. DiCaprio's performance all but brought tears to my eyes as the husband who tries his very best to support his family, but is fed up with his mind-numbing job. His tense relationship with his counterpart only makes him all the more stressed and genuinely confused about how to fix the situation. April seems like more of the free spirit and although Frank cares for her, their values are starkly different. One particular scene that especially moved me was after a particularly bad episode with April, he comes downstairs to find her calmly cooking breakfast as though nothing even happened the night before. In response to April slinging an ""I hate you"" at him the previous night, he just looks at her and asks—something to the effect of—""you don't hate me, right?"" It's just a few, simple words, but they succeed in being the most poignant words spoken throughout the whole movie. It's great acting, and DiCaprio does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet has never been under appreciated as an actor, and rightfully so. Every movie she's in, romantic, dramatic, funny, what have you, she always plays the part. She has mind-blowing versatility, and Revolutionary Road is no exception. April would be easy to make into the villain. After all, she's upstaging her family in pursuit of a pipe dream, she has unrealistic expectations of her husband, and she's overzealous (arguably, to a fault) when it comes to the chase of said dreams. Winslet, though, is able to make a sympathetic plight for April. Although a severely flawed character, she's still humanized and relatable. Not to mention, she's a powerhouse screen presence and she's so tapped in emotionally to her part that it's riveting.<br/><br/>The general consensus among critics and audiences is the not-so-cheery ending. One can't help knowing that something bad is coming considering the gloomy tone of the whole storyline, but thanks to DiCaprio and Winslet, the depressing plot is still watchable. Mostly due to the actors, Revolutionary Road may not have been a hit during awards season (whoever is responsible for DiCaprio not earning an Oscar nomination should be locked up), but I was glad I saw it. The directing (by Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes) is precise enough to allow the actors to do what they do best and the source material (the novel by Richard Yates) is nothing to sneeze at. Hopefully, Kate and Leo will reunite in the near future to deliver the same gripping performances as this one.<br/><br/>My grade: B+"

","If American Beauty questioned human morality, Revolutionary Road questions sainity. Richard Yates disturbing tale of human relationship has transcended into screen by Sam Mendes.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet who came together a decade ago for Titanic, play the role of the Wheelers, an outwardly happily married couple with two kids residing at Revolutionary Road. <br/><br/>In the first few minutes of the movie, the audiences get to see, Frank Wheeler and April eying each other, falling in love and then cut to the present, a few years later there is sea change in their lives. Frank hates his job as a salesman in a cubicle while April's dream to become an actress is a failure. Adding to this is the stress of their marriage falling apart. <br/><br/>And just like that April decides for them to get away from the emptiness and hopelessness encumbering their lives and start anew in Paris. She chalks out a plan to get herself a job there so that Frank can find what he really loves to do in life. All those close to them think it is the most unrealistic fantasy like idea, except for their land lady's lunatic son John Givings (Michael Shannon), who feels it's the sanest decision they had ever taken. <br/><br/>Just as things are looking upbeat for the couple, in terms of relationship, fate takes a different turn. Frank gets promoted and Alice is pregnant. From here the tale grows into a complex heart wrenching. With the Paris dream shattered, their life once again goes topsy-turvy. And mad man John with his deep insight hurting words to set a cascade of unpredictable reactions to follow. <br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are such a treat to watch. Di Caprio as a loving practical, responsible and once-in-a-while-going-astray husband, is especially good in the emotional scenes. Kate Winslet, yet again proves why she is the best actress on this planet. Michael will never be able to beat the Heath Ledger's insanity levels, but his very brief role getting nominated for the best supporting actor in the Oscars, speaks volumes. <br/><br/>The monotonous background score by Thomas Newman is just as haunting as the movie. <br/><br/>The movie is distressing in every right. It questions morality, fickleness of the human mind and its unpredictability. Who or what are we living for? For our own selves or for others? These will be the questions that will linger in your mind after watching this Mendes flick. He is a phenomenon, no doubt."

Is that the expression of human wisdom? Is that signifying a kind of reconciliation with the unhappiness in life? Is that telling us to give up our true desires just to be living from hand to mouth? I want to stop asking these questions for now because I have sensed an impasse just inches ahead. I am thinking about the couple in Michael Haneke's The Seventh Continent and another couple in Robert Bresson's A Gentle Woman.

Although an Oscar nomination does not automatically translate into universally accepted excellence (see: The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, etc etc...), I do not see this lack of nominations as a tremendous injustice: this is movie is good, but not very good. I have not read the book it is taken from, so maybe its shortcomings are a direct consequence of the novel's...this depends on how faithful is the script, especially when it comes to dialogs and characters' interaction in general. The acting is good (Winslet's better than Di Caprio's but this does not come as a surprise) but some lines where really either over the top or trivial. A movie that claims to be a merciless depiction of how ugly a relationship can get cannot rely on trite clichés like a woman accusing a man of not being a man, or an ""Idiot savant"" who explicitly tells it like it is with his acute insights and tongue-in-cheek blabber. In many scenes of the movie I felt like the characters were explaining their inner world, in a very simple and clear way. Like in 5th grade. We're all grown up here, people. Let's move on.

","Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite again 11 years after ""Titanic"" in this melodrama about a troubled couple in the 1950's, under the direction of Winslet's husband, Sam Mendes (whose début was nothing less than the neoclassic ""American Beauty"").<br/><br/>Needless to say, there was a lot of expectation about ""Revolutionary Road"", and it's easy to see why some people were disappointed. This is not a Hollywood epic à la ""Titanic"", but more of a homage to Douglas Sirk's melodramas. In that regard, ""Revolutionary Road"" is not as successful as Todd Haynes' superb ""Far from Heaven"" (2002), the ultimate homage to the melodrama of Sirk; filled with wit, magnificent acting (by Julianne Moore in particular) and visual exuberance. Marriage's tough, we all know that, and Ingmar Bergman made a bunch of superb films about married life; between European cinema and old Hollywood, it's a theme that needs to be refreshed to be brought back into life. ""Revolutionary Road"" is not a revolutionary film, but it is not a bad one by any means; well acted (Michael Shannon, who I first noticed in William Friedkin's ""Bug"", is responsible for the best moments, and deserved his Oscar nomination), scored with the usual competence by Thomas Newman, it's an elegant piece; however, not to be disappointed, you need to keep in mind you're going to see nothing but a well-made old fashioned story. 7.5/10."

","There is much more to this film than a simple story of selfish or disillusioned people. This is about two persons who cannot make up their minds about where should their life path take them and who are totally mesmerized by the ""hopeless emptiness"" of living. An stunning performance of actors, playing characters devoured by strong feelings, inflamed hope, resentments and frustrations. The idea of having their hidden, deep thoughts deciphered by the lunatic neighbour, is a very strong point for the film.<br/><br/>Not often have I seen a film in which the innate difficulty at communicating between man and wife - the way we look at common projects, failures and achievements- have been so crudely carved and depicted. Yet, for most of us, fortunately, affection, luck or giving up, maybe even sometimes common sense allows to heal the wounds. The final scene illustrates on a light tone the difficulty of communicating between spouses, the man choosing his own way to not have to continue the dialog with his life partner.<br/><br/>Franck and April are passionate people, and common sense is not something you want to hear about when you have a passion. Their drama is that they do not know what they are passionate about, they cannot find what makes them ""special"".<br/><br/>The same director as ""American Beauty"". In a sense, the characters in that film were totally unconscious, even if behaving in an irresponsible way, of what was going to happen; they could not think about the unthinkable ending. In this story, you can perceive a good deal of willingness to hurt and to be hurt; just to feel something, finally."

","Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Sam Mendes, is a great vehicle for Kate Winslet. Winslet is an actor whom I truly admire. A critic has called her the ""Meryl Streep for her generation,"" and I agree. Leonardo DiCaprio does a reasonable job as her husband, although for most of the film his expression varies between a scowl and a dark scowl.<br/><br/>Frank Wheeler is living the 1950's American dream--well-paying job, beautiful wife, two kids, shiny Oldsmobile, house in Connecticut. April Wheeler is living the dream as well. It's true that her career as an actor has gone nowhere, but she loves her husband and her kids and their beautiful home.<br/><br/>Except. . . Frank says he hates his job, and April thinks they should be looking down on the life they're living. They know they're better than other people they see around them. Her thought--let's go to Paris where I can work as a secretary and you can find yourself.<br/><br/>The problem with the script is that there's a major scene missing. We're led to understand, in context, that Frank had great dreams for himself, and April shared those dreams. That point is never made clear--when did they decide they could do great things, and what talents did Frank have that people around him didn't have? (We also never see Winslet, as April, acting. Early in the film, we're shown a scene where she's acted in a community play which, apparently, was horrible.)<br/><br/>The film contains some sub-plots, which basically serve as filler. Frank has a dalliance with a secretary, one of their friends is in love with April, and a mentally ill man is the only person who both sees the truth, and is able to tell the truth about what he sees. <br/><br/>The strength of the film is in Winslet's acting, and in the basic question: Is the perfect life really the perfect life? If it isn't perfect, what then?"

","I'm a fan of Sam Mendes' direction and his style in clear in this movie, which is one of the film's strong point. There are other strengths: the acting is good by just about everyone involved but especially Kate Winslet (who does a much better American accent than the usual grating attempt); the topic is interesting (marriage problems); and the treatment is mature. And there are some genuinely deep moments in the movie that any married couple will relate to. Mendes does suburban angst better than anyone in cinema but his theatrical roots show at times with the staged scenes and clunky dialogue.<br/><br/>DiCaprio just can't carry off heavy roles - he looks like a wee boy in a grown-up's suit. The film is based on a Sixties' book and inherits some of the sexism from that era (but not intentionally or ironically). And, at the end of it, it doesn't say a great deal... except that marriage is not the idealised perfection that romantic novels lead you to believe.<br/><br/>But for the acting, interesting topic, cinematography, music and atmosphere, it's well worth catching and markedly better than most movies.

","Stop, before you even attempt to read this review I must warn you. If you are currently engaged, if you are in a happy relationship and especially if your newlyweds, stop reading now. This movie is designed to repel you. This may just be the most depressing movie of 2009. An anti-marriage campaign if I ever saw one. What sets it apart from other movie with the same attitude (The Heart of Me) is that its flawlessly done. Sam Mendes movie looks and sounds gorgeous and not once does it put a foot out of line. What Revolutionary road fails to do however is maker you like it. Its wonderfully made sure, but the subject material is so banal its almost impossible to sit through.<br/><br/>With ""American Beauty"", Sam Mendes's previous film, we were given at the very least a glimmer of hope. The theory behind that movie was that even in the last year of your life you can live a lifetime over. Here, none of these characters are given a glimmer of hope; in the end it all feels worthless.<br/><br/>It's a movie for a specific audience, an audience I thought I catered to, with this movie however I even had to think twice about staying. It's not that it's a bad movie however, as I said it's wonderfully made. Look as hard as you want your won't find a flaw, its simply a case of the execution overruling the premise, a rare feat but true in this case. Its seems that from the get go this story fails to do justice to the elements Sam Mendes incorporates into it.<br/><br/>These elements, done so flawlessly, include two riveting performances from Kate Winslet and Leonard DiCaprio both playing tortured middle class people living in 1950's America. Titanic shipmates Kathy Bates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet step onboard for director Sam Mendes' tale of suburban malaise in 1950s-era Connecticut. Adapted from the classic 1961 novel by author Richard Yates, Revolutionary Road tells the tale of a young Connecticut couple whose once-idealistic relationship steadily deteriorates into a ceaseless cycle of petty jealousy and bickering as they strive to retain their independence in the conformity-obsessed world of picket fences and perfectly manicured lawns. Ever since they first met, Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) saw themselves as special and different.<br/><br/>They strive to form their relationship around higher ideals, though upon moving into their new home on Revolutionary Road, the defiant couple pledges never to be confined by the social conventions of the era. As time passes, however, Frank and April gradually become the very thing that they both feared most -- a typical suburban family complete with abandoned dreams and faded hopes. Frank loses his nerve after taking a comfortable job with a reliable salary, and April morphs into an unsatisfied homemaker desperate for passion and excitement. But April's independent spirit hasn't been suffocated just yet, and when she hatches a plan to head for Paris, her need to escape at all costs stands in direct contrast to Frank's desire to hold on to what they already have.<br/><br/>The score is executed with the same pin price precisions of that used in American Beauty, it feels as if somebody has spent a great deal of time on it. As does this film itself, Sam Mendes may have been so busy with the elements of his movie he may not have realised that the premise he was making his movie on felt a little lifeless. For better use of the word, a downer. Revolutionary Road is beautifully made, but it won't make your day.<br/><br/>Verdict: A film crafter so beautifully it would be a shame to pass it up now. Sam Mendes directional style shine through the dim premise and while it's unlikely to leave any audience member happy, simply due to its depressing nature, it may just enlighten some. You come out knowing you have seen some great performances, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography, but it is just not a film you love. For my overall rating I give Revolutionary Road 3/5."
"dj_xand325","9","0","1","31 January 2009"," Revolutionary Road is a depressing, tragic, immaculate, powerful force of a film.
","Sam Mendes shocked us in 1999 with his magnificent study of American Suburbia with American Beauty. He's come back onto our screens with Revolutionary Road, a shocking retelling of Richard Yates' novel. It tells the story of the seemingly perfect family, the Wheelers. They have 2 children, live within a very respectable neighbourhood, financially secure and seem externally to have a very loving relationship. Yet with Mendes (like American Beauty), nothing is ever as it seems and we see how Frank and April's relationship becomes jaded, empty and hopeless. April is a failed actress who spends her days tending for the house while Frank has a job that he can't stand. They're relationship is dysfunctional and Mendes maximises the devestating effect of this with the flashbacks of when they were newly weds which creates a profound contrast.<br/><br/>Frank and April have an opportunity to break out of this monotonous, vacuous lifestyle they live in by moving into Paris yet the arrival of a pregnancy and higher job hopes for Frank leads to this immature dream deteriorating which leads to a tragic conclusion.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful, visually and contextually. It presents the superficiality of American Suburbia that covers up the empty, cold lives these people lead. Dicaprio and Winslet were the highlight of the film. Their performances were sensational, Dicaprio's tour de force performance was vehement, passionate yet at times poignant. Winslet's performance was whimsical and truly flawless. The most important thing was the chemistry of these two characters, this withstood outstandingly throughout the film, which was of course helped by Winslet and Dicaprio's partnering in Titanic around a decade ago.<br/><br/>Winslet and Dicaprio reunite in Mendes' beautiful film about the crushing effects of post WW2 American Suburbia. American Suburbia has been given another swipe by Sam Mendes, and hes looking as bold and brilliant as ever 9/10"

","Revolutionary Road is absolutely one of the best movies in 2008.Sam Medes succeeds again dealing with real life issues using two of the best actors in their generation.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio now has his print on Hollywood map.His captivating performance is probably the best male performance this year and his best(after The Aviator of course). Kate Winslet's performance is as good as her co-star.(shame on the Academy for snubbing them).At least Michael Shannon got a nomination he deserved.<br/><br/>It's dark drama presents painful reality.Thus,it may not be interesting to the young audience who wants light movie."
"swillsqueal","9","0","1","31 January 2009"," The Big Bourgeois Trap
","Wage-slaves tend to reproduce the lives which their parents lived, with minor changes of location and personages. It's also true that some young adults swear that they'll live life differently. There's an urge to avoid a meaningless existence. There is that youthful Kerouac-like urge to escape the Big Bourgeois Trap and instead, to jump in the car, put the peddle to the metal and be free.<br/><br/>Willy Loman was trapped. Arthur Miller wrote his play ""Death of a Salesman"", revealing the life of a tired, forgotten wage-slave near the end of life's road; loyal to his bosses, disloyal to his wife, while lying to his kids and at the same time supporting them financially through his tireless journeys for love and money. It's more than ironic that Elia Kazan directed 742 performances of ""Death of a Salesman"" in which Lee J. Cobb played the empty, hopelessness characterized in Willy. Ironic why? Because, among other things, Kazan's granddaughter has a significant role, playing Milly in ""Revolutionary Road"". Ah, but that's another story. See the film.<br/><br/>Willy Loman's world is just one aspect of this 1955-centered movie which can be mined by the mindful. There are so many others, including references to the movie version of Edward Albee's George and Martha in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"". Ah yes, the 'bickerings' you say. Ah yes, the secrets, lies and use of sex as a weapon in the struggle between males and females in marriage. Ah, but there's even more to ""Revolutionary Road"" than this.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" is about the desire for freedom, nay, the instinct for freedom which is constantly being stomped down within the Big Bourgeois Trap from the time you are a terrible two until you've finally grown up and realized that you must be an adult and conform. Either that or die or become a hobo or be thrown in an insane asylum as the mathematics Ph.d. John Givings has been in ""Revolutinary Road"". John (played excellently by Michael Shannon) is that kind of Francis Farmer non-conformist who has not grown out of his child-like bluntness, ergo, he must be shocked to keep from shocking others. (Was he thrown in the asylum by his ever loving mother, played by Kathy Bates?) He blurts out truths, even within proper, safe social settings. He blurts them out like the machine gun fire one might face as a soldier during WWII. Frank Wheeler (Di Caprio) has seen this kind of truth before. At first, he and April recognize it and embrace it. Frank was a soldier, facing death in the WWII, which in 1955 had only ended ten years before. It was at that moment of life or death truth, he confesses to his wife April (Kate Winslet), that he felt the most alive, even though he was frightened. And April, whose love for her husband has been challenged by the hum-drum life of housewifery in the safe, leafy suburbs of NYC, confesses that she felt the same, existential awakening when she first experienced love making with Frank, back when they were young and on their own revolutionary road away from the ordinary lives which their parents had lived. The moment of this mutual recognition leads to a very steamy sex scene in the kitchen. Surely, you are interested now, dear readers.<br/><br/>The thing is that Frank is now a salesman for the same company which employed his father and he sees the death trap of a Willy Loman lifestyle descending over him, much as Willy's children saw it destroy their father. April sees it too. But hell, they've now decided to chuck it all, the relative security of life in the burbs of the 50s to take a chance on April in Paris. Yes, to move the two kids and their married lives ('the whole catastrophe', to quote Zorba) to Europe where existentialist juices are imagined to be flowing as freely as the espresso at the Cafe des Deux Maggots. The prospect of finally 'finding themselves' blooms somewhere, just over the rainbow shrouded Atlantic Ocean. Yes, the chimes of freedom are flashing again after some years of marriage with its triumphs and disappointments. Their instincts have been re-awakened from the doldrums of everyday life in the 50s with the father kissing the wife a la Dagwood and taking off to bring home the bacon from the office which Mr. Dithers runs and the kids, of course, running around in the yard shouting, ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"".<br/><br/>In the beginning of their relationship, both April and Frank really want this freedom from the Big Bourgeois Trap and they believe that this urge places them in another league from their peers. This urge sets them on fire with love for each other. Others see the spirit in them too, the ones who have already grown-up, conforming to the lies required of fear-filled wage-slaves in everyday life. They want to touch it; but are ultimately cowed by their social conditioning, rationalized as,""familial responsibilities"". When Frank is offered a big promotion in sales (he will be an ad-man for the then, cutting edge exotic machines called computers), he is tempted to accept and give up on pulling up stakes in burbs and moving to Paris with April.<br/><br/>April is not of the same mind. She is still star struck with the idea of getting out, perhaps escaping to the sheltering skies of Tangiers with Paul Bowles, instead of ending up as yet another archetypal Lucy Jordan, wife to that ultimate tragic archetype of capitalism, Willy Loman. Thus, lovers become haters and the road to revolution in their lives turns into its opposite: death on the installment plan in middlebrow suburbia, complete with those occasional visits to a reputable psychiatrist, just so one can remain safely shrink-wrapped in the Big Bourgeois Trap."

","Revolutionary Road was a great film in many aspects. First the powerful acting delivered by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet. Second the dialogue was absolute genius. Finally the story is so unbelievably told that it leaves you speechless to what you're actually seeing on screen. It baffles me that this movie didn't get more nominations and Leo and Kate needed nominations for this movie, but this isn't the first time I've seen Leo get shafted by the Oscars. The story of two people only in love with the idea of each other, getting married having children and trying to do the right thing with everything that's wrong finally clashes and is told so brilliantly and believably in this movie. This movie was highly underestimated by the Oscars. It was wonderful in many ways and Sam Mendes yet again brings us another great movie that leaves us thinking about it long after the credits end."

","Revolutionary Road is an exquisite piece of serious melodrama. Much of the emotional depth relies on what we don't see. Don't hear. And don't have explained. Characters control their feelings rather more than American cinema would usually like them to. That, will hopefully put off many a teenage cinemagoer who would be bored rigid by a lack of explosions. A lack of over-acting. A lack of subject matter one can relate to without at least one failed marriage, one relationship you get up for but would rather not, and a long period where the choice between emptiness and hopelessness stretches out like a life sentence. Di Caprio an Winslet are reunited. This time, it's not Titanic that fails to reach its destination, it's the American Dream.<br/><br/>Take a moment to recall a time when you had something all figured out. How everything would be just perfect. If only people would do it your way? Trapped inside individual visions of perfection, Frank and April communicate at emotional cross-purposes. They are an idyllically good-looking young couple in 1950s Connecticut, buying their first house. Expecting their first child. The world is opening up to them. Have you been there perhaps? Just a few adjustments. Tweak each other's views.<br/><br/>What do you do when you love someone and they won't see sense? Frank tries to disabuse April of her childish notions of being an actress, something she has trained for. She's awful at it anyway, he's right. Why can he not see that this is not the way to be supportive and loving? April slips jarringly from being the perfect wife to putting on perfection as a show. Then she has a bright idea. Let's start again. In Paris. Frank will have time to find what he really wants to do in life instead of an advertising job he hates. Deep down he loves her. If she can only just re-kindle that.<br/><br/>The problem with pretending to be nice is just that. If you have to pretend, then deeper issues are not right. Sooner or later they will come to the surface. Stuff about the symbolic nature of the title (the street where Frank and April live is called Revolutionary Road) could fill pages. But the film's strength is that any deeper meanings are secondary. There is sometimes a great temptation (certainly by this writer) to interpret films within a social context, to analyse their moral agenda. While this provides intelligent gratification of consciousness, it can blind us to the power of film as autonomous art, the precise use of a dramatic device for its own sake, the carefully crafted harmony of costume, lighting, sets, inflection and intonation, and the many formal techniques unique to cinema among the arts.<br/><br/>Winslet is here most diva-like, more self-assured than in many of her flamboyantly emotional parts. She delivers her lines with scalpel-like precision, and at last cuts the profile of an actress destined to become legend. Di Caprio is still underestimated as an actor in my opinion. Here, he plays off Winslet with the fire of a young Brando. As they throw emotional punches at each other, they are like two five-star boxers. A surgical jab to weeping wounds which hide tears. Pain inflicted without breaking rules. The cut and thrust of barbed words eliciting the worst. Is change possible without destruction? Bring on a neighbour's son, a mathematics Ph.D certifiably unsocial after repeated electric shock treatment to 'fix' him. Now a Village Fool like those of legend, who can speak the truth that no-one dares. Nowhere is such an occasionally theatrical device deployed more scathingly than with Michael Shannon's character, John Givings. A man who is past caring, towering over Frank and April physically and intellectually, he shreds any illusions we dare hold for their sake.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am wrong about teenage audiences. Some did walk out. But I remember Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. One of the first 'adult' themed films I saw as a young lad. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, bickering incessantly, and pointlessly showing off encyclopaedic command of words just to needle each other. I had to make myself sit through it. But the film made a deep impression and I look back on it now as a classic. I hope some young viewers will have the same experience with this Revolutionary Road."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","30 January 2009"," The road to ruin
","It's a decade since Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet starred as ill-fated lovers aboard the ""Titantic"". Since then, each has made some fine movies  DiCaprio in the likes of ""Gangs Of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" and Winslet in such as ""Iris"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". In between, they have remained good friends.<br/><br/>So it's great to see them back together, this time as a young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during 1955 in a film based on a 1961 novel by Richard Yates and directed by Winslet's husband Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" and ""Road To Perdition""). Both give excellent performances, with Winslet especially nuanced, in a dark tale of unfulfilled hope and lacerating conflict."
"Otoboke","Null","0","1","30 January 2009"," The Great American Nightmare.
","Reminisce with me to a simpler time in cinema, back when such a day out was an entirely different experience; a celluloid landscape sculpted with the most obtuse of films, a large quantity of which belong to the science-fiction genre with all its low- budgetary images of horror and paranoia gorging itself unto viewers of all ages from coast to coast in America's theatres. Much of these outings proved to be good fun for the family and dates, and yet something sinister was always prevalent to them- something a little more subliminal and ominous. It was the middle of the 20th century, around about the same time our story begins here.<br/><br/>Truth be told, science-fiction is a genre that couldn't be any further from the tale that director Sam Mendes presents to us here, but in another sense it couldn't be any closer to the truth. In what is essentially a two hour character and relation study of a 1950's American Dream marriage, Mendes paints an eerily numb existence fortified by loneliness and bewildering emptiness. Indeed, it's the same kind of world that Aliens From Mars! would portray as uncomfortably alien in an effort to contrast how well America supposedly had it in contrast to their eastern, vodka drinking red-shirt counterparts. The irony of course being that such audiences need look no further than their own bedrooms (as opposed to under the bed itself) to find such horrific scenes of conformity, lost dreams and social imprisonment.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Road comes from the director of beloved cult-classic American Beauty, which for all intents and purposes set out to decipher the same ideas of social frustration inherent to modern western philosophical values (or lack thereof) and short-sighted ambition. As a follow up, this outing feels both poignant and relative but not without its inherent drawbacks as a direct result of blooming in the shadow of such a renowned and similar output. Indeed, the most consistent of the film's low points simply come from the fact that Mendes seems to be at times- repeating himself. This isn't all bad of course; American Beauty isn't exactly a poor choice of film to trace ideas from- yet there still remain degrees of déjà-vu and needlessness to Revolutionary Road's model that detracts from the experience.<br/><br/>That being said however, Mendes does well to stay clear of the ""hopeless emptiness"" that dominates its screenplay's narrative; resisting the trappings of merely cloning an accepted form. Rather, Revolutionary Road is feisty and alive; we sit and watch closely as characters slowly wither away and yet we continue to feel for them in their struggle against a tide overwhelming their own personal desires for freedom. Through this shift to emotive engagement Mendes informs but also avoids overtly preaching to the point where connection to character is lost to cold, paper-based ideas. This attention to the emotive core of the couple's rather tragic deterioration allows the film to branch off into directions hinted at throughout American Beauty but never fully explored. Where Mendes' first output focused primarily on many different characters and how they related to one central persona's midlife crisis, Revolutionary Road instead details one relationship between two people lost in a cage that they accidentally stumbled into. It's a relatively small shift in direction, but the movie is certainly all the better for it.<br/><br/>A good few years down the line from their whimsical change of scenery and it would seem that all hope is lost for the Wheelers. Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) over the years of settling down to raise children in a comfortable corner of suburbia, initially found themselves content and perhaps even happy in their new home only to realise later on that it was a cage destined to kill the love that brought them there in the first place. The result? Explosive. Through years of building frustration with a directionless existence burdened and yet constructed upon the necessity of a normal, socially viable living, the pent up anger eventually comes loose in a series of startling scenes aptly performed by all involved. Indeed, Mendes' doesn't even elect to make obvious distinctions between the script's jumps in time- we can tell from the characters' attitude to each other as where we are in their story.<br/><br/>During these sequences of particular upset however, we experience fully the emotional baggage that each carries as a result of their embittered lifestyle with DiCaprio with Winslet selling it from beginning to end with utter conviction- there is hardly any doubting either's commitment to their role and partnership; this is top of the line stuff that gives a movie such as this its real value. Granted there are moments when Haythe's script borders on absurdity with dialogue plainly written solely to voice themes, yet even such instances carry their own weight in establishing the feature's ideas and criticisms central to the plot.<br/><br/>Rather than paint a picture filled with black and whites, Revolutionary Road instead brushes the canvas with light, albeit detailed strokes of subtle drama shaded with layers of compelling humanity. For what it's worth, the tale it sets out to tell retains a certain degree of romance inherent to its derailing, but not in the windswept manner to which DiCaprio and Winslet met ten years prior. Instead, Mendes offers a tragedy built upon regret and personal affliction rather than an outside, unshakable force- for the Wheelers, their iceberg it would seem comes in the form of a cosy little house overlooking quiet suburbia in all its apathetic, dreamless wonder- and yet you get the feeling that a shipwreck would somehow be a welcome change of scenery for both. For us onlookers however, Revolutionary Road provides safe, over-the-fence peak at the nightmare through a coherent, wonderfully dark, satirical, grounded and well constructed criticism of the picket-fence fantasy.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","After seeing yet another existential evocation of dystopian lives in 1950s suburbia (try the far more campy melodrama, Far From Heaven , or the far more gentle satire, Pleasantville, for a set of comparisons) it is obvious why the next step in American cultural evolution following Frank Lloyd Wright's inspired masculine tract house angularity involved both the ""Feminine Mystique"" and the ""Hite Report."" The sex in these 'burbs was just god-awful. Dicaprio's office stud was, at best, a six to seven pump chump fighting to beat a soft boiled egg timer when he played kitchen man to Winslet's unfulfilled housewife. Not surprisingly, she cheated to find better, but the guy next door was a truly pitiful front seat three stroker, if that. Did people of this type during this time period really screw so industrially? I mean I know the proverbial back seat drive-in movie thing was likely a fast, furtive and mostly clothed affair, but if this movie makes any statement about the banality and hopelessness of these characters' predicament, it is in the bump and grind of their everyday lives, or the lack of any to be precise. These well-suited and fedora clad men had won the war, then came home to fight meaningless memo battles within art deco wood and frosted glass foxhole versions of Dilbert's future cubicle hell. They wound up all pea and no cock, and their poor drab hens paid the real price.<br/><br/>I can easily picture Eddie Haskell as a selfish and quick lout bumbling about darkly in the back seat of a Studebaker between double creature features, but. I wonder if this is what it was like in Ward and June Cleaver's bedroom, or in their kitchen when Wally and Beaver were off somewhere being all American boys? <br/><br/>(Curious Note: Actor Dylan Baker, who plays DiCaprio's cubicle inmate at work, strikingly resembles the model for the father subject in the infamous 1930s anti-Depression propaganda billboard, ""World's Highest Standard of Living, There is No Way Like the American Way."" This billboard was made world famous through Margaret Bourke-White's classic ironic black and white photograph showing poor African-American flood victims lining up for relief in front of one in Louisville, KY in 1937. The billboard artwork, though it depicted an upper middle class white family enjoying ""prosperity"" as the Depression presumably ebbed in the late 1930s, is nonetheless eerily prescient for, and evocative of post war 1950s material culture.)"

","April Wheeler is one very desperate housewife in the 1950's. She married her attractive husband, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), thinking his unconventional ways and casual attitude toward his jobs would result in a less-than-ordinary life. However, once April got pregnant with her daughter, and her younger son, Frank changed. He started to work for the same staid Manhattan firm where his father had toiled for years and he moved his family into a lovely home in suburban Connecticut. Consequently, April is in a state of slow suffocation, for although she appears to be the typical, all-American housewife, she is not. One day, April greets Frank with a big smile and a nifty family party for his 30th birthday. That's because April has hatched a plan. Why can't the Wheelers move to Paris, which Frank saw and admired during his military years, and which would surely hold a bevy of new sights and sounds? Frank would not even have to work, April would work as a secretary for a government agency and Frank can figure out what he really wants to do in life. Caught up in April's enthusiasm, Frank agrees to the new venture. But, then April finds out she is pregnant with the couple's third child. What will happen to April's dreams of a new life? This is a devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her unhappiness with a picture-postcard family existence. April's problems are compounded by the fact that she lives in the 1950's when women were just beginning to break out of the typical homemaker ""mold"". In the 21st century, many couples grow apart as they grow older and there is not as much of a stigma to ending a marriage and starting all over again. Yet, Frank is a sympathetic character, too, for he is not the money-driven businessman that many folks are, but he does have a family to support and his feet are more rooted in reality than April's. The result is that the Wheelers are a couple in desperate need of serious counseling but they don't get it and tragedy ensues. As the principal actors, Winslet and DiCaprio are incomparable in their difficult roles. Winslet embodies the beautiful, unhappy April as few actresses could but DiCaprio, despite receiving no similar award nominations, is every bit her equal in his part as the torn-in-two directions husband. All of the supporting cast, from Kathy Bates to Michael Shannon and the rest, are absolutely marvelous, too. The scenery in suburban Connecticut is lovely, the costumes well chosen, and the production values are first rate. As for the story and its direction, by Sam Mendes, they are monumentally powerful and sad. Not all of us are cut out for the ""normal"" family life and to feel caught in a life style you don't love is a major downer. Therefore, this is not the film to see if you are in a state of depression or are experiencing any difficulties in your own family relationships, for it will thoroughly demoralize you. But, if you are a movie fan who yearns for a film to ""shake you to your bones"", with a strong story and great depth, this one just can't be missed. Mendes, as in American Beauty, is a master at showing the dark side of anyone's seemingly sunny life."

I could easily imagine the sounds of France keeping her in a spell as they incessantly played behind her eyes rousing nostalgia and beckoning her. Di Caprio was also great at pulling off being the head Wheeler, although he seemed at times to channel Jack Nicholson. Nicholson aside, Frank Wheeler was a complicated man faced with difficult decisions and Di Caprio really brought him across.

","I usually do not post in forums, comments, etc... but I felt like I needed to after I saw this influential film and the type of feedback it was receiving. The feeling this movie gave me is something I have never felt in my life. Sam Mendes does a wonderful job directing while both he and Justin Haythe adapt this Richard Yates novel into a screenplay... however, the biggest element that shined in this film was the superb acting.<br/><br/>I don't consider myself a movie guru, but I do know a lot about the general aspects that build a powerful film. Revolutionary Road was a complete outlier, as it struck chords I didn't even know I was aware of. I have been married for almost 3 years... I love sociology and I have written papers on American Institutionalism... which this move depicts very well in the 1950s. It was a time of change, a time of conformity, and time of confusion for Americans.... <br/><br/>The two main characters in this movie - April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leo Dicaprio) had a connection that only deep lovers may understand... I know many argue otherwise... but seriously... if both you and your spouse lift yourselves above the 'Marriage' institutionalism ideal... you will begin to realize, that we are both just two humans questioning a sociological constructed ideal called 'Marriage'. The way Mendes depicted this movie was flawless... there were moments I felt completely disconnected with reality and had almost a sense of eeriness watching the couple interact during their ongoing conflict in the film. <br/><br/>The movie probably won't appeal to the masses... but if you are aware of socially constructed ideals and institutionalism, you will find this film hard to forget. I think both actors did a wonderful job... I have never seen such emotional and flawless acting. Leo definitely got snubbed for the Oscars... I never really watch the Oscars, but the fact that he didn't' even get nominated has sincerely frustrated me.<br/><br/>Watch this film. Truly a quality piece that will show you an ongoing battle within every marriage... it is just a matter of how tolerant and willing you are to play 'the game'. I admire the couple for their willingness to be free-spirited and aware of their predicament. Marriage is socially constructed... it is NOT natural... despite the advantages, it just isn't. It is a form of social control delivered by a higher agenda that we may never come to realize. <br/><br/>We still fall victim to love though, and this movie depicts the struggle and realization of this institutionalized cage of marriage and individualism.<br/><br/>10/10"
"richard-1787","8","0","1","25 January 2009"," A very fine movie
","The trailers for this looked intriguing, and while I know they can be deceptive, I went anyway, having been very impressed by Kate Winslett's performances in other movies (Hamlet, The Reader, Sense and Sensibility).<br/><br/>Still, I was not prepared for as good a movie as this turned out to be.<br/><br/>Winslett and Di Caprio give first-rate performances, particularly Winslett. Yes, there is some shouting, but that's not acting, it's shouting. Anyone can do that. Both these actors say far more with their faces, their expressions, than they do with their shouting. They telegraph pages of script into glances, as the best actors do. Winslett at the end is absolutely devastating to watch as she prepares for what she clearly sees as a fatal act.<br/><br/>The directing is very fine as well. The scene of the abortion is perfectly and most movingly filmed, moving at just the right speed, cloaked in just the right hushed almost silence, with discretion and respect. It would have been so early to over-dramatize it, but Mendes does not, making it all that much more devastating.<br/><br/>There are points where one might want more elucidation. Why does di Caprio's character oppose the abortion? What is he thinking, married to the very beautiful Winslett, when he seduces the less attractive office clerk? There are other questions for which I might have liked at least suggestions of answers.<br/><br/>Still, I don't need every i to be dotted and every t to be crossed to enjoy a movie, as I most certainly did this one. It is a very moving story about a woman trapped in a life that does not satisfy her, surrounded by others who cannot understand her feelings and seem to be very satisfied with what she has. In that respect, it recalls the middle story of The Hours, though I found this more subtle and very much more moving.<br/><br/>The Academy may have overlooked it for best picture, but you should not."

","The drive from the train station is not that far. Once you get past the first stretch, home to local folk like plumbers, seamstresses and the like, you turn on to a quaint, quiet road. The house that will hopefully soon be the home to you and your children, present and future, sits atop its tiny slope, understated but proud. As you drive past the other homes, you see the people that inhabit them. The children run under sprinklers; the parents sit on their porches and enjoy their afternoon cocktails. They all look so happy, so home. This is what you need. This is what will make you happy too. This is Revolutionary Road. Only, it isn't really that. What it is really, is Sam Mendes' REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, and just like the pretty picture it paints, it isn't as revelatory as it inherently suggests nor does it bring the happiness you thought it might.<br/><br/>Mendes has been down this particular road before. In the Oscar winning, American BEAUTY, Mendes explored the trappings of suburban life. It was hardly revelatory when he did it then but screenwriter, Alan Ball's unique take on the subject made it feel fresh and relevant. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is based on Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name. It tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet), the lovely, new couple who have bought the aforementioned house at the end of Revolutionary Road and who bring with them the promise of youth and vitality. You see, the Wheeler's are special. Everyone has always said as much. Then they moved to Revolutionary Road. They made their house into a home and filled that home with two wonderful children. It was at this point that they realized that they may not truly be as special as everyone has always said, that perhaps they are not destined for anything greater than what they already have.<br/><br/>Leo and Kate are perfectly cast as the Wheeler's. More than ten years after TITANIC, the pair are together again and now everyone gets to see exactly what might have happened if the couple had survived the boat going down. (I trust I gave nothing away there.) And while there is nothing romantic about their reunion, they are REVOTIONARY ROAD's one true revelation. Winslet is remarkable. She is subtly but always at odds with herself inside. She wants to love her life, her husband, and on some level, she does. But she is also yearning and desperate to feel alive. DiCaprio is a bit shaky but while April's hand is less than reassuring, Winslet's hand lifts him and elevates his performance to nearly the same level as hers. To watch the two of them go back and forth between being hopeful for their futures and dismally resigned to a lifetime of unhappiness is a ride well worth taking and one that will certainly leave you dizzy by the time it comes to its harrowing close.<br/><br/>The problem with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is that Mendes seems more concerned in presenting the Wheeler's as a symbol for the greater point instead of allowing them to just be the relatable characters that they are. Frank and April are special. When we begin to buy into the idea that we are just like everyone else is when we become just like everyone else. When a film tries to make a point instead of just allowing the point to make itself is when a film takes on an importance it did not earn to start. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD could have been beautiful if it wasn't trying so hard to be the biggest house on the block."
"hacheurdeportos","9","0","1","25 January 2009"," great movie
","When I sat down, I was wondering if the film I was here to see was just a remake of the magnificent ""American Beauty"". It isn't, Revolutionary road is much darker than its predecessor. For the last hour and a half, I couldn't look off the screen due to the intensity of the tragedy lived by this couple. The acting is very impressing particularly Leonardo DiCaprio who seems to be on top form. Kate Winslet wasn't good enough for the part but who is? Sam Mendes might have aimed a little too high with the female character, tortured and yet full of hopes. However, revolutionary road left a good impression on me. More than a remake of ""amercian beauty"" it's a sequel showing the troubles of the American society."
"shiningsee","10","0","1","24 January 2009"," An Emotionally Devastating Masterpiece
","Revolutionary Road begins innocently as typical boy meets girl. The girl dreams of being an actress. The boy has no immediate ambition, save for the beauty that stands before him. They get married. Our detachment from the outcome is abruptly shaken by the true-to-life build up and explosion of their first argument. We witness something at once familiar, troubling and vitally important <br/><br/>Following that initial confrontation, broader social themes emerge. A workday dawns with a visually stunning torrent of businessmen in nearly identical suits bursting forth onto the trains and streets. Our lover turned patriarch is but one fish among many, swimming with grim determination into the jaws of wage slavery. All of this to achieve the American dreama perfect house in cookie-cutter suburbia, a car, a doting wife and 2.5 children. At what cost? Is this the road to happiness and fulfillment? What happens to dreams and ambitions that don't fit the mold? Not new questions, but the answers are, or should be, as unique as a living soul. <br/><br/>RR gradually builds to an intensity that made the world around me disappear, brought me to the edge of my seat and invested me fully in the struggle played out on the screen. At the end the audience sat for a moment in stunned silence. I stayed longer and left with emotional embers still burning inside. <br/><br/>RR has given me a new appreciation for the craft of acting, directing and cinematography. DiCaprio and Winslet move with amazing art and skill across a vast spectrum of emotion. The mastery of lead and supporting actors, director Sam Mendes, author Richard Yates and all who worked on this film is evident in ways large and subtle giving us a glimpse into the culture of the time and the soul of two characters who were caught up in it.<br/><br/>A word of advice for those who've read the book: Don't go in expecting to see the book reproduced exactly on screen. A movie like Revolutionary Road is a work of art unto itself, yet still powerfully delivers the essential themes."
"kyle_caldwell","10","0","1","24 January 2009"," Beautiful
","Revolutionary Road has turned out to be a beautiful movie. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect. Winslet plays April Wheeler HEAD on. and DiCaprio plays Frank Wheeler HEAD on. The two fit in just like puzzle pieces, and I'd have NO problem watching the movie again. Eagerly awaiting DVD release. ALTHOUGH---- this movie is not for everyone. You have to be in the mood to enjoy what Sam Mendes brings to the screen, but all around it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful movie. It really is a triumph. I would VERY much so recommend this film to a friend. The events fit in and it's not hard to follow. Two amazing actors fit in beautifully and I'm short on words. You are left without word to describe. It's simply and truly beautiful"

","The moment I heard that Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet had another movie together last year, I was stoked to watch it. When it earned both of them Golden Globe nominations and Kate won Best Actress, the more I wanted to watch this. So was it worth all the expectations? It turns out that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable to watch, especially as a couple. I watched this by myself, and I was thinking how it would be if my wife watched it with me. It portrays the story of Frank and April Wheeler, an idealistic young couple in the 1950s who live in a nice suburban house along Revolutionary Road. It traces their gradual emotional deterioration as a couple until it reaches an inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>""Revolutionary Road"" was written by males, both the book and the script. I do not know about the book, but this movie was clearly written from the male point of view. I may sound sexist, but the character of April is so maddeningly irrational! I do not fully understand what she really wants. Though Frank is no saint himself, I empathize with the frustration of Frank as he tries to put up with the inexplicable moods of his wife.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet was predictably good in this role, which is very much reminiscent of her turn in another suburban housewife in ""Little Children"" last year. But for me, it was Leonardo di Caprio who totally succeeded in inhabiting his role of Frank. He was very good in delineating the exasperation Frank must be feeling being caught in such a depressing situation. I personally think Leo's portrayal of Frank had much more depth than Brad Pitt's Benjamin Button.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet had been quoted to say that she felt Leo di Caprio is her second husband (after director Sam Mendes) and they do look like a real married couple on screen. They really look good together there, so this makes the twisted storyline more heartbreaking to witness. I cannot believe that both of them were shut out of Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The surprise Oscar nominee that seemingly came out of nowhere was Michael Shannon as Best Supporting Actor. Shannon played John Givings, a psychiatrically-ill math genius (and son of their landlady) who seemed to be the only person who could read the true thoughts of the embattled couple. He was only in two scenes, but he made his mark despite the limited screen time.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes gives us another tragic view of suburban America as he did in his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty."" As with ""Beauty,"" someone from my background would feel that everything seems over the top and unrealistic. Is it? People do not really talk or behave that way, do they?"
"blanbrn","7","0","1","23 January 2009"," An emotional drama of life, love, showing the ups and downs of marriage proving it's a roller coaster ride.
","""Revolutionary Road"" an emotional drama and true it's not everyone's cup of tea still the film is well done and enough of an emotional drama to make it a watch for most especially married couples. Based and adapted from Richard Yates's novel director Sam Mendes takes a haunting and close look at marriage in 1950's Connecticut living the American dream in the suburbs. Meet April and Frank Wheeler(and again the chemistry between Winslet and Dicaprio is top notch maybe better than ""Titantic""). And they are the perfect young couple already with two young children. Both have unlimited promise April is an aspiring stage actress and Frank works a good job as a sales rep in the city. Both want big dreams to happen as they plan this after they move into their house on ""Revolutionary Road"". Yet as is so common with many couples they find the struggles of trust and most of all they feel trapped in a world of coded convention. Then it's the lying and the lack of faith and the behind the back cheating that surely enough leads to explosive problems for the Wheelers.<br/><br/>Yet April(in one of Kate's strongest performances)wants to start over again by leaving Connecticut for the confines of exotic Paris, France. As expected Frank's heart isn't in it and this leads to extremes especially for April as she will push herself over the edge. Overall I found this nothing great yet, it's worth a watch for the performance of Winslet especially who's very strong and a must see for Kate and Leo fans. Still most couples and especially married ones can relate well to this film as it's proves and shows married life is never easy especially when each see different paths it proves that marriage is clearly a roller coaster ride and no bed of roses."
"george.schmidt","7","0","3","23 January 2009"," Suburban rot re-examined by Mendes; good to see Leo & Kate again
","REVOLUTIONARY ROAD (2008) **1/2 Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates, Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Dylan Baker, Max Casella, Max Baker, Jay O. Sanders. Filmmaker Sam Mendes traipses once again onto the finely manicured lawns of American suburbia in this noble rot adaptation of the novel by Richard Yates  the stilted screenplay by Justin Haythe is largely to blame for the logy pacing  about a young married couple (Di Caprio & Winslet re-teaming 10 yrs. after TITANIC act as if it were only yesterday they were together they are so indelible an on screen coupling) circa 1950s who are both listless from complacency searching for something significant in their seemingly lackluster, meaningless existences. The biggest disappointment is the rather pedestrian direction by Mendes and the underlining of Everything. Has. Some. Significance. in its delivery. Ably acted, particularly Shannon in the film's true stand-out performance as a mentally unbalanced neighbor who speaks his mind damn the consequences. Too bad no one else felt that way in this production."
"PWNYCNY","10","0","2","16 January 2009"," Tour-de-force
","Move over George and Martha. Step aside Archie and Edith. Take a walk Oliver and Barbara. Here comes Frank and April. They are in the house. They have arrived and they mean business. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio give tour-de-force performances as a couple in conflict. Separately each character is likable, indeed wonderful, someone you would want to have as a friend. But together? Oh boy! Hold on to your hat because you'll be going on a ride, with a lot a bumps along the way. The director has taken what would otherwise have been little more than another hokey Hollywood potboiler and has raised it to the level of a classic. This movie is devoid of the mucky sentimentality that reduce such stories to sappy melodramas and instead deals forthrightly with the trials and tribulations associated with unmet needs. For one wants freedom and other wants security and they struggle to bridge that gulf. Ms. Winslet and Mr. DeCaprio were wonderful in Titanic. In this movie their performances are better. They're older but still retain that youthfulness which make them so appealing as actors. Also kudos to Kathryn Hahn who is one of the great comic character actresses. There is no bad guy or good guy, just people struggling to get through life and not be emotional frauds."
"fertilecelluloid","9","0","2","9 January 2009"," Like an autopsy of a relationship's corpse
","Superb drama. Solid performances from Kate Winslett, Leonardo De Caprio, and the amazing Michael Shannon (one of filmdom's brightest hopes). Finally we have an American movie that dares to be honest about our lives (hopes, realities, and disappointments). ""Revolutionary Road"" (named after the street on which the characters live) is about the consequences of the choices we make. It's like an autopsy of a relationship's corpse -- only the corpse may still be breathing. Winslett and De Caprio are a couple who have succumbed to the so-called Amereican Dream of a house in the suburbs, kids, a job in the city, the usual bull. Winslett, smelling the rot beneath the floorboards, suggests they pack up and move to Paris. At first, De Caprio is all for a change. Then, ever so gradually, he's pulled back into the maelstrom of conformity and material promise. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Justin Haythe, this raw collision of emotion remains consistent and true to its thesis. It offers no easy answers and isn't afraid to suggest that looking for answers is, in itself, problematic. Michael Shannon (so great in ""Before The Devil Knows You're Dead"") plays a mentally unpredictable man who sees the truth in what's going on between Winslett and De Caprio. The scenes where he single-handedly exposes the domestic fairytale for the crock it is are riveting and darkly funny. The end result is breathlessness. Mendes, who directed ""American Beauty"", has a talent for getting under the fascia of modern relationships. Here, he gets in there and manipulates the tissue until it bleeds. I loved every awkward moment."
