I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director.

","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.

","Schindler's List is a film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler,Ralph Fiennes as German officer Amon GÃ¶th,and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.The film was directed by Steven Spielberg which was based on the novel, Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. <br/><br/>In the movie,Schindler is a greedy German businessman.Then he becomes unlikely humanitarian amid his exposure of the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story,he managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg rose to the occasion of directing the material by making sure that people do realize the horrors that the Jews have gone through during the Holocaust.It was simply a masterpiece.The use of black and white simply with simply touches of color like the girl in dress and the light of the candle provided what powerful emotions to the viewer.<br/><br/>Evidently,the screenplay was sharply written for the movie was authentic and sincere in its presentation.The story was simply moving and uplifting when the goodness of men were shown just as it was disturbing and horrifying when graphic violence and cruelties of men towards others were displayed. <br/><br/>The performances of the actors/actresses were simply fantastic.Neeson was excellent as Schindler,Kingsley was fantastic as Stern and most of all,Fiennes was real and horrifying like Goethe.The cast weren't over- the-top nor were they created like movie characters,but they were treated in the film like human beings with both positive and negative traits. <br/><br/>Finally,I could honestly say that this is one of the greatest films ever made that could rival The Godfather.This is truly a masterpiece."

","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.<br/><br/>I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

","This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

"Docterry","Null","37","53","31 March 1999"," Emotional Release
","I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.<br/><br/>This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.<br/><br/>Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.<br/><br/>I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.<br/><br/>Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

","An incredible movie.  One thing that stands out in my mind about this classic film is the great characterization of all the players due to superb acting, directing, and scripting.  Ralph Fiennes character is especially vile but at the same time human.  He may be 95% evil but to not present a stereotypical and archetypical 100% bad character makes him infinately more realistic.  Filmed in black and white, this story certainly shows the shades of gray that is the duality of man.  This is further exemplified by Schindler's own declaration of being a bad person because he could have done more good and saved more lives."

","The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.<br/><br/>Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.<br/><br/>I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""

","The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.<br/><br/>The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film. Everyone is human in it, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

","One thing we forgot about Steven Spielberg, that no one really seems to notice.  He is the most skillful handler of gallows humor outside of Tarantino and the Coen brothers.<br/><br/>Gallows humor:  the pain of real life, happening to someone else.  Please understand, I'm not speaking of the truly horrifying scenes of massacre in this film and ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I'm talking about specific instances only.  Consider the scene in the ""...Ryan"" film where a soldier is struck in the helmet with one bullet, is amazed that he has lived, and is shot through the head after another soldier comments, ""lucky bastard.""  It has the rhythm of comedy, and we might laugh if we weren't scared stiff.  It shocks us and keeps us off-balance, which is precisely why both movies work so very well for all of their considerable running times.  They also give Spielberg license to be sentimental later on--he's EARNED his right to be sentimental in those movies.<br/><br/>The thirty-minute opening to ""...Ryan"" and many scenes in ""Schindler's List"" grip people in a very unique way, and often they can't completely describe it.  That's because they CAN'T completely sum up how they feel.  Here's what it is.  Spielberg never lets us settle down with one defense mechanism for these sequences, because when we do we let our guard down somewhere else. I can say with impunity and without exaggeration that Spielberg is the finest manipulator of movie audiences since Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" could've been just another comprehensive look at the Holocaust.  I'm not saying that that would not have been needed, but I'm very impressed that he didn't settle for ""just another.""  He's made a remarkable film memorializing the most heinous criminal act in modern times, and he made it DIFFERENT from every other movie we've ever seen.  Yes, there are influences we can catalog, and we can argue that no filmmaker has really done anything special with the cinematic art since D.W. Griffith, but that's not my point.  Spielberg has sewn in moments of grief, fear, depressing thrills, breathtaking spectacles, grotesquely brutal acts, and perfect little snippets of comedy.  The Wagner-backed helicopter raid in ""Apocalypse Now"" did that for about twenty minutes.  Spielberg has given us three gorgeous, haunting hours."

","The feelings I experienced while viewing this film are almost indescribable. I am an avid fan in World War II history but more specifically Holocaust history. It is my belief that humanity has a huge lesson to be learned from cowardly acts such as the Holocaust, and this movie has an uncanny way of helping pass the message along. This film shows human compassion even in the darkest of times. I do not think my eyes were dry at all during the movie-I found it so deeply moving.

","You might not have heard about Oscar Schindler but you will definitely want to know more about him after watching the movie. He is credited with saving the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. He was named Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli Government a few years after the end of the Second World War. Righteous among the Nations is awarded to those non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust in various ways such as providing them food or shelter, arranging escape out of Germany and German- occupied territories, etc.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is based on a 1983 novel, Schindler's Ark. It tells the story of the efforts of Oscar Schindler, a German, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Played by Liam Neeson, Oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. It takes you time to fully understand who he is. He is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. He is an opportunistic businessman. He comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. But deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when Jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand Jews. He is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. You can see this in the movie when a Jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. At first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for Jews. But you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other Jews in his frustrated voice. Later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory.<br/><br/>The movie starts with how Oscar Schindler, in the midst of the Second World War, sets up a factory manufacturing pots and pans to supply to the German army. Oscar hires a Jewish accountant to manage the factory. While the account runs the factory enormously profitably for Schindler, he hires many Jews who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. By getting German SS guards to believe that they have the important skill sets required for the factory, he cleverly sneaks many Jews out of the concentration camps.<br/><br/>As Oscar is setting up his factory, the German SS is brutally evicting all the Jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. As Oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the Jews. The atrocities that the Jews face will touch your heart. In a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by German SS guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. He tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. The fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart.<br/><br/>As the war progresses, the state of the Jews worsens. The SS plans to exterminate all the Jews and hence gradually starts moving them from labor camps to concentration camps. Oscar's pots and pans factory are not considered important enough for the war effort to continue employing the Jews anymore but he is determined to keep the Jews in his factory, by now called Schindler Jews, from the concentration camps as he devises a new plan.<br/><br/>Despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humour. As Oscar's manager is cleverly hiring Jews in the factory by keeping the SS in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. The state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. But the subtle humour in the situation is difficult to miss when Oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory.<br/><br/>Overall, Schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. The movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. It is a must-watch. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10."

","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the KrakÃ³w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""<br/><br/>It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himselfÂ and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.<br/><br/>With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of itÂ. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""<br/><br/>This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.<br/><br/>Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker Â with such adventure classics as ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm."

","I know many of you, out there will disagree with me, when I say that  Schindler's List is one of the greatest film that there has ever been.  It does sound that I'm extremely overrating it, but I truly believe  that Schindler's List is up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane I  mean everything about is so good, that its close to perfection.  The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson  as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an  Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best  actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well  that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting  Actor.  I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it  was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film  wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film  would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.  Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was  a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white  because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you  see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the  evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.  There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even  hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the  Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven  Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost  Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven  Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the  tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.  10/10 Absolutely Recommended!"

","Schindler's List is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. Personally, it is one of my favorites, as I have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. Some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality.  Not being Spielberg, I have no idea what his intentions were, but I would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of Nazi rule in Germany.  Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made.  Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous.  This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness.  It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction.  Do we really expect film to be reality?  I don't.  I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before.  Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not.  I don't want to relive the Holocaust, I consider myself quite fortunate that I have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either Stern, Goethe, or Schindler.  Instead, the Holocaust should be taught and learned about to discover more about humanity, hopefully to reach an understanding of ourselves that we can use in the future. That's what this film does; it's a work of art."
"mark.waltz","10","11","15","29 August 2014"," You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.
","History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.<br/><br/>The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.<br/><br/>I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.<br/><br/>Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy."

","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.<br/><br/>The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor.  The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men.  He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business.  But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered.  That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.<br/><br/>This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).  At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.

It is impressive to see how the sequence in which the architect dies, with a slight movement of camera, characters and staging, is putting everything in place to make you look where you should look.

I am thoroughly convinced that I will never ever forget this movie now or 50 years from now. Schindler's List is powerful in direction, hypnotic in nature, and perfect in form.

I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.<br/><br/>The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period.

"rhinocerosfive-1","7","207","400","19 November 2007"," don't take this personally
","Perhaps I should be shot, but I think four minutes of ""Springtime for Hitler"" is a more ingenious and powerful argument against anti-Semitism than four hours of ""Shoah.""<br/><br/>Many Jews attribute the resilience of their culture to a capacity for laughter in the face of catastrophe. As Saul Bellow said, ""Oppressed people tend to be witty."" Pogroms didn't start with Hitler; by the time the Spanish Inquisition burned a hundred thousand Jews, the story of Jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. Many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth: there are no Carthaginians left. There are no more Thracians to speak of. The Celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature, having been subsumed by their conquerors. Their gods are dead, and their languages, or nearly so. But the Jews thrive on. Something kept hope alive under Stalin, under Isabella, under the Caesars. A sense of humor is a great virtue, not to be undervalued.<br/><br/>But in order to make sure I appreciate the horror of the events portrayed, this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. The situations don't live as they might, because all the time I'm being flogged with message. There is no even partially redeemable Nazi in this movie, and Schindler's own late-stage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. And even melodrama need not be propaganda; Minnelli and Ray always left us with choices. But ""Schindler"" must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor, which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps.<br/><br/>The films of Bunuel and Altman are often political but rarely propagandist. The films of Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel are always propagandist and not always political, though they are of course always bad. So propaganda need not be political, and politics need not be propaganda. This shouldn't need saying, but in the modern age of American politics, it's worth remembering. I wish Steven Spielberg remembered it. <br/><br/>One can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective, a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. Propaganda is the use of art to persuade. It turns art into an expository essay. Propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form, limited by its very agenda. The tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter; the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. So I think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin, an overkill on the negative. I am not heartless; I hate hate as much as anybody, and I celebrate Jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. But is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours? <br/><br/>The fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. There is a decision made about every angle; literally, the perspective is chosen for the viewer. This is not the case with other arts, with musical performance, acting, writing, sculpture; but the more visual the medium, the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. It takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth, into a question rather than an answer.<br/><br/>You can make propaganda about love, like ""Love Story"" or ""English Patient""; you can make propaganda out of character, like ""Patton"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flag-waving and hate-mongering - what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. At its best, propaganda can remind us of our values, of our responsibilities, of our mythologies and potentials; and so it can be a great good. At its worst, propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium - it may be bland, dull, predictable. When it is these things, it is not very persuasive, and so it fails at its main intent.<br/><br/>In this light, ""Schindler's List"" is maybe the second-best type of propaganda. It has real emotion, a compelling story, myriad technical virtues; it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it, but of course I agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. The movie moves me to an extent. But it lacks comedy, the propagandist's most effective tool; and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity, it tells a half-truth. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays an excellent cad, and Ralph Fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. (It is among the many faults of the ""Harry Potter"" movies that they cut off his nose.) But I prefer ""The Pianist"" as a portrait of Nazi-occupied Poland. Aside from possessing greater artistic powers than Spielberg, Roman Polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. He does not preach, and he is not strident, and he is not sentimental. And he allows Adrien Brody to make me laugh occasionally, not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. Shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling; it is a view to a more realized universe. ""Jaws"" has it. ""E.T."" has it. But Spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the Holocaust would be in bad taste. <br/><br/>As far as propagandist filmmakers go, I'll take Charlie Chaplin or Paul Verhoeven. They are at least funny; the pill of ""Great Dictator"" or ""Starship Troopers"" goes down more easily, more persuasively, therefore more effectively, than the pill of ""Schindler"" or ""Private Ryan."""

","It's September, 1939. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler is a Nazi-Catholic industrialist from Czechoslovakia, a bon-vivant who realizes that a nice long war in Europe might be an excellent situation for making money... So in a great opening parallel montage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race...<br/><br/>As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to Schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of Poland's medieval cities...<br/><br/>Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them with food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi officials...<br/><br/>The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and offers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's expertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the presentation...<br/><br/>In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced...<br/><br/>Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business... Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.' <br/><br/>Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical historians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that ""People die - it's a fact of life.""<br/><br/>Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His character is always evolving, yet always convincing... His transformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately slow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching scenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers...<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also Schindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in a touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice Macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving Jews from the veranda of his high villa...<br/><br/>Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him...<br/><br/>Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear...<br/><br/>The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers...<br/><br/>Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to Auschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic...<br/><br/>'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential.""<br/><br/>Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home).<br/><br/>'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz Kaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color reminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone...<br/><br/>Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins the Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside... <br/><br/>'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role in adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. He makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of Oskar Schindler..."

As long as the Jews stay out of those camps Schindler makes money.<br/><br/>*Review: Schindler's List is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen and ever made. What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art. In one word I can describe this movie ""MASTERPIECE"". This is probably one of Spielberg's best movies he has directed.

","This isn't much I can add to what hasn't been said or written some dozen years after this was released. It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly is and that's enough. The little details don't matter.<br/><br/>This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain. He's downright scary and one of the most rotten, despicable human beings ever put on film....but that was the intent. I don't know if his character (or lack of it) was exaggerated since this was made by a famous Jewish filmmaker (Steven Spielberg) who has made the Nazis look as bad as possible in a number of his movie (not that they don't deserve it!). Nonetheless, Fiennes' portrayal of ""Amon Goeth"" is one you'll remember. You'll want to punch this idiot right in the nose.<br/><br/>Neeson, in the title role as ""Oskar Schlinder,"" is intriguing as the industrialist who slowly sees immoral things happening that the become too repulsive for him to support. For much of the film, he still isn't a ""good guy"" but he certainly comes around and becomes a hero in the end. Neeson's scene near the conclusion when ""Schindler"" parts with ""his"" Jews at the end of the war is extremely moving. It brings tears to my eyes every time. When he agonizes that ""I could have done more,"" it is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunted me after each viewing.<br/><br/>In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. (i.e. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Ed Wood,"" etc.) The camera-work helped draw me back to several viewings.<br/><br/>A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing, scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing scenes. <br/><br/>It should be seen at least once, though, by everyone."

And after watching this film, I have deep respect and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would not have done it justice.<br/><br/>The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.<br/><br/>Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening protrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many favs!"

","Surely and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time. Steven Spielberg's greatest, no other film has depicted the suffering of the Holocaust so hauntingly vivid and realistic. Despite the horrors we all know took place, Spielberg is relentless with the graphic images we see, only furthered y the black-and-white visuals. The evil, sadistic nature of the Nazi cult is shown without refrain. What I particularly liked about this film was how it showed the degenerative effect of murder on a man's sanity, personified best by Amon Goeth, who was played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, becomes a truly inhuman monster.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's greatest role that he has ever played. He is debonair as Oskar Schindler, yet riddled with grief and guilt as the film goes on. Human geed becomes human compassion, as a ray of light against the black darkness of the Nazi hearts. And Ben Kingsley was just marvelous as Stern.And John Williams scored the film beautifully. There is not an easily recognizable leitmotif style he uses here. The music is used only here and there, to capture the realism but when you hear it you know only Williams could be behind such a radiant and somber score.<br/><br/>As I said before easily the best movie of all time."

","Schindler's List is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally and on a true story about a German factory worker, Oskar Schindler, who is a member of the Nazi party and due to his decreasing number of employees, employs the Jewish residents in his factory. Schindler's List explores the true dark side of the Second World War. Unlike most World War Two based movies, Schindler's List is based on the Holocaust; the cruelty of the Jews during the period. The film is also a history lesson; it explores all the years of the war; starting from 1939, the start of the war, to the very end, although the main focus is Oskar Schindler whose actor is Liam Neeson (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, A-Team movie). The character, not only is represented as a womanizer and laid-back, but he is obviously the odd one out; he does not see the Jews as bad people unlike the other Nazis and because it is his job to employ factory workers, cannot resist temptation in saving the Jews from the camps, where the Jews are imprisoned. This shows the message that working on the evil side is the only way to rescue innocent people, which is what would have occurred during a brutal era like World War Two. This is why the film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Picture. John Williams' incredible score links very well with the German Jewish culture, but also represents sadness and bleakness in the story, because it tempts the viewers to feel sympathy for the Jews. The black and white tone also suggests the darkness of the story, but also links with the 1940s setting when most films used the colour tone. Even if it looks older than other nineties movies, Schindler's List was definitely a modern film; for one reason, the film combines black and white with colour; the first shot consisting of a group of Jews paying respects to Oskar Schindler is filmed using colour and the viewer will easily spot a tiny amount of colour during one of the crowd scenes. Another reason is due to the following actors in the film; Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Thunderbirds movie) who plays Ishaak Stern, Ralph Fiennes (Wallace & Gromit In The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit) as Amon Goth and Caroline Goodall (Hook) the actress of Emilie Schindler. Schindler's List was directed by Steven Spielberg who won an Oscar for Best Director and is considered one of his best works ever. It proves that Steven does not just direct thrilling adventure movies!"

","When I first saw that Spielberg was behind the movie, I had my doubts since his earlier work doesn't really fall into this category, but I held faith and I have not been disappointed! From the beginning it is such a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more then once. It is completely set in Black & White, except for the Red Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time period it was portrayed in.<br/><br/>The Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra seemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles, especially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon Goeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with it. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the best thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people throughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.<br/><br/>It's a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent Film!"

This was one of those movies.<br/><br/>The great thing about this film, is that it, for me, builds up a very heavy mood, so every scene is affected by this mood and becomes even better. Take one of the last scenes, the one where Amon Goeth ( Ralph Fiennes ) is hung. Any other hanging scene with a ton of blood and eyes popping out, wouldn't have been as gripping, but because we ""know"" this guy, know that he's queasy, vain, malevolent and totally bungled, know that he is robbed of his uniform and swastika badge, standing alone on a scaffold in a creepily defiant attempt to smack his Hitler-hairdo back into place, we see that he is still as weak, ignorant, hypocritical and pathetic as always. He is basically the German Jeffrey Dahmer, and for me that moment is a marvel in editing, and it is first time that a scene has nearly made me retch.<br/><br/>Schindler's List has been accused of playing too much on peoples emotions instead of telling a ""true story"".

","Schindler's List both conveys the horrors of the Holocaust and depicts the life of unlikely hero Oskar Schindler, a German businessman (and member of the Nazi Party), who begins to sympathize with the Jews when he realizes the true scope of their suffering and ultimately saves 1100 of them from Auschwitz.  Liam Neeson plays Schindler excellently, and Ralph Fiennes is just as good as the vile Nazi Goeth.  With a movie that so graphically (occasionally almost to an unwatchable extent) portrays the Holocaust and the unspeakable crimes of the Nazis, it was nice that it had the character of Herr Schindler to show that not all Germans were in support of this and that some Germans went against the Nazis and saved lives, a fact that is rarely mentioned in Holocaust films or anywhere else.  I'm not sure if ""enjoyed"" is the right word, but I'm certainly glad I saw this important piece of cinema."

","Schindler's List is a great drama about the holocaust. It is both well written and directed. I haven't read the book or done much research. However it does tell a touching story of a man trying to save life in a very dark time in history. Steven Spielberg did an incredible job directing. There was so much detail in each scene. I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen.

"sol-","Null","222","441","8 January 2005"," My brief review of the film
","The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age."

","First I have to say that being born in Poland, I knew about holocaust since before I was 10. I guess only in Israel people are more aware of it. It is a very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting, memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of the greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more than just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.<br/><br/>Many will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about the way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful antisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know any better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber scene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called ""shower room"" would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself as a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all. To sum it off - If you didn't see this movie, go see it.<br/><br/>But don't stop there, find some real live accounts of holocaust survivors."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>For some strange reason I find it difficult to talk about `Schindler's List', which is strange as I could talk for hours about any other Spielberg film. Stranger still considering the immense acclaim and debate surrounding the film. Perhaps it's because `Schindler's List' is a film that reaches beyond the limitations of its celluloid to become a cultural and historical institution. Perhaps it's because the film is so perfectly mounted that it is hard to zoom in on a select number of topics. Or perhaps it is simply because I can not fathom the impact `Schindler's List' had on me.<br/><br/>
I disdain the aura surrounding this film. I disdained watching my parents viewing this film simply because they heard it was `important' to do so. Yes, the film is important and yes, everyone should see it. But no one should view this film based in the mindset that they are doing so only because of its subject matter. It destroys the cinematic experience. It destroys objective thought. And it blinds people from what Spielberg is trying to say with this film. `Schindler's List' has been labelled a Holocaust film. However, I do not see it this way. I see the Holocaust as merely a backdrop for a morality play Â which `Schindler's List' is.<br/><br/>
Spielberg films have often been criticised for their supposed black/white characters. The good guys and the bad guys. In `Schindler's List' Spielberg has blurred the lines more than he ever has done. Our title hero is a womanising adulterer whose prime goal is to make money Â exploiting his workers to do so. He doesn't hire Jews because of sympathy. He hires them because they are cheap and expendable. There is a scene between Schindler and Goeth Â it's one of their first meetings. They sit and drink, they casually talk about business and the war like one would talk about sport or the weather. In this scene we see how alike our hero and villain are. We see that Schindler is only a step left to Goeth's path and Goeth a step right to Schindler's. Later on in the film we see two pivotal scenes that keep each on their own path. After flaunting his new found sympathising routine, Goeth looks in the mirror and sees the man he really is. He then shoots the boy he pardoned mere moments before. Similarly, Schindler looks out a window before deciding how his fortune should be spent. Both have `power' as Schindler defines it, both use it in different ways. <br/><br/>The film itself is an awe-inspiring goliath of cinematic perfection. It seems Spielberg has studied the master of the epic Â David Lean Â well. The film is over three hours, yet it is never boring. The film is as absorbing as any you care to mention. Not one frame is wasted. The film is shot in black and white by Janusz Kaminski and is proof, if nothing else that black and white films should still be consistently made. The film is beautiful. No matter how harrowing the subject matter may be, it seems impossible for Spielberg to frame an ugly shot. Backlights, shadows and smoke are all used magnificently to create atmosphere. One of the most controversial aspects of the film has been the use of colour Â specifically the red coat used to highlight a girl Schindler watches during the Liquidation of Krakow. This is not Spielberg being pretentious. This is not Spielberg trying to pull the heartstrings. This is Spielberg's spin on the old saying, `One death is a tragedy. One thousand is a statistic'. During the most horrific of genocides, the individual must not be forgotten. <br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley give career bests. Neeson is able to evoke the multiple facets of Schindler with merely a smile, a laugh or a wink. We are never certain what is on Schindler's mind nor his motives or reasons for his actions until their affects have taken place. His performance is similar to Kevin Spacey's in `The Usual Suspects' which both require repeated viewings to fully appreciate. Fiennes is his direct opposite. What you see is what you get. His performance is in-your-face and visceral. Yet, despite his evil, Fiennes is able to evoke a certain likeability about Goeth and when he is executed at the end I actually felt some sympathy for him. Kingsley again shows that he can perfect any ethnicity by playing Schindler's Jewish accountant Stern. He is the voice of reason and solemn dignity in the film. They are all so brilliant it is impossible to pick a best actor from this film. In fact the strongest compliment I can pay to any of them is that no one attempts to steal the show. It is clear that everyone involved in the film are working uniformly to make it as good as possible. John Williams is also on top of his game Â the violin and piano solos of the main theme are both hauntingly beautifully and heartbreaking. <br/><br/>Many have criticised the film for bowing to Spielberg sentimentality when Schindler breaks down at the end. People say it would have been uncharacteristic for Schindler to do so. I consider this to be tripe. Schindler has completed his arc. He has gone from a shameless money grabber to a man who would give anything to save another life. He has learned the price of human life and so have we. It is neither the price of a car nor the price of a gold badge. It is priceless. At the end of the film we learn there are 6,000 descendants of Schindler Jews. This means that for every life Schindler saved, five more lived.  ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" `Schindler's List' is not a film about the horror of war. It is a film about the beauty of the human spirit. The film is timeless. It is a masterpiece of cinema."

The black and white felt like all that old concentration camp footage we have seen over the years giving it that realism that made it even more uncomfortable too watch. <br/><br/>Fiennes performance was dynamic from monster to person to monster. it makes us wonder how people can become this way.

He bribes officials and befriends Nazis including evil camp commandant, Goeth, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Spielberg has cleverly juxtaposed Goeth and Schindler as two sides of the same coin. They both love the finer things in life, easily swayed by money and women. Playing on this, Schindler tries to show his contemporary that power can be better served by sparing people's lives rather than taking them. It is an idea that Goeth acknowledges, but is destined not to adhere to for long.<br/><br/>The film finishes on a powerful note in present day with the real Schindler survivors and their descendants visiting his grave.

I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds.

Without any music to go along with it, nor any sort of cinematic effects has amplified the effect of horror and grieve. Spielberg was simply just let the event speaks for itself when the genocide occurred right in front of the eye of the audience. The picture was utterly disturbing which also vividly portray the shockingly cold scenes of the history. People being executed like a stack of meat like they were inanimate objects.<br/><br/>One of the conversation between the protagonist Liam Neeson and the antagonist Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes was particularly impressive. It's left us questions regard to the differentiation between justice and power. In the film, Schindler said ""Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't."" He then proposed hypothetically what power truly means, when a man who has committed a crime was brought and interrogated by the emperor for his crime, then begged for mercy. The emperor had power over the criminal for the act and this is what Schindler thought was the true meaning of power. Conversely, the concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth was merely executing Jews under the cause of justice.<br/><br/>Towards the ending of the film was immensely moving.When Schindler told the cold-blooded officers to return their home and their family after they had been following their orders to carried out such dehumanized acts.It's delivered us a message that people have multiple roles and behave differently under different circumstances. The change has occurred to Neeson's role is not something that I envisaged. After the war was finally called to an end, he thought he could have salvaged more refugee undercover by his factory.

","Schindler's List is the kind of once-in-a-generation film that comes along and earns truly universal acclaim. The tale of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saves well over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. Approaching its 20th anniversary, Universal Sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity.<br/><br/>Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a Nazi second. In the throes of WWII, he sees opportunity in hiring Jewish POWs to work in his enamel factory. With the help of trustworthy accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the Jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. Naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking German officers, including the sadistic Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>The legacy of Schindler's List stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. The film took home seven Oscars at the 1994 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while Neeson and Fiennes were bested in the Acting categories by Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) respectively. Today, Schindler and Goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career. <br/><br/>The Blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. It is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. The update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to Bach and the first glimpse of Auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. The famous Girl in Red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative.<br/><br/>For such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of Spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. The film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. As he did with more contemporary histo-drama Lincoln, Spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any A-list director ever.<br/><br/>The end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. Schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the Benjamins- or in this case, the Reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. Likewise, Goeth, the man who kills Jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his Jewish maid. <br/><br/>Kingsley's Stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for Schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted. <br/><br/>It is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. Appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which Spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects. <br/><br/>The Blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including Voices from the List, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'Schindler Jews' who survived the Holocaust, as well as a story on Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation. <br/><br/>The intentions of Universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. However, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through Spielberg's screenings of Seinfeld and Robin Williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of Fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real Goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

","The Greatest masterpiece of veteran director Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List is an emotional and harrowing account of the Holocaust during the Second World War. The movie delves deep into the darkness of human heart and depicts the metamorphosis of a shrewd businessman and womanizer into the greatest philanthropists humanity has ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie is almost entirely shot in black and white which gives it a grim and timeless look, a remarkable effort by the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler has given his career best performance for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Ben Kingsley has also stood well with him in his role of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. However, it is Ralph Fiennes who has stood apart in his portrayal of Amon Goeth, a sociopath Nazi officer without a moral code. Unfortunately, he did not win a well deserved Academy Award for supporting actor.<br/><br/>Furthermore, John Williams has come up with a brilliant score bringing out the misery, horror and tragedy of the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is Spielberg's unforgettable piece of art that makes one cry many times over, especially in the final moments of the three hour seventeen minute epic. Its a must watch."

","I feel really goofy trying to write anything about this film. It's all been said on this site and most of it is true.<br/><br/>The first thing to underline is that Ralph F. should have won best supporting actor in a supporting role. I was so stunned that he did not. He is so good that for months I didn't know he wasn't German. And his character is truly vile. Read up on the real Amon Goeth and you will see what an evil man he portrayed. He probably didn't care, but good golly.<br/><br/>Secondly, having dated an observant Jew for a long time, I can attest to the Talmud quotation. My boyfriend believed and lived that precept.<br/><br/>No, this film is not earth-shaking, but once you see it, please remember that some of the people who made the film with Spielberg were, themselves, survivors. If you remember that Oscar ceremony, you might remember that one man got up to accept the award and gave the numbers that he had tattooed on his arm. It really happened!"
"TheFilmFanatic1","10","28","47","14 January 2013"," The best film I have ever seen
","I have to admit, I'm a bit of a history geek. I love Historical movies and Schindler's list is not only the best historical movie I've ever seen, but one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is the best Liam Neeson movie and he, paired with the tremendous Ralph Fiennes as Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth respectively, lead the line in what is a superb cast. Ben Kingsley is superb in his supporting role as Itzhak Stern. However, at the helm of this movie, is the almost immortal Steven Spielberg who utilises his directorial skills to create an atmosphere that makes you feel as if you're right there at that moment. The movie is jam-packed with symbolism, particularly the use of the girl in the red coat. For me, there is no other war movie that portrays the struggle of the Jews as effectively as this one. One thing separates this from every other war movie, the decision to film it in black and white. This Black and White tone creates an automatically dull tone for the movie, but it also helps to create an historical tone, almost as if you are actually in the 1940's. To conclude, everything about this movie is perfect, the actors, directors and overall tone of the movie. It is a film that will, and I repeat just to emphasise, will stand the test of time. People will look at this movie in years to come, and they shall know not only the brilliance of the movie, but how Oskar Schindler helped to save all of those people during the war."
"tooraj-jamal","10","28","47","30 November 2012"," Summary of others reviews in my opinion
","1. Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the KrakÃ³w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""<br/><br/>2. It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himselfÂ and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.<br/><br/>3. Film's sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.<br/><br/>4. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black- white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.<br/><br/>5. This movie is more than just something for us to watch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget, to teach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along with those who tried to help those same people survive.<br/><br/>6. ""I... pardon you."" These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and forgiveness.<br/><br/>7. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of itÂ. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""<br/><br/>8. Schindler's List is the idea of a perfect Film. Something with as strong a message as it may speak out to us and truly touch us is outstanding. The acting is flawless, and the direction is breathtaking. The one film everyone needs to see before they die."
"ShibanPD","Null","28","47","12 November 2012"," Schindler's List
","Steven Spielberg's meticulous, passionate direction; John Williams' haunting, uplifting score, highlighted by violin solos by Itzhak Perlman; Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white photography; Steven Zaillian's award-winning screenplay; and the acting brilliance of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes coalesce to render, ironically, one of the most beautiful films ever made, based on actual events that took place during one of the ugliest chapters in modern history. Neeson's screen presence as Oskar Schindler, the unlikely savior of hundreds of Polish Jews during the Holocaust, is commanding and magnetic. Kingsley's performance as Schindler's accountant and eventual friend is neurotic and tender. Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, a cold, sadistic Nazi officer, with startling range and subtlety. Williams' score and Spielberg's camera are characters in their own right, narrating and observing with unnerving honesty and pathos. From the perspective of the captive Jews and their plight, Schindler's List is frightening beyond imagination, thrilling, and unbearably sad. From Schindler's perspective, the initial prospect of profiting from a slave-wage workforce and an economic climate that only war could engender is opportunistically exciting. But when the plan changes from profit to protection, the excitement takes on a different form, as Schindler faces the danger of the Nazis discovering his altruistic motives at every turn. From the perspective of the Nazis, the unconstrained license to kill, at justifiably remorseless will, is liberating. Murder is easy, especially when the victims have been dehumanized in a much more savage way than any real wartime enemy. In one scene, a Nazi is firing rounds into a burning hill of murdered Jews, and he is screaming jubilantly and laughing. In another, Amon Goeth picks off random workers from his bird's eye ""villa"" as if he is shooting at clay pigeons. It's target practice; it's a free game, a joke. That feeling of irresponsible liberation is eventually supplanted by true liberation as the clandestinely moral acts of Oskar Schindler overtake the immorality of the Nazis and as Schindler assumes the weighty responsibility for more and more human lives. Schindler's List is not a movie about the Holocaust, any more than it is a movie about World War II. It is about a manâa magnanimous profiteerâliving in a time and place of unspeakable acts. It's about a forbidden friendship that flourishes amidst the failure of humanity and the prevalence of hatred. And it's about the hope forânot the triumph ofâGood over Evil."

","Although there are a lot of harrowing images in this excellent movie, I have a feeling no film has ever really shown the true graphic horrors of the death camps. I am sure that movie...will be made someday. There so many Jewish people being murdered in this fine motion picture, but,...in the end it is about a brave man being totally psychologically transformed. Months of seeing human beings being brutalized and getting to know them (his factory used the Jews as cheap labor) as individuals, made Nazi Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) change dramatically. This is not the usual Steven Spielberg fare. He directs this with a deft touch. The holocaust should NEVER be forgotten...and man should have learned from it. Unfortunately since this catastrophic human disaster there have been more cases of ""ethnic cleansing"". ""When will we ever learn ?"""

"mi286","8","28","47","28 December 2010"," The possibility that one simple idea can change your life and the lives around you.
","The connection between the people in the film and the audience is almost incomparable with any other film. Even the people who are not regulars, you feel that you know who they are, that you've experienced what they have been through but also realising that how bad this film portrays the war the experience of the Jews will never be displayed to its full effect on the people involved. Spanning through the workers at the end brings to light what a good job Spielberg has done with this connection.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film has more in common with inception then any other . in that there is the possibility that one simple idea can change your life and the lives around you. In the case of Schindler it was the red coat of the young girl who provoked an idea to grow and i believe this is the reason for this film to be black and white. To make sure the audience got the poignancy of that scene, that something so beautiful cannot help but stand out against the rest of the world and effect the people involve more so.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes brings a brilliant typically perceived German into the picture, ruthless and cold blooded in the way he unnecessarily kills the workers for fun almost but eventually shows heart. One of the hardest rolls in the film well played.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is perfect as you feel that it has already climaxed with 20 minutes to go and in ways of personal actions changing the storyline drastically it has but in drama it has certainly not . An unbelievable performance by Liam Neeson in its last moments is what pushes this film to 10/10"
"roryboo","10","28","47","20 August 2010"," Schindler's List
","I've been aware of the film for a long while and watched it somewhere in June this year. So it took me no less than two months to think the thing over and compose this review.<br/><br/>A lot is quite certain about SL - for example, it's an exceedingly good movie, well-made and harmonious. There are people saying that Spielberg is a professional, he knows how to influence his audience, that's why you like his movies. I can't say whether it's true or not, since the only other Spielberg movie I've seen is one of the films about Indiana Jones and it's impossible to compare these two genres. So I just enjoyed (as much as it's possible to enjoy a movie about the Holocaust) the film; it didn't seem repulsive to me or too distressing - it didn't even make me cry. I thought the topic to be well-told, all major parts wonderfully performed and the right conclusions made in the end.<br/><br/>But 'something was missing', as Schindler himself says in one of the episodes - though in this case it's neither war nor luck. Something that stayed my hand when it moved to give SL 10/10 on IMDb. Something that made me re-watch the film and separate episodes all over again. Something that excludes all possibility of blind, excited praise-singing.<br/><br/>Later I gave SL 10 points nonetheless but only because in me it evoked an interest in the Holocaust, WWII and everything connected with them. I no longer tried to avoid this subject and understood that without any knowledge about this dreadful catastrophe there's no understanding of History. That's all very well but it doesn't free SL of certain drawbacks.<br/><br/>Generally, they all are about character study. With Oscar Schindler it's OK. It's a Nazi that shifts from blind money-making and using cheap labor of the Jews to the true understanding of the situation, to compassion and at last to saving over 1000 human beings from certain and cruel death. Liam Neeson's performance was good though not exceptional (there's Ralph Fiennes to compare him with). We see what he was at the beginning - through his manners, style, conversation. He changes gradually, and it's not true with Goeth. What a shame - such amazing a performance and such shallow a look at human psychology. Yesterday Goeth shot people from his balcony without breaking a sweat, today he decides to become 'a good emperor' and pardons everybody he happens to meet. Then, he looks at his nails and all of a sudden he's the main villain again. I love this scene though - the look in Goeth's eyes changes dramatically and betrays his true nature at once - that's more than professional acting. But all the same such a quick and shallow change couldn't befall a personality like this.<br/><br/>That's what concerns the main counterparts of SL - Schindler and Goeth. They represent two chief lines of behavior and world-view in the movie. They are friends and enemies at the same time. One is the savior, the other is the torturer. One is capable of compassion and understanding, the other does his bloody duty without questions and his sole attempt to act otherwise is a failure. But who are they saving and killing? To whom the movie is dedicated? <br/><br/>Where are the Jews? <br/><br/>You can say - here they are, Stern, Helen Hirsch, Poldek and Mila, the Rosners, the Dresners... Yes, they are here, all of them with their own names and destinies - but at the same moment they are absent. No Jew could become a main character in a movie about Oscar Schindler, for the latter would overshadow him; there had to be a good Nazi and a bad Nazi and a humble mass of people they are struggling over. But who if not a Jew should be the main hero of a Holocaust movie? You can say - what about Stern? Isn't he the third point of view, the third power, so to speak, equal to those of Schindler's and Goeth's? Well, he's surely a very significant character, but he is not shown and told about as deliberately as Schindler, for instance. Izhak Stern is not much looked into. The viewer can't penetrate into his inner nature and personal life. He's just the chief representative of the Jews, who - especially nearer to the end of the movie - become just examples, not characters, even Helen Hirsch. While Stern is reserved and strong, Helen is weak and tortured but that's all we can say about her. If the film had been based upon the opposition Goeth-Helen there would have been the possibility of telling about what were her losses, what were her hopes and and thoughts. Unfortunately or not, that's not the case. Helen too remains an example.<br/><br/>The main hero is Schindler and this determines the specificity of the film. This also makes the phrase 'In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered' a bit illogical. It is clear that the line should be 'In memory of Oscar Schindler, a Nazy who found strength and will to oppose the killings and saved more than one thousand Jews'. That would've been more appropriate."
"Rectangular_businessman","10","28","47","18 June 2010"," A masterpiece
","Without a doubt the best movie about the holocaust ever made. Spielberg's vivid picture of the horrors of Hitler's Germany is so affecting and honest, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. Ralph Fiennes creates one of the most convincing villains of all-time in his depiction of Amon GÃ¶th. Beautifully filmed,written and acted, it's a film that will be watched for years to come, not just as entertainment, but as a legitimate historical document as well. This is not overrated at all: It deserves all the praise that it receives, because it's one of the best films ever made and it is easily the best movie from Steven Spielberg, which is a great filmmaker."

","Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.<br/><br/>He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg."

","As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour.  However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.<br/><br/>Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.<br/><br/>The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.<br/><br/>Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras Â if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.<br/><br/>Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.  A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in.  Difficult to watch but worth the effort."

","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.<br/><br/>The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.<br/><br/>This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).

","When looking at a black and white movie since the beginning till you see that there is a little girl out there in the chaotic cold miserable wartime wearing a Red Dress, the movie turns into perfectness. I think the movie is brilliant. The military tyrant character is amazingly played. The role of the main character -Schindler- was somewhat weak at the end yet it was well-played too.<br/><br/>Generally, the movie succeeded in driving me through imagining the horrors of WWII, specially those unspeakable sufferings caused by the holocaust. A very good watch that could capture these moments when the war reveals how chaotic and deadly it is, how less it cares about the weak, and how random death can be. <br/><br/>The main line was about a young ambitious businessman, Schindler (Liam Neeson), who tries to make use of Jewish victims of war, those who were fleeing from the holocaust just to fall under the control of greedy Schindler. Then at some point, Schindler changes dramatically, when he witnesses the real suffer of Jewish under Hitler's war, from an ideal natzy narcissist, into a human being. Schindler's change process is lengthy, shaped by death camps controlled by a military tyrant,Commander Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) . So he creates a list of names of Jewish workers to be saved, and pays off everyone he could to do so. Sometimes he risks his own life for that purpose. Finally he succeeds in saving hundreds of innocent people. Shortly after then, the war ends, and those who were saved by Schindler return the favor, and save Schindler from being killed by allies forces. <br/><br/>Although the movie looks filled with sad, dark ideas, yet I'd watch the movie again because it made me think a lot about those real people who had suffered the holocaust and the consequences of WWII, deep thoughts developed by the brilliancy of acting, directing and writing."

","Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list.  It is also his most personal work to say the least.  And what he brings to the screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.<br/><br/>The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them. The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander.  Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever.  Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made."

"t-viktor212","9","49","88","24 September 2017"," The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general
","The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. <br/><br/>The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);<br/><br/>1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.<br/><br/>2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e LealtÃ "", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. <br/><br/>3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. <br/><br/>4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.<br/><br/>5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. <br/><br/>Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that."

","Actually I had watched this film 13-14 years ago. But that time I got pretty distracted and couldn't grasp much of the film. After watching it again, I must say it's a remarkable film which comes once in a while. Based on the true events of the holocaust, the film is like a well written book which can serve as a quality time to anyone striving for a brilliant work of art.<br/><br/>Well, many nice films have been made on Jews concentration camps like ""Life Is Beautiful,"" ""The Pianist,"" or the most recent ""The Boys on Striped Pyjamas."" Indeed all the movies were brilliant, but they saw holocaust through individual character. But ""Schindler's List"" gives a holistic account of the history for which the film stretches for over 3 hours and uses monochromatic colors to give the periodic feel. Despite the over-length, every scene of the film remains compulsively watchable till the end credits. Every scene presents a cinematic excellence in depicting the story of a greedy industrialist who saves over 1100 Jews from the concentration camps. His uplift of the spirit from greed to human compassion, seeing the atrocities of Nazis, is brilliantly realized. <br/><br/>The bloodshed in the film starts with a single execution which slowly shifts to mass killings during the liquidation of ghettos showing the brutality done to humankind, which just leaves you horrified. The grit and the depressing environment the film creates is pretty touching and many moments of the film raises the feelings of humanity for which the film becomes a well felt heart touching saga. For focusing the story. the film keeps a low profile with much unknown cast and avoids sentimentality and gloss till the very end. Overall, the film remains a landmark for the ages to come; and it deserves to be archived as one of the immortal film makings of all time.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars out of 4"

","This is perhaps the only film that I feel compelled to review. Take the first two Godfather films, I prefer them over Schindler's List slightly, yet I did not feel the need to write a review for them. But this, I just feel I HAD to do it.<br/><br/>This film is not just a film, it's an experience. Each time I watch it, I feel like I'm actually there. Something about the film does that, the use of black and white works perfectly. Not only does it bring out the horrors of the holocaust and make it scarier, but the soundtrack fits perfectly too. The film is probably the most accurate depiction of the holocaust, ever to grace the silver-screen.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, there is no over-acting at all. The first 30 minutes are perhaps slow, but as the movie progresses you feel the pain of the Jews. The soundtrack at times it haunting, but also hopeful.<br/><br/>The film is inspiring and carries a message of hope and redemption. It sure did make me cry.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a master of story-telling, with strong narrative and a beautiful soundtrack, it never get's old. To this day, 20 years later it still remains one of the greatest films of all time, but also Steven Spielberg's finest work."
"ChristianUnchained","Null","29","49","23 April 2013"," Hard to watch, impossible to forget
","This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today. <br/><br/>Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.<br/><br/>The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).<br/><br/>Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.<br/><br/>I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtedly remain a classic for ages to come.<br/><br/>Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw. The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV."

","Known to all audiences as one of the greatest movies ever made, ""Schindler's List"" is biographical drama of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jews during the Holocaust, and employing them in his factories. This could affect the lives of many Jews during this terrible event in history. With a 3-hour running time, a marvelous script, and a breathtaking directing duty from the legendary Steven Spielberg, ""Schindler's List"" is one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. Liam Neeson delivers his best performance as Oskar Schindler, and this guy really brings truth and charm to his character, and it lets you see that he has transformed into this iconic figure. Ralph Fiennes portrays a scene-stealing performance as SS-officer Amon Goth, with a cruel villainy to his character that is just awesome to watch on screen. Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and Caroline Goodall round up the supporting cast, and they all create a powerful casting ensemble. Director Steven Spielberg succeeds once again, directing such a fine masterpiece, that led him to two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. This film may be lacking for the first couple of hours, but it does not change the fact that this movie is a sensational piece of work. Some moments make you furious, some moments make you cry, and this is the type of movie that you are going to feel bad about, but you'll still enjoy it. The art direction is sensational, the editing is superb, the cinematography is just masterful, and John Williams' score is completely breathtaking. But it's Spielberg himself that guides this movie. His directing has made a big impact on the face of cinema, and he improves once again, making one of the greatest films he has ever made. This movie is dramatic and heartbreaking, but this also a challenging and emotionally moving motion picture, and Spielberg never disappoints. ""Schindler's List"", in my review, ""an epic and heartbreaking Spielberg masterpiece""."

","""Schindler's List"" is the kind of movie that, because of its historical accuracy, could be used as a documentary. But it also gives us a deep story, and a performance by Liam Neeson, that is among the best of all time.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a vain, glorious and greedy German businessman who becomes unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has a technical talent like no one else has. His frames are so elegant and objective, that you know what is going on, and where (in the last battle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" you can notice this qualities better), which makes us feel that we are living the movie. The massacres and killing scenes are distressing, because it looks like it's happening to you. And the idea of making this movie black and white gives a tone of reality, that looks like the movie was shot during WWII.<br/><br/>The plot, beyond giving us a history lesson, shows the amazing story of Orkar Schindler, whose personality and turns are probably the best thing in the movie, and powered by Liam Neeson's incredible and contained performance, that is just one of the best. And other great characters, Ben Kingsley as Stern, as the smart, but quiet Jew, Fiennes as Goeth, the obsessed with power German (Although I thought it was exaggerated sometimes, like when he wakes up, and shoot Jews with a rifle, just for fun). And the construction of the characters is very well made, which makes the ending even more powerful, being one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Verdict: Probably Spieberg's best work, with a moving and accurate story, and a mesmerizing performance by Liam Neeson, this movie is simply, one of the best."

","Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film "" Schinder's List "", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****"
"jzappa","10","30","51","5 August 2008"," One of the All-Time Quintessential American Films
","Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.<br/><br/>Schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense."
"freemantle_uk","10","30","51","13 March 2008"," My Favourite Film
","Schindler's List is my favourite film of all time. The film is based on the novel Schindler's Ark, which itself was based on the life of Oscar Schindler who saved over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Oscar Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, and his performance was excellent. The shows that Schindler himself was faulted character himself, he was a member of the Nazi, he was a war-profiteer, a womaniser and bribed officials. He did however have a sense of humanity and could not allow innocent people die. He uses his influence and money to save them and has to battle Nazi officials to do this. Ralph Fiennes was also performed brilliantly as Amon Goth, a senior Nazi who was sent to help organisation the Final Solution. Goth was portrayed a Sadistic murderer who enjoyed randomly killing Jews and having sexual affairs. It was also shown that Schindler had to work with Goth to save as many Jews as he did.<br/><br/>As well as the acting, the black and white filming added to the atmosphere of the film. It gave the film a sense of beauty and also gives the viewer the feeling of being there. The film also shows how the horrible the Holocaust was and showed some of the things people had to do to stay alive. But it also shows the faith of many of Jews and strengthen their resolve against the Nazis.<br/><br/>I find the Holocaust interesting on a Historical, Psychological and Sociological viewpoint because it shows mankind at its worst. It was the worst atrocity in the 20th Century and unfortunately Genocides still are going on.<br/><br/>The ending was very touching for me as well. Some people have criticised it but I don't know why. I felt the level of emotion was just right, not over done or underplayed. It is the only time I ever been tearful during a film and that is why I think the ending works. I also like the use of real footage at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The film as serves as a film lesson which is very good, especially since I am a History student.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a classic!"

","I thought that the film was excellent, I thought it was a brilliantly realisation, fiercely controlled and restraint treatment of a true story, the film had a great atmosphere of a kind of documentary, harsh and compassionate and avoid sentimentality until the end. And felt as though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the Nazi's were just the jury. I also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected."

","Just a few comments: Anyone saying here that Spielberg knows only Big Budget spectacular filming, obviously isn't aware of his Empire of the Sun or Color Purple. Both of these works go hand in hand with Schindler's list.<br/><br/>Anyone saying last scene (the ring) is fiction - I don't care - the scene is an emotional tsunami. The Schindler Jews stated in their interviews they don't care who he was or how he led his life - to them, he is an angel. I think the same. The man is a rare angel. <br/><br/>Also, the cinematography and the 40's heavy feel was never seen or surpassed before (or after), not even with Spielberg's Ryan."
"rmax304823","8","30","51","23 October 2007"," A moving story.
","Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as ""a nation of poets and dreamers.""<br/><br/>It's a kind of ""cross-over"" movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a ""Jewish"" movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better ""In the Heat of the Night"" than ""Superfly."" <br/><br/>But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichÃÂ©s associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.<br/><br/>The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, ""My God, what am I doing?"" Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.<br/><br/>Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.<br/><br/>Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? <br/><br/>The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in ""F"" (for ""facism"") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. <br/><br/>Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.<br/><br/>'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame! And Man, whose heav'n-erected face The smiles of love adorn, - Man's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn!"
"shashanc","10","30","51","5 February 2007"," One of the greatest and most important films ever
","Without a shadow of a doubt, Schindler's List is the finest film Spielberghas ever made; it is also, comfortably, the most important and is a movie everybody should make an effort to see, not just because of it's quality as a film but because of the message it carries with it. Everyone must surely now know the basis of the film - war profiteer OskarSchindler, a Nazi party member, works to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust, risking his own life in doing so. It is a story that, told incorrectly, could have been overly sentimental or that could have failed to make the points it needed to make about the Holocaust.Instead, it is told so well, it transcends the boundaries of it's media and has become both a vital historical document, cataloging the terror of the Nazis in a way everyone can understand, and a salient warning for our future. The strength of the film lies in the fact that it makes no attempt to preach to the person watching it. The primary characters are painted in shades of Grey. Schindler is a womanizer, a drinker, a profiteer who seemingly puts money before morals much of the time. He laughs and jokes with Nazis, including the primary villain, Plaszow commandant Amon Goeth,who himself is never presented as entirely evil. Throughout, the viewer is presented with a document of the actions of the characters and left to make up their own mind. Spielberg shot the film in black and white, often using hand-held cameras,to give it the appearance of a documentary, and it works. Coupled with the realities of the characters, and the fact that Spielberg neither draws back from the brutality of the Nazis nor uses the script to preach about it, this gives the film ""the ring of truth"". One of the hardest things in film-making is to take the truth, make no major changes to it and then make it believable on the screen; here Spielberg succeeds in this totally. The central performances in the movie are immense. Liam Neeson, RalphFiennes and Ben Kingsley give utterly convincing performances in the lead roles and the scenes where they appear with each other pin the film together and carefully chart the development of Schindler's sympathies.They are the final link in a film that has no weaknesses. This is a dark film though - how could it be otherwise with it's subject matter? It is upsetting and deeply moving and anybody who watches can'help but be changed in some way. The emotional climax of the film, in Auschwitz itself, is one of the most harrowing scenes ever put on celluloid. Spielberg handles the ending wonderfully as well, avoiding cloying sentimentality but still managing to provide some hope after all the darkness that has come before. The final scene, involving some of the people Schindler saved, is profoundly moving. If you haven't seen this film and are considering buying it, do so. Quiteaside from the fact that this is one of the finest movies ever to come out of Hollywood anyway, it also stands alongside books like 1984 and TheGrapes of Wrath, and films like The Battle of Algiers, as being""entertainment"" that is far more important than the genres which spawned them. The 2-disc set is beautifully packaged, and somehow this seems important for once. There is a deeply moving documentary included featuring interviews with survivors from Schindler's List. The transfer of the film to DVD is excellent as well - clear, bright and smooth. The choice of starting point for the second part of the film on the second DVD is also well made and poignant. For those who wish to further their knowledge of history's darkest hour,the best starting place is Martin Gilbert's book The Holocaust. Alsorecommended are Primo Levi's books If This Is A Man, The Sixth Day and IfNot Now, When; Roman Polanski's film The Pianist and, in music, Gorecki's3rd symphony and Shostakovich's Babi Yar. Equally important is another Martin Gilbert book, The Righteous, which catalogers the actions of some of the 17,000 other people so far recognized by the Council of Yad Vashemin Israel as righteous people who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. All these works help further tolerance and understanding,as does Schindler's List and that, surely, is the film's greatest credit and testimony."

","To me this is clearly Steven Spielberg's greatest film. It is far reaching, intelligent and historic and it addresses a sensitive issue in a meaningful way. The choice of black and white (with one hint of red) was brilliant and added a darkness that was truly dire. The film also gave a feeling of the European Jews and the Nazi's as human and not statistics. The Goetz was a psychopath but a lot of Nazi's were historically. The SS welcomed people with violence problems and obsessions. The whole regime was run by dark eccentrics and uber-patriots with a chip on their shoulder. I felt that this was history in a way that other films (the Piano not included) did not make me feel."

Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people.

","Some films i feel you can watch and just think there is something wrong and you don't really feel anything from it. There is nothing that shocks you whether it be the story or the acting. Schindlers list is one of those films like a lot of other Spielberg greats (Saving Private Ryan,Jaws)really grips you.This is probably the most powerful epic of any historical event ever made. Everything about it is perfection for a good movie. From the incredible performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar who i felt had deserved an academy award more than any actor alive for his performance and also for Ralph Feinnes as a terrifying Nazi and Ben Kingsleyalso gives another memorable performance as Jewish factory worker Izthak Stern right to the dazzling cinematography (the film was shot in an amazing black and white style to give it a more historical and realistic look). I think my favourite scene of the film has to be at the beginning when you see the all the Jews being evacuated and terrorised by German soldiers and then suddenly a little girl appears in a red dress which is the only coloured part of the film. That to me is shot that will go down in movie history.Many people believe that Spielberg is the kind of guy who is always going to be remembered for masterpieces like E.T,Jaws and the Indy trilogy. In my opinion this is the film where we knew that Spielberg was right next to Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee was one of todays greatest living directors."
"faincut","10","30","51","6 May 2005"," A story that captures many aspects of the Holocaust. Fanatastic Movie.
","Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.<br/><br/>Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for ""his Jewish workers"", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.<br/><br/>I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world."

","|This film is almost perfect,both in its place as a cinematic masterpiece visually,and in its sensitively handled subject matter.It is only given a nine by myself because i really don't think i will ever see a film that truly deserves a ten.The film is about a subject that affected millions,The Holocaust,but it has a very personal impact on the viewer by concentrating on a group of people that are characterised enough that the viewer relates with them so much more.If they had tried to show the wider spread effects of the Holocaust,the empathy would be diminished,because although based on harrowing events it would become just another historically based movie,with too much going on.What makes Schlindlers list so touching is that your given time to relate to the central characters in such a way that you feel you could almost imagine what they are feeling,and any film that can take you to that level of empathy is automatically a classic in my book! It is a good way to ''teach lessons''as it were because it affects anybody who watches it.Anyone harbouring fascist views should be made to sit and watch this movie repeatedly.If they can still be that way after seeing this,they must be in human,it really is that good at getting to anyone on an emotional level.This impact is heightened by the beautifully used black and white tones of the film,with significant items/parts in vibrant colours,stunning!The score is very effective too.Any one who can watch the ending without feeling moved is a robot!Fact!The film is great,granted but the cast also take this film to new heights,Liam Nesson is superb in his portrayal of a man forced to question his own values,beliefs and place in a system that is wrong,and who chooses the right path,absolutely mesmerising!

","Whenever I am feeling low and the world around me seems a hopeless place, I find solace in watching Schindler's List. Each time I view it, my soul is renewed.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is graphic in its depiction of Nazi murder, so one would think that such a film would only worsen my mood. But in reality, this movie is not about man's inhumanity to man; it is about the best that humans are and can be. It is about courage, compassion, love, and selflessness. This movie is about Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>I will not repeat the real life story of Oskar Schindler that this movie portrays, since so many others have done an excellent job of describing it. Instead, I will tell you about my favorite scene.<br/><br/>Though Oskar Schindler starts out as an opportunist who appears only motivated by aspirations of wealth, he begins to change, almost in spite of himself. He begins to show signs of caring and concern for his Jewish workers. The movie reveals this change in a most dramatic scene.<br/><br/>A young woman arrives to see Oskar Schindler, a woman that he has never met. She pleads with him to take her parents into his factory so that they will be safe. She tells Schindler her parents' names. She confesses that she has no money to give him. She says to Oskar, ""They say that no one dies here. They say that your factory is a haven. They say that you are good."" Schindler goes into a rage and throws her out. He then rushes into another room to confront Itzhak Stern, his Jewish business assistant upon whom he depends. ""You don't think I know what you're doing?"" he shouts. Harboring Jews ""is dangerous"" he rails. Schindler calms down after a few minutes.<br/><br/>Then, Oskar Schindler removes a note from his pocket. He reads the names of the girl's parents and tells Stern to ""bring them over"". Then he hands Stern his expensive watch which Stern is to use as a bribe to the Nazis. Schindler seems to almost sigh with the realization that he is now locked into a path from which he cannot escape. His life's purpose has changed irrevocably. In his heart he knows that his Schindler Jews are fully his responsibility and he must do anything and everything to protect them. An extraordinary love and the courage that comes from that love now rule Oskar Schindler's life. From now on, he no longer wants wealth for himself. Instead, as time progresses, all of his money is used to pay off Nazis to save his Jews.<br/><br/>Though the movie can bring one to tears, you can't help but feel wonderful about life when you watch the bravery, the love and the humanity, exemplified by Oskar Schindler, the Schindler Jews, and all of the Jews who suffered under the Nazis."

","I'll start with an ""aside."" What is a ""film"" and what is a ""movie."" I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew ""films"" so that the director and editor can create a ""movie"". But I have a difficult time thinking of ""Schindler's List"" as a ""movie."" I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, ""Schindler's List"" is certainly a ""film"", one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.<br/><br/>But this ""film"", while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a ""connected"" man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.<br/><br/>Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters."
"Avenge85","10","30","51","25 April 2004"," How a corrupt man is humanised by a man deemed to be sub-human.
","---minor spoilers within---<br/><br/>It is amazing to believe that in 1993 Steven Spielberg was responsible for creating two of the most influential films of the last number of decades. With great aplomb he produced 'Jurassic Park' - a film reflecting the calibre of his imagination and the potential of Computer Generated Imagery in order to enhance the realism of film. 'Schindler's List' on the other hand was never intended to be a show-case for imagination and new technologies. In fact, it strives to demonstrate the suffering caused by both of these factors when they are within the grasp of 'the wrong hands.'<br/><br/>Imagination and the ability to generate differences that do not exist is a core-factor that has led from one attempted genocide to another. During the Second World War and the occupation of Europe it became clear that fictional differences were driving the operation to eliminate the Jewish people. The second factor, technology allowed mass-movement of the state's victims and their extermination - mechanisms lubricated by the contemporary propaganda of radio, film, rallies and posters. <br/><br/>This film is about two men, not one, who stood against the grain of the Nazi propaganda machine and eventually set their differences aside. These men were Oskar Schindler and Itzhak Stern - a Nazi party official and an accountant. Within this iconic piece of film their relationship is strengthened through functionality and trust.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler is introduced as a reserved, womanising, money-wielding and disloyal industrialist. He wines and dines those in high positions, throwing lavish parties (whilst people die at his feet in the ghettos) in order to acquire future business contacts and 'friends in high places.' The prime concern in his life is his wealth and profit. His early opinions are summarised by his quote: ""now I see, in the past my businesses have failed as there was no war."" Over the years however, Oskar grows to love the Jewish people working in his industrial factory knowing that he and only he has the power and contacts to save them.<br/><br/>Itzhak Stern was the Jewish accountant employed by Schindler to operate the economic necessities of the factory, he was responsible for the employment of the Jews - insisting that they would save money and could be swiftly trained to operate the machinery. Stern was the modest protector of his people, and frequently hires those who would not last in the harsh conditions outside the factory. <br/><br/>Stern leads to one of the most joyful and sorrowful moments of the film - the hiring of an old, one-armed man as a machine-operator insistent on thanking Mr Schindler personally.  ""Of what use is a one-armed worker?"" cried Schindler ""he has valuable skills"" replied Stern - ""he's a metal press operator."" ""Very skilled."" This in itself was amusing, but I cried when Schindler himself uses Stern's reply to defend the worker when quizzed by a Nazi Official. Schindler was touched by Stern and the honest of his people, his slow change of outlook became evident as the film progressed.<br/><br/>The film itself is magnificently well paced allowing timely plot and character development under various settings and scenarios. The black and white footage with the selective hint of colour allows the viewers to look on this dreadful event without distraction or confusion. The 'snow' scene is the pinnacle of cinematic shock and many of the following scenes make you wince with fear for the people which, on-screen you have inexorably bonded with.<br/><br/>I feel that the tagline of the film: ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" A line taken from the inscription engraved on the ring gifted to Schindler by the people he had harboured owes greater relevance to Stern. Itzhak had saved the life of Schindler from the greed of money - now long spent on buying the freedom and food for 1,100 Jews. Oskar was liberated from his mind bent on profit - which had now been retrofitted to manufacture love and understanding. As Stern saved one life - Schindler could save hope for the world entire. There is always good within every evil created by man and money.<br/><br/>An accurate expression of the elegant truth within a context of differentiation. <br/><br/>Andrew N. McVea"
"rserrano","10","30","51","15 March 2004"," Transformed by the white light
","What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying ""If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?"". But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says "" Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this"". He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as ""Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it"". Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic ""bath tub stain"" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him "" No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good"". One can easily substitute the word ""heaven"" for ""haven"" and ""God"" for ""good"". In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him."

","SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) **** Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz. Powerful interpretation of Thomas Keneally's novel about the true-life story of German factory enterepreneur Oskar Schindler (portrayed superbly by Neeson, warts and all, and nominated for Best Actor), who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis during WWII, by employing them in his war-profiteering enterprise. Excellent acting by the entire cast, specifically Fiennes (Best Supporting Actor nominee) as Amon Goeth, a remarkably complex portrayal of nuanced evil.<br/><br/>Deservingly bestowed with 7 Oscars (including Best Picture), this harrowing documentary-styled monument to the travesties of the Holocaust is Steven Spielberg's (Best Director) masterpiece and is a must see. Shot in starkly haunting black and white by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made."

Schindler's List is a film which tackles the issues of war, religion and the human spirit with emotion.<br/><br/>It revolves around Oskar Schindler, a factory kingpin who, amidst the chaos and slaughter of the war, decides to help the defenceless, enslaved Polish Jews. He makes a list, comprising of 1100 Jewish people, whom he shall liberate and set free. Hence, Schinder's List.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is first class, and he tells the story with emotion, yet the film is totally in-your-face. One scene which captures the poignancy is where the red dress of a little girl is shown in colour, even though the film is shot in black and white. It sticks out and captures the essence of innocence.

Details such as the nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that is scary.  The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very well presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad.

"ToldYaSo","10","30","51","3 August 1999"," A fantastic film that I had to see twice
","I don't have to tell you that ""Schindler's List"" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""Jurassic Park"" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.<br/><br/>I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""Schindler's List"" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out. <br/><br/>Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.<br/><br/>Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""Seinfeld"" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.<br/><br/>Back to our friend ""Howdy Doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.<br/><br/>I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what ""Buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate."

"bkoganbing","10","31","53","16 November 2008"," When The State Dehumanizes A People
","It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.<br/><br/>If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. <br/><br/>Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. <br/><br/>Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.<br/><br/>Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.<br/><br/>Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.<br/><br/>It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how."

","I dare not rate this film but only give some thoughts. If I was watching it to be entertained, it would receive a negative number. If I was watching it strictly with a critical eye as to judge if it is a well made film, I might have to give it an 11. Be it contrivance or not, this is the most powerful and disturbing film I have ever experienced.<br/><br/>The violent and disturbing scenes depicted in this film are based in fact. They are recent history for that matter. That makes it very hard to endure. And worse, the inhumanity of genocide continues to this very day. I have little doubt that the scenes depicted in this film are tame compared to the realities of what occurred at Krakow and elsewhere.<br/><br/>The film brought me there convincingly, and the pain was there. It was hard to watch, and disturbing as I ponder that at any moment a political tide might derail my own life.<br/><br/>There are characters that kill for sport. But these are not characters. These are characterizations of real evil people that recently existed, recreated in the film based on the recollections of those who have witnessed the atrocities. Then there is Schindler, who is not characterized as sweet, but as a unique person who will not trade inhumanity for money. It is quite an intriguing story.<br/><br/>On one hand, I say this movie should be seen by every human being on the planet. On the other hand, I have found that this movie has brought within me a feeling of depression that is long lasting. For sure, we must not forget the Holocaust. With a revived knowledge of this history from viewing this film my eyes will be more open.<br/><br/>I could have spent my time more enjoyably. But this well-made film has a reason to exist. You won't care unless you watch it. Yet, you will pay the price whether or not you are indifferent to the messages in this film.

","This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, ""Never Again"", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved ""one more"" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by ""It's A Wonderful Life"", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for us or at our disposal."

Speilberg, immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and sentimentality.

We talked about it and, in the discussions that followed, I was accused of not caring about the victims of the Holocaust. One person even said I was denying the Holocaust happened!<br/><br/>And that soured me on the movie even more. The fact is, Holocaust movies have insurance against criticism: if you say the movie is a waste of time, someone might attribute your opinion to the Holocaust itself. I don't understand it, but that weird emotional blackmail made me really uncomfortable with Schindler's List.<br/><br/>I thought Liam Neeson was horrible. His acting is very stiff and unconvincing. The use of hand-held cameras and black-and-white cinematography *should* work, but ultimately they amounted to subtle special effects.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was emotionally flat, as well. I watched each character go through the motions, wondering when something unexpected would happen. The horror of the Holocaust is shown in an almost clinical way.<br/><br/>I don't know. I just felt that this movie would feel less like a bid for an Oscar and more like a personal film.<br/><br/>At the risk of being a complete jerk, I'll give Spielberg this advice: Do it again. Make another Holocaust movie. Why not? He finished Kubrick's ""AI."" Kubrick had another movie in the planning stages, a Holocaust film called ""Aryan Papers"" (aka ""Wartime Lies""). I hope he'll finish *that* Kubrick movie, too, and create a better Holocaust film, something I can sink into and be surprised by, something that feels much more personal."

A film that helps promote liberties taken over the years by that certain group of people from anything to a good seat at the Opera to unabated attempts to destroy other people's beliefs and right to exist.<br/><br/>This film is (unfortunately), not about a man's humanitarian well-meant efforts to do what he could to help to save a group of desperate and obviously(for most of them) doomed to their certain death, people.<br/><br/>The point that came across was visually witnessing the random acts of a certain person committing atrocities and exaggerating them to an extent that diminished what really happened to those people. In trying to add visual credibility via sensationalism made a mockery and a not so subtle message that a certain group of people have rights forever to commit atrocities to avenge what befell them over the centuries. If there is such a thing as a hate film, well this is it, generalizing 40 million people as monsters for the actions of a handful of lunatics sanctioned by the so-called Allies that were still full of boast and smugness and let's face it, blindness to what was going on.

The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role.

"paladeen","5","165","328","2 August 2008"," Schindler's List, or How I Learned to Stop Profiteering and Love the Jews
","Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being ""deeply moved"" or ""touched.""<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.<br/><br/>A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?<br/><br/>And what about Amon GÃ¶th, the representative Nazi? A ""grotesque caricature"" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why GÃ¶th hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.<br/><br/>The attempt to add depth to GÃ¶th's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?<br/><br/>This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?<br/><br/>Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.<br/><br/>Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.<br/><br/>One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.<br/><br/>When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.<br/><br/>What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:<br/><br/>* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.<br/><br/>Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.<br/><br/>All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...<br/><br/>Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.<br/><br/>Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth."

","Well its the first time i've ever watched this movie and it was worth the wait! My review based on the fact that its a true story, then the movie is very sad and an emotional story that is depicted brilliantly through Spielburgs fantastic direction and through Neesons and Fiennes fantastic performances, also everyone that acted in this movie were brilliant! This movie displays a very moving, inspirational and touching story of the horrors the Jews had to go through during the war and shows the wondering and truly amazing individuals quest to trying to save as many Jews as possible. You watch this movie and you won't control yourself enough to not start crying. <br/><br/>Spielburg did a fantastic job of this movie and so thoroughly deserving of the 10 nominations and 7 awards that this movie received! I loved the way it was in black and white and that near the beginning of the movie your introduced; or Spielberg draws your attention to one little girl in particular who is wearing a red coat the only colour within the movie, i guess its a way of making you ore aware of that little girl so that through the movie your wondering what happened to her which you do find out!

","Few movies really stay with me for years and years, but this one does. I think it will leave an impact on anybody, for that matter. Both the cruelty of the Nazis as well as the grotesque Holocaust are very realistic in this movie, and a lot of the scenes are directly painful to watch. A lot of the movie makes the viewer see the Holocaust through the eyes of Schindler, and how he understands more and more that this is wrong. And they have made a very good job in making the viewer feel like they ARE Schindler, watching all this. Especially is a little girl in red walking alone in a ghetto, who we later see dead in a pile of corpses. This is a moment you will remember for the rest of your life. In a lot of other movies, you can comfort yourself with that the violence is only fiction, but in Schindler's List you are forced to face the brutal fact that this actually happened. So why even watch this? Because with what Schindler ends up doing makes you feel that there might be a little hope for the Jews in the camps, a little chance of turning the hopeless situation. And so you end up (spoilers ahoy) all the more relieved when he gets a group of them out. the scene with his realization of everything he could have done to save a couple of more Jews from death was strong enough for me to blink back tears. So prepare for a powerful experience rather than a mere movie, because you are in for precisely that."

","Schindler's List, a cinematic masterpiece, winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, conquered both art critics and the public. The film presents the true story of the enigmatic Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, a womanizer and a profiteer, but who manages to save the lives of more than 1100 Hebrew during the holocaust. The film is a moving testimony about the horrors of war and the human character corruption in wartime. War is the hub around which action and plot, representing a way of salvation for some and condemnation for others. It is a very impressive and emotional film, perhaps the best ever made by Spielberg! Most shocking scene is the last in which Schindler appears to regret not saving more lives and can even use his last money after giving all his wealth to buy the Hebrew and bribe officials to Nazis, I thought that this scene captures the essential best movie and think everyone should see it, even for trauma and suffering caused all product usage options Jews of that period!"

","There are good movies, fantastic movies, mind blowing movies and then there is Schindler's List. It tells you the story of the time of holocaust during World War II and how one businessman Oscar Schindler (played by terrific Liam Nesson) becomes concerned about his Jewish work force after witnessing the massacre. It's black and white except the one last scene because there was no point of using colors till that point. It shows we the people can be nice and can be evil without giving a thought to the reason. It is as graphic as it can be while showcasing the horrors of war. You need to be really stone hearted if not moved by this emotional, horrific portrayal of war times. Ralph Fiennes as ruthless German and Ben Kingsley as Jewish business manager of Schindler's factory give knock out performances. But the movie belongs to legendary director Steven Spielberg's unmatched skills of directing the whole story with such uniqueness and conviction that is hard to believe. Schindler's List surely tops my list of top movies."
"indicontent","9","15","23","19 July 2013"," Excellent Film and Characters
","Schindler's List is not just a film but excellent portrayal of characters. Liam Nisan's character Oskar Schindler is complex as for me he transformed from one to another. After failing many a times in businesses, he finds 'the holy grail' of business i.e. 'War is the best friend for Capitalist.' Though he did not have an iota of feelings for Jews when he started business, later on his friendship; rather, professional coordination with Itzak Stern imbibes him with some feelings for them. To watch in the movie is how and at which point Schindler starts feeling for Jews is important.<br/><br/>I think when he sees that Germans are no good for Jews or even for Germans. Also, may be he realizes that siding with Germans when they are losing the war can have grave implications. May be a lot of people will disagree to the fact and it has not been shown in the film, many survivors also felt that Schindler was a lousy and lascivious guy who tried to benefit from the circumstances but accidentally became a guy in the Jews' good book."

",""" I....pardon you.""<br/><br/>These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and forgiveness.<br/><br/>I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to experience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would not have done it justice.<br/><br/>The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.<br/><br/>Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening portrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many favs!<br/><br/>awesome movie must watch available in Hindi"
"ShelbyTMItchell","10","15","23","28 March 2013"," Historical Film That Needs to Be Told To Everybody!
","Probably one of the best films that I have ever seen. Really haunting but true. Along with sad but it is about the human race along with how hard these people in Germany had to deal with the brutality and harshness of the Nazis! By having thousands of them work for Oskar Schinder in his factory and hiding them. As that was at the time an overlooked thing before the movie was made. As how thousands were saved from the death camps of Germany.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg proved he could direct the best pic ever in his career after the Academy voters did not take him for real at the time. Only thinking he could do blockbusters. But with this film, he shows the point of view of WWII Germany. At the time of the Third Reich. Plus him being Jewish really makes it authentic.<br/><br/>It is shown in Black and White as Spielberg says that if there was color, it would not be a historically realistic as it would had been. Glad that he kept it in B&W! Liam Neeson gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist and war profiteer Oskar Schindler. Who turned his greed into humanity by saving lots and lots of Jews from the Nazis and Hitler. As he felt compassion on them.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes turns into a haunting performance in his breakthrough role of the main antagonist, Amon Goeth as he shows no mercy to those people that are under his command. He steals every single scene in the film with his evilness.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley does a great job as Neeson's right hand man. As he shows compassion and sympathy as kind of a spokesman for his people and an accountant by trade.<br/><br/>This movie needs to be seen through all generations. And that it is nearly 20 years old but seems like only yesterday that it was made! Very good acting, writing, and makes you feel like you are there!"

","I notice Schindler's List is a patchwork of stories retold through the eyes of Holocaust Survivors. This felt entirely appropriate and gives the film a unique perspective. Many outstanding WWII dramas have been made, but so few will equal this detailed, historically revealing one about those so directly affected. <br/><br/>Anecdotal encounters with German soldiers are re-enacted here: The young man who clears suitcases from a ghetto street, only surviving due to approaching Nazi Soldiers finding this amusing. A factory worker who survives only due to Commandant Goeth's pistol failing. The young boy stepping forward and pointing to an inmate the Commandant has just shot, informing him this was the chicken thief.<br/><br/>Only a Jewish film director should have made this film, and I wonder if it was a painful experience for Spielberg at some points? He deals sensitively with a plethora of barbaric scenes including German soldiers stripping inmates, or pushing them in frustration onto the mangled bodies of less fortune kin. <br/><br/>Spielberg does not veil the horror here. We see how heads explode when a 9mm Luger is discharged at point blank range. Not a fan of violence, I found myself forgiving the director here, because the destruction by Nazi Soldiers against unarmed civilians is evidential. The Nazis also tried hard to cover-up the extent of their War Crimes.<br/><br/>The screenplay tends towards the sentimental, but right at it's heart is a fascinating dichotomy of personality. The unprejudiced approach of Schindler in contrast to Commandant Amon Goethe's hate-driven, psychopathic one. Unfortunately, psychopaths thrived in Nazi Germany and it's evident Goeth (pronounced ""Gort"" in German) was responsible for thousands of deaths.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe Nazis hated the Jews because of the desperate poverty many Germans experienced after World War One. The building of the Extermination Camps (Auschwitz being one of them) was a twisted, yet banally logical step in the process of Nazis ensuring everything was taken from their chosen scapegoats... A defenseless, civilian population. <br/><br/>The Holocaust will remain one of humanity's deepest tragedies. We need to understand why it happened and Schindler's List helps us all do this. Those sacrificed for the sake of economic expediency was a hateful, unnecessary war crime. <br/><br/>I sobbed uncontrollably for the last 15 minutes of this film...<br/><br/>Favorite Film Moment:<br/><br/>Has to be when Schindler questions the use of a one-armed machinist. The superb Ben Kingsley as sober plant manager, Stern simply raises his hands saying: ""Very useful... Success!"" As Schindler drives away. Black comedy at its finest. <br/><br/>Favorite Performance:<br/><br/>Embeth Davidtz as victimized housemaid ""Helene Hirsch"" (who had to deal daily with the violent and unpredictable Goeth) is outstanding in her scenes. I cannot believe she did not receive an Oscar in this role. She deserved one - Despite being part of an impressive, solid cast. <br/><br/>Most Haunting Scene:<br/><br/>The now famous Girl In Red Coat Scene is one of the best pieces of film direction I have ever seen. That little girl wandering amid the bullets, confusion and murder is cinematic symbolism at its finest. The soundtrack changes to children singing during this part of the film. Spielberg shows us the affects of evil on the innocent with remarkable skill here. No corny dialogue, no over-acting. Just undiluted representation of the consequences of hatred."
"jellybean1129","10","15","23","16 March 2013"," Perfect Film
","I have never come across a film that had as a profound and lasting effect on me. This film is perfect in so many ways. It truly depicts the terrible nature of the Holocaust and one of mankind's darkest hours very beautifully.<br/><br/>The film starts out by showing us Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party who you would want to be friends with if you were alive at the time. He has money, connections, and charm. Who wouldn't want to be on his good side? Oskar is shown as a womanizing, egotistical, opportunist who is looking to make money off of cheap labor, aka the Jews. If someone were to watch this movie before knowing anything about Schindler and what he did, they might dislike him at first. However, he's also one of the few people in the movie who never despises the Jews. He did not care about the fact that his accountant, Itzhak Stern, was Jewish, even before he made the decision to save as many Jewish people as he could. He doesn't hate them, but at the same time, he doesn't feel he owes them anything.<br/><br/>As the movie moves forward, you gradually see Schindler's change in attitude, brought on by his accidental witnessing of the ghetto liquidation. Like many of us, his eyes follow a young girl in a red coat as she walks through the streets and runs into a building to safety. In my foolishness, I genuinely thought she had a chance at making it. Seeing her rather gruesome looking body being carted off to be incinerated was extremely disturbing for me because of that. That is also the scene in which Schindler really came to realize what a horrible regime this was. He looked horrified when he saw her body. Soon after, he begins to develop his list, paving the way for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>There are so many moving scenes in this film. The ones that made me either want to cry or actually cry were the result of a build up of emotions from earlier in the film. For example, I can never hold in my emotion when Schindler and his wife are about to flee the country. Seeing him cry over the fact that he didn't give up even more and save just one more life really told me what this film was trying to get across; every human life is precious. The scene when each survivor and the actors who portrayed them put a rock on his grave also made me cry. When Emilie Schindler, his widow, came up to put it on his grave, she couldn't even reach it from her wheelchair, so the actress who played her did it for her. When she was being wheeled off, she looked back at his grave with an expression I can't even describe, like she wished she didn't have to leave her husband's grave, yet she also looked proud of what he had done.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler was phenomenal. He used just the right amount of charm and emotion needed for this character. His natural charm shows through, making him even more perfect for this character. In him, I can sense Schindler's confusion, doubt, and the obligation he feels to save 'his people'. His portrayal was Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>My absolute favorite portrayal in the film was Ralph Fiennes as the brutal, real life SS officer Amon Goeth. To put it lightly, the man was a psychopath who murdered anyone he desired, usually just for the heck of it. It was extremely hard to watch him shooting people at point blank-range because they simply did a small thing to set off his violent temper. The creepy obsession he had with his his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, made his character even more complex. He hates himself for feeling these things for a Jew, so he takes it out on her by beating her brutally. It's hard to believe such a nightmarish character actually existed and did even more gruesome things than showed in the film. Survivors on set found it difficult to be around Fiennes because he reminded them so much of the real Amon Goeth.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film, please do, it will be worth it and if you truly understand what messages they're trying to convey, it will stay with you for a very long time."

"jdneukom","10","15","23","23 February 2013"," The Best Movie Ever Made
","A lot of people are under the assumption that either CITIZEN KANE or VERTIGO is the best motion picture in human history. And, while these are undoubtedly in the discussion, and one can say that Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock are certainly in the top 10 best directors in history, neither of these are the best movie of all time.<br/><br/>CITIZEN KANE is an epic piece of semi-fiction clustered around the life and times of Hearst, McCormick, Insull and a few others. This film broke ground in so many technical ways--flashbacks as the primary source of telling a story, multiple narrators, deep focus shots, intense shadows and lighting effects, and camera angles shot from the floor at times. Also, this was probably the most highly controversial film ever made, since William Randolph Hearst tried furiously to snuff it out, and Hollywood moguls approached Orson Welles and RKO Productions to reimburse him for the costs of the film just to simply destroy it. However, although CITIZEN KANE might be the most innovative film of all time (save for the first motion picture, the first color motion picture, and the first with sound), it is not the best picture or all time. This is largely because the story is quite dated, and almost no one can connect with a newspaper mogul in today's society. Sure there are enduring themes here, but ultimately this picture doesn't have the soul to grab us as viewers and pull us in.<br/><br/>Without going into similar detail for VERTIGO, suffice it to say that this is another picture that is technically revolutionary (Vertigo effect), but the story just doesn't have the level of humanity and soul that one would expect for best movie ever.<br/><br/>Two other pictures that are commonly viewed as contenders include IMDb's own #1 THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as well as IMDb #2 THE GODFATHER. And while these movies are much more soulful story-wise than VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, neither rises quite to the level of technical brilliance exhibited by the other films.<br/><br/>So, there appears to be a quandary at the top of the movie hierarchy, where we have two brilliant, technical masterpieces that don't have quite enough soul, and we also have two brilliant cinematic masterpieces that might not be as technically/visually stunning as one would expect from the best movie ever.<br/><br/>Enter SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br/><br/>SCHINDLER'S LIST is a movie that, although it is comfortably amongst the top movies on IMDb (#8 currently), no one ever seriously mentions it for best movie. And this is really a crime, because it deserves that title, and is by far Spielberg's best work.<br/><br/>The acting is A++ in this movie--what we have is Liam Neeson, possibly the most underrated actor of the last quarter century, delivering his finest performance as protagonist Oskar Schindler. Alongside this performance, is Ralph Fiennes also giving his finest career performance as antagonist Amon Goethe. There is not a single line spoken, nor facial gesture made, nor flourish with a prop (cigarette, shot glass, deck of cards) that is anything short of mind-blowing. The scene between Schindler and Goethe discussing the difference between power and justice, with power coming the ability to not exercise that very power, or make a pardon, was phenomenal. And then Goethe's being so influenced that he becomes obsessed with trying on that version of ""power"" for size before ultimately discarding it was haunting. Aspiring actors be on notice, this movie can teach you to win an Oskar (intentionally misspelled) someday. Ben Kingsley fills his role sublimely as the necessary cog in the Schindler machine (and ultimately the one who goads Schindler into realizing there is more than business at stake), Itzhak Stern. Additionally, casting European and Jewish actors and actresses only makes this tale that much fuller with realism and soul.<br/><br/>The sound, music, and cinematography is simply on another level, and this is what sets it apart from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE GODFATHER. Seeing Krakow from a distance at night, with machine gun fire intermittently lighting up rooms with murders was extremely effective, as were all the set pieces that showed intricate hiding places and how the Nazis had come to use stethoscopes to defeat this Jewish strategy. The cat and mouse game between hunter and hunted was very well done. What's more, the emaciated bodies of people who played some of these roles looked like they were actually taken out of Holocaust footage. It was disturbing and stunning all at once. Throw in an AMAZING, beautiful, and tragic score with superb sound editing, beautiful panoramic shots, and compelling grayscale to yield an artistic, audiovisual feast.<br/><br/>As if to cement its status as best film ever, the attention to detail, the script, and the utter despair felt at every turn was breathtaking. You cannot help but be awe-struck at every horrified expression, every pained look, every exactly delivered line. Though this is a 3-hour-long epic, there is not a single extraneous line in the entire movie. There is not a single gratuitous scene. Every scene absolutely belongs, and every spoken line fits like a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>The mood of this film gives it soul, like you find in films such as CASABLANCA and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but darker and haunted. This feeling just makes you want to root like hell that everyone makes it out unscathed. And when that train full of women is mistakenly sent to Auschwitz, a knot forms in your throat--so close, but yet so far from salvation. And, even Liam Neeson as Schindler is not immune, as he gives a bravura final performance where he weeps and questions the value of a life--could he have done more? It's become his sickness, his addiction, and though he did so much, it is certain not being able to turn his Nazi gold pin into even a single additional life will haunt him forever."

","Circa 1993, Steven Spielberg was arguably the biggest name in Hollywood. The world had just seen ""Jurassic Park"" become the third of his films to take over top spot in the list of the highest grossing films of all time. Then, for an encore, he delivered ""Schindler's List""; the film that finally brought him Oscar recognition.<br/><br/>The story is based on a factual novel by Thomas Keneally about a German businessman who moves to Poland during WWII in the hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. He thrives with the aid of Jewish slave labour but as the war progresses he becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his work force. Eventually, he resolves to sacrifice his wealth in an attempt to shield his workers from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Steven Zaillian is a strong one and it ended up resulting in an Oscar win. The tone can be grim at times as the film unflinchingly portrays the nightmare of German occupation. With a runtime of more than three hours, the film is somewhat gruelling early on but you eventually get so wrapped up in the story that the time passes quickly. Zaillian should also be commended for not portraying Schindler as a man without fault; rather, he is an unlikely hero.<br/><br/>The cast also rises to the occasion. It's no surprise that the always dependable Liam Neeson landed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Schindler but it is surprising that this is his only nomination to date. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes, in his breakout role, basically stole the show as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth. Also deserving of high praise was Ben Kingsley, whose low-key performance spoke volumes.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is exceptional. The black and white cinematography of Janusz Kaminski is stunning and Spielberg's direction is impeccable. Both individuals were justly rewarded with Oscars for their work. Meanwhile, the sets & costumes were also top notch and helped to lend the film a feel of authenticity. Also worth mentioning is John Williams' Oscar-winning score.<br/><br/>In the end, while ""Schindler's List"" shows exquisite care in every area it is ultimately the film's emotional impact that elevates it above the pack. It'd be a stoic individual indeed who isn't moved by this film in one way or another."

","Schindler's List tells the tale of a German industrialist Oskar Schindler (28 April 1908 â 9 October 1974) who was credited to have saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Steven Spielberg both directed and produced this movie, and has been received widely as a classic.<br/><br/>The thing that catches your eye when watching this movie is the cruelty of war itself, there are just mainly losers no winners, only those who happen to be in-between that suffers, the men behind it sit behind a desk. Spielberg depicted such cruelty in the Camps.<br/><br/>A scene where a Jew who made hinges was moved from where he is working to go shove coal and then when he was done he returned, Amon GÃ¶th (Ralph Fiennes) queried him for not meeting up to his regular toll of hinges and immediately had him arraigned to be executed, for something that was not his fault. That scene touched me.<br/><br/>The movie was shot in KrakÃ³w, Poland for seventy-one days. Shots were done in real life locations, though the PÅaszÃ³w camp had to be reconstructed in a pit adjacent to the original site, due to post-war changes to the original camp.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is direct; a German businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) in Poland sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using bribes to win military contracts, and bringing in an accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.<br/><br/>He then hires Jews for the cheap pay, but later after witnessing the cruelty they face in the Nazi Camps, he then tried to get as much Jews away from the Camps to his factory, using all his savings to take care of them.<br/><br/>The movie is not so bad when it comes to acting, but the main hat dipping should go to the Screenplay and the directing. The Screenplay and the script had to be perfect in other for us to be able to get the feel of what the Jews were going through. Also the directing had to be top notch so as not to get carried away by the suffering or the cruelty but to understand why a German will like to save the Jews.<br/><br/>Although we know that much has been done by Liam Neeson (Taken), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Ben Kingsley (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) over the years, but they will be fondly remembered for their role in this classic.<br/><br/>Take a 3 hour break from your busy schedule and watch this movie.

","1993 was a great year for Steven Spielberg. Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.<br/><br/>As with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.<br/><br/>I've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.<br/><br/>Acting was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.<br/><br/>Having seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed."

","Perhaps no other film in history depicts the Holocaust as unforgettably and disturbingly as does Schindler's List, the title that won seven Academy Awards in 1993, including Best Picture. Powerful and immense, Schindler's List uses top-notch acting, directing, music and cinematography to reconstruct the Krakow ghetto, Plaszow concentration camp, Schindler's enamelware factory and Auschwitz. What stays with you about this black-and-white film is the imagery--children hiding in a sewer, human beings packed into train cars, Goeth shooting random men and women from the balcony of his home. The scenes in Schindler's List are chillingly realistic because Spielberg does not cut corners in portraying the actuality of the violence. There is no sugarcoating of the Holocaust and how many lives it destroyed. The camera angles capture the emotional aspect of situations, often using close-ups to portray character reactions. At times, a hand-held camera was skillfully employed to convey chaos. John Williams' stunning musical score contributes to the intensity and confusion of the film. My favorite aspect of this film is the acting of Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes. These actors carry the film with subtle dialogue and nonverbal cues. With brilliant acting, directing, music and cinematography, Schindler's List is truly a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/"

","Spielberg is one of those few men who manages to strike Gold with most things he does. Few would deny his qualities in directing motion cinema, and the many triumphs he's achieved with all genres of film. But with Schindler's List surely we have his greatest. The precision to every single frame of this movie is endless. The staggering scale and scope of the story telling, of which we see a businessman (Schindler) making a high level living from the Nazi war machine, who in the end uses his entire wealth to save has many human beings as possible. And that is this films triumph its human tale. A film which is as uneasy (in parts) to watch as it is equally beautiful. It is not a comfortable movie and not for everyone, but those who appreciate true cinema, incredible script and story telling, perfect direction and impeccable acting there can be no greater. Ralph Fiennes as the wickedly evil Amon Goeth is spell binding, a part which must have been difficult to play is played to perfection, in which for me is Fiennes finest performance. He plays the part so perfectly you would believe you where watching an actual piece of footage of the events. And indeed this was Spielberg's idea behind the black and white theme, to allow the audience to experience the film as if it was historical evidence. A film which asks questions about the depths of the human ability to carry disgraceful acts of violence and horror, and the mindset of the ones who can no longer standby and say they did nothing to stop it. All the acting is perfect in this movie, Neeson excels and plays Schindler with a grace and coolness that few other could execute. To sum it up every time i watch this movie it gets better, but to call this a movie would do it an injustice, this is a Picture, a nod to the old days when detail was everything, but with the pace and the brilliance for it to last forever. There was never a finer one made. Spielberg's greatest. Film makings crowning glory."

","I first heard about this film through my Grandfather's reading of the book, and as a keen historian especially the 2 World War's, l was immediately drawn to viewing this film. As i sat down to watch this, l was told that this is one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of all time, it was hard to see it before the viewing, but after the viewing of this film, l have no doubt that this is one of the greatest films of all time. It captures the horrors of humanity and the best in humanity. All this in 1 film is almost impossible, but the genius Spielberg has done it somehow. This is his finest work, yes ET, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, all fantastic films, but Schindler's List is his finest work. The actors in this film are incredible. Liam Neeson in probably the performance of his well established career is the Protagonist Oskar Schindler. The Antagonist Amon Goeth portrayed by Ralph Fiennes is one of his best performances of his career is chilling as a brutal Nazi Guard. The story of Oskar Schindler had to be told and it was due to the incredible film making skills of Steven Spielberg, the best film maker of our generation if not of all time. All in all, this must go down as one of the greatest films of all time. I certainly enjoyed this movie. WARNING: Extremely graphic scenes, coarse language and violence. These graphic scenes were necessary though for Spielberg to convey to us the brutality of this horrible war."

","Schindler's List â CATCH IT (A+) Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. (Wiki) Three hours long black & white movie is remarkable in itself. As the whole time you feel like you're in that time zone and not watching a movie but a history in told in the most brutal natural formal way. I was completely surprised when read on end credits that it's direct by Steven Spielberg. The director who mostly directs big fantasy movies from years. Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler as the cunning but sweet hearted man is magnificent. This proves why this man is so well respected and maybe now he has moved to Action (decent) genre we all know what exactly he is capable of. Ralph Fiennes as egoistic Nazi is as despicable as despicable his actions were. In other words he was Incredible. Ben Kingsley is a legend. Overall, even though its 2012, when I finally saw this great Oscar winning movie it's totally worth your three hours."

My favorite scenes are when Olek has to hide with Danka and the other children in the toilet, when the survivors place the rocks on Oscar's grave, and when Oscar cries ""I could've saved one more. That truly showed the passion of the man to save lives. Liam Neeson,Raiff Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley make their best performances, and all deserved Academy Awards.

","""Schindlers List"" is based on a true story in World Warâ¡, this film tells us a story about a German business man, Oscar Schindler, who tried to save more than one thousand Jews and other victims from the Nazi Germans.<br/><br/>Oscar Schindler used to live a luxurious life with great ambitions in his business. He was a devoted member of the Nazi party and was in close touch with the Nazi officers. The war provided him a good opportunity for his business, thus he wanted to get every possible benefit from it and decided to manufacture military need products. Just because the Jews are the lest costly labors available, they were brought to work for him. At first when his Jewish workers were killed by the soldiers, he was just angry because it made him lose money. One day, with the words ""today is history"", of Amen, the chief officer of the German troop, the holocaust began. The noise of machine guns was never stopped in that day. The blood of the Jews flooded the streets. Oscar Schindler, who was riding a horse in the wood, happened to see the killing from the hill. In the mess, he saw a Jewish girl running in the street. In this black and white film, only the girl was in red. This color makes her different. I think the director must indicate something to us. What does this color mean? Does it represent blood and anger of killing, or passion and hope of life? I kindly thought it was hope, but in the later part of the film, we saw the girl in red again among the bodies to be burnt. When I watched the film for the second time, I realize that had not for some good people like Schindler, no one can survive under the beast like Nazi. After seeing the holocaust, Schindler changed. He tried his best to save the Jews. He bought over 1000 lives from the devil. Through the long list with the type machine clicking, we see the light of hope again. In the final of the film, the war ended, and the picture turned to color again. The world is bright again. This is a movie worthies watching for everyone. We should never forget history. Keeping history in mind does not mean keeping hatred in heart and revenging, while forgetting history means betrayal to all humankind."

","A close friend of mine had recommended this movie to me. For long I did not watch it thinking it was just another movie with a 'war' theme. When I eventually watched it, I was kicking myself that a movie buff like me took so long.<br/><br/>Schindler's list is based on the 'Holocaust' era where Jews were hated and brutally killed in Nazi regime. The movie begins with the relocation of Jews from the neighboring areas to Ghettos just after world war has commenced. In parallel, we see Oskar Schindler, a German businessman (and a womanizer) trying to cash in on opportunity to make profits. He hires an accountant Itzhak Stern and uses his skills to expand. During the course he also befriends SS Lieutenant Amon Goeth who is responsible for overseeing the Krakow Ghetto. During the course of Amon's governance we witness the brutal killings of Jews. Specially we get to see how the Nazis selected their Jewish work force (retaining skilled laborers and murdering old/unhealthy ones). This is the point where Schindler decides to splurge his fortune to save the Jews. The rest of the movie shows on how he goes about accomplishing this.<br/><br/>Performances are top notch. Liam Neeson as Schindler is natural and brilliant. The scene in the end where he makes a speech and eventually breaks down is touching. Amon Goeth as the ruthless Lieutenant is equally good. I was a little surprised that neither of them won an Academy for the efforts. The supporting cost is headed by the ever dependable Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>Technically the movie scores on several grounds. Shooting the movie in B&W makes it chilling especially the scenes in Ghetto. Along with the (haunting) background score, some of the scenes stay in your mind forever.<br/><br/>Above all, the real star is the genius Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie, Ben Kingsley tells Schindler 'the pages with names is life'. That is what this movie is about. It is about Humanity and it has no boundaries.<br/><br/>***Whoever saves one life saves the world entire***"
"fredericksmith1952","10","15","23","9 February 2012"," ""If you save one life, in time you save the world.""
","This amazing story is, in my humble opinion, the epitome of Spielberg's work. To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of magnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for their contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are immediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold as if you were there. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is dynamic and compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer, but his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben Kingsley's quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments Neeson's. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant, unhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without compassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply disdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes in this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important line in the film occurs near the end. ""If you save one life, in time you save the world."" The violence and cruelty of the film make it unsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound judgment. A definite collectors item, and if they haven't shown this to your teens in high school, they ought to. This is a reminder of the inhumanity man can reach if he has nothing to stop him."
"Steffi_P","10","15","23","1 January 2012"," ""Not the work â the presentation""
","One of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, I mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. The more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone â each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see â the one-armed man and the civil engineer â are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them ""Nice things cost money"". Eventually he will be buying human lives.<br/><br/>In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained faÃ§ade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous â his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama â but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.<br/><br/>And this â the life â is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this."
"johntravolta12345","Null","15","23","19 December 2011"," A breathtakingly poignant masterpiece by Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, Schindler's List, is clearly one of the most poignant and perceptive movies of our generation. Up till now, I had simply heard such praises of the film countless times from family and friends, and had accepted them to be true. Now, after having viewed the film myself, I can attest to such a statement and much, much more. The basis of the story revolves around the life of one man â Oskar Schindler â whose subtle yet lucid transformation during the Holocaust relentlessly captures the interest of the audience. While the film is filled with many depictions of gruesome violence, it still manages to aptly display the emotions behind them in an uncharacteristically impartial way; in essence, Schindler's List perfectly presents itself as both a technical and artistic masterpiece, and is able to do so without hindering its plot in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>Rather than conforming to the framework of a classic World War II drama, the plot of this movie, as mentioned above, is more of an exposÃ© about Schindler and the reasons behind his actions. The protagonist of this film, Liam Neeson, was wisely cast by Spielberg for the role of Oskar Schindler. In my opinion, this choice was superb for many reasons; the poise and sincerity displayed by Neeson throughout the film is characteristically reminiscent of historical accounts of the real Schindler. He flows through his many roles, as a womanizer, businessman, humanitarian, and lover, with a fantastic sense of ease and genuineness in his actions. The other protagonist, Itzhak Stern, was played by the widely renowned Ben Kingsley who, once again, failed to disappoint. In fact, I would argue that the casting of Kingsley alongside Liam Neeson gave their relationship in the film a whole new perspective. As the pragmatist in Schindler's business, Kingsley is initially afraid of the Direktor, but quickly comes to terms with his impulsiveness and stubbornness. This leads to a remarkably subtle relationship between them that is even further accentuated by their stark physical and emotional contrast. The primary antagonist in the film, Amon Goeth, was also masterfully cast by Spielberg and his crew, but I have some complaints as to his portrayal as a psychopath in the film. Although Ralph Fiennes did a remarkable job emulating the nuances of a Nazi officer, his role as the Commandant of PÅaszÃ³w gave the impression that he was mentally ill, which, in my opinion, takes away from the effect of his arbitrary cruelty. However, the script and dialogue aren't by any means his responsibility, and he definitely did an amazing job with what he was given.<br/><br/>My personal favorite part of the movie was definitely the closing five minutes in which Schindler has to flee, and the workers are liberated by a Red Army dragoon. This scene is a great culmination to all that happens in the movie, and carries a bigger emotional impact than even the horrifying scenes of Auschwitz. It also captures the essence of the enduring relationship between Schindler and Stern without being melodramatic or unnecessarily maudlin. Schindler's breakdown regarding his inability to save ""a few more"" helps solidify the audience's perception of his benevolence, while also hinting at the doomed fate of the others. When the throng of Schindler's Jews morph into their descendants today, this emotional impact is given a touch of reality. This sudden influx of authenticity makes the rest of the movie even more moving too, and does well to evoke genuine sympathy rather than pity from the audience.<br/><br/>Arguably, the most remarkable thing about Schindler's List may be its ability to present a relatively neutral view on such a historically stigmatized topic. The movie pretty much tells it how it is (or was, really); yet, contrary to intuition, this makes the moral ramifications of the film even more profound than they would have otherwise been. As Ebert points out in his review's conclusion, the reason why Uncle Tom's Cabin has been met with so much disdain is because of Stowe's relentless commentary on the flaws and evils of slavery. Such triteness can often incite argument rather than agreement, and so, in my own opinion, it's best to leave the moral judgment to the viewers, and simply focus on the story, as Spielberg has done. When I finished watching this film, the first thought that I had was to juxtapose the pre- and post-war Schindlers, and to compare their values and goals as individuals. By doing this, I found that the primary moral lesson that I take away from this film is that by helping others, you are really helping yourself. This is rarely in materialistic terms, of course, but a clean conscience and contentment with yourself is more than any man can ask for â after that point, there is no fear of pain, no paranoia of death; after that point, your life is fulfilled and desire loses its value; after that point, you are the strongest person out of anyone, although you may seem weaker in appearance. This is exactly what Oskar Schindler achieved, and through seeing his actions I think others will take away a similar, albeit paraphrased message too.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd like to discuss what audiences this film is most geared towards, and my interpretation of its intended purpose on such audiences. Besides the age and maturity factor, I think that this movie will appeal to all sides of the genre spectrum,and is definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't already seen it. Overall, no matter how hard I tried, there is very little to complain about this film, and countless things to praise it. Therefore, out of 4 stars, I would give Schindler's List a full 3.9 for its masterful direction, stunning screenplay, thought provoking dialogue, mind-boggling imagery, astonishing characterization, and much, much more. This movie will clearly go down in history as an indubitable classic, and will undoubtedly be referenced for many generations to come."

This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on.

In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.<br/><br/>Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement."

"Wombat-46","1","352","727","31 May 2000"," Over-hyped and not over quick enough
","This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Only Steven Speilberg could take an astonishing story of courage and determination in the face of hideous oppression and turn it into a poorly made schmaltz-fest like this. Chief in a series of tacky, amateurish filming techniques is the legendary ""girl in red coat"". Having decided on black and white in an attempt to show that he can be serious about something, the paucity of Spielberg's imagination is clear in that he can think of no other way to make the girl stand out and be recognised - he seems to think that his audience is incapable of recognising, say, a face, and has to hammer home the identity of the girl by presenting her in an entirely different way from everybody else in the film. The monumental cheesiness of the closing scenes with the people saved by Schindler goes way beyond the point of tackiness - just more evidence of Spielberg's extraordinarily sentimental side sabotaging what should have been a meaningful film. On the plus side, most of the acting is superb, but on the whole the film sensationalises the violence and oppression which it should have set out to attack. Oskar Schindler was such an extraordinary man that his remarkable story, which everybody should know, deserved far, far better than this."
"Mr Lombardo","1","348","719","24 April 1999"," Black and White
","I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do.  Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both.  In neither case does he succeed.  One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler.  Why did Schindler do what he did?  The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice.  Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive?  Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint.  It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material.  He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are.  This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!"

The thing is every scene is interesting but is kind of like a paper you have to write for uni or school and it has a word count you can't exceed even if everything you have written is relevant some of it still needs to be cut out, and the same goes for this movie, some scenes should be cut out even though there was no one scene that stood out as unnecessary.<br/><br/>So 9/10, one thing I must say is that when checking actual reviews here I'm surprised it has the 8.9/10 rating since the majority has been 1/10 reviews."

","The P.H. Metric 91/100 Directing: 9/10<br/><br/>A masterclass in direction. Spielberg's connection to the source material pushed him to make something that defies any sort of dilettante criticisms.

Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time.

Visually perfect.<br/><br/>Editing 10/10<br/><br/>Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 8/10<br/><br/>The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.<br/><br/>Writing: 8/10<br/><br/>The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.<br/><br/>Production Design 9/10<br/><br/>Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.<br/><br/>Costume Design 9/10<br/><br/>Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.<br/><br/>Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10<br/><br/>Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white."

"leahtinclair","10","42","75","29 September 2017"," My Response to Schindler's List
","What I learned about the Holocaust in the film 'Schindler's List' is that it teachers us about the horrors of the Holocaust and the nature of genocide. It also gave me the insight of what happened by showing a horrific number of deaths. The movie was shown through the eyes on the outside(Nazi's) and then through the eyes on the inside(Jews). This gave me more of an understanding. The first stage of the Holocaust was 'definition'. Jews were forced to wear the Star of David and shown as a threat. The second stage was 'segregation'. Jews were now forced into ghettos. The fourth stage was 'concentration camps'. Jews were sent to these camps to work and do free slave labor. The fifth stage was 'extermination camps'. Gas chambers were disguised as showers. By 1945, six million Jews were executed. The final stage was the 'aftermath'. Camps were liberated.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler changed drastically from bad to good throughout the film. At the beginning Oskar was a greedy, money loving, womaniser but as the film progressed we were shown key moments that changed Oskar. The first key moment was when cities were being evacuated of Jews, Oskar see a little girl in red being evacuated and this left him shocked. The second key moment was when the bodies were being burned, Oskar noticed the very same red clothing the little girl was wearing. These moments, I think were major factors that led to his change.<br/><br/>Based on the events in this film, I do believe that one person can make a difference. I feel that Oskar was influenced by how the treatment the Jews were receiving etc. but also how the Nazi's were carrying on like animals, thinking they can do whatever pleased them. Oskar noticed all these actions and in a way he did act alone because he gave away personal items to get what needed to be done.<br/><br/>My own personal response to this film is that it was 100% worth the watch. All the awards the film won were all well deserved because in my opinion, it made me realize just how horrendous and cruel it all was. From an educational view, I think this is a film that every student should see because it is a major moment in history that will never ever be forgotten. The film was depicted so superbly."

"ckbarbour","9","43","77","19 March 2018"," Steven Spielberg's best work to date
","Zephaniah 1:15: That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of Shoah and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness. It wasn't until today that I could appreciate and understand how well that verse described Steven Spielberg's 1993 movie Schindler's List. It made me realize this was not just a movie about Oskar Schindler, but a tribute to the Jews deep religious devotion and conviction that made it possible for them to be strong to enough endure the hell they went though and give them the faith to believe in and trust in a man like Oskar Schindler. This was just not about genocide but about a religious prosecution that rocked the world on its foundation and that still has a bearing on World Religion and politics today. 
Schindler's List comes to life in war torn Poland, where the Nazi's had invaded and taken over. They have ripped the Jews lives apart piece by piece. They had been told they had to leave their homes, most of their belongings and register their families in the big cities. Upon their arrival, they were humiliated, harassed and herded off like livestock to live in an overcrowded, run down ghetto community. This is the true story of how their lives and the life of Oskar Schindler became a part of that dark part of history together. Liam Neeson played the role of Oskar Schindler, a materialistic opportunist who was a part of the powerful Nazi party member. He became acquainted with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) a Jewish accountant, to get the capital, he needed to open his Polish Factory, Deutsehe Email Waren Fabrik. As the horrendous treatment of the Jews escalated around Oscar and his factory's future started to unravel, the relationship between him (Liam Neeson) and Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) changed from that of an employer, employee nature to that of a friend or confidante. As the movie progressed the audience saw him evolve from the opportunist individual he was in the beginning, to the man he became in the end. He risked everything to save their lives, the lives of those whose name was on his list, Schindler's List. They called themselves Schindler Jews, they honored him in life and in his death for his sacrifice for them. Whether a person is a Steven Spielberg fan or not, this story needed to be told in order to honor Oskar Schindler and the brave souls that lived and died during and after the time of the Shoah."

","IMDB - Review of Schindler's List<br/><br/>Director:
Steven Spielberg 
Writers:
Thomas Keneally (book), Steven Zaillian (screenplay) 
Stars:
Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler), Ralph Fiennes (Amon Goeth), Ben Kingsley (Itzhak Stern)<br/><br/>This a true story of the Holocaust and an atrocity of the purest of evil. The theme of good vs evil and morality plagues this film. Decisions made by the three main characters; Oskar, Amon & Itzhak throughout the film depicts the disposition of their thoughts, actions and morals. Stern is a humble Jewish man living his life and working to support his family but uprooted in the worst ways because of the war. Oskar at first sees the War as a vehicle towards his ambition in becoming a successful businessman and prove to his wife, friends and hometown that he has made it in life. Amon Goeth is the Officer in charge of the concentration camp in the Krakow that becomes close acquaintances with Oskar. He ultimately makes the decisions that Oskar constantly asks of him, such as the buying of the Jewish people at the end of the film.
Schindler's List tells the story of a failed business man named Oskar Schindler, who is of German ethnicity. The timeframe is set in Krakow, Poland during World War II. It is at the start of the German army forcing Jewish people into the Krakow ghetto and stripping them of all their rights before Adolf Hitler is set to impose his Final Solution, being the Holocaust. Oskar has failed at previous business ventures before and decides on a new route. His plan is to befriend high ranking German Military officers and use this leverage towards being able to start up a factory selling pots and pans to the German military. He has used up all his funds while implementing this friendship and is now in need of more capital to run the factory. He befriends a Jewish accountant named Itzhak Stern to both oversee his factory, and more importantly fund it as well. Itzhak gains the trust of other Jewish people to invest in Oskar's idea. In turn Oskar tells them that he will employ their family and friends and give them finished goods such as pots and pans to trade in the ghetto, which is worth more to them than their monies. Throughout the film we see Oskar's character swaying from greed to empathy as he sees the Germans plan for the annihilation of the Jewish race. He uses his funds that has made him rich over the course of the war to buy as many Jewish people's freedom and stave off being sent to the death camps implemented by Hitler.
This film garnered several Academy Award nominations and wins. Although this is a true story, we can claim because of the theme that it compares to a superhero film such as Batman or Superman; because the main character is the one fighting for good versus evil. Oskar does not have super human powers but because of his actions; families, offspring and names have survived. Oskar's character always waned in decision but made the best decision that he could in the eyes of morality. 
Cinematography and lightening were huge ways for the director to show this theme throughout. It set the audience with a feeling of empathy, hatred, helplessness and sadness. The fact that the entire film was in black and white was significant. It made the claim that everything was surrounded by evil because of the darkness and that at various points light such as Shabbat candles and the little girl in the red coat tried to shine through the darkness. Another significant technique was the camera close-ups of the Jewish people's personal effects, such as eye-glasses, gold plated teeth, luggage, and so on. This showed to the audience that the Jewish people were nothing more than inanimate objects to the German soldiers and worth nothing except the value that they could extract from these objects.
The atrocities that Hitler and the German people committed against the Jewish population, the staggering numbered killed during WWII and the Holocaust, goes to show that there can be no greater evil than this."

"kitsuyuutsu","8","43","77","3 November 2017"," Watch and decide for yourself...
","There are a lot of negative reviews on here... Most of those focus on the fact that Nazis weren't as bad as how they depict them. I suppose that's a matter of opinion. And, as we know, opinions are like assholes, everyone's got one. Honestly, the fact that they exterminated so many people (and not just Jews) because they felt them to be ""inferior"" doesn't make Nazis all sunshine and rainbows. Were they an efficient society? Yes. Did that make them superior to people of other faiths or races? No. No matter how you look at it, everyone has their own definition of good and evil and levels thereof. It all depends on your point of view. And how Spielberg views exactly how evil he felt the Nazis were should not be the sole basis of a movie review. My apologies to those who think otherwise. Now, as for the movie itself, it is a bit dark and depressing. But then again, the real life events weren't like a Club Med vacation. If you know anything about this particular period of time, you shouldn't expect cheerful. If that's what you want, go watch something else. My son watched this in history class in high school (I had to sign a permission slip because of the nudity and content). When he saw it was on one of the movie channels a year later, he told me I should watch it, that it was such a good movie. Now... my kid loves video games and Pokemon. That's pretty much it. He hates to read and hates historical anything. So when he said it was good and I should watch it, I knew I had to see it. I must admit, I was engrossed from the beginning. I had never heard of Oskar Schindler before this movie (when I was in high school, they didn't delve much into WWII) and I found his story fascinating. He risked a lot to save the lives of a lot of people. Whether or not he profited from this financially or not is kind of irrelevant. What's most important is that he wanted to save lives when the rest of the Nazis wanted to kill them all off. And the very fact that these people, who are shown at the end honoring his grave, shows me they held him in high regard, which I found moving. And I'm not easily moved. From an artist aspect, I think this was very well done. The use of black and white was quite appropriate for the content and also allowed for the few splashes of color to help the viewer focus on something important you may not have noticed otherwise, like the little girl in the red coat. As for people who complained about Spielberg... You may not think this his best movie or some sappy piece of fluff he cranked out. For those who felt that way, I'd like to ask that you go read some of the trivia items. He doesn't get a dime from this movie. He wants everything he could get donated. Mind you, he could have just donated a chunk of money, but this was obviously something he felt strongly about. I consider that to be more than admirable."

Oscar Schindler was a Nazi embroiled in the holocaust and the second world war.  He managed to save his friends, yet profited from concentration camps.  Ok, so he wasn't an anti-semite bent on destruction, but he only saved people he was connected to, and their families.<br/><br/>And the evil Nazis in this film are all slightly comical.

This is a masterpiece, empowered by amazing acting, directing, filming and attributes. I've been taken through a rollercoaster of emotions. From fear, to anger, to joy, to grief.<br/><br/>Schindler's List (1993) is an amazing movie, so I wasn't surprised that it was directed by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson has done a very good job acting as Oskar Schindler. He has portrayed his emotions very well, helplessness as well as showing true power. Ralph Fiennes hasn't disappointed me either as he showed us great insanity throughout the movie.<br/><br/>While Oskar Schindler himself was a man of innocence, he was not innocent at all. He had taken part in the entertaining side of Nazi activities willingly. Many will say it was done for the greater good. People who actually watched the movie, will know that a big part of Schindler himself told him that he's acting dangerously and should stop helping humanity but rather help his bank account. But an even bigger part took out on his emotions and actually helped the Schindler Jews - later on in the movie. <br/><br/>I'm very happy that the good side of Oskar Schindler took over. He said himself, 'war brings out only the bad in people. Just the bad.', ironically!<br/><br/>The little details throughout the whole movie have very much amazed me. Every gory scene showing massacred Jews, intense shooting scenes, SS activities and so on. His list looked just like names. His golden Nazi pin looked just like gold, not like a person. But actually seeing the bad that was done to innocent Jews, has made a huge difference up to this day. Still, I am more touched by visuals than by mere numbers. Actual persons, actual blood and actual pain. It was all shown, and I'm glad it was. It makes one realise what the war was actually like. Even the noir filming did not matter. Everything came out just as emotional.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend this movie to everyone who wants to know what a powerful but good man does during the second world war, or how Jews were treated."

","'Schindler's List' is one of the most important, illuminating, admirable, and beautiful films ever made. It is also one of the most enigmatic, unnerving, and demoralizing ones ever made. This makes for a most interesting combination. What this translated into for me was that it took me several viewings to finish the film, finding it necessary to pause to recollect my thoughts, both wishing to remember emotionally overwhelming scenes and to let myself realize that this is history. And quite recent history. As much as I wish this were another story of some fictional premise, I would be in denial, which is exactly what this film aims to alter. Because of these very reasons, Holocaust films are usually not very successful. 'Schindler's List' remains as a preeminent exception to this. <br/><br/>I was amazed to learn that Steven Spielberg was behind this masterpiece. Apparently, among other great directors, Scorsese & Polanski were also given the opportunity. And I am damn glad it was Spielberg who ended up with it. But I have to admit I would not have said this before seeing what he can do; apparently the variety of his talents. The same man who brought us the Indiana Jones & Jurassic Park series. Where is the Hollywood action? The pizazz? The overdone glamour? Even his more serious films, Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Munich, seem to be done by a completely different director. To me, they all pale in comparison to this film, which I confidently assert as the quintessential Holocaust/Nazi film. <br/><br/>Spielberg's choice to film in black & white illustrated the foresight and vision of a master. Furthermore, his selection of what minimal color would be used (bookend scenes & the young girl's red coat) was pure genius. It gives the film a timeless quality, yet matching the feel and style of the time of the events, rather than the time of filming. Whether or not intended, the film also drew parallels to Italian Neorealism, traditionally filmed on location, with some unprofessional actors, telling the stories of struggle and everyday life. The girl's red coat was a conspicuous way to make a visually beautiful statement. Our eyes are drawn to this unexpected, sparse, vivid infusion of color. ""Look at me,"" it says. ""You can try to be in denial, but this is really happening. You cannot pretend it isn't These deaths, this injustice, this wrong is not going away on its own."" And, in fact, it is when Schindler realizes that the girl he observed so silently only days before is now gone forever, signaled only by her red coat, that he sees this and begins his dramatic character shift. The second use of color, in the bookends, seems to be primarily for the candles. Both scenes portray a family observing The Shabbat. In the opening bookend, before the start of the war, we watch two votive candles melt away into nothing; in a beautiful use of cinematography, the last of the smoke from the candles, lightly colored, dissolves and transforms into the black and white smoke from a train arriving in Krakow, Poland. A title card announces World War II. In the closing bookend, to signify redemption and the renewal of hope, these same candles are relit; color is renewed."

","SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil."

","Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.<br/><br/>In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.""<br/><br/>Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.<br/><br/>The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.<br/><br/>John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.<br/><br/>Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.<br/><br/>Schindler's List â ââââ (8/10)"

","The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age."
"alina_bav","10","16","25","19 January 2014"," All about it
","Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.<br/><br/>Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.<br/><br/>Principal photography took place in KrakÃ³w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz KamiÅski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.<br/><br/>Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget ($35.6 million in 2014 dollars). It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004."

","after watching this felt like we were there in some corners in second world war.A very beautiful, epic and dark story about courage and the desire of living, a masterpiece made by Steven Spielberg this is one of those films which if you didn't like it, you have got no heart.Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, ""Isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf."

What I have observed more as specific talent and skill of the director is mood and tone of the film being transformed to the audience; heartbreaking sequence of the film where Jews are moved toward the gas chamber and moments later where the smoke comes out is utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it, also the camera shot choice and composition makes the sequence identical.The hand-held camera in some sequences has achieved the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view. For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene."

True, the acting in this film is topnotch, the direction is basically flawless, but it's the music that makes this film. Seriously I dare anyone to hear those violins crying and not cry themselves.<br/><br/>There is something extremely powerful in it and I truly believe that the film would not be half of what it is without it, that feeling of horror, stupor mixed with anger and outrage that I personally felt at the end of this film mainly stems from the power of the music. Of course I'm not taking anything away from the actors and the director which were all BRILLIANT , but I just felt that there hadn't been enough said about John Williams..."

","So here we go in my 80th review, in this November 28th 2013, coincidentally the day of an American Holiday Thanksgiving Day. Nothing better in fact than watch a very good film in that special date for those who celebrate it, and for sure, Schindler's List is the perfect film. It's very clichÃ© to say that, because as we all know it is a very popular and acclaimed film from both critics and audiences, and is widely regarded as one of The Greatest of All Times, but even with these accolades, i think i need to say it's a great film, because it has everything you can seek in a film. It's sad, it shows how the war can affect otherwise normal people as GÃ¶th_masterfully interpreted by Ralph Fiennes_ in wicked and psycho assassins, which believed so much in the Nazism that he turned into a disturbed man.<br/><br/>But unlike Schindler himself says in the film's beginning, a war also can turn a 'bad' person in a 'good' one, perhaps. Schindler was a completely egocentric person, but after the vision of the girl in red which contrasts with the black and white scenario. She clearly has a specific allegoric sense, and so had the candles. Then he starts to help the Jews, and he really did everything that he could do to help them, until the war's end. <br/><br/>And despite my despise for these conventional 'black and white' characters, this film works very well exploring these, i must say, one-dimensional characters. With an exception to GÃ¶th,of course, because he had various faces in the film, though all due to his madness.<br/><br/>I don't need to say that the cinematography and art design were fantastic in this film. It Principal photography took place in KrakÃ³w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary.

","This film IS a masterpiece! Spielberg infused his camera-work with urgency and attention to detail and he never strays away from horrific images, and then he films them just enough so they make an impact, never over the top... This is a rare movie which genuinely made me feel sad, happy, anxious and horrified in one afternoon, I can't think of an able counterpart... Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people... It's incredible just how he pulls it off; In my opinion he made the movie, it wouldn't have worked with some other random actor.And not to say that I'm trying to justify Nazi movement, on the contrary, I'm only saying these people need to be understood and their actions put in a greater context, maybe Amon is a bad example, but a lot of those foot soldiers were just following orders. We can't just tag them as evil, as that's not enough, don't forget- they were able to seduce a complete nation, you can't do that just by playing evil, other factors come into play.It is exhausting movie to sit through, but in a good way, I would urge everyone ,as I have my complete family, to watch this milestone in cinema, such is its cultural impact... Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves... Only by including this film into mandatory school viewing can we only prevent that horrible event from happening ever again. People must understand, it's the only way to go about it..."

","Absolutely Great film. Very moving and definitely a must see. Shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in colour, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning. When Oskar Schindler visits a night club, he looks like a 1930s movie star as his cigarette smoke spirals above his head, his eyes hidden in the shade.<br/><br/>It is the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler which captivates right to the end. He is transformed from physically imposing, charismatic philanderer to the humbled man, wishing he had saved more lives.<br/><br/>You watch nervously as he tries to save over a thousand Jews from almost certain death in concentration camps by getting them to work in his factory. He bribes officials and befriends Nazis including evil camp commandant, Goeth, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Spielberg has cleverly juxtaposed Goeth and Schindler as two sides of the same coin. They both love the finer things in life, easily swayed by money and women. Playing on this, Schindler tries to show his contemporary that power can be better served by sparing people's lives rather than taking them. It is an idea that Goeth acknowledges, but is destined not to adhere to for long.<br/><br/>The film finishes on a powerful note in present day with the real Schindler survivors and their descendants visiting his grave. It is the final reminder that this is a true story of one man's bravery and that in ""saving one life, you save the entire world""."

His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.<br/><br/>The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.<br/><br/>The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!<br/><br/>Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema."

","This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust wasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure, it's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering that makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next, some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that they haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely hasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way, Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That's why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong oak finally crumble was too much. <br/><br/>Pairing: ""Empire of the sun"": another war, another tragedy, another hope...."

","Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.He has directed family films (""E.T.""), horror films (""Jaws""), science fiction movies (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and even quite a few mature, adult dramas. ""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.<br/><br/>It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.<br/><br/>Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!<br/><br/>This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...<br/><br/>I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter."

"MovieGuy109","10","11","16","2 August 2011"," Spielberg's timeless masterpiece
","Schindler's List was the first film by Steven Spielberg since Jaws I can genuinely call a masterpiece. Schindler's List is the highlight of the 90's, a touching look into humanism and a frightening look into the Holocaust. Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood's most classic works, Schindler's List claims itself at the top of 90's filmmaking. All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized. A triumph for Steven Spielberg and the cast and crew. It is certainly the most impressive Spielberg film and perhaps the best film of the 1990's."
"pcast99-1","10","11","16","15 July 2011"," A pure utter masterpiece!
","Before I watched this movie I had heard a lot of great things about this movie, that it's Spielberg's best and one of the greatest movies ever made. And I have to say when I finally watched it, this was the only movie I knew immediately after that it was a pure masterpiece of film making. I knew this was a movie about the Holocaust, but I didn't know who Oscar Schindler was, so I had to do some research and saw he saved over a thousand Jews from Auschwitz. The movie started out a little slow, but It focused on different characters to build up depth and development. About an hour in I was so captivated by the realism and accuracy I couldn't look away even though it is very graphic and violent. The scenes in the prison camp were spot on, and each actor in this movie gave a flawless performance. Liam Neeson was perfect in the role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were great as well. I'll end by saying this movie will open your eyes to the horrors of what happened in the Holocaust, but it will also give you a sense of hope."
"neil-476","10","11","16","7 July 2011"," Outstanding
","Schindler's List comes about halfway in Spielberg's cinematic directing career (to date). It isn't his first (or his last) serious movie, but it is his best and, notwithstanding the enormous impact his entire output has had on the movie industry, I would go so far as to say it is the film he was born to make.<br/><br/>Spielberg does the impossible, in a number of ways. He takes one of the most appalling periods of how vile man can be to his fellow man and, without losing any of the emotional and visceral impact of that inhumanity, wrings something inspirational and human out of it - we watch fascinated, moved, devastated, and - if we are even halfway human ourselves - improved by the experience of watching the story unfold.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant in so many ways, not least of which is the fact that the protagonists - Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern - are no one-dimensional caricatures, created for the single purpose of delivering plot developments. No, they - and all the characters in this wonderful, harrowing film - are real people, neither all good nor all bad.<br/><br/>Watch it to see a truly gifted director exercising his art at the very top of his game, not that Spielberg has ever been anywhere else."

","This film, for lack of better words, is breathtakingly amazing. To film it in black and white was sheer genius. This most definitely is Liam Neeson at his best and as many people have said, I find it absolutely hard to believe he did not win an Oscar for best actor. Certain scenes from this film, for instance the liquidization of the Jewish ghettos is hard viewing but completely spell-bounding at the same time. Watching this film for the first time will leave you in many ways; shocked, chocked up, amazed, saddened and hopeful, (I say hopeful because this story proves that people like Schindler did have a heart and not every German or even Nazi during the Second world war was a callous heartless murderer) if not all of the above. This is worth watching 100%, if not, re-watching quite a few times, as it is a compelling, heartfelt story."
"Pycs","10","11","16","13 June 2011"," Left Me in Tears
","Very little films can do it. That is to leave me in tears, sharing the pain of the characters on screen. I've seen plenty of 'sad movies' and 'tearjerkers' over the years that I have left me emotion hollow. (Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler's List is different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You're not watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you're witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue his peers seem to be lacking: compassion. But, unlike many weaker efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to his factory. Over the story, his character develops more and more feelings for his Jewish subjects. He reaches the point where they aren't Jewish workers, but fellow human beings.<br/><br/>In that, Schindler's List is a very human story. A film that every single human being on the face of the planet should sit through, not for entertainment, but to get a first person perspective to the horrors man is capable of committing on each other. Schindler's List is a beautiful film. A miracle film. A film so emotional, down to the very last scene, no matter who you are, you will be pouring tears by the buckets."
"manyak_tazz","9","11","16","8 June 2011"," Schindler's List Film Review
","This is not a happy movie, or a feel good hit. It is a moving story of one light in the darkness of Germany. It shows the depths to which humanity can sink without God. I recommend this movie, but with warnings. It contains penury; shows violence of nature; and the subject matter is about one of the most hideous times in recent history. However, it is all in the telling of this true story; a story that should be told. Exactly, not a film for children.<br/><br/>This an elegant film and an accurate description of the Holocaust. You cannot change the Holocaust around to make it a happy. The Holocaust was a sad, dark event. The scenes of violence and nudity were relevant to this film. The brilliant director, Steven Spielberg, chose to show mild scenes from the Holocaust. I have seen a lot worse things. And the reason the film didn't show any of the other groups tortured was because Oskar Schindler saved Jews, so it was probably unnecessary to show or mention the other groups. And also because the fact that Jews were the main group targeted. The penury was important, too. In the scene of the selection in the concentration camp, the penury was necessary to make an accurate definition and the sexual scenes were there to show that Schindler was a womanizer. This film is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and everyone should watch it.<br/><br/>While it's a movie for mature audiences, the viewer shouldn't fast forward through any scene. They'll miss something if they do. Spielberg's best movie and one of the best films ever made. To many Holocaust films shy from the truth. That is sad, because it is one of the most important events in the 20th century. Watch this movie, watch it carefully, and see what you learn from itâthe nudity has a part in this film."

","I saw Schindler's list in Religion, our teachers wanted to show the evil in our world. Schindlers list did exactly what was asked of it, it showed the horrors of war and it showed how good can prevail. <br/><br/>The acting is spot on, Liam Neeson manages to put on a great show as our protagonist Oskar Schindler but I must mention Ralph Fiennes. This man's talents in portraying a ""baddie"" are truly spectacular. Fiennes manages to show the evil inside Amon Goeth,he is a cold hearted killer who has no mercy. <br/><br/>The black and white filter is also a nice touch, I'm not exactly sure what it represents but it may be to represent the fact that war is pointless. <br/><br/>Last of all I have to mention the music score. John Williams managed to create a score that fit the film perfectly. The music is sad and almost makes you want to cry. The idea to play iton a violin was smart and added to the sadness. John Williams truly deserved the Oscar and always will. <br/><br/>Schindlers list is truly a classic,directed by the great Steven Spielberg it manages to portray the horrors of war, how one man can make a difference but most important of all it showed hope."

He saved so many, the list is the creation of generations, the novel ascribed the list as ""Ark"" similar to the biblical Noah's Ark. This movie is the definition for all movies of its kind.

"Red-Barracuda","9","11","16","30 March 2011"," Spielberg's successful attempt at a serious drama
","At the time of this film's release, while he was the undisputed commercial king of cinema, Steven Spielberg had never been considered a 'serious' film-maker. With the exception of The Colour Purple he was known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of Schindler's List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was another thing he craved desperately.<br/><br/>The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more â it doesn't seem gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say Fiennes's Goeth was sympathetic â he was vile â but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.<br/><br/>On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler's List is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. The only place where he breaks is in Schindler's closing speech at the factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This minor slip-up aside, Schindler's List did prove that Spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it."
"ketgup83","9","11","16","15 December 2010"," A master piece !!!
","Schindler's list was an astounding work of cinema which was depressing and emotional but at the same time was backed by powerful performances and intelligent direction. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film. It has all the ingredients to make a goodÂ dramaÂdialogÂgood background score."

","Excluding the alleged twist of historical facts, I'm really surprised at the number of people that hated this film. The acting is phenomenal and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night showing) to tears is incredible. There's a technical kudo: review the tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city (Schindler's on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement (superior to famous 1962's The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also love some of our foreign friends' opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in U.S. history). But that's akin to saying a British film stinks thanks to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler's end-of-film breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe... Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)"

"ebsable-1","10","11","16","17 February 2008"," The best and most important movie ever made
","I think the strength of Schindler's List comes from its illustration of how the value of Jewish life to Oskar Schindler changed throughout the movie, and Steven Spielberg's way of channeling most of the horror of the Holocaust we see in terms of Oskar Schindler's reaction to it.<br/><br/>Schindler starts out as a relatively greedy man, in search of money. It seems that he will stop at nothing to make it, and mistreat any Jewish or Polish person in his quest for it. He opens a factory producing ""pots and pans"", choosing Jewish workers because they cost the least of any on the market. He sees Jewish people only as items of his factory, and ultimately there simply for his profit. <br/><br/>There is a one-armed man working for Oskar Schindler. He is executed by Nazi soldiers because they see no practical use for him. We see him shot in the back of the head. Parallel to this, Schindler is talking to an official about it, complaining, and the dialogue is constant, but the scene continues to alternate between Schindler and the official, and the dead Jewish man. We see a close up of the man lying on his back, his blood soaking into the snow, while Schindler talks of the loss of the man in terms of the money it will cost him.<br/><br/>Schindler continues to have this outlook, while Stern, his accountant, is secretly recruiting Jews from Krakow ghetto who are inevitably going to be killed to Schindler's factory, knowing their lives will be spared. Schindler realizes this, and becomes angry at Stern for doing this. Although he is angry, there is some indication that his views are changing because he makes it evident to Stern that he is angry because he is afraid German officials will find out it is happening.<br/><br/>There is a turning point for Oskar Schindler that occurs when he overlooks the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. He witnesses first hand the cruelty, and inhumane acts his country is carrying out. Here is also the most brilliant idea I have ever witnessed a movie use, and that is having the coat of one little girl in the ghetto be in color. In the midst of all the chaos ensuing around the ghetto, we see a red object moving around, and realize it is the coat of a little girl, who's parents have probably either been killed or taken away, and she is trying to find a place to go. Schindler spot her as well, and she disappears from sight into a building. Though he doesn't, we see her hide under a bed in the upstairs portion of a home. The next shot is the look on Schindler's face, and we get a sense of his character change.<br/><br/>The following portion of the movie revolves around horrific, true events that occur. A powerful strategy of Schindler's List is to show unblinkingly some of the inhumane acts done by the Nazis on the Jewish people, and to use this violence in a way that will help contribute to a world-wide assurance that events like those during the Holocaust will never happen again. Though they are hard to watch, they serve an incredibly purpose, and are justified in their presence in the movie.<br/><br/>There is a scene called ""Make me a Hinge"", where we see a man about to be executed for not making hinges at a pace that is satisfactory. Amon Goeth, the main Nazi military leader in the movie, is about to execute him by shooting him in the head when the gun jams, probably because of the cold weather, and does not fire. He tries another gun, but it too does not work. The life of the man is spared, only because the guns will not fire. This is the difference between life and death for the man; a simple annoyance to the Nazis. <br/><br/>Schindler continues to gradually Jews as people, and to value their lives, and is growing increasingly sympathetic toward them. Now, as all of the Jews around are about to be shipped to concentration camps, it is apparent to him that he has an opportunity to save some of them. Now the tables have turned, and Schindler begins to spend money in order to save the lives of Jews, by buying them from Nazi officials, and bribing others as well. In the start of the movie, Schindler saw the loss of a Jewish life as a waste of money. Now, he is wasting all his money in order to prevent as many Jewish deaths as he possibly can.<br/><br/>What happens for the remainder of the movie is a miraculous true story of the survival of more than 1,100 Jews because of Oskar Schindler's brave, self bankrupting actions. When the war ends, he is forced to flee because he is technically a criminal, buy the Allies' standards. There are two images in Schindler's List that I will never forget. The first is seeing the little girl in red later in the movie, as her dead body is being hauled away to be burned, her coat still illuminated on the screen in bright red. The second is when Schindler's car is driving away from his factory at the end of the movie. There is a shot where we see his reflection in the window. Out the window, we see Jews lined on the side of the road, passing by, all alive because of him.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg refused to receive any kind of payment for directing Schindler's List. With the funds from it, he helped found one of the largest memorial foundations today, the Shoah Foundation, to preserve the memory of the millions who died during the Holocaust. There is not a movie that I consider to be more important than Schindler's List, nor is there a director who I consider to be more honorable than Steven Spielberg."

It is beautifully brought to the forefront of the screen with care, devotion and stunning acting to portray the harsh reality that was taking place in under Nazi rule in the 1940's. Liam Neeson's performance stands alone as one of the greatest solo performances on screen for a long time. Neeson portrays the amazing man of Oskar Schindler with such regard for the qualities needed he becomes infallible in his role. It would be unjust to say that powerful scenes are lacking and are seldom shown, i feel some scenes create such emotion you feel for the characters involved.To briefly state why i felt this film deserved 9 not 10 is that i felt it just missed something, nothing significant but just something that could of brought this film towards perfection. It really strikes you that the scenes being portrayed throughout the film were real- life events, in some cases worse. I feel Schindlers list moral is in a small way similar to The shawshank redemption, the true film masterpiece, which gives a message of hope. I feel in Schindlers list this message is true to that of many Jews but also of how a man can change, how one person can change and do the most remarkable things. To finish of this review to give all credit to this film, to tell no lies this was the first time and probably only time i saw a class completely and utterly captivated by a film, which i feel in itself is evidence that this film is truly stunning."

","I would like to make my feelings known for the first time ever on the internet about one of my favorite films.  I do not think that Schindler's List is the greatest film of all time (although I am absolutely delighted that it is rated at #4 on the IMDb list and was #9 on the AFI list of the greatest films ever in the last century) but it is certainly one of the top three greatest war films of all time.  It was more than poetic justice that Steven Spielberg was finally vindicated when he was named as the Best Director of 1993 and this film the very best of that year.  What made it special for me personally (since I am an Anglophile) was that the top four acting roles went to Brits: Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler. The fact that it was filmed in black and white with stunningly effective cinematography enhanced the film's uniqueness although it was obviously an Oscar bid by Spielberg, who had agonized over whether to have the project helmed by Roman Polanski before he himself took on the burden.  (How ironic that only recently Polanski was justly honored for his great work for directing The Pianist, which I think is the best film since Titanic).  I can understand why there is a continual debate about the significance of this film, but it cannot be denied that it is a necessary work of art and a very valuable history lesson, particularly now that we are once again a nation at war with anti-Semitic totalitarianism.  I support anyone's right to free speech, but I am truly appalled that many Americans want to deny that there was even a Holocaust, or wish to forget what happened in the past, and find personal satisfaction in condemning this movie as overrated or mere Jewish propaganda to downplay any other horrific crimes committed by other nations in times of war throughout history.  I was not at all surprised when Titanic became such a huge hit (the biggest in fact since Gone With The Wind) that even schoolchildren began doing book reports on the subject and the entire movie-going planet seemed to erupt in Titanicmania.  Common sense will tell anyone willing to take the time to think about it that the Holocaust was the Titanic at least five thousand times over, and to be honest, I would rather drown in freezing ocean water two miles deep in the dead of night than face death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. I still think it was ridiculous that James Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the victims of history's most celebrated shipwreck at the end of his Oscar acceptance speech, when Steven Spielberg merely (and politely) asked that the nation's schoolteachers ""please teach this in your schools"" when he was so honored for making a film about the most ghastly crimes of the millennium.  There is a huge difference between escapist entertainment and serious enlightenment when it comes to movie making.  Just ask Steven Spielberg, who has also directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever made. His heart's desire is clearly the driving force behind all of his films; Schindler's List most of all."
"heywood100","9","11","16","18 March 2003"," Spielberg's Masterpiece
","While trying to remember them off the top of my head, every other Spielberg film I've seen (with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan) has been an over-sentimental crowd-pleaser. If you think about it, Schindler's List could well be accused of the same - it's all perfectly designed to tug at the heartstrings (especially the modern-day section at the end) and I've certainly never met anyone with a bad word to say about the film. The difference, the thing that makes Schindler's List different from all those others, is that no amount of schmaltz could diminish the power of Oskar Schindler's story.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is not a lyrical, wistful treatise on the horrors of war. For the most part it is a bone-crushingly upfront recounting of the personal and collective horrors faced by the Jews during the Second World War. Some of the more violent scenes are reminiscent of the opening from that other Spielberg classic, Saving Private Ryan. The difference is that while many of those in Saving Private Ryan became soldiers and put themselves in the line of fire by choice, the people in Schindler's List are innocent of any crime and absent of any choice. The indiscriminate killings and attitudes of most of the Germans, and particularly Amon Goeth (played excellently by Ralph Fiennes), chills to the bone, as does the well known appearance of the little girl in the red coat who provides one of the few splashes of colour in an otherwise aptly dark and dour film.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler himself makes a transformation, from cold-hearted factory-owner using the Jews to make money into a man so disgusted by the crimes of his fellows that he puts his own life at risk to save others, that is so obvious and predictable that it should feel contrived. But it doesn't. And I have no doubt that there are other glaring faults throughout, but it would take a crass mind to even notice them, let alone write them down. The power and scale of this film (the amount of extras used is unbelievable, like one of Eisenstein's films) are the things that win out, and will continue to win out for generations to come. If Spielberg is remembered for just one film, it will surely be Schindler's List."
"brandywine191","Null","11","16","5 March 2003"," One Hero's Story
","""Schindler's List"" begins in September of 1939 at the start of WWII. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory at the beginning of the movie and needs Jews to work in it for free.  Although he doesn't pay his workers with cash, they receive something more valuable in the end--their freedom and their lives.  In the beginning, Schindler is only out to make money, but by the end of the movie, has given up everything to help save the lives of over 1,100 Jewish people.<br/><br/>Spielberg is trying to tell Schindler's true story so more people will know the truth about him and his contributions to help the Jews.  Schindler isn't made out to be a saint, however, as he loves women and mingles with the Nazis.  Spielberg also wants to show how one man can make such a difference in the world.  Although Schindler feels he could have spared more lives, Spielberg illustrates that countless generations live because of his concern and generosity.<br/><br/>The black and white film gives the movie more authenticity and realism. The little color used was utilized very effectively.  At times the film is hard to watch, as it is gory, vulgar, and contains nudity, but much of it is needed for the full effect of the film.  After seeing scenes that depict how the Jews were treated in the ghettos and death camps, we have some understanding of what they lived through.  Spielberg pieced the elements together to make the movie as close to actuality as possible.  It is an informative and heartbreaking story that is very well put together."

","I can't believe I've finally seen this movie, after 11 years!  This is Spielberg at his best, it must have been tremendously emotional to have watched the first run of this masterpiece.  I'm not going to give a university professor like analysis of this movie, but suffice to say, it was worth the wait. Obviously there are several horrific moments of human brutality that we witness, but when I finished watching the movie, it wasn't so much the random killings and scenes of mass carnage that affected me the most...no, it was the sheer hopelessness that was portrayed by the Jewish prisoners. The feelings of utter doom, separation of families, and watching the children being hauled off to Auschwitz.  I say this, because in some ways, I was prepared for the scenes of mass burnings and atrocities, thanks to the old 16mm high school history films back in the early 70's (remember those?). Ralph Fiennes is absolutely chilling and brilliant in his role, but it's Kingsley and Neeson that really steal the show.  I've always admired Kingsley....I think his role in Ghandi is one of the top three performances of all time.  He's truly the voice and conscience that we witness penetrating the soul of Schindler. But let's get to Neeson's role in this movie.  To put it bluntly, how he never won the best actor for his role in this movie is beyond me.  It's simply stunning.  Don't get me wrong....Tom Hanks was great in Philadelphia, but I have to rate this performance as POWERFUL! One of the most powerful aspects of this movie was at the end, when they brought out the survivors along with the respective actors who played their role, and put the stones on Schindlers grave.  I had tears in my eyes....this must have had a tremendous impact on the actors.  So that's it....a simple summary to a complex movie in a horrific period in our history.  It reminds us of the evil that has perpetrated in the hearts of men in the past and continues to do so in the present.  This is a movie not to be forgotten and should be watched by all who enjoy top rate acting."

By just showing when Nazi soldiers shoots a jewish worker through the head because of this old mans culture and his handicap (one arm) gives people a hint of the cruelty that enrages when misunderstanding takes place. Seven Spielberg is a master of filmproductions and shows that sometimes movies are needed to make people open their eyes. The story is great, and it's special effects too. This beutifull masterpiece also is filled out by John Williams fantastic score that touches your heart. If you don't like this movie (or find it boring) you do not have any compassion to fellow man.

","I didn't expect much before I saw this film, but when I did, I was blown away by what I saw. Everything about this film was excellent. Based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, this film succeeds in every area. The performances by the lead actors which include Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are top notch and as ever the directing by Steven Spielberg is wonderful. This has to be one of the best films Spielbreg has directed (and he has directed quite a few decent ones). What I thought worked very well on this film was using black and white. When Neeson's character was watching the little girl in the red dress (which was in colour), you could really tell that that was what he was focusing on. Now I'm not one who normally breaks down when watching a movie but I was close when watching this. The horror and cruelty that those Jews had to undertake was unbelievable. I have to say Spielberg is a genius when it comes to directing films. Before this film in the very same year he released Jurassic Park, another brilliant film and all the rewards he took home in 1993 he deserved."

"Robbo-3","10","11","16","14 June 2002"," A Great Film - makes you realise how lucky you are......
","This film is a must see for anyone, it is based on the true story of Oskar(Oscar) Schindler and his brave heroic saving of many lives during and after World War 2.<br/><br/>There is no way to explain how much Schindler did and must have gone through to achieve what he did. This is not a sci-fi film but a film of one mans manipulation of using evil people to save lives. The way Schindler risks his own life by cleverly ensuring that he has made friends of the most powerful nazis in the area he lives and works in, to ensure that if things go against him he has an 'escape route' shows the mans intelligence.<br/><br/>One of the main things that has to be said about Schindler was that he certainly never could ever be classed as a racist, or as some have suggested using the jewish people to save his own skin. This as shown in the film is far from the truth, Schindler is awake to the evil actions of the nazis and their intentions to wipe them from the face of the planet.<br/><br/>For anyone thinking of watching this great film that is in two minds as to whether to or not - the answer is go for it you will not be dissapointed. The film as I say is based on fact and not to be sniffed at when looking at what Schindler did for the jewish people, he saved the lives of many many jews and of course their offspring, many jewish families today owe their lives to Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>One of the best films ever made in my opinion and will always be rated as such.........."
"brichtr1","10","11","16","30 May 2002"," frighteningly realistic
","Reading some of the other comments i noticed that the only reason the film is EVER criticized is because of the fact that 1. It doesn't say how the war started blah blah it's just about the poor old Jews and 2. they always make the Germans the bad guys.. well i have much to say about that but first of all.. this isn't a STORY ABOUT HOW WWII BEGAN. It's a story about how one man saved hundreds of lives and countless generations. And about the 'poor old Jews'... More than 7 million jews were killed during the Hacaust. A period of less than a decade. Even if this many had died in a century, it's still unbelievable. So maybe, yeah, they deserve a movie showing what happenned. Also, I know it's unbelievable, but you'd be surprised at how many people don't actually know about the Halocaust and how much more you can learn from this movie than by staring at digits in a text book. The deaths begin to actually mean something. Each person who was murdered was a PERSON. Many people fail to understand that. That may be because it so incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Also, about the Germans always being the badguys.. obviously in this case, in this movie.. THEY ARE... The director isn't going to make the nazis Canadian or something just so the Germans won't be offended! This period in history REALLY did happen, sickeningly enough, and people will just have to get used to it. So for those who gave this movie a '1' aren't seeing what this movie really is. There's a reason why this movie is the top 10 of all time... on any list.. Some people are just too ignorant and blind to see it.<br/><br/>This is what a real movie is."
"scoremasters","10","11","16","29 May 2002"," Personal thanks to Mr. Spielberg
","Mr. Spielberg: Thank you. ""Schindler's List"" is certainly more than a motion picture masterpiece. To simply attach adjectives leaves me unfulfilled, so I am compelled to leave this offering:<br/><br/>As a 40-year old American Protestant man, my only personal connection to the holocaust is my father's distinguished military service in during WWII.<br/><br/>Like so many young men in the early 1940's, my dad answered the call and joined the army in a rush of patriotism. He arrived in Europe armed only with basic training and the gear thrown on his back. He returned two years later as a decorated veteran and moved on with his life. Marriage and family and many years of hard work followed.<br/><br/>Through my childhood in the 1960's, the war was in the past and rarely spoken of. The medals he earned and the black and white photos he brought back from his tour of duty did most of the talkingÂbut only when they were pulled from their closet storage box. I spent hours looking at the pictures. Smiling soldiers, posing with their guns and tanks, or with civilians. A few showed marching columns of German prisoners. Some had smoke rising in the distance, indicating where the ""action"" was, or had been. But for the most part, they were innocent snapshots taken during the war's quiet moments.<br/><br/>The photos captured my imagination and gave my own feelings of patriotism a foundation. But I always sensed there were more pictures, the ones not taken with a camera. There must have been many images captured and stored only in my father's memories. As I grew up and learned more about the war, that sense became a certainty. Beyond acknowledgment, however, dad wasn't one to offer details of the war's darker experiences, and curiosity could never overcome my reluctance to ask about them.<br/><br/>He passed away in 1993.<br/><br/>What ""Schindler's List"" has given me, in addition to a phenomenal movie experience, is a glimpse at the images that my father didn't capture with his still camera. And those that he did capture have changed. The soldiers' smiles are different somehow. The poses aren't as carefree as they seemed to be years ago. The snapshots have lost much of their innocence.<br/><br/>Did ""Schindler's List"" do all of this? No. Age and education change perspective more than any movie. But the film certainly played a part, and it serves as a reminder with each viewing.<br/><br/>And for that, Mr. SpielbergÂmy thanks."

","The mark of a truly great movie is defined by its cinematography, script, characterization, acting, and directing. Schindler's List soars in these categories.  A film of this stature leaves an indelible mark in our minds and souls.  The haunting images of man's inhumanity to man juxtaposed with the essential goodness of man linger long after the last reel ends. Each frame exquisitely tells a ""thousand stories"" with their great attention to detail, clarity, composition, and camera angle. Coupled with John Williams amazingly poignant musical score, each and every scene infuses itself into our consciousness. In addition to the incredible cinematography, music, and story, the acting was clearly driven by a deep and heartfelt conviction of character by all of the actors.  Especially notable performances were delivered by Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. In the modern age of special effects and high action films, this film renews the truly great creative potential of some of our filmakers.  Mr. Spielberg took a bold step when he decided to finally make Schindler's List.  Shooting the film in Black and White further emphasizes the boldness and greatness of this film.  Like its great B and W predecessors ""Citizen Kane"" and ""On the Waterfront"", Schindler's List clearly takes its rightful place as one of the greatest films yet made."

"silly-7","10","11","16","7 June 1999"," Excellent movie
","Schindler's List is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films, and there countless reasons why.  Spielberg is able to portray Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a way that does justice to the character's complexity.  Through the use of black and white he brings you back to the time of the Holocaust, while using color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present.  In particular, the use of black and white to identify the Holocaust is appropriate given the brutal nature of the event.  People dream in color, but they have nightmares in black and white.  The scenes themselves help show the facelessness of the Holocaust and the horror it brought to its victims.  In particular, there is one scene in which a number of Jews are forced into a shower expecting to be gassed.  The looks on their faces, along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright. Although in this scene the Jews are not gassed, the message of this scene is there- even when Jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including those who were not killed.  All in all, Spielberg uses the medium to his advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the Holocaust, while also telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the end."

","Schindler's List is one of the best movies ever made, for many different reasons.  I could repeat what has already been said on this list about the brilliant acting, direction and cinematography.  But you already know all that stuff.  What makes the film great for me, though, is the way it shows humans at their truest, improvising and scrounging to survive.  This is what life is all about: trying to stay alive no matter what the circumstances around us.<br/><br/>The film is amazing in its restraint and subtlety.  It would have been so easy for the movie to step on a soapbox and tell us all about the negative factors that led to the Holocaust.  Instead it simply depicts one little corner of that massive evil, and shows how a few people outsmarted it, and did survive.  The film trusts our own intelligence, and lets us draw our own conclusions about why Schindler changed, and also what the Nazis were like. Another thing I loved about the film is that Spielberg resisted the temptation to paint the Nazis as mindless villains.  Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is seen as having the same passions and mannerisms as Schindler himself.  But somewhere along the line Goeth strayed from the path of good, and from that we can see that the line between good and evil is a fine one.<br/><br/>This is a masterful film.  Fantastic acting, superb pacing by Spielberg, beautiful lighting and photography, great music, and extremely intelligent and profound insights into human nature.  What more could you ask?"

","Judging a 1993 movie in 2016 &Especially that's been adapted from a Book is somewhat unfair to the Director Steven Spielberg(Who,being a Jewish,to my mind,will in anyway show Jewish in better light & Nazis as ultimate evil).World & Cinema & presentation of stories has changed a lot since 90s after all where producers & directors played to the Audiences & for their thrill rather than cater to an actual storyline. The fact that this Biography is set in backdrop of World War II & how HE viewed the events is somewhat taken away is overlooked too in light of the persecution of Jews & tragedy that a war is.""Things are omitted"" or ""It looks a simplistic version of a complicated,deep thing"" is often heard but it remains one of the best representations of Holocaust on movies ever.Point is,things get lost in adapting a book into a screenplay & Spielberg DOES add his own tidbits to make it more dramatic.If you want to explain how main characters, Oskar Schindler(Neeson),Amon Goethe (Fiennes)& Itszhak Stern(Kingsley) suddenly change colors or how they thought is explained better in the book rather than any movie that adapts the book.This review is keeping that in mind. It's a largely Black&white movie that attempts to make movie look bleak with Greyscale colors in 1993 to take viewers back to 1939 & that's an innovation worth commending.It also tries to make the story of the book into an narrative documentary about the people in it(not quite there,but does well enough). Story takes central character Schindler from Krakow,Poland to Auschwitz,Germany to his hometown,Zvitaw-Brunnlitz.He arrived in Krakow as failed businessman &with nothing & a member of Socialist Nazi party & a can-do attitude.He saw World War as a great profiteering opportunity with cheap Jewish labor from Ghetto settlement created after Blitzkrieg demolition of Polish armies.His investment in metalwork&enamelware is run by him after ruthless bargaining in goods instead of cash from ghetto&bribery of occupying SS officers & he employs his Jew accountant Stern to keep them in line with a similar philosophy.From there on,he changes a little&protects Jews in his employ,initially to protect his workforce & profits &later after imploring of his valued Stern(who uses Schindler's factory as cover to get ""essential"" workforce from oppressed helpless Jews,thus making them indispensable) &pleaders who approach him,once he's perceived as a hero & haven-provider due to Stern's efforts.His actual & final transformation into a sympathizer occurs when he witnesses violent liquidation of Krakow Ghetto by SS Army,in particular,by a little girl in Red in all the Black & white he sees running around & later on die once ghetto residents are ordered to move to Auschwitz.This is Liam Neeson at his best acting skills even if story itself seems to be clichÃ© towards the end. Best acting is however,by ever-underrated & great Ben Kingsley(overshadowed by other actors in native India as well as Hollywood) as Stern & a young,expressive Ralph Fiennes as SS Kommandant Amon Goethe.Only a book explains how stern was a real hero in background while giving credit to Schindler & escaping attention but Kingsley does that implied part justice.Also,Fiennes in a role of sadistic butcher who made a sport of hunting Jews is outstanding.His cruelty & hedonistic pleasure is even apparent in his hitting,yet protecting&loving a Jewish maid,Helen(Embeth Davidtz) who he wouldn't send to concentration Camp or wear a star. Apart from these central characters,story itself moves to given bleak series of events & cinematography which is excellent.It's a movie that deserves it's place & prizes in spite of better contemporary movies & as one of all-time greats out of Hollywood.That faceless ""Girl in Red"" is highlighted just to underline what it was that changed Schindler &Jews placing stones on his grave in the end to pay tribute in vibrant color(&thus out of bleak scenario)is a very 90's Spielberg idea to just simplify it to audiences & catch their attention.Deliberately put even if unneeded.An attempt to make a bleak movie lighter since it can't really be enjoyable.I liked it. Music&props in the movie are understandably full of gaffes if you nitpick.A 50s Billie Halliday's song playing in 40s or Krakow with post-war invented stuff is something producers will simply have to turn back time for.90s Krakow can't have 40's stuff lying around everywhere even in makeover.Most glaring one is the Railway with electric lines being used to transport Jews in prominent scenes.So,forget nitpicking & just see how great acting using those props & movie is.Kudos for a great movie & acting all round otherwise."

It's a really long movie, but one does not feel the time, as every scene and fact being told was important. However hard the subject, the movie is brilliantly and beautifully made. Kudos to the director and all the actors. The story of Oskar Schindler is phenomenal. The suffering of all the people is unimaginable and heartbreaking, who suffered at the hands of crazy animals. The story is amazingly told by Schindler's Jews and Mr. Thomas Keneally. Without their efforts in narrating the story, this movie would not have been possible today. Mr. Steven Spielberg has brilliantly picked up the most important bits and made it into a movie. The screenplay is commendable. Every actor has done justice to their characters. Specially a great variation from Liam Neeson, as the story progressed. Addition of the little girl in red coat, is very well used for the sake of the movie. It shows the exact moment, which changes everything in the movie. The movie picks up from this point and you are glued to the screen. My only suggestion would be to keep a tissue box with you while watching the movie."

","The movie is one of the fewer biography movies that I have recommended to others. <br/><br/>The portray of each and every character is spectacular. Liam Neeson's acting was no less than a pure portrayal of shear reality. He depicted each and emotion with all its perfection. From an unconcerned person to a emotional being with so much humanity is the real transformation showed by him. The difference between what you can do and what you should do is the best thing shown the movie. Though a biography still all the additional factual details are also so minute that you can not differentiate. <br/><br/>Spielberg is a gem of cinema."

","Amazing story That's all. Gripping, moving, tear jerking, uplifting, top notch acting, stunning photography, script line in sync with the book, true life ending, OMG. This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign. This is a movie (and book) you must watch (or read) to believe. I generally do not care for ""war"" movies, and although I love splatter films and gory fiction books, I despise real life violence. Having once been a victim of violent crime, I have a relationship with real life horror that I do not like to explore, but the heroism of this story so dramatically overwhelms the real horrors that it is a must see for anyone. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley along with Ralph Finnes fills out the superb acting. Difficult to watch, impossible to forget, it is truly the story of heroism on its grandest scale. The most poignant moment is the one, the only, faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film."
"nsganapathy","10","28","48","3 January 2016"," Simply an Awesome movie and a masterpiece..!
","Exceptional!! Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!"

","Out of all the movies I've seen in my lifetime, Schindler's List will always be a staple in my mind. The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>This movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.<br/><br/>Some may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian. Not to mention Steven Spielberg's direction on this is flawless. He pieces everything perfectly together, wraps it up in a bundle, and gives us an absolute masterpiece of a film.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is my favorite film. There has not been a single film that compares to my experience watching it. There has not been a single movie that has moved me and left me speechless like this movie has. The only movie that has come close to impacting me like this was Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men, and even that by comparison doesn't add up to how Schindler's List impacted me. I know some people will say ""You need a movie that you can watch over and over again that is fun and enjoyable. How can you have something so depressing as your favorite movie?"" Some will even say it's too obvious a choice. Well, you know what? It is an obvious choice, because it is obvious that this is a powerful, beautiful, and incredible film experience that excels in pretty much everything it has to offer. It's an incredible achievement and I can't wait to watch it again. Well done, Spielberg."

","This is one of the greatest films ever made. It will stand the test of time and ensure that one of the greatest tragedies in human history will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is crafted with care and precision. The cinematography is subtle and haunting and the film is beautifully shot in black and white, symbolising the duality of tyranny and hope. The acting is utterly flawless, especially Ralph Fiennes as the embodiment of Nazi oppression. However Liam Neeson is also fantastic as Schindler himself, bringing a dominant screen presence and an emotional strength.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful aspects of the film is the realism that is consistent throughout. It is as if the audience have been propelled back in time to witness the horror. The 3 hour running time allows the viewer to reflect on the 6 years, which leads to an incredibly powerful emotional climax. But as the film unfolds it's Schindler's transformation from self-serving Nazi to compassionate protector which bears the most emotional resonance. For me, this was the most striking aspect of the film, that despite the scale of the monumental atrocities, the capacity for human goodness remained."

","Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg directs this moving drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, which counteracts the realistically depicted violence revealed on screen. Spielberg maturely presents the film through an honest and sometimes disturbing lens, but it's completely necessary in telling the story with complete authenticity. The horror on display in this film exceeds anything I've ever seen, because of the painful reality. It sickens me as a person to know that this sort of thing actually happened and watching Schindler's List is not only an experience, but a history lesson that we should never forget.<br/><br/>Schindler boasts incredible, convincing performances all across the board. Liam Neeson gives a brave performance as Schindler. Like fellow Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes, who plays evil Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Neeson is not afraid to play his character as written: in Neeson's case, an arrogant war profiteer who does not realize--until the very end--the enormity of his actions; in Fiennes's case, a human embodiment of pure evil and hate. Lesser actors would try to romanticize their characters to make them more pleasant to the audience. Fiennes and Neeson wisely chose not to take that route, and make an even more favorable impression than they would have had they tried to soften their roles. Ben Kingsley (as Schindler's accountant, Itzhak Stern), Embeth Davidtz (as Goeth's Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch), and Caroline Goodall (as Schindler's wife, Emilie) all turn in the type of performance that is easily taken for granted. They are so convincing that it is easy for the audience to forget that they are actors playing roles, especially since they are in the background. While watching Schindler's, the audience does not see actors acting in a made-up world; it believes it sees real people living in the real world."

Seriously, this film makes it a point that you get emotionally inspired.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, as always, takes up a sensitive topic and carves it to perfection. Not taking in account the long running time (which is actually pretty fair) & the imbalance of narration, the story of Oskar Schindler saving a bunch of innocent Jews from the clutches of callous German Kommandants strikes a visual chord mentally, emotionally. The heart-aching depiction of cruelty on Jews, rampant corruption during World War, slavery & the magnanimity of Schindler, his friendship, his aura is all well filmed.

I once read one of the survivors of the Holocaust visited the set and started shaking when she met Ralph Fiennes because he portrayed such a resemblance of Amon Goeth. I can completely understand that. The way he acts in this movie, the way his character thinks are very well thought of. Ralph Fiennes is truly terrifying in this movie, which is a remarkable feat and an Honor to witness.<br/><br/>Secondly, I applaud the choice of Stephen Spielberg to film this movie in black and white. It makes the entire war seem sinister, dark and intriguing. The tiny aspect of the movie in color, the young girl in the red coat is beautiful.

","Schindler's List (1993), directed by the most acclaimed director Steven Spielberg is the most touching and fascinating movie Hollywood ever witnessed. The movie has Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes playing the key roles in the film. Spielberg demonstrates his creative genius by taking the audience back into the era regarded as the worst period in the history of mankind, the Holocaust. The protagonist Oskar Schindler, played quite beautifully by Liam Neeson is a true Nazi gentleman having a taste for women, liquor and money. A sense of confidence is reflected in the eyes of Oskar as he goes on to establish an enterprise having Jews as the manual labourers. It was the time when Jew labour was considered to be the cheapest and it seemed perfect for Oskar to make a successful business. He appoints a Jew manager by the name Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who once ran a factory in the Cracow ghetto. Stern does the job of recruiting Jew labour while Schindler takes care of the flamboyance (that is what he claims he is good at). The work of running a labour camp in PaszÃ³w is entrusted to Amon Goeth, a ruthless Nazi general. The Krakow ghetto is liquidated and numerous Jews are sent to allocate in the labour camps where innocent Jews are shot in cold blood by Amon for no reason and just to fulfill his immoral satisfaction. As the film progresses, a gradual change in Oskar Schindler takes place. The person who used to think only about his enterprise and the profits associated with it starts feeling a concern and a sense of sadness for the devastated Jews. The audience can literally sense the humanitarian nature evolved in Oskar Schindler. The name 'Schindler's List' pertaining to the list which Oskar prepares to bring in thousands of Jews into his company thereby freeing them from the clutches of Amon. Spielberg creates an artistic feel as the movie is shot in black and white and the viewer gets himself time-travelled in the past. The movie ends with Schindler saving more than thousand Jews thus stopping paving a way for another world. The film has a very pertinent dialogue quoted by Stern. He says ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". A Big salute to Spielberg and this masterpiece... Nudity: Yes Kissing: Mild Foul Language: No Blood and Gore:Yes"

","""Schindler's List"" is described as a film about the Holocaust, but the Holocaust supplies the field for the story, rather than the subject. The film is really two parallel character studies--one of a con man, the other of a psychopath. Oskar Schindler, who swindles the Third Reich, and Amon Goeth, who represents its pure evil, are men created by the opportunities of war.<br/><br/>In telling their stories, Steven Spielberg found a way to approach the Holocaust, which is a subject too vast and tragic to be encompassed in any reasonable way by fiction. In the ruins of the saddest story of the century, he found, not a happy ending, but at least one affirming that resistance to evil is possible and can succeed. In the face of the Nazi charnel houses, it is a statement that has to be made, or we sink into despair.<br/><br/>The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, ""Isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life.<br/><br/>What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control. Yet Spielberg, the stylist whose films often have gloried in shots we are intended to notice and remember, disappears into his work."

She is wearing a red coat the first time she is running down the road and then the second time in a wheelbarrow. This make a very large impact to the film in the way the meaning behind it being that she is alive in one scene and the next dead because she is a Jew. At this point Schindler knows that he most do something and something big. He had started off small and then wanted more. He felt that he never did enough he felt that he could have saved more. <br/><br/>This film is done as tastefully as can be with the film showing what would happen to Jews in the time of World War II. With girls be raped and forced to do things that is wrong on so many different levels. Children being ripped away from there parents and forced in to slave labor, whose who were not able to work killed. Then so much more if the Jews would hide or try to run away being killed on the spot. That this time so many people wanted to do something but would not in fear of being killed, Schindler was the man who saved the most and wanted to help in the vastest way. This is a must see film and should be shown in school while teaching about World War II."
"psfebin","9","17","27","16 September 2013"," The review on ""Schindler's List""
","This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing.<br/><br/>The Jewish saying ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled.<br/><br/>The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention."

","I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper.<br/><br/>This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it.

"StoryCharts","9","17","27","15 August 2013"," Absolute good triumphs over absolute evil
","Schindler's List is about the idea that good triumphs over evil. Small gestures of kindness can overcome the inconvenient irks of everyday life, but absolute good must rise to the occasion to meet absolute evil, no matter the cost. In this story, there is no question about the absolute evil: the innocent victims of the Holocaust (the appeasement of which implicates us all, see The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich). In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.<br/><br/>To give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.<br/><br/>This story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca."
"UnknownRealmsDotNet","10","17","27","27 August 2012"," Devastating
","Holocaust stories aren't watched for entertainment. They are more for documentation, more for knowledge. So it is no wonder this film clocks in at over 3 hours long, because like most holocaust stories, Schindler's List was made to be evidence to those not born in the time of that tragic and horrific event, not for a jaunty, fun watch. Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see."
"CinemaClown","Null","30","52","6 January 2010"," Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire.
","One of the most essential, powerfully moving & profoundly affecting films to grace the silver screen, Schindler's List is the crowning achievement of Steven Spielberg's remarkable film career that finds the master storyteller at the pinnacle of his artistry, is crafted with extreme care n dedication, and is rightfully acknowledged as one of the most honoured & significant films of all time.<br/><br/>There are many films out there that have dealt with the subject of Holocaust in the past but the level of precision, craftsmanship & commitment that Spielberg brings on the screen this time plus the emotional impact this film provides over the course of its runtime is second to none. And even after two decades, Schindler's List remains his most personal, most mature & most accomplished work to date."
"arahansehrawat","10","46","84","1 September 2017"," Stunning film, indeed. Without a doubt...
","Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death."
"Samuel-Shovel","7","39","70","3 August 2017"," Thoughts on Schindler's List
","This movie is visually stunning. Just the sheer mass of extras, set design, costumes, cinematography, and everything else that went into this movie is breathtaking. Through all this, the movie definitely pulls off a war-time atmosphere, the black & white photography only adds another element to this. The acting is (mostly) great. And the story is a good one and an important one. What Schindler did deserves our recognition, respect, and reverence. I'm glad Spielberg was able to bring it to our attention.<br/><br/>Now for the problems with this movie. First off, the length: I think this movie's 3 hour 15 minute runtime just snuck by Gandhi as the longest theatrically released movie in my viewing history. I try not to make a fuss over the length of a movie; however long the director requires to get their story across to the audience is up to them. What I do take issue with is a movie that has a 3+ hour long runtime that is completely unnecessaryÂ such as this one. This movie contains a story that doesn't need its allotted time. I think a 200 minute cut of this movie would really improve it, maybe even a straight 2 hours if you're pushing it. Too much time is taken replaying the horrors of Nazi-occupied Germany seemingly over and over again. I just want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish what happened or the emotional impact these scenes have, however when we as an audience are bombarded with scene after scene of tyrannical cruelty via the hands of the Germans, the emotional effectiveness of said scenes starts to fall under the law of diminishing returns. At a certain point, I as an audience member have no emotional energy left to invest and the effort Spielberg's putting into causing a mournful tone just becomes fruitless. With most things in life, overexposure will lead to dulling of the senses and emotional desensitization. I am aware that what is occurring on- screen is horrendous but my mind can no longer keep up with what is being presented. Sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>My next issue relates to the treatment of the protagonists and antagonists of this movie. No, there is no excuse for what the Nazis did and defending this party or their belief system is contemptible and disturbing. But as a director making an Oscar-winning Best Picture, please do not make your characters these black and white symbols of good and evil. Not every person in the Nazi regime was 100% certifiably evil; not every person representing the good guys was a sinless angel. It is up to you as a director to show us these characters, their nuances, their grey areas, and their stories as a whole. It is up to us as an audience to take in all of this and make decisions about these stories and their characters. But when a director paints all these characters in broad strokes, labeling everyone as either entirely pure or entirely evil, he or she has taken the decision out of our hands and we as an audience are forced to consume the subject matter from the pre-destined moralistic vantage point that the director has prepared for us. That is exactly what has happened here. Spielberg hold our hand through the entirety of this movie, not leaving anything up to the audience's interpretation or judgment. In Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"", we get to see the multiple dimensions to characters from this conflict. Polanski focuses more on the character development of the Nazis and Jews and less on the abhorrent crimes that were occurring. So, when we do see some kind of appalling act taking place on the screen, it is considerably more effect and haunting. But the point is that Polanski treats all characters, whether bad or good, like human beings. And, to me at least, it is much more frightening to see people with humanlike qualities behind these egregious acts of genocide. (See ""Downfall"" for another great example.) Spielberg's Nazis act more like monsters from some other dimension, far less unsettling. <br/><br/>Another issue I see with this movie is the character arc of our main focus, Oskar Schindler himself. At the beginning of this movie, we see a man who can be labeled as a womanizer, a drunkard, an opportunist, and someone who is self-centered and focused on personal wealth attainment. By the end of the movie we see a family man melodramatically balling his eyes out because he didn't give away enough of his wealth to save more Jews. (Did we really need that scene?) In theory this is a nice beginning and end point, however during the movie itself, we do not see exactly how this man went from being an egoist to a full-fledged humanitarian. Sure, the scenes involving the young girl with the red coat is supposed to represent a pair of epiphanies that Schindler has that alters his mindset similar to a Dickensian Scrooge. However, to me at least, these two scene do not do enough to cause me to buy this change. This movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes. We could spend a little of that time seeing Schindler's subtle changes over the course of the war. Instead we have this dramatic shift seemingly overnight that is difficult to swallow for me as an audience member. The character development just comes across as half-baked.<br/><br/>Despite all the gripes I have with this film, I still think Spielberg made a fine movie here. He told a beautiful story competently and with a few scenes that left me awe-struck. While the length of this film is a bit overwhelming, it is still something that I think everyone should see at least once, a very important piece of film history."

"AaronCapenBanner","10","18","29","18 September 2013"," Shattering Film Masterpiece.
","Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives.<br/><br/>Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid.<br/><br/>The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg."

","During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever.<br/><br/>I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film."

"r-mcharg","10","12","18","26 July 2003"," Just My Opinion
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Schindler's List (1993) Director: Steven Speilberg Starring: Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley Screenplay: Steven Zaillian Music: John Williams Cinematography: Janusz Kaminksi Running Time: 195 minutes <br/><br/>It's almost bad taste to call Schindler's List a movie given its documentary style and subject matter but it is a movie and an incredible one at that. We are so used to war movies that depict gun shootouts and heroics on the front line but away from all that is perhaps the TRUE horror of World War II. In 1939 war is declared and Germany defeat the Polish army in two weeks, we know that from a caption that appears in the first 5 minutes but what follows is unexpected and unbelievable. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a member of the Nazi party. He is a confident maybe-arrogant womaniser. He is also a rich businessman, the war has made his fortune thanks to cheap Jewish labour and the black market, he explains to his wife. While the Nazis are on top of the world the Jews have no world left. The most important person to Schindler's factory is Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) his Jewish accountant but his only real friend is the psychotic concentration camp leader Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). Goeth is evil personified and it is his despicable actions that lead Schindler to save over 1,000 Jews using the one thing he loves most Â money. Schindler bribes the Nazis to save Âhis' Jews from certain death at the hands of the Nazi's concentration camps. Schindler's List features some of the most powerful images ever put on screen most notably the little girl in the red coat. But there are plenty of others, the children hiding in filth, Nazi soldiers marching into the Ghettos, Goeth in the cellar with Helen Hirsch and the shower water coming down in Auschwitz. For sheer heart rending emotion, watch Oskar Schindler reduced to tears in the arms of Stern, without whom the list would not have been possible. In doing a Holocaust film, Speilberg took a massive career and personal risk but it paid off big style. He worked on this project for over ten years and every single second was worth it. He delivers to us a message that evil can be renounced and survival is possible, it just takes one man. The saying `He who saves one life, saves the world entire' is extraordinarily powerful in its own right. All this and all Speilberg wanted to do, in his own words was to tell an interesting and true story. He did that all right. The story is so amazing it has to be true but this is more than a story, this is the best movie Speilberg has and will ever make, it is also more than likely the best movie anyone will ever make and no one is ever likely to better it. The phenomenal heart-rending power and epic emotion of Schindler's List will never be outdone by anyone, even Speilberg himself."

"Robert_duder","Null","12","18","15 June 2002"," The most moving, exceptional film ever made!!
","I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality.  He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews as labor.  However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to ""buy"" Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he ""purchased"" are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't, however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 10/10"

","What can I say about this movie that will truly honor the masterpiece that it is? Well, to start with, I can say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It stirs up numerous emotions inside me when ever I see it. Spielberg- being a jew himself- has in a remarkable way, managed to re-tell the story of the destiny of the WWII jews. One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.<br/><br/>Schindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors, Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today. No one can disagree there I think. Make sure you all see this one soon, I promise you a movie so strong, you'll remember it for a long time to come."
"moviemachine","10","12","18","25 April 2002"," Excellent!
","""Schindler's List"" without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. ""Schindler's List"" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.<br/><br/>10/10"

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","12","18","2 April 2002"," Arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film ever.
","Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rockedÂ), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.<br/><br/>
As he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. The time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film. <br/><br/>Spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people Â the descendents of those that he saved during the war Â walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting. <br/><br/>With Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List, the Best Picture of the year, as well as Jurassic Park, which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Hook, the Indiana Jones films, and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as Amistad, Saving Private Ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, Schindler's List."
"White Dolphin","10","12","18","14 January 2001"," A Powerful Stunning Horrifying Movie
","How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.<br/><br/>I didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me).<br/><br/>I saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make (including many many Israelis) is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel ""Yad Va Shem"" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. When over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.<br/><br/>The movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a Jew/Gypsy/Black/Homosexual/Deformed/Handicaped/Left-Handed/Communist, etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.<br/><br/>
Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 (over The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption) it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day, and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10."
"Dodger-9","10","12","18","16 January 2001"," The most important film of the last 50 years
","In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.<br/><br/>
Intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the Nineties.<br/><br/>Schindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast - especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of release.<br/><br/>`I remember Steven saying ÂDon't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way. <br/><br/>So, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career.<br/><br/>He had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own Jewishness as a subject. <br/><br/>Following his more Âhuman' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level. <br/><br/>After offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.<br/><br/>Having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.<br/><br/>So keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start filming.<br/><br/>Old friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.<br/><br/>Both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.<br/><br/>Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.<br/><br/>Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.<br/><br/>Indeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.<br/><br/>For his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release."

","I dont mind admitting it. I am a 30-year old man, who saw this film at the cinema when it first came out. I was 24 then, and only one other film had ever made me cry (David Lean's Elephant Man). But this film got to me. Even now when I see it on Video, it still brings a lump to my throat. The cast are wonderful in the movie. What a good actor Ralph Fiennes is. They say if an actor playing a bad guy, can truly make his audience hate him, he has a gift for acting. Well, I truly hated Fiennes at the end of this movie. Not the man himself, of course, but the evil German Nazi he was playing, Amon Goertz. Having seen a documentary on Schindler a few weeks after the movie came out, Fiennes also chillingly looks like the real Goertz.<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS AHEAD... DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILM<br/><br/>The film was shot in Black and White, to add an eerily atmosphere, which made it look more realistic. But the bit I broke down to at the cinema, was the young girl that you spot in the Red Coat, running away with the rest of the people. Then a few scenes later, as the Germans are pouring the bodies of Jews into the mass Burial hole, you see the girl in the red coat come out of the wheelbarrow and into the pit. This was too much for my Girlfriend, who left the cinema. Also the ending where Schindler is apologizing to Stern for not saving more Jews was quite moving.<br/><br/>I remained in my seat, alone, and just watched as the real survivors of the holocaust, and the actors that played them were led to Schindler's Grave to lay a stone. And then the final bit where you dont actually see him, but Neeson lays a flower on the grave of the hero he had just portrayed - and so convincingly. <br/><br/>In years to come when Speilberg is long gone, I believe he`ll best be remembered for several films: Jaws, Back to the Future, Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and this one.<br/><br/>10/10."

","To say that this movie is ""great"" or ""horrible"" does not begin to define the purest form of emotion that can be drawn from a movie. ""Schindler's List"" is the closest thing to poetry that I have ever seen on film. I have always believed that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were both shafted in the Oscar category, but Oscars are only one year victories. This movie lives on as a testament to the most important event that has occurred during the course of the last century. If I analyzed how to write, direct, film, or orchestrate a film of this kind of magnitude, then I would know how to make classics, which ""Schindler's List"" is. Steven Spielberg is an artist...both in entertainment and in realism. This is a film which I have not seen for many years and decided to see again to see if it had the same impact that it had when I was younger. Now 21, I truly understand the message he was attempting to get across. It was that one man can understand the value of life through the violence and pain that surrounded him as he attempted to profit from it. Seeing it again also re-established my acknowledgement that this is one of my most favorite films of all time. A true 10 on my scale."

Liam Neeson creates a Schindler who is simultaneously a deeply flawed and compassionate man - in other words, a real, fully rounded human being, one of the best portrayals in motion picture history.  Also sublime are Ben Kingsley as Stern, Schindler's bookkeeper and confidante, and Ralph Fiennes, whose Amon Goeth reminds us just how dark and twisted the human soul can become.  No film has ever done better at capturing the depth of suffering that was the Holocaust. A work of genius - easily the finest film of the 1990s, and one of the greatest ever."

I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone faces for their respective parts.<br/><br/>The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated all the same.

Throughout the movie is noticeable the conflict experienced by Oskar who finds himself in the dilemma between saving lives and keep your business out of sight of Nazi officials. The character Liam Neeson tries not to show their feelings to factory employees and presents the most of the time a serious man. The curious thing was that Oskar Schindler was a member of the Nazi party, a fact that leads him to escape the Red Army with the end of the German army and war, it is still noticeable humanity of his character in contradiction to Ralph Fiennes character.<br/><br/>Both main actors confuse the viewer a little early because of the physical resemblance of them. The look of the film, to be in black and white makes it seem more real scenes of a past that should not be forgotten. The girl in the red dress is one of the most intriguing characters in the film representing from the blood of the Jewish people to hope.<br/><br/>A long film that had to be split in two but that still was not enough to show all the suffering experienced by the Jewish people. Many stories are told throughout the film, a way to revive the memory of those who were in this sad episode in the history of the world.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful scenes of the film, when Oskar needs to get away and all factory workers meets all their assets in gold, melt and transform into a ring given to Schindler in their match, he dressed in pajamas that thousands of Jews dressed. In this moment, Oskar gets emotional embarrassed, thinking he could have done more and thus save more lives.<br/><br/>The final finish is given in the last scene and more exciting when some of the characters in this tragedy played in the film comes up together in a field and find the actors that interpreted.

He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath.

"chrisbrown6453","8","13","20","17 June 2002"," Steven Spielberg finally pulled it all together in one film to please the adult public and the Academy Awards voters alike.
","Schindler's List did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the Academy put him at the top of their ""A"" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort, E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for ""his"" Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as Schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. The real-life Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.<br/><br/>
Also quietly impressive is that Gandhi guy, Ben Kingsley, as Itzhak, a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the Schindler empire. Newcomer Ralph Fiennes has also copped some Best Supporting Actor awards for his nasty Nazi, Amon Goeth, who heads up the Plaszow forced labor camp. When bored, Goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. Chilling. The rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen, the script is intelligent, the music is sweeping, and that cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a knockout. The complaints about Schindler's List are mostly minor. At one point Spielberg feels compelled to use a special-effects trick. It looks like a cheap cut-and-paste job. Couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? The protracted finale also got on my nerves. After the movie climaxes, the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. Mr. Spielberg, your manipulation is showing."

A great movie, didn't made me cry, maybe because of the documentary-filming..."

"gollumslider","Null","14","22","13 August 2004"," Is it REALLY beautiful?
","The simple answer to that one line summary is yes. As i read a review here once about this movie being beautiful and that's only too right. Of course it is very rough and violent, but then again it's a movie about war and about the oppression of a hole religion. The right thing to do by director Spielberg was to make this like a journalist would. And John William's music is too touching to describe.<br/><br/>Usually I dislike movies of great historical happenings or big battles and so on, but Schindler's List is an exception. Though it tells of Schindler himself, clearly the movie's real concern is the Jewish, not the one man who made that difference. And that is there as clear as it could be. What the Nazis did there on work and concentration camps is so shocking and this movie tells of that so shockingly as you can imagine. It even goes to sadistic measures with the character of Amon Goeth a bit too much at points maybe. But maybe not. That actually is the fact that makes this movie so powerful and interesting.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is one the best ever made because it is the prime of big movies. You just can't ignore all the perfectness of every single frame, shot, piece of music and of course that acting great too. But really as said this movie is about what happened during the holocaust, from the beginning to end. If you haven't seen this watch it now, because there are not many movies that match up to this. Truly and clearly the best picture of Steven Spielberg."
"scott-fuller","Null","14","22","13 August 2004"," Worthy examination of moral complexity
","In general, I do not rate Spielberg all that highly, primarily because of his history of big-budget garbage like ET and Jurassic Park - movies that appeal to the most base aspects of humanity - but I think that he redeemed himself with this movie. Firstly, if I were to be a cynic, I would say that the choice of the Holocaust as a setting for a drama that would establish Spielberg's artistic credentials is a little too obvious. I am not going to be a cynic, however, but instead will share a couple of thoughts that I have about the story. What I find is the most significant aspect of the movie is the way the character of Oskar Schindler fits nicely between his initial role as a war-profiteer through to his eventual role as a local saviour. <br/><br/>What I am saying here is that the ambiguity which a number of you have expressed regarding the character of Schindler can be answered quite succinctly whilst simultaneously demonstrating that Spielberg had not established a character whose 'virtue' was defined at the outset and which was exposed to the evils of the Nazis. The most important details about Schindler are that he was a cynical, exploitative, manipulative opportunist who always kept his real motives hidden from others. We see glimpses of this in his relationship with his wife, and the introductory scene where he essentially establishes his Nazi support-base by presenting himself as someone who he is not, but, through a convincing performance, as a confident, wealthy and important businessman (which he was not at that time). Combine this with his tactical resourcefulness in securing the capital for his enamel factory from a couple of wealthy Jews and his entrance into the Jewish underground market, and we see that Schindler cements his position in the movie as a man of power through the use of cynical, selfish methods. The moral complexity of Schindler, however, comes when he uses exactly the same methods to secure the lives of his workers. If he had not been the cynic as I described, there would have been no way for him to secure a position in which he would have been able to save the workers. <br/><br/>So for those who may have some qualms regarding Schindler as a man, the lesson is that the very vices that he had were precisely the reason why he was able to do what he did. To place this in the wider context of the Holocaust, what we learn through the movie is that in a situation that is so incredibly dire and hopeless, normal understandings about morality and virtuous character have no application. A genuinely 'good' man would have been powerless to resist the Nazi deathmachine; only a 'bad' man like Schindler would ever have been able to find a place within that climate to do what needed to be done to resist the genocide. This exploration of the dual-nature of vice, being reprehensible under ordinary circumstances (the fact that he was a failure before and after the war) but absolutely essential to do good in exceptional circumstances is, I believe, one of the most significant lessons that Spielberg portrayed in ""Schindler's List"". It was certainly a relief from the usual wholly good heroes that Spielberg seems to love in his other movies. Bravo."

","I thought this movie was insanely wonderful. It was horrifically accurate and painfully real. The actors were all phenomenal. However, for being a movie about one of the most tragic events in history, there was too much sex. Granted, there wasn't actually a lot, but the unnecessary female nudity of Schindler's sexual partners was a tad distracting. I was hoping to watch a GOOD movie without any need to show women's bodies in a sexual manner. Besides that, it is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves a heartbreaking yet eye-opening movie. Please don't get angry with me for being an arrogant feminist who ""doesn't understand the moral"", because I certainly do. It just made me uncomfortable. Although not extremely gruesome, the violence is unforgettable and shocking at times. Still an excellent film."

","This classical drama is one of my favorites for one reason. Sometimes there is a great script and bad directing. Sometimes the cast is fantastic, but story is weak.

No one can possibly answer that, including Mr. Spielberg, who's best movie is Schinlder's list. And if we don't teach our kids history and about mistakes made by Allies not stopping Nazis when they just started to exist, and about horrible crimes during the most viscous war of all times, history may happen again. My only suggestion to this movie makers would be: may be Red army depicted in a form of a drunk Cossack on a horse at the very end of the movie announcing to remaining concentration camp prisoners that they are ""free now"" should have been different from what you showed. After all 9 out of 10 Nazi soldiers were killed by that same Red army. And Soviets broke German armies spinal cord loosing 27 million soldiers and civilians.

","A fellow reviewer started his review of ""Schindler's List"" almost on the defensive, with an assumption that others might be critical of his determination of this film as one of the greatest, that he would place it ""up there"" (my words) with ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane."" <br/><br/>I'm going to contend that ""Schindler's"" is not only among the greatest, it goes down in historical terms as perhaps one of the most important films ever made. This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.<br/><br/>The cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope. <br/><br/>The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, ""Schindler's List"" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer."

","It was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and Spielberg knew it. This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.<br/><br/>While Schindler and Goth battle it out miles above the Jews like New Gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the Jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. It is Itzhak Stern ( Ben Kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified Stern is a Jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the Nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to.<br/><br/>It is through Stern that we see the transformation in Schindler, as first Stern will not even take a drink with Schindler by the end Stern looks at Schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people.<br/><br/>We see the slow transformation of Schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the Polish countryside, it is here that Schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by Hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for Schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. Her life snuffed out like a candle. This is the moment when Schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting.<br/><br/>From that moment on Schindler is relentless in protecting his Jews, the Schindler Jews, he overcomes every obstacle the Nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. But not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. The Nazi's were relentless in their thirst for Jewish blood and Schindler had to be just as relentless.<br/><br/>A masterpiece and a historical look at Mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the Nazis thought their Reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. Thankfully there were men like Schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be."

"blackmamba99971","10","9","13","17 March 2017"," Quite possibly the most exquisite film shown
","Steven Spielberg has brought us the most in not the most important film to date. A tale of the holocaust where Jews had been lied to about the relocation programs during the Nazi occupation. Liam Neeson who plays Oscar Schindler. A man on a quest to help Jewish people from certain death while the SS regime uses the lie in order to implement what would be called; ""The Final Solution."" A horrendous policy where Jewish prisoners are transported to concentration camps only to be executed because of their race.<br/><br/>It is Oscar himself who spares the lives of some eight hundred Jewish political prisoners as he becomes the go-between for both the German Nazi party, and the Jewish community. Using a factory as a front he employs the same eight hundred people waving his contract of absolute immunity towards the German Reich. Yet not all German officers believe that he is a genuine compatriot to the cause which results in an investigation from both the allies, and the Nazi party.<br/><br/>I found this to be the most excellent and highly informative adaptations from one of the best film makers of all time. It injects horror, despair, anguish with the distant light of hope at the end of the rainbow. The vision to this movie held me spellbound watching the horrible acts against the Jewish people as they are processed, stripped of all humanity and finally imprisoned with only the hand of the Grim reaper out waiting for his next soul. It wrenches your heart while witnessing vile acts from a people who were once close neighbours to one another.<br/><br/>The real hero of this film is Oscar. Without him eight hundred people would have died in the same concentration camps as their families did who could not attain freedom if for only a few more years during World War II. Ben Kingsley who played Itzhak Stern was brilliant as was Ralph Fiennes who played his sadistic role as Amon Goeth. With these three seasoned actors alone Schindler's List will live on as the most undisputed war film of the century. I highly recommended this film to all ages who must understand that war is the only evil on this earth, and those individuals involved or creates a war must atone for their sinful crimes."

It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.<br/><br/>So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud.

Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black- white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness.

This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film.

"ryangrogers","10","9","13","6 October 2016"," The story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes Schindler's List a simply incredible tale.
","Schindler's List Film Review<br/><br/>After viewing Schindler's List, there is only word to describe the film-Powerful. Steven Spielberg is able to take history, make it a gripping story, and bring it to the camera. The movie showcases the forgotten horrors of the Holocaust in such a dark way, at times, it can be hard to watch. However, this is one of those films that truly everyone should view at some point in life. Yes, from a filmmaking standpoint the movie is very good but the message proclaimed is even better. The story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes Schindler's List a simply incredible tale. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an up-and-coming businessman in Krakow, Germany planning to make a fortune at the start of WWII. Over time, he gains power and respect within the Nazi regime. He buys a factory and begins to mass-produce products the German military needs, hiring Jews from the local ghetto to make him a profit. Business begins to thrive until one day, the Nazi SS clears out the ghetto and sends all of the Jews to concentration camps. At first, Schindler attempts to get his workers back as he is only focused on making money for himself. However, as he witnesses the horrors occurring in the Krakow concentration camp, Schindler must make the decision to put his life-earnings second and make the lives of his innocent Jewish employees first, one life at a time. Steven Spielberg's goal was to make Schindler's List as simply as possible from a technological standpoint. There were no cranes, zoom lenses, or steadicam at all used in the film and the entire thing is in black and white. Spielberg's choice to make a black and white Holocaust film in a time when color film was the norm stands out and also enhances the movie. It creates a sense of horror and pure darkness that victims of the Holocaust actually faced while also making the movie gritty and brutal. For several hours, it took the emphasis away from the filmmaking industry and put it solely on the story. Every film is a product of its time and this is exactly what Spielberg was trying to accomplish. Historical accuracy cannot be the only thing that makes a movie special. It also takes quality actors that can give superb performances and Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are able to do exactly that. The two men are foils in the film, Neeson being the symbol of morality and Fiennes, the epitome of pure evil. In his performance, Neeson is able to embrace everything the real Oskar Schindler stood for. His character is believable, dynamic, and someone that an entire audience can feel for. Viewers can see how emotionally torn Schindler is. It is very impressive when an actor can become a man hated by so many. The task is certainly not easy. But Fiennes embraces his role as Amon Goeth, the despised Nazi in charge of the camp in Krakow. He becomes the man that killed so many and excels at doing it. The special effects are another element of the film that excels. Spielberg and his effects crew make each gunshot and fatal wound seem so real that it seems like each one is happening in real life right in front of the viewer. The scenes of death and violence provide realism that gruesomely hit hard. All of these elements allow Schindler's List to thrive both as a film and as an educatory device on the Holocaust. Some people were outraged by the movie saying it exposed women due to the amount of nudity on camera. Others stated that Spielberg made all of the Jews supporting characters with no real background instead of the main characters of the movie. Although these are among a few of many complaints, the movie truly has no flaws and is extremely well made. Unfortunately, this film cannot and should not be watched by some simply because of the pure evil and brutality depicted. Despite this, its importance in historical film is evident and needs to be seen so something incredibly evil can be learned from and therefore, never repeated. Steven Spielberg is considered one of the best directors ever and Schindler's List proves why. The film is worthy of a 10 out of 10."

","Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical period drama film, directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon GÃ¶th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.<br/><br/>Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.<br/><br/>Principal photography took place in KrakÃ³w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz KamiÅski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.<br/><br/>Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004."

"jay-techie2007","9","9","13","22 August 2016"," A must-watch movie, if you love a little heavy but a top quality cinema.
","It is only twice that I have watched this movie and it definitely is one of the classics of Hollywood. Probably the finest work (and undoubtedly one of the finest) of Steven Spielberg till date. In the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Poland, Schindler's List comprises of Jews who are to be saved by an otherwise greedy and flamboyant businessman but a transformed humanitarian, Oskar Schindler. <br/><br/>Story (10/10): The story is based on Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"". It is a story of a German businessman who went all out to save the Jews who were being massacred by the Nazi army post-invasion of Poland. While, initially, he employed the Jews to make quick money by exploiting them. However, the views of people being needlessly killed by the Nazi army evokes the human inside him and that's when he decides to do whatever possible to save as many lives as possible. And while doing that, he not only has to manage the secrecy of the purpose but also justify the purpose of every single Jew in his company to the bloodthirsty Nazi army. The screenplay is brilliant and it couldn't have been better adapted from the novel. <br/><br/>Acting (9/10): Liam Neeson, playing the title role, was effortless in the projection of a greedy, money-minded and a womanizer businessman in the beginning of the movie and an emotional, humanitarian later on. One of the toughest scenes was when he is watching the Jewish massacre from the top of a hill - and his expressions in that scene told a thousand words, something which is very tough. It was quite a challenging role and Liam executes it like a boss. Besides Liam, another actor that stood out in the movie was Ralph Fiennes. His role and quality of acting reminded me of the role of Christopher Waltz in Inglorious Bastards. Playing a role of a cruel Nazi commandant of the KrakÃ³w-PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp in PÅaszÃ³w (German-occupied Poland), he was brilliant in his cold looks and depiction of hatred towards the Jews. Ben Kingsley was commendable in his role of Jewish accountant of Oskar Schindler. His depiction of a hesitating, unsure and under-confident person (yet rising to the occasion whenever the situation demands), largely due to the circumstances around him, was brilliant. <br/><br/>Direction (9/10): I loved the idea of Steven Spielberg shooting this movie in B/W which provided it a vintage feel as well as a slightly dull projection which was necessary considering the subject of the movie. SS has been great with the actors and he brings the best out of it. One negative for me was the length of the movie which was too long, especially when you have such a heavy topic. Conceptualization of some of the scenes are so brilliant they stay on your mind long after you have watched the movie - something I felt when I watched ""12 Angry Men"". <br/><br/>Overall (9/10): Definitely, one of the classics in Hollywood, and a must-watch movie, if you love a little heavy but a top quality cinema."

","I understand that as someone who considers herself a movie buff, it is a great sin that I had not seen Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List before last Sunday afternoon. In my defense though, the film came out when I was one year old. I was too young to understand the subject matter much less to bring into a movie theater. Well, I have atoned for my sins and finally watched the movie. I turned it on expecting it to be a film that I know I should admire but for some reason am not grabbed by. On top of that, I have usually associated Steven Spielberg with Jurassic Park, E.T., and Hook before I can even allow myself to recall that he directed Saving Private Ryan much less other films on its same level of dramatic intensity. Point being, I was not expecting Schindler's List to move me. Well, not only did it hurt me to watch for all of the intended reasons, it stirred up an anger and sympathy in me unlike any film I have ever seen before.<br/><br/>This is the only true masterpiece that I have seen by Steven Spielberg. Here he develops a careful touch in evoking outrage and fear through the quieter and even more casual (for lack of a better word) moments. He does not take the easy way when it comes to getting the audience to sympathize with the victims of the Holocaust. He shows every excruciating detail, emphasizing that the most horrifying aspect of this section of history was not what was being done to the Jews, but how the people committing these crimes against them felt about it. He does not even paint our main hero of the film to be a morally superior individual looking to change the world.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler (played splendidly by Liam Neeson) is the main hero of this film (as I'm sure you could guess). He is the reason that 1,100 Jewish men, women, and children were able to escape the damnation of Auschwitz. He uses an artillery factory in Czechoslovakia as a cover to give these people work, keeping them out of the government's clutches. However, he is no Martin Luther King, Jr. Helping people is only his main priority in the last third of the film. Beforehand, Jewish people were, at best, cheap employees for his startup enamelware factory. In one early scene, a gentleman comes into Schindler's office to profusely thank him for the job. Soldiers of the S.S. nearly killed him, but his status as an employee at Oskar Schindler's factory made him ""essential to the war"" thus sparing his life. Schindler shows little acknowledgement of the gratitude. Quickly shaking this employee's hand then waving him off. The impression this moment leaves on Schindler is only to inquire with his accountant, ""Did you notice that man had one arm? How is he useful in my factory?"". Who would have guessed that this insensitive individual would turn out to risk and spend everything in the name of saving the lives of others? Later mourning that he did not save enough people? I certainly wouldn't have.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes playing Amon Goeth puts the film on a level of brutal historical honesty that I have never seen before. He wakes up in the morning and goes to his bedroom balcony, carrying his rifle like a fresh cup of coffee. He carefully aims at one of the prisoners then shoots, killing her merely for target practice. After patting himself on the back for keeping up his skills with a gun, Goeth goes back inside thinking nothing more of the murder he has just committed. This is his morning routine in the same way that anyone else would wake up, check their watch or phone, then get up to make coffee, etc.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, thanks to Spielberg's marvelous direction, this is not Amon Goeth's most sickening scene. During one his shifts, Goeth is rampaging a Jewish ghetto. In this mass, stroboscopic shooting which lights up the hallways like a fire, Goeth takes a cigarette break complaining to a colleague ""I wish this night were over"". His colleagues agree; they would like their shifts to end so they can go home to their wives and families, to read their books, put on music, anything just as long as it means they get off work as it is being a particularly annoying shift this night. There is no word to describe the level of consternation, anger, disgust, and countless other similar emotions that I felt in that singular moment. I had to pause the movie and collect myself, remembering that Goeth and his cronies cannot hear me screaming at them, condemning them for not only what they did but for feeling no remorse.<br/><br/>In some of the best Holocaust movies I have seen, the Nazis are loud, filled with pride for their blonde-haired, blue-eyed glory, and become quickly frustrated with any Jews who they come in contact with. There is little to their characters except for the uniforms. In this film, they are parallel to humanity. They enjoy music, partying, joking, and complaining about work like most people. To the rest of the world, their work is one of the most unforgivable crimes in history, but to them it is a day at the office. It is ""paperwork"". The fact that Steven Spielberg takes the time to bring up that side of them is profoundly poignant. It is through those less obvious moments of atrocity that Schindler's List ascends to a whole new level worth of respect.<br/><br/>The best film I have ever seen about the Holocaust and probably one of the best movies I have ever seen period. Thank you Steven Spielberg for your time, effort, and dedication toward respecting the victims of this heinous and hellish event in history.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my blog Art Scene State at the following link: http://cinemasmarts.blogspot.com/"
"shruti-00651","10","9","13","15 August 2016"," A brilliant movie by Steven Spielberg !
","Directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg - Schindler's List is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. It is based on the life of Oskar Schindler â A German industrialist who saved the lives of more 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, by employing them in his factories. Set during the Holocaust in Nazi occupied Poland, the film is shot entirely in black and white. The film is a vivid portrayal of the persecution and mass murder that took place during the Holocaust- the monochrome making it's impact even more profound. <br/><br/>The film takes us through the transformation of Oscar Schindler. Initially focused only on making money, Schindler is profoundly affected when he witnesses the massacre in KrakÃ³w ghetto, particularly the death of a little Jewish girl in a Red coat- the only splash of colour in the film. He subsequently spends his fortune on saving as many lives as possible, lives of those he once exploited. Schindler continuously outsmarts the Germans by winning their friendship through bribery and flattery. The titular ""Schindler's List"" is a list of names, created by Schindler and his Jewish accountant 'Stern'. A Noah's ark of sorts â the list deems Schidler's Jewish employees as indispensable to his business, thus saving them from transportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp and subsequent death. <br/><br/>The soundtrack, composed by John Williams, befits the horror depicted in the movie. Spielberg manages to bring out the haunting history of the era with such subtlety and perfection that it lingers with the audience even after the movie. The black and white footage brings out the despair, hopelessness and gloominess better than today's visual effects would. I would rate the movie 5/5 stars. A winner of seven Oscars, this masterpiece is a must see for everyone."

Emilie Schindler / Jonathan Sagall ... Poldek Pfefferberg (as Jonathan Sagalle) Embeth Davidtz ... Helen Hirsch Schindler is a vainglorious and greedy German businessman who becomes an unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us he bribed the Germans into giving him people to work in his factory in which they were supposed to make arms but keep them alive Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.Yes, both were very real. The PlaszÃ³w labor camp was located in a southern suburb of KrakÃ³w and was presided over by the real Amon GÃ¶th. Under GÃ¶th's command, many thousands of Jews were killed there, it is documented that GÃ¶th was every bit as cruel and psychotic as the film depicts him. Schindler's factory, Deutsche Emailewaren-Fabrik, also existed in the KrakÃ³w city limits. Schindler's efforts to bring Jewish prisoners to work in his factory are also documented. There's an old saying; ""You have to spend money to make money."". Schindler was schmoozing with the local Nazi & SS officers to build a customer and contact base. He'd already made plans to open the Emailwarenfabrik factory & supply the German army with cookware but he needed to find the right people to sell his product to, IE, all the officers that frequented the restaurant. You can see him working up the chain of officers that come into the place. Schindler (at least in the film) is presented as not only very charming but also very cultured -- he orders appetizers & entrees that appear to be crowd-pleasing & converses with the Maitre'd about the right wine for his guests. At the end of the scene we see him having a drink with OberfÃ¼hrer Julian Scherner, who is the highest ranking officer that enters the place -- his rank is that of a senior colonel. If Schindler is able to, at the very least, strike up a friendship with this man, then Scherner will be likely to throw business Schindler's way through the other officers under his command. Schindler's strategy pays off well; he picks up a lot of business & begins making a lot of money.<br/><br/>Schindler wasn't completely broke when he arrived in Krakow. You can see, while he picks out his outfit for the evening, that he has lots of Polish zlotys stashed in various places. Schindler is also a very shrewd businessman, as we see throughout the course of the film. He'd be the type of person to know how to stretch his money during dinner to accommodate his guests, however he did lavish on them quite a lot to gain their trust and friendship. Also, the restaurant management might also have, later in the evening, recognized Oskar to be a trustworthy customer and may have let him run a tab for his dinner expenses. Schindler could have easily paid them back later with a budget of$22,000,000 (estimated) it made a lot of money in in America $96,067,179 Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go buy Schindler's List."

"leonardoanamorim","10","9","13","20 July 2016"," Spielberg makes a masterpiece for the times, driven by emotion and loyalty towards history, it's victims and characters.
","Steven Spielberg is a known director. Most of his works focus on adventures, genre movies, be it with children, explorers or Extra- Terrestrial beings. So, when Spielberg decides to focus on historical dramas, usually based on true events, we can see the full array of his abilities and capacities.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a movie that occurs during the holocaust, and this time period serves as background for characters study. Spielberg was smart enough to realize that such a theme could not be tackled head on. Instead, the focus is on the humans of the time. Why they did what they did, how could they and, specially, how they endured it.<br/><br/>The narrative focus on the actions of ""entrepreneur"" Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). How he dealt with the holocaust and how he was touched by the Jews situation after seeing their torment and suffering. He had to take care to not have such a feeling be discovered by any of his many Nazi friends, such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>Being a Jew himself, Spielberg finds the fine line between homage to those who died and survived without falling in any melodrama. Spielberg is, above all, a director. And a director has only one obligation: to make a good film. Even though directors are human beings, Spielberg is professional enough to know how much he really must use of his emotion, sensibility and identification with the victims of the holocaust.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that this is one of the best Spielberg films. For many, like me, his best. A historical piece with much to add in the discussion of mankind tragedies."
"gscoufoglou","10","9","13","20 July 2016"," An absolute depiction of WW2 darkest days
","What made Schindler's list special to me, was the authenticity that is displayed throughout the movie. Till I saw the movie I thought Nazis were an army of fanatics, with a psychotic commander. Through the analytical and accurate recounting of the movie I was intrigued to ask questions I never thought I would. Acting of all the actors make you feel the movie, make you want to learn what really happened, make you want to understand why. There are plenty movies based on true stories and I think I have seen enough of them, but none of them had affected me that much. In most cases I would put myself in the main character's shoes and think how I would react in similar conditions. In this case I didn't even bother, I thought I wouldn't manage. What made these feelings though so strong and vivid, were the acting, the directing, the very well done research over historical events, even the idea of shooting the picture B&W I think made more realistic. I hope I will have the chance to watch the movie once more and I wish we will be able to watch movies of equivalent quality in all its aspects.<br/><br/>tms"
"Rawal_Afzal","8","9","13","13 July 2016"," Schindler's divine and sacred list!
","Before I proceed to add any comments on the film, I must simply salute to this great human-being. Compassion and love is the most natural state of us humans, any other emotions of hatred, rage and violence are an alteration of our very being and existence. It is most commendable of Mr. Schindler to have stuck to his natural state amidst all the violence and the preaching of extreme hatred for Jews, amidst a world war to put it best. It is a perception that rich people care the least about the poor and the suffering, but above all is God Almighty's unbeatable Law of descending good people amongst bad people, and vice versa, and here he descended an angel in the form of a rich business, the best option, for the Jews who'd been suffering hopelessly. I smiled when he said to his secretary that if the German army becomes suspicious of the incompetent works done in his factory he'd buy ammunition and weapons from some other factory and then sell it to the army to keep things in control. A masterminded person!<br/><br/>It was so touching and heartening to see him instead of feeling satisfied at his achievement or taking pride in it, he chose to cry and curse himself for having not saved even more lives and for not having used earlier opportunities to take this path. He cursed his rich lifestyle and the expensive things he bought for himself instead of spending even more money to save even more lives. Truly a sign of a great human-being who chose to reflect on his flaws instead of the good works he did, which itself was a huge, huge risk that could've cost him not only his status, business and money but also life if the army could've got even a minor sniff of it.<br/><br/>On the film, since it was based on true events I can't really find faults and point to things they could've done differently. So no issues with it. However, two things annoyed me a bit, the first of which being it being in black and white. It prevented me from getting a good feel of the atmosphere, the surroundings and the whole drama. I felt as if I was looking at the screen from a place very far. So this wasn't a smart move on Spielberg's part in my view. By the way, I mean no disrespect to the films of years ago which were in black and white anyway. They'd to be shot that way and you as a viewer understood the limitation of the film-maker, but that can't be said of a film released in 1993.<br/><br/>Secondly, although I fully admit that the film had to be full in every detail and very spread out with explanatory scenes, but still feel it could've been shortened at least by 20 minutes. Three hours is just way to long for a film of which its entertainment value is its least strength.In general, films on suffering and pain shouldn't be that long, never. Since such films are low on entertainment, the aim should be to make the viewer stayed focused throughout, and if the film turns out to be as long as three hours then somewhere in the middle of it you'll find the viewers scratching their head, looking left and right, talking to others in order to re-find their focus after a few minutes break. In short, such films should be shorter in length."

Directed by renowned veteran director Steven Spielberg this story of morbid ethnic cleansing, is of timeless learning for generations to come. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kinglsey as Itzhak Stern & Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth there isn't a moment of distraction from the matters at hand. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler an industrialist and an obvious opportunist acquires an enamelware factory in Krakow employing Jews from concentration camps in the region. Hounding prisoners to invest in his industrial venture as he reaps the financial benefits, whilst the Jewish investors are paid their returns in metal ware.

As time passes his interests were in-tuned with the well being of his workforce than himself strident towards bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Performances that are brutally surreal and engrossing will break you down, whilst certain artistry of hand held cinematography will place you in the midst of all chaos and tragedy. Shot in black and white with certain exceptions of the odd girl in the red coat for personification, the realism of the morbid drama of the holocaust will never leave the audiences' mind. Up until 1993 Spielberg although is renowned for his creativity behind the camera certainly has not dealt with a screen play with such delicate baggage. A slip of the slightest would have this historical drama crawling, gaping for life at the mercy of its 195 minutes of runtime. Never is it so. With CGI at its minimal and the concentration on the subject, and the subjects' woe within the subject is where Spielbergs' heart is at.

","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.<br/><br/>The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.<br/><br/>This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.

The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles.

","Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be.

","Schindler's List<br/><br/>When we think of the holocaust we think of Hitler, Jews, and for some, Oskar Schindler. Steven Spielberg took an absolute horror and showed us how there was still good in man. The movie is an excellent tear jerker and at some times send shivers down your back due to the gruesome inhumanity that was shone. The movie was fantastically crafted to show us the horrors of the holocaust and really toy with our emotions.<br/><br/>For instance, Spielberg's use of color during a black and white film was fantastic and brilliantly thought out. For example, the scene of the of the little girl with the red coat was so incredibly sad and shows us how utterly atrocious it really was that they would have killed a little girl as such. Spielberg had such a way with making the viewer feel a certain way in the film with his use of all special effects, it was fantastic! When it comes to the acting side of the film I have nothing bad to say what so ever. Liam Neeson, usually portrayed as a killer in his other films, found his soft side and acted as Schindler brilliantly. His voice change and overall talent throughout the film made it such a better film. Not to mention all of the supporting roles such as Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) who was an S.S. soldier and how ruthless and emotionless he had to be in some scenes when he killed in order to really get Spielberg's point across. After this film was released in 1993 the world not only remembers how many lives were lost, but how Oskar Schindler risked everything to save twelve hundred Jews and his only regret was that he couldn't save more. ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" (Oskar Schindler)"
"moisesalexramirez","10","9","13","13 April 2016"," The quintessential narrative on one of the darkest chapters in human history
","Although there have been many attempts through numerous mediums to capture the horror, the inhumanity, the helplessness of the Holocaust, only through the eyes and hands of Spielberg has this black phase in the history books become the foundation for a superb masterpiece, a work of art that is also a tribute and a remembrance to those that perished and those that still live to this day and were unfortunate enough to live this savagery.<br/><br/>Schindler's list is likely to make you cry, and if it doesn't, it will definitely not make you feel happiness, as you slowly watch the brutality of men take away what little joy you had before and during the show. Its realistic and relentless substance generates grief and reflection that not many films can offer, and it is present in every minute. Any sensitive people are advised to be emotionally and mentally prepared.<br/><br/>Spielberg's vision for the Second World War and the depressing take on its participants (and ultimately victims) and their environments is unmatched. The cinematography stands out as some of the best that Spielberg has shown us, and never seems to disappoint throughout the entirety of the film; it does justice to those who most needed justice and their tale to the world.<br/><br/>The admirable and tragic life of Oskar Schindler, the manner in which it is portrayed by an excellent script and an outstanding performance by Liam Neeson, and the decisions he ultimately makes will probably make a small percentage of the viewers reevaluate their beliefs and outlook on life, but even if it fails to do so with the rest, it achieves the objective of history classes in schools: to learn not to make the same mistakes, and it does so with marvelous execution on a subject that is sometimes forsaken. It transcends as both a study and a visual art.<br/><br/>John William's score is nothing short of magical, majestic in a harrowing, yet spellbinding way. It is an essential addition to an already beautiful piece; the connection between the score and the film is the epitome of chemistry between the two that many other filmmakers should study.<br/><br/>Schindler's list may disappoint as a date film or as a family addition, but it will never fail to give us a glance of a subject that, although controversial, should serve as a lesson of why history is important to learn."

","Schindler's List is an amazing film about war and, at the same time, friendship. Spielberg did a wonderful job; of course he had help, the fantastic cast and photography helped the creation of this epic. Liam Neeson's Schindler is very human, and you can identify yourself with the character. He's ambitious, but he never gets what he wanted: to be rich. He moves to Krakow, Poland, to take advantage of the situation, and be a success businessman, the Jews were under increasing pressure from the Nazis. He was very opportunist, selfish, and manipulative, at the end of the film, he becomes a totally different person. Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern is also amazing, he's a very strong character, a character that you can feel compassion and, you hope that he can be fine by the end of the film. That's one wonderful thing in the film, you care about the characters, even if is for a brief moment on screen, like the little girl with the red coat. The photography is stunning, all black and white, like a documentary, you feel like you're watching a History Channel's documentary, but, more real and with an amazing direction. In conclusion, Schindler's List is a great film about war, and one of the bests films Steven Spielberg ever made. A wonderful epic that you can see a despicable man turn into a better person, which helped more than one thousand Jews from certain death."

","I was riveted from the opening scene to the closing credits where the live people from the Holistic were laying stones with Ben Kingsly. Don't plan on answering the phone or trying to squeeze dinner in while watching the movie. Nothing will be able to interrupt you. This was the first real taste I got of Liam Neeson. After that I made it a point to see some of his other films. A friend had told me about the filming of the shower scene and how hard it was to do it. I imagine the train scene was also very difficult as actors as well as all the crew behind the camera. I wish for this film to be shown in high schools because I never knew of this movement in WWII. At least there was some little glimmer of humanity in that war as this film shows."

","In Shindler's list, Oskar is faced with many obstacles in getting workers for his factory. Oskar is an all around good guy. He helped Jews get jobs, he helped them become better people, and he saved their lives. Without Oskar many of those Jews would not have survived the Holocaust. After a train full of women arrived in Auswtiz by mistake, Oskar did everything he could to try to get them back to the factory, and he succeeded. He realized what was going on at the concentration camps and decided to make a list of people to take with him back to the factory. He kept his workers there as long as he could, even though some might be too young or be missing a limb, he gave them life. Oskar risked his own life for those who were being discriminated and killed. Oskar was one of the very few who were actually good in the saddest movie I have ever seen."
"Mittenstigger61","10","9","13","1 March 2016"," Very accurate Portrayal by Ralph Fiennes
","Schindler's List,in my opinion, was a very accurate portrayal of the man and war themselves. I enjoyed the cast and was very gripped in the story right from the beginning thru to the very end,and that doesn't happen very often. World War II was very complex, to begin with, and when Oscar Schindler assisted with placing Jewish People in jobs, in order to keep them out of the Concentration Camps, that was the nicest thing anyone had done for them in a long time. The people he placed appreciated it,and he was a good employer as well.His friends didn't realize he was doing this,and I don't think they would have themselves. When the Nazis came and took some of the people who worked for him, he tried everything to keep them out of the camps."
"aurora7459","10","9","13","20 February 2016"," Schindler's List"" Review = Perfection.
","Perfection.<br/><br/>There are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. In fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. Sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as ""Titanic"" and ""LOTR"" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. These are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. Finally, there are films such as ""Schindler's List."" Films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. ""Schindler's List"" is, indeed, an icon of American cinema. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's 1993 story of Oskar Schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the Nazi Holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history. <br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and I dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. It is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. Only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it. <br/><br/>There are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. They are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. ""Schindler's List"" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one. <br/><br/>Virtually every aspect of ""Schindler's List"" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. It would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection.<br/><br/>As Oskar Schindler, Liam Neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. Neeson offers a Schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. What makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...So often, in these humanity films we get a ""superhero"" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into Mr. Wonderful. Schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. It's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical ""tour de force."" <br/><br/>While Neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including Ben Kingsley as accountant Itzhak Stern, a man who works with Schindler yet remains wary of him and the Nazi's. Ralph Fiennes offers, perhaps, the ""tour de force"" performance as Amon Goeth, a sadistic Nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to Schindler. <br/><br/>The list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. The score of John Williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness.<br/><br/>The film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design. <br/><br/>Yet, in many ways, watching ""Schindler's List"" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. This film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...It is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. Yes, it truly is that grand. <br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. It is, in my opinion, Spielberg's finest work and one I doubt he will ever top. ""Schindler's List"" is more than a film...it is a life experience of such depth and beauty and greatness that I think it almost calls out for an 11th Commandment...Thou Shalt See ""Schindler's List."""
"willwoodmill","9","9","13","17 February 2016"," Steven Spielberg's greatest cinematic achievement
","In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making. <br/><br/>Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust. <br/><br/>Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.) <br/><br/>Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars. <br/><br/>I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)<br/><br/>9.4/10"
"gulherme","10","9","13","10 February 2016"," The best movie of all times
","Schindler List is a movie about everything, begins with most basic values in the human natures until a complex analysis of war society, and find a journey to the human heart, in good and bad forms. Schindler list is a movie 10 in all questions, history, photography, OST and in send a message.<br/><br/>First we need know the movie is about a couple relationship between the Nazi government, German business man and the Jewish people. Schindler is entrepreneur, capitalist and a good negotiator, he has good relationships with military, and military enjoy your source of guns and material to support the war. A well established relation, Schindler keep low cost using prisoner as cheap labor to his factors, a smart but not decent idea.<br/><br/>Although his well wealthy business, Schindler decide he can change the world. This is the main point of the movie, and how he star to achieve a bigger goal instead the quarterly balance sheet profits. Schindler decide all system is not correctly, and he understand a change is need.<br/><br/>The lesson in this film is the status quo isn't a law, it can be changed by the humans. When oppression is the law, kill is normal, when human are properties have a act to change all it is the right decision. Schindler is what all we need in the moderns day, a break point in the society, a hero doing the obvious, a man whit heart and ambition to change the world."

","I finally had a chance today to watch this movie in full, and literally my only complaint about it is that I had to remove the double-sided DVD partway through the film in order to flip it over and watch the rest of it.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, it is hard to believe that Spielberg made this movie in the same year as Jurassic Park (1993); both movies are great in very different ways.<br/><br/>With Schindler's List, I feel that every technique used within is used deliberately and with purpose. The film is in black-and-white because that is actually how Spielberg envisioned the Holocaust from the documentaries he had seen; we see the coat on the little girl in red in color in order to indicate that Oskar Schindler is focused on her; and so on.<br/><br/>It is wholly evident that Spielberg wanted to make this movie the best movie possible so that, in turn, it becomes a timeless document depicting but one story of the Holocaust. And indeed, while we still enjoy the fun adventures in Jurassic Park, E.T. and the like, it is Schindler's List that will be remembered, years from now, as one of the greatest films of his entire career, if not the greatest."
"kmcanerney_2016","10","9","13","11 December 2015"," What can be said
","Kubrick said that the holocaust was about six million who died, Schindler's List was about six thousand who didn't. That perfectly encapsulates the brilliance of this film. The Holocaust was the most horrific event man ever caused, nothing comes close. Somehow, Spielberg found a story of hope in the pitch black evil. That is not to say this movie is for the faint of heart. Nothing about Schindler's List is easy, it will break you but in the end the tears you shed--and you will cry--are not elicited by horror but by beauty. It is the story of a man, by no means a saint, who finds it in himself to stand up against the horrors of his day. I could write on about the acting, writing or directing, and it is all superb, but to do so would miss the point. Schindler's List excels because it has the all important fourth factor, the right stuff. I am too young to have seen it in theaters and I envy those who shared this experiences with strangers, but every time I watch this film I am left speechless. I do feel the need to right about the ending. Realizing that the evil presented in this film is of a degree we cannot fathom, Spielberg brilliantly reconnected us to reality. It was on my third viewing when it occurred to me that the little boy, the grandson of a Schindler Jew, was no more then eight years old. This would mean that he was born after Schindler died yet owes his entire existence to the man. This is the beautiful part of the story, this is what brings me to tears every damn time. Schindler's influence stretches beyond the grave. This movie was over twenty years ago, that boy is now a man, probably married, maybe with children. Schindler gave the girl a husband, the boy a father, and they never shared time on earth. This is one of the twentieth centuries most extraordinary films about one of its most extraordinary men and if it wasn't for the film, we wouldn't even know the name Oskar Schindler."

"sharky_55","10","9","13","19 September 2015"," What's one worth to you?
","Spielberg once stated that Schindler's List is not about the millions that were killed during the Holocaust, but rather about the one thousand that were saved. It's a very important thing to consider when looking at some of the criticisms levelled at this great film. There have been documentaries that have attempted to capture the atrocities of the Holocaust but even so none come close to the unflinching and systematic mass murder of the event. Schindler's List doesn't attempt to provide an substantial and unbiased view of it. It is a story about one man in particular and his absolute good. <br/><br/>Even so, the film does attempt to place itself within the reality of the events and create some sense of authenticity. Apart from the powerful bookends which are drenched in colour, the black and white documentary approach serves its agelessness and heightens the intensity of some scenes; the first look we get at the enigma of Oskar Schindler, catch-lights hitting his twinkling eyes at the party, or when a little boy attempts to hide in the underground box full of sewerage. Hand- held is also used intensively and to great effect - the rounding up of naked Jews, the extended liquidation scene, scrambling around the camp in madness in avoiding a psychopath with a sniper rifle. Spielberg doesn't overdose the film with visual tricks but shows it for what it is (the lack of storyboarding aided this), making those little touches all the more effective - quick match cuts to show the various inept secretaries that are hired anyway, Kingley's distant voice-over as Goeth executes lined up boys silently and mercilessly, and the most powerful motif of them all, the girl in the red coat, a symbol of innocence lost and atrocity committed. <br/><br/>There are two exceptional performances here. The first is of course Neeson, who brings to the table a great charisma and pragmaticism that later dissolves into sympathy and great courage. We first are charmed like the German officers at the party (I love the great touch of the officer moving forward to get closer to Oskar in the photo, obscuring the pretty girl he was initially wooing), and through voice-over and a photo we receive those charms again through the lavish gifts of champagne, caviar and sardines. Spielberg does not create a moment of realisation or change; it is a gradual and subtle process that Oskar goes through. He is not the morally pure and idealistic man we look for in a Hollywood production such as this - he initially hires an entire group of secretaries not to save them, but to further his womanising and marital affairs, and when a one-armed man comes to thank him for saving his life, Neeson's face is struck and visibly confused; we wonder if he has ever been the receiver of such sincerity and gratitude. But that changes when he realises the gravity of the situation (""He was a metal press operator""). Oskar's front is of course the affable German business man, concerned only about profit, but in glimpses he shows his true humanity and courage in front of the Nazis: a long kiss on his birthday, a determination to see worker's thirsts quenched, and in that final teary-eyed heart wrenching monologue, a complete reversal of his ambitions. John Williams' iconic violin theme is stirring and most evident here. <br/><br/>The other is Fiennes' Goeth, who takes a despicable monster and adds tiny tinges of humanity that make his character all the more terrifying. His introduction is telling, a faceless POV in the back of the car before we reveal him, not some intimidating figure, but an irritated man with a cold: ""Ja, why is the top down? I'm f*cking freezing."" Another one of these moments is a brilliant scene where he corners Helen in the baseless, shivering and terrified. Goeth ignores this, constructing a rather tender conversation in his mind, and we witness a insatiable conflict in his mind, unbelieving that he has fallen for a ""jew bitch"". He almost gives in, but his Nazi sensibilities come back to him and he strikes her. This segment is brilliantly inter cut with kisses of another location, the modest Jewish wedding and the lavish birthday party where Oskar kisses many. This man is truly barbaric, and even a clever appeal to his ego from Oskar (""I pardon you."") does not satisfy his cold murderous streak. What Fiennes does is give us a tiny bit of insight into a man like Goeth, because to us it seems inexplicable that such a man could do such sadistic things and be instrumental in genocide. And so, he loses Helen over a game of 21. They bargain over the life of these essential jew workers, and Goeth's question to Schindler is perhaps a moment of realisation of what he must do. <br/><br/>One little moment in the montage of compiling the list is a overlooked appearance from another Righteous Among the Nations, Julius Madritsch, who save thousands of Jews himself. I am struck by how his story and many others could similarly be rightfully portrayed as a compelling act of bravery in the face of such evil, much like Oskar Schindler's. His story was almost never told; a fateful encounter between writer Thomas Keneally and a Schindler's Jew in Poldek Pfefferberg was the basis of a book and later this film. Pfefferberg's own words are particularly telling about this great man: ""Schindler gave me my life, and I tried to give him immortality."" And in this film, he has achieved it."

"TooManyFives","9","9","13","9 September 2015"," One of the most important films ever made.
","I watched Schindler's List for the first time a couple of nights ago. I can't really put into words how great it was. <br/><br/>At first I thought wow that's amazing and horrifying. I'm so glad I have now seen it and never want to watch it again...<br/><br/>But it's still playing in my brain and I actually can see myself watching it again now quite easily. Not that it would be easy to watch, it could never be that. I cried and cried and was shaking with anger and fear and pure horror at it (especially scenes like the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto). But I can see myself wanting to see it because of just how brilliantly made it is.<br/><br/>The performances were fantastic and not just the two leads of Liam Neeson as Schindler (I hadn't realised he was such a flawed protagonist and had built him into this thing of perfection in my head because without seeing the film and knowing the story i couldn't realise that to do what he did you needed to be sneaky as hell and have that edge to you) and Ralph Fiennes as the truly wicked and evil Amon Goeth. I keep on forgetting, and did so in the film too, that it was Ben Kingsley playing Schindler's ""clever accountant"". He was so good in the role that he disappeared into it.<br/><br/>The score was brilliant too and also stayed hidden and didn't get in the way if the part it was playing in the film as a whole. (I loved reading this in the trivia of the film ""When Steven Spielberg first showed John Williams a cut of the film, Williams was so moved he had to take a walk outside for several minutes to collect himself. Upon his return, Williams told Spielberg he deserved a better composer. Spielberg replied, ""I know, but they're all dead."""")<br/><br/>It can't not get a 10/10 from me. I will watch it again, and be utterly heartbroken again."
"filipemanuelneto","10","9","13","8 September 2015"," A lesson of humanity.
","This film tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Polish industrialist who collaborated with the German war effort, after the invasion of his country, by keeping working in his plant many Jewish prisoners. Aware that keep them working was to save their lives, Schindler hires as much as he can, going against his own interests and even raising suspicions among the Nazis. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film also has the participation of Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. Based on a true story, the film screenplay is from Steven Zaillian.<br/><br/>There are some movies that are so good and symbolic that ultimately overcome the art of cinema itself and become part of the heritage and memory of Humanity. This is one of those movies. There isn't any negative note to do: the cast exceeded expectations, the script is excellent, the costumes and scenarios are historically accurate. The cinematography deserves special positive note, with interesting camera angles and a very clever use of black and white. In recognition of this merit, the film won seven Oscars (best film, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best editing and best original soundtrack) and was nominated for another five statuettes (Best Actor, Best supporting actor, best costume, best sound and best characterization).<br/><br/>The story told in this film is the living testimony of a sad page in world history, but that doesn't end in the past. The Holocaust ended decades ago but there's still genocide and ethnic cleansing in other parts of the World. If this film brings a message of compassion and humanity, this isn't only for some people, but transcends the issue of Jews or Germans to reach all those in this World are persecuted for their faith, ethnic or other perverse motivations."
"OllieSuave-007","8","9","13","8 September 2015"," An intense and heart-breaking film!
","This movie is difficult to watch as it, in detail, expresses the sheer horror and grisliness of the Holocaust. From the forced relocation of the Jews toward the ghettos to the terrors of Auschwitz, the persecution of the Jews is a centerpiece of this film and it will resonate in your mind long after this movie is over. <br/><br/>This movie also centers around the life of Oskar Schindler, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, as a money-hungry German businessman who employs Jews to work in his factory, but ultimately grows concerned for the well-being of the Jews as he witnesses their merciless persecution by the Nazis. His mission in turning his factory into a salvation for the Jews throughout WWII becomes a driving force for the plot and builds up the suspense and tension, making you eager to find out what the aftermath is by the film's end.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley gave a great performance of Itzhak Stern, the Jew who ends up being Schindler's trusted assistant and right-hand man, and Ralph Fiennes gave a haunting portrayal of the evil and sadistic Amon Goeth - an ultimate villain you would love to hate. And, all the supporting actors and extras who portrayed the Jews gave a heartfelt performance; even as actors, you really sympathize with them as they gave such a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal.<br/><br/>Janusz Kaminski did a good job on the cinematography, capturing the aura and tension of World War II; John Williams gave a stirring music score with a beautiful violin solo by Izak Perlman; and Steven Spielberg did a nice job directing a well-paced film.<br/><br/>It's true that some people criticizes the accuracy and historical facts of the film and the overly intensiveness of the plot elements, but, it is no doubt an impactful film about the Holocaust and the courageous deeds of a man who sought to save many.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

You know, every week there are at least twenty-five new movies being released just in the U.S.. Thus, on the list of the billions of movies I could watch, this movie was not even in top 10,000.<br/><br/>I accidentally ended up watching it. I was at home sick and they were showing it on TV. Bored and with nothing to do, I said watching this movie can't really hurt or anything.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes were weird and I did not get much from it. I was already reluctant about watching, but in the end, I kept going. Truth be told, I did not even know what it really was about.<br/><br/>But as the story kept going, I fell in love. I fell in love with the fantastic directing, of the one and only Steven Spielberg. I fell in love with the realistic and award-worthy performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz and, especially, Ralph Fiennes. While I have already respected Neeson and Kingsley, knowing them as brilliant actors, it was not until this movie that I started liking Fiennes's performance. Until then, I'd known him from the Potter movies, in which his performance couldn't connect much with me. And to end this list, I fell in love with every single detail this movie had.<br/><br/>Outstanding and brilliant are ant-sized words in comparison to what Schindler's List's true adjectives sound like. I am not really capable of naming at least one.<br/><br/>And to end this review, there is absolutely no wonder why this movie is among the best of all times.

","Though I rather like to think it did. <br/><br/>There is a moment at the end of the movie where Oskar is about to leave in order to escape being arrested. He is surrounded by the Jews and is accompanied of course by his wife. <br/><br/>The dialogue is as such (according to the quotes page):<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just... I could have got more. <br/><br/>Itzhak Stern: Oskar, there are eleven hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: If I'd made more money... I threw away so much money. You have no idea. If I'd just... <br/><br/>Itzhak Stern: There will be generations because of what you did. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: I didn't do enough! <br/><br/>Itzhak Stern: You did so much.<br/><br/>*Schindler looks at his car*<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: This car. Goeth would have bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there. Ten people. Ten more people.<br/><br/>*removing Nazi pin from lapel* <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: This pin. Two people.This is gold. Two more people. He would have given me two for it, at least one. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. <br/><br/>*sobbing*<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler: I could have gotten one more person... and I didn't! And I... I didn't!<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>It is during this moment that Oskar appears to have a moment of so much regret and remorse and yet, you can't help but think--Oskar, you did something! You did something more than so many people bothered to do.<br/><br/>And that is better than doing nothing at all, no?<br/><br/>So, I give this movie (though it is a ruthlessly manipulative Spielberg adaptation) ten stars, for this scene more than any other scene in the entire film.<br/><br/>I do not know (and to some extent highly doubt) whether this conversation actually took place.<br/><br/>But despite the fact that I know deep down it probably did not, I like to imagine it did. And I like to imagine that even if it didn't, the emotion behind it was present during the actual event that this scene portrays. <br/><br/>It is this that makes me feel as though this movie deserves the ten star rating. This scene alone. Even if it is perhaps the most manipulative scene in the entire film, I can not describe how deeply I love this scene. How much I cried over this scene. <br/><br/>Again, I realize this is the talking-down-to-the-audience technique so often seen in such big blockbuster historical non-fiction films like this, but I can not help but feel so much for just this one particular moment and I guess I can not explain why. I hope that the quote itself explains it enough. <br/><br/>And I hope whoever sees or has seen this movie will perhaps understand why this scene is so important.<br/><br/>At the present time I am in the process of reading the book from which this movie is adapted and eventually perhaps I will see the documentary.<br/><br/>But for now, this is something. <br/><br/>Oskar, you did something!"

When I composed myself enough to get to the car, I burst out crying. My grandfather escaped the Warsaw ghetto (he died shortly after I was born). My father who was older than my mother, grew up, in part, in a Japanese prison camp and was stamped (he went away when I was 10). So while you'd think I'd know more about my heritage and all my family killed in Poland by the Germans, I do not. I only heard bits and pieces. So when I saw it come together in a way that only Stephen Spielberg can do, it hit me--hard. My family endured this and only a few survived. I believe regardless of heritage, that everyone should see this film to know what could happen in the future-again. The fact is, it is happening today in North Korea where daily acts of unspeakable cruelty happen. It's a must see film for the acting, the authenticity and the truth. NEVER FORGET!"

","This movie explains what happened to so many of the Jews during World War II. It takes an inside look at what really happened while they were in the camps. Also, how disrespect to any German soldier or any one that was loyal to Hitler resulted in extreme punishment. Extreme punishments such as death were not uncommon. Schindler, in the beginning, was only trying to make money. As the war went on he realized what was really going on in the factor. As he grew closer to his workers in his factory, he didn't want to make money anymore, he just wanted to save them from the death of the war. He began to spend the money he had to buy the workers back from the camps and tried to save as many as possible, he became broke by the end of the war. Before leaving his workers at he end of the war, he cried because he felt guilty because he felt like if he sold his car and some of his belongings, he cold have saved even more lives. Oscar Schindler, was known as a savior to the Jews during and long after the war."

","Spielberg was definitely the right person to handle this movie. He gave the emotion it needed to get the viewers feeling for these people as well as trying not to manipulate their emotions. The shots are purposeful as well as showing so much without much talking. Also, the movie was stylized to seem like a documentary, but still having substance. The story is compelling and shows that in times of hardship and on the side that seems to be ""all evil"", there will always be those that will risk their own lives for the lives of others. The acting was incredible. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did amazing in their roles and hid their accents well. Their faces alone could provide the tragedy that the war caused and the empathy for some of these people. There were times when I had to remind myself that they had different accents!

They normally didn't allow me to watch R rated movies (they didn't even let me see PG-13 rated movies until I was 13). I of course was familiar with the holocaust from school, but this film really shows just how horrible the atrocities were that went on here. Mr. Schindler was a great man for what he did, and this film does an excellent job of honoring his memory. Schindler's list is about a man named Oskar Schindler who owned a factory in Germany during World War II. After seeing how Jews are treated in the concentration camps he feels deep sympathy for them and wants to do something, anything to help. So he gets the idea to convince the Germans that he needs more help in his factory to help with the war effort and that Jews would make excellent workers. So this allows him to save at least some of the Jews from the horrible fate of being in the camps."

","It is inevitable for a movie depicting the World War II era with such imagery and honesty to prevail and gain success. It is also inevitable for a movie depicting the World War II era with such imagery and honesty to not provoke and excite younger audiences. I belong to those younger audiences and that is the reason I have not given 10 stars to this picture. <br/><br/>We know Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time. He proved it in 1993 by providing us the most decent and thoughtful depiction of one of the saddest facts that ever happened in man's history. A few complain about the Holocaust brutal scenes being unnecessary. I won't even put a comment to that. It's obvious that they won't thrill or excite us, but the power of the film is mostly based on those brutal scenes, which moved us all to think about those lives that were lost. The saddest thing is that WE can't do anything. But who could?<br/><br/>Schindler could. And he did. At the start of the movie you meet a respected official among the Nazi, with all the things you come to expect from a business man of their side, dedicated to his purpose. That means money, commitment, women and money. Absolutely no caring for other people... only profit and wealth counts. By the end of the movie, these things are nothing but ashes to this man. Step by step, the film is changing Schindler from a cold-hearted, normal business arrogant to a man feeling sympathy, love, care and affection for his fellows. Can his efforts matter? Do one's efforts against all odds and conditions really make sense?<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is great in the film, but clearly Ralph Fiennes gives the defining performance. Both portrayals are worth so much, mainly because they are so true to the circumstances of the time presented. <br/><br/>This film is a one-time significant piece of history; it places you for 3 hours in the unforgotten times of misery this world once saw. Perhaps it bores you in the beginning... but you won't regret a minute once you're at the end."
"sandnair87","10","9","13","18 March 2015"," Right at the Top of My List!
","In Schindler's List, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. It will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. It will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life.<br/><br/>The movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits Krakow Jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. He keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous S.S. officer Amon Goeth with the help of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.<br/><br/>Shot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect: When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.<br/><br/>Headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress ""I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word"" and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.<br/><br/>Marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics."

","Review on Schindler's list The highly emotional movie Schindler's list (1993) is inspired by the novel ""Schindler's Ark"" by Thomas Keneally, that was based on real events. During World War II Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews through the use of powerful nazi friends. Holocaust survivor Poldek Pfefferberg was one of the jews that was saved by Schindler and he inspired the Keneally with his first hand experience of these events. The film, which is directed by the epic Steven Spielberg, has received seven Oscars and is also rated seventh of all movies ever on the site IMDb, which I think shows how great this movie truly is.<br/><br/>Schindler's list can be placed within the categories drama, history or biography. The movie is mainly focused on the character Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, a business man who hires Jews because they are cheaper employers than other ones. In the beginning it is all about the money but after Schindler gets to know some of the Jews he eventually gets an entirely different goal for his business; to save his employees from Hitler. I think this development of Schindler is significant, not only for his employees but also himself. He evolves from caring about his own wealth and women to prioritizing other people and ultimately becoming a better person. Another important character is Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes, a highly ranked nazi.<br/><br/>I think the purpose of this movie is to elucidate and educate people on these horrendous events during World War II. Perhaps its meaning is to give us hope and show us that there will always be good hearted people. From watching this movie I think we can learn a lot about important parts of our history, but also about solidarity. I think it is important to be aware of how hard it must have been to save all those people and how great Schindler truly was! In the movie you could see he had a lot of obstacles.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked with the movie was that it was in black and white because it is really rare nowadays and it makes the movie unique. It also created an illusion that made the movie more realistic and, if possible, even more sad. An explanation Spielberg gave to why the movie was in black and white was that all the documentaries he had seen about the holocaust were in black and white and that he wanted Schindler's list to be in this documentary style so people could understand that the events in this movie were real.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie you could see the real persons that Schindler saved. They walked to Schindler's grave and put a rose on it together with the actors/actresses that played them in the movie. I think this was a great ending of the movie to give the viewers some perspective and show them that the second world war did not happen that long ago.

","I can't believe I waited until the age of 29 years old to finally watch a movie I had been planning to view for years but never got around to. I knew that the story would exert an emotional toll on me but I finally found my chance to watch it through last week and it was worth the wait. This is magnificent and emotional viewing. Based on an inspiring true story that is enough to restore one's faith in mankind. The acting all round is incredible. Neeson is understated - although I have read that he wasn't entirely happy with his performance in hindsight. Kingsley was even more understated. Ralph Fiennes was simply incredible. Totally twisted, believably merciless - he portrays exactly what you would expect of a debauched, unapologetic and excessive Nazi. The overall mood is extremely sad. Some of the scenes that depicted actual events that happened in our world, by human beings - are utterly gut wrenching, heartless and terrifying. The horror of the mass shower scene was an unforgettable experience - by not showing what you expected to see - it seemed to create even more empathy with the helpless fear of the situation. To tackle such historical atrocity is a monumental task indeed. Schindler's list shows us every side to the events that shook, and still continue to shake the world. The horror, the senselessness, the bravery, the hope, the fear, the courage, the evil. The greatest purpose of all that this exceptional movie serves - we must never forget what happened. There are some things that can never be forgotten or forgiven. And there are some people, like Oskar Schindler, whose actions carry a weight that will never be forgotten by all of those who's lives were saved. A remarkable movie about an inspirational man."

It shows laughter, pain, terror, joy, sadness and a lot of faces.<br/><br/>Every actor in this movie, from the smallest background player to Liam Neeson himself create such a strong atmosphere,close to the brilliancy of real film noir.<br/><br/>My recommendation, grab some popcorn, grab some drinks, get cozy and have a three hours well spent with charming and tear bringing picture, a real masterpiece."

The fact that the film had the ability to share a message was fantastic. Yet it was also able to provide a different perspective to the war. The cinematics in the film was extraordinary.

","MASTERPIECE. By far, my favorite Holocaust movie so far. It depicts the horrors of the war and the Jewish nation's suffering and tragedy. It perfectly shows that there is nothing more valuable than human life, powerful and touching. Spielberg directed this movie superbly, and the work done by Janusz Kaminsky (director of photography) was magnificent. I must admit that I don't always pay attention to these details, but what was done in Schindler's List, captures your attention and is hard to ignore any detail. The performances are also pretty amazing, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler is perfectly interpreted. Every expression builds a man, who starts as an ambitious business owner, and eventually, turns into a compassionate man. Yet, my favorite performance was Ralph Fiennes as the cruel Nazi officer, Amon Goeth; twisted, cruel and believable. He creates a perfect villain. Great movie, shocking and heart-shifting."

","Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust."

I know it sounds banal but truth is simple - ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece. No matter what are your believes, not matter what is your life experience or anything else - this is a monumental movie experience. Probably no other movie in my life grabbed my so hard, delivered me to the place and made me experience events so purely as ""Schindler's List"" did. <br/><br/>This is a movie making at it's very best. Everything in this movie works on highest level for some simple reasons - to get the knowledge and to learn. Learn from our past, learn from our unforgivable mistakes and to witness a descent humanity in the most ruthless places of our times. <br/><br/>I won't going to start to admire this movie craftsmanship. It's brilliant. Everything here combines to a one excruciating masterpiece. One who will experience ""Schindler's List"" won't going to ever forget it. This is a timeless masterpiece. And one of the most sticking things that ever haunted me was that this picture was created in Hollywoood, by Steven Spielberg who at the time was mostly known for mainstream blockbuster experiences. How could they come up with such an idea and most important how could they created this kind of a movie, which doesn't represent popular teams and tones is still beyond me. I guess, true art find it's way, and for this motion picture Steven Spielberg will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>Overall, if you haven't experienced ""Schindler's List"" by now, do your self a favor and witness this masterpiece ASAP.

This is the second time I've seen a movie in which nobody exited the theater during the credits. The first was Platoon (my second all time favorite movie). At the end of Platoon the audience sat quietly through the credits before anyone dared to get up and leave. But never before have I seen an entire audience rise in unison and give a standing ovation. And not for a minute or so, but during the entire length of the credits, as if Steven Spielberg himself was standing before us. Then absolute silence fell. Nobody could come up with the right words to say. We were stunned into utter complete and total silence as we stood absorbing what we had just seen, as if a modern day Mona Lisa had just been unveiled before our very eyes. BEST MOVIE EVER...PERIOD.

Like many scenes in Schindler's List, this parting becomes more than an indelible, wrenching moment of shared pain. It is rendered with a restraint and a prodigious film making technique that transform an image into an act of scarcely bearable communion for the audience. The empty uplift seems contrived after the devastating power of what precedes it. But this coda does not detract from a testament in which a man finds redemption in saving others, and a director at the height of his art preserves the past with magisterial authority and conviction."

","When I saw this for my religion class, I was sort of hesitant. I'd heard many different reviews towards the movie. From my mother saying she enjoyed it, to my father saying it was a very mediocre movie. However, I'm the kind of person to try things out to make my own mind on. I don't listen to what ""everyone else says"", I find out on my own. So I watched it with my friend. I would have to say this movie was pretty good. However, it's a really intense movie. You really have to be old enough to understand everything that's happening. For example, if I'd watched this movie two years ago, I wouldn't have understood why all the Jewish people were being killed and why the Nazi's were so cruel. But school taught me well and I learned all about the Holocaust. <br/><br/>When I started watching, I thought the movie would be in color, but once I got through the first 10 minutes, I realized it was a black and white film. I was really confused because I checked it up and found out it was made in 1994. But after doing more research I realized that Steven Spielberg was trying to make it a very powerful movie, and indeed it was. The black and white aspect was, as I said, powerful. The girl in the red coat was really really strong as it showed me that everyone, no matter the age and innocence was killed. <br/><br/>The actors chosen for this film was a phenomenal choice. Liam Neeson portrayed Oskar Schindler way too well. After seeing Neeson in so many other films such as Star Wars, Batman Begins, Clash of the Titans, etc. I realized how good of an actor he is. He really can act as many different characters, from being a kind and caring Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars to being a really strong and harsh Ra's Al Ghul in The Dark Night Rises to finally being a kind, caring, strong but, in a sense selfish, Oskar Schindler. Then with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes, well I was very satisfied with the actor selections for this film. <br/><br/>All in all, I found this film a very dramatic, intense, powerful, but very entertaining. It had a very strong depiction of the Holocaust and how scary it was for all the Jews. Along with how nasty the Nazis were towards all Jews. I would rate this film a 9 out of 10 for all the drama and intensity."

Some men are seen praying or holding prayer beads. As they are gathered on the street, there is many anti-Jewish graffiti seen on the walls and windows of shops and so on. They are then moved to the Ghetto, where they are forced to work and kept inside the community. They still prayed to God that things would be just again, and still retained faith. When out of no where, the Nazi authority gathers people on the streets and shoots them if they don't get on a train to a labor camp. Many are seen paying respects to a small shrine in their homes, or praying. Even when they are put in a labor camp, an old lady performs the rituals of a Bar Mitzvah for a boy.

","Schindler's List (1993) is produced by Steven Spielberg and is about how Oskar Schindler, a greedy businessman turns the labor to salvation for the Jews during the Holocaust. Schindler himself was a part of the Nazi party, and he had been given a factory to produce military clothes, cooking items, and more. He didn't know how to run the factory, and received help from Izakh Stern (leader of a Jewish council), suggesting that he should hire the Jews over the Polish, because they are cheaper. Schindler follows Stern's advice, creating false documents, so he could have ""enough"" Jewish workers. This sneaky action prevented many of the Jews from being sent to concentration camps, almost certainly saving their lives.<br/><br/>The construction of a labor camp began nearby Paszow, with the killing of everyone who opposed in the ghetto. During the time of the killing, Schindler bribed an official so that he could build a camp for his own workers, in his mind; he wanted to keep them away from the guards, preventing any harm. He was also ordered to send all the remaining Jews away to Auschwitz, but managed to convince the same official to let him keep his workers, on the condition that he moved his factory to Moravia (outside Poland). Schindler's list includes Jews who have special skills, and almost all the Jews on his list arrived safely t his factory in Moravia. However, there were a few women and children redirected to Auschwitz by accident, but Schindler manages to bribe camp leaders and saves the children. Basically, he has spent a majority of his money earned in Poland to bribe officials, or leaders of camps.<br/><br/>Schindler, as a German Nazi, had to flee from the Soviet Red Army and told his Nazi soldiers to return to their families, so they could avoid confrontation with the Soviets. The Jews give him a ring with the a quote, which means that he has saved a man and has saved the world, as well as a letter of appreciation for Schindler being the Jews' savior. It was then given that the thousand Jews he had saved, brought up families, which amount over six thousand. It is really amazing how so many people were saved under the power of one man. Not only was the number of people saved stunning, but also to have a German Nazi save Jews is unheard of.<br/><br/>Obviously, the movie was very good from the start to the end, courtesy to Steven Spielberg. With great acting skills by Liam Neeson (as Schindler), and a very accurate representation of the events has made this movie prime during release, as well as in the present day. Based on a true story, it has been a touching, moving and suspenseful movie. It is recommended for people who love to watch movies related to humanity, or want to learn more about the horrible times of World War 2 and the Holocaust, 4.5 out of 5."

","Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.<br/><br/>Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.<br/><br/>Principal photography took place in KrakÃ³w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz KamiÅski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.<br/><br/>Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004."

","Movie: Schindler's List (1993) Director: Steven Spielberg Cast: Liam Neeson, Ben Kinsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a non-fiction movie directed by Steven Spielberg based off the events of the Holocaust Genocide and a true character with the name of Oskar Schindler. This movie shows us how a greedy Nazi party member with the wish of making a fortune ends up saving a total of 1,200+ Jews. Owning a factory that produced goods, Schindler, with the help of his assistant Stern were able to disguise Jews as factory workers, and ultimately save their lives by fooling the Nazi officials. <br/><br/>Schindler never planned on saving the Jews in the first place. He was in the Nazi party not because he wanted to exterminate Jews, but rather because he didn't want Nazis bothering his work. He figured by joining the party, they'd leave him alone, knowing he sided with them. The factory he owned was one that was invested by a rich Jewish smuggler, and his assistant Stern was also a Jew. His factory produced enamelware. His workers were all Jews, for they were cheaper to hire at the time. However despite the fact that everything he owned were up and running because of Jews, he knew about the Nazi's actions, yet still felt no urge to save the Jews. However, Stern, being a Jewish himself, had different plans, and realizing the fact that if Jews were used to work for the Germans, they would not be killed, he decided to hire more and more Jews to work for the factory as a disguise for them. One day, he brought an old man with only one arm into the factory, and the old man accidentally blurted out a thank you. Oskar, finally noticing what was happening, sent the old man away.<br/><br/>Oskar scolded Stern for trying to save Jews, telling him that it was not his place to do so, and also lectured him on how the Jews were here to work, not to be saved. Then suddenly one day, a new concentration camp in Plaszow was opened, and all the Jews were moved there. What they did not know however, was that the new concentration camp was actually an extermination camp. Oskar, realizing this and the cruelty of Germans, started siding with Stern and rescuing Jews. All of a sudden, Oskar's dream of investing and making a fortune turned upside down as he spent more and more money bribing high Nazi officials for Jews as workers, and paying those off to turn a blind eye. Overtime as Oskar becomes more desperate to save more lives, he starts giving Stern most of his properties and leaves him with the task of bribing officials to transport the Jews to the factory. Every day, every second was the same, trying to save as many lives as possible.<br/><br/>Finally, the war ended. Oskar saved a total of 1,200 lives with the cost of his whole fortune. Despite all that he has done however, because he has joined the Nazi party in the past, he is still considered a war criminal. He tells the Jews that have been hiding in the factory that they are now free, and he is to leave at midnight with his wife to avoid capture. The Jews, unbelievably grateful of his compassion, gives them a ring made of gold (which was all they had), and told him that ""by saving a life, you save the world"". With this, Oskar flees.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the best realistic yet intense movies I've ever watched. The idea of making the film mono-colored (black-white) was also very intelligent, symbolizing how the events that happened were history. The facts on Oskar are also relatively realistic, for he did indeed risk his own life to save over 1,000+ Jews. This is a realistic movie that is hard to watch because of all the unfortunate events that happened. It simply arises so much emotion inside you that it is impossible to not be focused throughout watching the whole movie. This film attracts attention, imitates the past, has information that are reliable and realistic, and presents the history near perfectly. I would rate this movie a 9.5/10. Simply a fantastic film."

Based on a true story about Oskar Schindler, this movie is about how a luxurious Nazi Party Members ends up saving more than 1000 Polish Jews from the Holocaust, also known as Schindlerjuden (Which translates into Schindler's Jews). He owed a factory to produce enamelware, and Stern, his Jewish assistant, mainly hired Jews as they cost less. Also, by having Jewish workers and deeming them essential, they realized that the they wouldn't be removed and sent to concentration camps and be killed. Because of this, Stern, Schindler's Jewish assistant, immediately filled the factory with more Jews, preventing them from being sent to death. <br/><br/>Originally, Schindler was a wealthy man that was focused on making money. He was only concerned about himself, and all his profits and investments. He joined the Nazi Party not because he was interested in their ideology and fully supported their goals, rather because by joining the Nazi Party, it will help him make even more money. He had no intention of saving Jews initially, it did not matter to him. The factory and his new apartment were originally confiscated from wealthy Jewish, but he still felt no guilt at all. Later, he realized that Stern was abusing his position in the factory by saving Jews. <br/><br/>He scolded Stern for hiring Jewish people at first. A new concentration camp in Plaszow is opened, and all the people from the Krakow Ghetto are moved and sent to the extermination camp. Seeing this, he started to actively save Jews. He persuades Goeth to send him his workers, and are moved to the factory. Over time, he also gives Stern more of his belongings for bribes to bring people to his factory. One of the times is when a train was transporting children and women was being redirected to Auschwitz, and he bribes the commander with a bag of diamonds to give them to him. He forbid SS soldiers to enter the new factory. Once the war ends, Schindler tells his workers that they are free and is bankrupt, but he will have to leave at midnight as he will get hunted as a war criminal. They give him a ring, he cries, then he flees. <br/><br/>This movie really did feel realistic and everything seemed true. After reading the real Wikipedia page on Schindler, I can say that most of what happened in the movie was true. Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not included, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how everything was black and white, and there was only color for a few seconds in the beginning and end. Also, throughout the movie, it was hard to pickup what the actors were trying to say. Overall, I really did enjoy this movie, it presented the historical facts really well. I would give this movie a 4/5."

","In Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.<br/><br/>Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. Indeed, the biggest criticism the film gets is that it came from Spielberg, well known for his sentimentality. Had another director made the same film, it would probably be considered flawless.<br/><br/>One can wonder about the casting of Liam Neeson as a Moravian German, when he clearly is not. But with such a strong acting ability, this can be overlooked. The casting of Ben Kingsley was brilliant, even if he is not Jewish, and it is a shame this role is not the one he is best known for. Somehow Ralph Fiennes got a supporting actor nomination, but not Kingsley? The choice to film in black and white makes sense, as Spielberg wanted a ""documentary"" feel. Does the infusion of red take away from this? Some might say so.<br/><br/>This film racked up a slew of awards, including several Oscars, and this is well-deserved. Despite its critics, this will no doubt go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, and easily the best to address the Holocaust."

"powermandan","10","9","13","17 October 2014"," This Really Is Spielberg's Best. Really Is One of Cinema's Best.
","Steven Spielberg is arguably the best film director ever. He may have done some bad movies, but his resume is chalkful of some of the most timeless things to every lay your eyes on. Enter Schindler's List: the true story of a crude nazi-party member (played here by Liam Neeson) that saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. Spielberg outdoes himself using every trick up his sleeve and more, to the max. The movie is black and white to get an old feeling and the filming in general is dynamic and hauntingly real. So it is a feast for your eyes. The acting is uncanny with everything being character driven, which are the best movies to see. As a brutal Holocaust film, it is difficult to watch. As a movie about a bold hero, it is a major triumph. Many different emotions are felt at very high degrees, happy and sad. Very few movies made this well that can carry you through over 3 hours can make you truly sad and truly happy by the end as a major accomplishment. None of these few movies are Spielberg's. Yeah ET and Indiana Jones were masterpieces, but a funny-looking alien and an invincible archaeologist can't be taken as seriously and, simply, aren't quite as good. With the general movie-making being superior, its seriousness sets it apart from Spielberg's other classics. Because this is Spielberg's best, it is evident that this would be one of cinema's best in general. Top 20, heck, top 10! If somebody calls Schindler's List the best movie ever, I would not disagree.<br/><br/>4/4"
"caulfieldjanet","10","9","13","16 October 2014"," One of the best of it's genre ever! Poignant and moving.
","Spielberg's finest! Superb writing, acting and directing. I honestly couldn't say who was the better actor, Liam Neelson or Ralph Feinnes. The character's were so real and the actors gave performances that will never be forgotten. The cinematography beyond spectacular. Can't say enough about this one. Loved the black-white effect. It made the movie more bleak, dark, horror of the Holocaust. John Williams' musical score is wonderful. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film. This one along with Jurassic Park, Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will remain in my humble opinion his best!"
"ayush-rock04","9","9","13","7 October 2014"," Great Movie
","Schindler's List blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel based on the role of Oscar Schindler during the holocaust was very much his cinematic coming of age. Many have criticized Schindler as a profiteer and coward for not taking up arms against the Nazis. He was not a soldier and if he had done, at best he may have killed a handful of inconsequential German troops before dying a ""hero's death"". And every man, woman and child who worked in his factory would have been murdered. Spielberg does not shy away from the fact that he was not a saint, showing him to be a womanizer and hedonistic opportunist but when he was faced with the human tragedy of his environment he acted; a reaction that was all too rare at the time. In fact Spielberg draws parallels between Schindler and Goeth, his counterpart in the military work-camp but whereas the industrialist was a man of compassion, Goeth was the embodiment of the Nazi party; a cold, cruel and ruthless man who acted without conscience or mercy. It's true that the film is guilty of button pushing, but it is the manipulation of a master story teller; the highlighting of the girl in the red coat in particular is obviously Spielberg's way around the old adage of ""one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."" Putting a human face on an individual tragedy is the only way it is possible to process horror on such an unimaginable scale. Beautifully shot and expertly played, Schindler's List is a remarkable and moving film that will no doubt be part of a larger monument to an atrocity that must be remembered to ensure that it is never, ever repeated."
"user-120-212339","10","9","13","30 September 2014"," Amazing!
","One of the most moving and captivating films I have ever seen, I would recommend it to anyone! It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centred around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again."

","Spielberg directed countless movies that are to be called masterpiece, but, Schindler's List is above all of his other films. This films tells a true story of Oskar Schindler,(Liam Neeson),a war profiteer and a industrialist who spend his fortune and risked his life to save over a thousand Jews from Nazis. The hear breaking story entirely crafted in Black and White filled with full of terrifying moments of brutality and cruelty all that told with honesty. However, this emotional masterpiece are not trying to teach us about the past but showing just how one man can change the course of another's life by jeopardize himself. Schindler's List will always be remembered Stevens Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional magnum opus."
"braddugg","10","9","13","19 September 2014"," A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.
","A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.<br/><br/>'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'<br/><br/>I finally made it, I cannot ever see the whole picture at once for it's brutality that was displayed, but yesterday night I did it gone through the film at length and just took a water break and the 3 hour long saga made me cry even an hour after it was ever. I am emotional and certainly have deep feelings, I cam to restore them again with very film. It made an impact and it re emphasised the value of the life a human, I know what a loss means, I have gone through that, I just can't bear any untimely losses anymore. Here, they are organising a crime of execution of poor souls.<br/><br/>I wrote the film is in English, though 40% of it is German and Polish.<br/><br/>It's about Oskar Schindler, a Nazi man man who saved more than 1100 Jews from the holocaust of the German Army. 6 million Jews were killed them can you imagine how much it is, 6000000. That is, a whole race was being eliminated and this man stood up against all odds, and saved 1100 of those. Now, this did happen and Oskar Schindler is one of the few heroes who must be revered for what he done to Jew community specifically and to humanity at large. <br/><br/>I can say that I am now happy to be reviewing a masterpiece that shows a world of a different kind, a world that I never knew of, but it happened to exist in the world ward 2 under Hitler's regime. A world where they call you names, just to kill you, where people are not afraid to be dead either. This was what Taliban had did to those in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Now cinematically it's flawless, it's 3 hours but no editing is needed, any cut would demean the value of a life of a Jew, it's best the way it is, cinematography, sound, music, set design and art direction are sublime. Now, what' great is you have nearly thirty thousand people working on a film and they themselves make a world that is real in every sense. The actors everyone of them is just so real. We watch history and many epic films but this one is something else. It is by far the greatest documentary made on war. <br/><br/>I cannot say anything about the genius of Spielberg, I am no worth even to utter a word of single word of praise. About the film, I can say this much, you might not like to watch it many times, but if you did it once, it's highly unlikely to forget anything about this film. <br/><br/>By the way, I loved Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley, he is more a hero here than anyone else. <br/><br/>It's not about applauding the team for such a masterpiece, it's about thanking them for what they have done to humanity by depicting history the way it was. They brought us a story that teaches us value of a life, what more can you ask. I am speechless and even a 5/5 rating seems so less, to this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ah, it's aching me even now as I write this in the joy of pain. Salutauions to the heroes who have saved lives and our only little tribute we can give them is by knowing their story, so please watch this film.<br/><br/>Those, who have seen this, they may better know where it comes. For those who have not, here is a scene from the ending of the film."

Film editing, cinematography, costume design, musical score, screenplay, everything deserve 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>The story is very touching. ""Schindler's List"" is set around German industrialist Oskar Schindler, who used Jew prisoners in Nazi prison camp in Poland as labors. If you don't know the story like me, ""Schindler's List"" will blow your mind. During the last half an hour of the film I was like, ""why don't the start the credit!"" I wanted the movie to end sooner so that I won't see anymore suffering.<br/><br/>4th film ever to get a 10 out of 10 from me."

No time is wasted with fillers or anything of that typical nonsense. Words cannot describe what this movie will do to you both on an emotional and mental level.

You never know what people have gone through, and you'll never know the base of why they are who they are unless you go back. This movie touches on lives that were and will be forever changed even those generations that come after them. You don't have to be born back in that time or even of that race to understand being a slave to things, whether it's people, your job, bullying or anything that takes you out of your free will.

"thomas2193","9","9","13","8 September 2014"," Spielberg's masterpiece
","Schindler's list is a film that showcases the true horrors that occurred during the second world war, and manages to captivate them in the most realistic way that's possible. Although the film was produced in 1993, most of the film has been shown in black and white, which adds to the time period. This is a true masterpiece released by Steven Spielberg, and you can feel the emotion and fright from the actors involved. It must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but Spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. The film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long.<br/><br/>There's a deep message involved in the film, which Schindler makes clear towards his friend, war criminal Goeth. Power is not just control, it's to know when not to abuse your power. Or in a different definition, power is to know when to spare a life instead of taking one. That's what Schindler believes, and that's what makes him one of the most heroic Germans during the second world war. He was indeed a member of the Nazi party, but yet, he doesn't agree with the crimes that the German's commit against the Jews. During the film, your'e able to witness his growing envy of the holocaust and his fellow German Nazi participants. The first step he takes and when his true colors start to reveal themselves, is when he wants a Jewish accountant to run his company. The Jew, Isac Stern, tells him that Schindler might not be aware of the situation, since he's a Jew. We find out that Schindler couldn't care less, since he simply replies with the answer: ''Yeah, and I'm a German''. While the company is able to expend, more Jews start to come over to Schindler's company and start to embrace him like he's a saint to them, because the Jews that are able to work for him, are saved from death. After a while, when his entire company has to dissolve and his workers have to leave for Auswitzch, he buys each and every single worker in his company, to save them from the concentration camp.<br/><br/>That's truly heroic, in my opinion. There's isn't a damn thing he could've done more for his fellow humans. All of the people in the company, that are on Schindler's list, are being transported to Tjesch Slowak, but the woman end up in Auswitzch due to a mistake made during the train transport. He saves them by handing the guard a couple of diamonds, and the women are able to head for Tjesch Slowak. Schindler tells the German guards they will not shoot without permission, nor enter the work floor without authorized permission from him. Stern tells Schindler that the company isn't doing well and that the Granate Shells aren't good enough which will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. Schindler again shows his true colors by simply replying: ''I would be very unhappy if my company would actually make decent grenades''. After the war is over, Schindler has to flee because he'll be seen as a criminal, although he certainly isn't in my mind, as well as in the minds of every single saved Jew from the 1100 he managed to save. Schindler falls down into tears, and despairs that he could've saved at least one more live. That's the moral to the story: How much is a human worth to you? That's something to think about."

","while watching i kept moved by this movie .<br/><br/>.Few American movies since the silent era have had anything approaching this picture's narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.The French author Flaubert once wrote that he disliked Uncle Tom's Cabin because the author was constantly preaching against slavery. ""Does one have to make observations about slavery?"" he asked. ""Depict it; that's enough."" And then he added, ""An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere."" That would describe Spielberg, the author of this film. He depicts the evil of the Holocaust, and he tells an incredible story of how it was robbed of some of its intended victims. He does so without the tricks of his trade, the directorial and dramatic contrivances that would inspire the usual melodramatic payoffs. Spielberg is not visible in this film. But his restraint and passion are present in every shot."

","I am probably still too young to understand the real reasons why SL is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It was mostly shot in black and white while virtually all other movies in the decades before and since are in colour, adding even more of a sense of realism to the film. Schindler's List is a story of a man's change of heart and attitude alongside themes of survival, hope, brutality (mostly served by Ralph Fiennes' murderous Amon Goth)and countless other situations for hundreds of Jews. In black and white, the bloody, graphic summary executions of Jews throughout the film were overwhelming, the images freezing me in my seat and imprinting themselves in my mind to this day, but they justifiably implied to you the horrors of the Holocaust like no other movie. The girl in the red coat seems to symbolise, as her fate suggests, that there is no escape from the dominant force. The acting is spotless. Liam Neeson should have won an Oscar for portraying Schindler (I must admit, I am yet to see Tom Hanks in Philadelphia) with an emotional tone, the performance launching him into super-stardom once and for all. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also played their parts with the right touch, especially Fiennes whose character also seems to change within, halfway through the film, but only slightly, his insanity still alive as in one scene he randomly snipes numerous Jewish workers from his bedroom. But the star is director Steven Spielberg, who in 1993 made maybe not his most famous movie, other projects such as E.T., Saving Private Ryan, CEOTTK, the Indiana Jones saga also rising forward. But without question, maybe with the exception of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest work."

","The Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. Oskar Schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires Jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. But, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. Liam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But, the portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the Jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing and hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the Jewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the Jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air. <br/><br/>An unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where the protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people really adore him. This can be defended by accepting that the real Oskar Schindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the rest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience. All in all, the movie stands today as a masterpiece made once in a lifetime."

This movie is a clear view to the inhumanity of the ""Third Empire"". The colors black and white stay for the death in the Nazi regime.

","WWII and The Holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions. Tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million Soviets dead, 15+ million Chinese dead, 6+ million Poles dead, 7+ million Germans dead, 11 million the victim of Nazi genocide â it just beggars belief. The European and Pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. However, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information.<br/><br/>The film follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Sudeten German businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during WWII. With his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through Nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland using Jewish labour. At this point Schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the Nazis' approaching final solution.<br/><br/>He eventually becomes acquainted Amon GÃ¶th, the callously evil commandant of the PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp who is performed excellently by Ralph Fiennes. GÃ¶th was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following: 'Amon GÃ¶th himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' GÃ¶th's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. The film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls.<br/><br/>Fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered Englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. Just like an inundated office worker, GÃ¶th complains to Oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses â 'Can you believe this? As if I don't have enough to do they come up with this? I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' <br/><br/>Like Adolf Eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, Fiennes' depiction of Amon GÃ¶th is another example of Hannah Arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. It is a compelling depiction of one of the Third Reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in Nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity.<br/><br/>The relationship between Schindler and GÃ¶th and his SS cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. Schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a Jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of SS officials.<br/><br/>As the film progresses and Schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. Deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. Their exchanges shows that Schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas GÃ¶th only has ruthless barbarism, something GÃ¶th realises and struggles with.<br/><br/>The film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. A notable example is the 'Red girl' scene during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. Schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. The scale of the scenes at the PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. I think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and I also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in Saving Private Ryan (1998). <br/><br/>A great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with Schindler's List as Spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in John Williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people.<br/><br/>The depiction of the mass exhumation at Chujowa GÃ³rka is set against 'Immolation (With Our Lives, We Give Life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. There is also notable use of Hebrew music, such as the ebullient Yerushalaim Shel Zahav and the haunting Oyf'n Pripetshek/Nacht Aktion. Even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'Exodus', a work by the celebrated Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling.<br/><br/>Despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably Stanley Kubrick, who said:<br/><br/>'The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.'<br/><br/>Firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. Kubrick suggests that 'Schindler's List' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the Holocaust, it certainly isn't. It is a true story, Oskar Schindler really did save 1200 people, it isn't a fanciful, maudlin figment of a screenwriter's imagination. It is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering.<br/><br/>97%<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"sebondar","9","9","13","6 June 2014"," One of the best historical films
","Schindler's List (1993) is one of Spielberg's most creative, and dramatic films ever, and one of the most powerful films ever released. Everyone should watch it and experience the historical true event. Whoever has not seen this film is definitely missing out. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson fit the leading role perfectly, making the film entirely believable. You truly experience the darkness, and the light in this moment of persecution in our history. There are very few films this good about Jewish persecution. Another must watch film similar to this one is the The Pianist (2002).<br/><br/>Another reason to watch this film is because history repeats itself. Persecution is still happening today."
"user-18-888430","10","9","13","3 June 2014"," A Moving Film
","I thought this movie was a really amazing one, probably because it connected to me in such a deep way. Although this started off as a religion class movie, it was much more than just that. I feel like that I connected with the movie on more of a spiritual way instead. The most heartbreaking scene to me was the final one, where Oskar Schindler broke down in tears as he was about to flee Germany. I think that the situation he was placed in really exemplified the role of moral issues in the movie. He reflected in his choices he made relating to the number of lives that he could saved and this I'm sure, left Schindler with a tremendous amount of guilt. This was also a point in the movie where I realized the big issue at heart in this movie. The dilemma I think he was facing was one about sacrifice and how much a life is worth. I thought that this idea was one that really challenged the audience and is an unanswerable question. Apart from the emotional/moral side of this movie, I thought it was well produced and well made. The acting from Liam Neeson in this was fantastic and he showed the feelings faced perfectly. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone - it really shows the state of society during The Holocaust and faces important moral values."

","Movie Review - Schindler's List<br/><br/>Schindler's List is captivating because the story it tells, the characters it portrays and the way it was shot feels very real to the audience. Why the Nazis had persecuted the Jews was not explained, however, throughout the movie, the audience are reminded how the Jews are not considered as people but inferior beings. All the Nazis believed this, with the exception of Schindler, he befriended his Jewish accountant; he showed empathy towards his workers; he even kissed a Jewish girl. Schindler saw the Jews as people and as his peers, to all the others they were an inferior life form, to be exterminated.<br/><br/>The movie was mainly shot in black and white, conveying a mood of bleakness and hopelessness. The most memorable use of color is the red coat worn by a little girl, seen by Schindler during the evacuation to the camps and again seen by him in a pile of burning corpses.<br/><br/>The main characters were developed in depth and detail. Schindler's character changed from a greedy businessman to someone who spent all his money bribing the 'list makers' to save as many Jews as possible. The mood intensifies as the Jews realizes that they are being systematically killed, and, that the Nazis are slowly loosing their grasp on their humanity as they indiscriminately kill all the prisoners. In the end, the audience are reminded that although unbelievable, these events are real and that real people are depicted in the movie."
"onno1996","9","9","13","1 June 2014"," My review of Schindler's List
","Schindler's list gave me some insight on how Jews were treated out of concentration camps in Nazi Germany. This film is about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who starts a company making silverware using unpaid Jewish labor during the Nazi regime. Overtime as Schindler develops empathy towards his workers. Schindler moves his factory and his workers back to his hometown in Czechoslovakia and waits till the war blows over. During the process of aiding the Jewish people, Schindler spent millions of Reich marks in order to feed and save 1100 Jews. This movie The Nazi soldiers would abuse Jews by cutting their hair, push them around, or even killing them. Jews were forced to wear a Star of David and were obliged by law to inform German men that they are Jewish. This film shows us how Jews were forced to change their usual practices in daily life. This is depicted in the scene where Schindler tells the Rabbi that he should be preparing for the Sabbath since it is Friday evening. This is also seen when the Jews are celebrating and they break the glass. Overall I believe that this was a fantastic film that was very educational about the Holocaust and the Jewish faith, and also an inspiring humanitarian."
"juggermat","10","9","13","28 May 2014"," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","It was not surprising when a name like Steven Spielberg is printed on a film cover to be so sensational and mind-blowing. The film could be called a masterpiece which is compelling due to fabulous acting of Liam Neeson at his best. Not to mention that the whole concept of the film only came to realize when Ralph Fiennes force you to comprehend the abstract meaning of humanitarianism.Apart from the actors and their glorious plays the storyline was sad and drama but worth even ten visits.When a conceited businessman gradually changes during his war life and decide to help his workers to survive you can feel the true story that lies behind the movie. Thus if you have not seen the film yet I strongly recommend watching it as soon as possible."

"RossRivero99","10","9","13","16 May 2014"," Spielberg at his best
","Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created."

And it worked.Schindler's list is an amazing movie, If you haven't watched it, you really need to. Steven Spielberg is a genius and having only the little girl in color somehow added a even greater depth of sadness and melancholy to the movie. I admit, I did cry a lot during the film."
"belleofjune","9","9","13","25 April 2014"," Phenomenal Film
","Probably one of the best film ever made. Of course it's Steven Spielberg, but considering the actors portraying their characters most especially Liam Neeson as Oskar Shindler, he performed it excellently. The plot which happened in 1939 which started the World War II showed information to those who are not well versed with what really happened at that time.<br/><br/>As a 1980's baby, I never knew what life was with the Jews until I watched this film. It is more than an entertainment film for me. It is very informative and adds knowledge to the naive. <br/><br/>And I was very impress with the casting. the fact that Neeson auditioned for the film while we all know he's a good actor then and now.<br/><br/>Cinematography, wow I like the idea of Spielberg of making it documentary-like kind of film. He used black and white to make it feel like real documentary from the 1930's. It surely gave an edge of the film. Spielberg is a genius.<br/><br/>Overall, I love it."

"tomgillespie2002","9","9","13","6 April 2014"," Feels short at over three hours
","Schindler's List is a film that will no doubt forever grace the endless 'Best Movies' lists trumped up by various organisations and movie magazines. It's serious subject matter, black-and-white photography, rousing score and 'directed by Steven Spielberg' tag has cemented it's status as one of the best American movies of all time. But the more hardened movie-goer will more than likely pick holes in it, and tell you that this in fact not even Spielberg's greatest achievement. Which is why, 21 years after it's release, I decided to revisit Schindler's List, and although I would agree that Spielberg has made better (he did make Jaws (1975) after all), this is still a masterful work, a wonderfully mature step-up for the film-maker who had, up to 1993, leaned towards the visual spectacle of David Lean and Howard Hawks.<br/><br/>The Holocaust is now very much a roll-your-eyes focus for a film-maker, easily passed off as a desperate plea for awards and serious recognition, and the Oscar are routinely stacked with movies portraying this appalling historical event. But Spielberg's movie was the first one brave enough to show it for what it was - a sickening, bloody event that humiliated its victims and where the life of a Jew was worth less than the work the Nazi's could squeeze out of them before they were routinely disposed of. Documentaries such as Night and Fog (1955) and Shoah (1985) hit hard, much more so than in this movie, but Schindler's List feels like a documentary come to life, with Janusz Kaminski's cinematography giving the movie a sense of timelessness.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, a Czechoslovakian opportunist looking to use cheap Jewish labour during World War II to make him enough money to help him retire a very wealthy man. He employs Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinsley) to hire his workers and run his factory for him, at first making kitchen utensils to be used in the war. After witnessing the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto under the direction of SS- Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), in which many Jews are massacred, Schindler is profoundly affected. He begins to lavish gifts and bribes upon Goeth in order to protect his workers from being murdered, but as the Germans begin to lose the war, Goeth receives the orders to move the Jews from his camp onto Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Made the same year as his CGI blockbuster Jurassic Park, Schindler's List showed an unseen maturity in Spielberg's work. He had made 'serious' films before, but they were always in the style of classic Hollywood; grand, sweeping epics that were generally homages to better directors. Here, Spielberg is invisible, his hand nowhere to be seen until one of the final scenes. This was film-making closer to Italian neo-realism, with hand-held cameras, bleak cinematography, and a glorious lack of sentimentality. Rather than make you weep into a tissue, he has you looking away from the screen in utter shock. Hundreds of naked Jews are humiliated as decisions are made on their ability to work and Goeth coldly shoots workers with a rifle from his balcony before breakfast. In one of its most famous scenes, a group of women are led into a shower room that may just be a gas chamber. It's one of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.<br/><br/>Spielberg wisely chose relatively unknown actors to fill the roles. Neeson, now inexplicably an action star, brings a complexity to Schindler as he changes between smug womaniser and Nazi suck-up to a man capable of great kindness and selflessness, and the film isn't afraid to show the darker side of his character. Kingsley, who was known for his Oscar-winning role in Gandhi (1982), is Schindler's consciousness, a constant reminder of the atrocities that were being committed outside of Schindler's comfortable bubble. As Amon Goeth, one of cinema's most memorable villains, Ralph Fiennes steals the film. He is a hypocritical, loathsome psychopath, embodying the sense of self-righteousness of the Nazi power trip. He despises the Jews, and preaches about their extermination, yet falls in love with his servant Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), only to beat her in his disgust.<br/><br/>Although there are better films out there that focus on World War II or the Holocaust, it is of no surprise that this is still one of Spielberg's most revered films. It is a brave, accomplished film that gives you a sense that this was the film the director was always meant to make. However, he seems unable to resist stamping his recognisable dose of sentimentality at the climax, as Schindler breaks down in front of his workers wishing he did that little bit more. It's an unnecessarily slushy scene, a piece of director self-indulgence in what is damn near a perfect film, that, if anything, lessens the brutal impact of what came before. But this is a staunch reminder of the atrocities that humanity is capable of, and, as all great movies do, feels incredibly short at over three hours.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"SnoopyStyle","10","9","13","23 March 2014"," Spielberg's most important work
","Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.<br/><br/>This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

","Talking about the incident that changed the face of humanity for ever is not the easiest thing to do. There are lots of ways a story can go wrong, especially when you subject is World War II. Even so, Schindler's list manages to keep the politics away as much as possible and to bring you a story that is thrilling, exciting and most of all scary. <br/><br/>Your jaw will drop when you see through what horrors the humanity went through in World War II. It is very graphic and this is the reason after all. It treats you like an adult who understands pain and fear. <br/><br/>From the first moment you will understand what it is to live in Europe during wartime. You will see greed, despair, hatred and much more. People trying to stay alive while others are trying to make piles of money out of it.<br/><br/>One major aspect is that nobody is perfect. Not a single person is presented to be completely soulless or some angel, but instead in a shady gray. Everybody will get what they deserve and this shows you how important are your life choices and how important is to preserve our humanity against the times we are leaving. It is not about religion or beliefs, but how we treat each other.<br/><br/>Through this movie you're staying in the first row of a history lesson which meticulously teaches you how important your life really is and how many died before, for you to have the life you have. There is not an exact word to express this movie, but it is for sure a good reminder of what hateful and merciless times our predecessors endured."

","This film is will make you change the way you see people. It will make you think that there's a silver lining in life and we shouldn't give up. You'd see here the amount of destruction and deaths that were caused by the Nazis. You'd think that they are really the most ruthless and violent people in the face of the earth. The acting here is great. Everyone does their best. Liam Neeson is amazing here. Every emotion that he feels can be seen in his eyes and when he sees a random pedestrian getting murdered, you'd perfectly see that he feels sympathy for he victim and anger towards the Nazis. The near end scene here shows a burst of emotion from him. That scene is just spot on perfect in every way. You could see all the pain he kept in him and he opened up to a crowd of Jews. There are a lot of frightening scenes here especially the burning bodies scene. It just shows how many people the Nazis have killed and they still manage to be angry at the Jews. Like I said this film is an experience, it changes the way you see people and it makes you sonder. No other film has made me feel so sad. This film is a must watch and it is a film worth passing on"

","Steven Spielberg has made his own Holocaust museum. In Schindler's List (Universal), an adaptation by Steven Zaillian of Thomas Keneally's book, Spielberg has created a 184-minute account of the fate of KrakÃ³w's Jews under the German occupation, centered on the German businessman and bon vivant, Oskar Schindler, who devised a ruse to save 1,100 Jews from the Auschwitz ovens. A closing note tells us that in Poland today there are fewer than 4,000 Jews but in the world there are 6,000 ""Schindler Jews,"" survivors and descendants.<br/><br/>For this film Spielberg has done the best directing of his career. Much of his previous work has been clever and some of it better than that, but Schindler's List is masterly. He has, with appropriate restraint, shot it in black and white (except for two closing sequences in color). Janusz Kaminski's superb cinematography uses shadows like prosodyâ illuminates with shadows. Michael Kahn has edited with intensity and line, never breathless, always fast. (One demurral: the inter cutting between a Jewish wedding in a camp, a wild German officers' party and a German officer's boudoir romp is heavy.) John Williams has arranged a score, with Itzhak Perlman doing violin solos, that for the most part is quiet: Jewish melodies on woodwinds or a small children's chorus under scenes of inhumanity.<br/><br/>STANLEY KAUFFMANN"

That word Endoslung is the word. The final solution! After we clear Germany of that pestilence, we will live in peace and have plenty. We will rise our Ariyan children and be happy, we will not work much, Eastern Europeans will work for us in our Lebensraum and peace will prevail on Earth.

","This film is an amazing representation of what Shindler did for a small percentage of the Jewish population. Some would not like this film due to the fact that it is black and white for the majority of the film. There is one point where there is colour among the black, white and grey which is a very heart wrenching scene (im not going to spoil it). Although sometimes it seems that the film drags on it makes a statement that will never be forgotten and will possibly make you love one Nazi who tried to do the best for the hunted.

","This movie was, in my humble opinion, the greatest movie Steven Spielberg ever created. I have loved most of his movies, but Schindler's List trumps them all for one very important reason: it's a true story that not only tears at the heart strings of any human being with a heart, but it captures a piece of history that is personal to Spielberg himself. I am a major defender of the nation of Israel and a lover of her people. The idea that any man could glean pleasure from destroying any human life is a concept way beyond my grasp, but to feel a race of people is so superior to another that the other is deemed unworthy to live is beyond reason. <br/><br/>As you may have guessed, Schindler's List is about the Holocaust. Spielberg brings the stories of a relatively small group of Jewish families who were caught in the middle of the world's greatest tragedy right to your living room. What makes this movie so different from most other Holocaust movies is that you get a first-hand look into what a real life hero is made of. Heroism is not all muscles and brawn. Sometimes all it takes is a broken heart."

You wish you could've yourself done more, even though you weren't there. Liam Neeson is amazing in this movie. I don't cry often. Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do more.

","I just watched this movie recently, after postponing it for years and years. 3 1/2 hours or so just seemed to daunting.<br/><br/>I am glad I did finally watch it with my roommate. We both thought it was the best film by Steven Spielberg by far and easily one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>All the performances were top notch and it tells an important part of our history which many people do not even know about. It is brutal, it shows people getting executed, huge piles of bodies being burnt and much much more. It made me as well as my roommate tear up several times and it became harder and harder to hold the tears back as we both would have sobbed without being able to stop.<br/><br/>The end is also very emotional when Liam Neeson's character, Schindler, realizes he could have saved many more lives if he had not spent so much of his money. The film ends with the actual survivors visiting Oskar Schindler's grave and paying tribute to his unforgettable achievements once again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can only give this masterpiece only 10 out of 10 points. There are not enough stars to give to this movie."
"Theflyace","10","9","13","7 February 2014"," Spielberg' Finest Artistic Achievement
","Candles slowly burn during the Shabbat in a Jewish household. After many hours of burning and illumination, the flame goes out and gives off ominously rising smoke and reveals the black and white image that snuck in as the candles shrunk. Such is the tone that is set for the rest of the film Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's tribute/justice to the millions of Jewish people slaughtered during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>This particular chapter of the Holocaust is the portrait of the mysterious Oskar Schindler, and his actions during the war in Poland. We see him begin as an opportunist businessman, who wines and dines with the Nazi higher ups in exchange to receive funding for a factory he wishes to profit from. For both parties, Jews are considered ""cheap labor,"" therefore Schindler hires Itzhak Stern to handle rounding up a workforce in his new factory. Stern is really trying to save as many people as the ""Herr Direktor"" will allow from certain death. Over the course of the film, something changes in Schindler that drives him to save ""his Jews"" because he begins to realize the atrocities being committed around him, and that he must make a difference, even at the risk of losing his life in the process.<br/><br/>Every actor in this film is perfect, no matter how big or small the role is. Liam Neeson gives his best work here as the complicated Schindler. It could have been a stereotypical ""revelation"" motivated performance, but Neeson never condescends to a perfunctory level. He is complimented in his performance by Ben Kingsley as the loyal and determined Stern. The actor who steals the film is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. He, like Neeson, has the hardest task of any actor, to give humanity to someone who is morally reprehensible on paper. His is one of those performances that was robbed of the recognition it deserved.<br/><br/>Much like the film The Shawshank Redemption, this film delves into the souls of the people in the middle of a dark situation. Schindler himself is an enigma. here we have a man who begins thinking about only himself and his money, but realizes what his actions mean in the big picture of what's going on. As the film progresses, he begins to care about the people he has saved, and pours every ounce of energy and every cent of his money to make sure that they do not suffer the same fate as those who couldn't be saved. The character of Stern acts as his moral compass, convincing his boss that what he is doing is right. He does not always agree with his boss' logic, but works to make sure no one is killed or taken away to the ovens. The evil incarnate character Amon Goeth, is also conflicted by his feelings about this whole affair for one reason. He too hates the Jews with a brainwashed passion, but ironically falls in love with his Jewish housemaid. He struggles to come to terms with this fact while still managing to shoot Jews at random for sport.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg and writer Steve Zaillian take a really smart approach to the material, by not making the characters one-dimensional or motivated by a cheap clichÃ©. We are never really clued into what makes Schindler change his mind about his workers until the very end of the film, which is a brilliant storytelling masterstroke.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing glamorous at all in this film, which lends its greater sense of verisimilitude. The cinematography is in black-and-white, as it should be. If it had been in color, it would have been all wrong. Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski shoot this like a documentary, lending itself to far more realistic shots and actions than a straightforward drama. The violence is truly gut-wrenching and sickening, but again, it is an accurate view of what happened in real life. The disturbing image of bodies burning and the billowing smoke from the Auschwitz chimney won't leave one's mind for years after seeing this film. The girl in the red coat is the most haunting image from the film, as the filmmakers wished to convey the confusion of how people didn't even know this was happening, even though it ""stuck out like a girl wearing a red coat."" Spielberg knew just when to add color to the film, the moments when there is true despair or hope at the end of the film<br/><br/>This film is made all the more haunting because of the first-rate score by John Williams. Backed with the violinist Itzhak Perlman, Williams delivers one of the best scores in eternity, and one that is never overblown. Both use their beauty to convey a dark passage in history, but most importantly, to highlight the success of the people saved. <br/><br/>At a first glance, it would seem Spielberg was the wrong man to make this film, as his focus in his early career was on entertainment films and escapist images. With this film, we see him blossom into a true artist. He does not mince images or words in this film whatsoever. He presents the events depicted like it was, stark and hopeless. Spielberg so poured his heart into this material that it was reported that he sobbed every day during filming, but wouldn't relent in telling this story. This film is the greatest achievement in his career, not only in terms of Oscars and recognition, but his transformation as an artist."
"cowboykalira","9","9","13","24 June 2012"," Only a true cynic will mistake this for sentimentalist crap
","Schindler's list to this day stands out for being one of the most impressive movies made about the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Spielberg went the extra mile in every aspect of this movie. Superior cinematography, lots of historical references (which, although not always completely accurate, give a good sense of what the holocaust was like for the Jews), brilliant actors, brilliant score, amazing screenplay.<br/><br/>People have criticized it for being too sentimental, and I can understand their problems with that, but I can't agree with them. The subject matter is still one of the darkest periods in living history.<br/><br/>Now we have a film like ""Der Untergang"" which shows the story from inside the Nazi high command at the end of the war, and that movie is even more haunting than this one. It doesn't focus however on the victimization of the entire Jewish community, and therefore does not have to deal with the emotional burdens of the people who had to live through these conditions.<br/><br/>Another point is that if you want to show the holocaust in a drama film, you have to think of your audience as well. Although many people still know what it was like, there are also large groups of people who haven't got a clue about the war. They heard the figure, 6 million Jews killed in concentration camps, but know nothing about the ghettos, the slave labour, the slow descent from being deprived of the right to have certain jobs, to being murdered just because you are a Jew.<br/><br/>Schindler's list makes this history accessible to the masses. Spielberg does this expertly, by balancing the sentimental with the downright cynical and horrific.<br/><br/>Where a film like Der Untergang focuses more on the human weaknesses of the Nazis, this film poses the Nazis outright as the pure evil that Jews had to deal with in the war. This is a very different approach, that can be classed as a more conventional narrative. Good versus Evil. Oskar Schindler stands alone as the ""good German"". In reality there were others like him of course, but in the reality the protagonists of this movie faced, those ""others"" played no part, so it is not necessary for the movie to work to emphasize this.<br/><br/>What more can be said? Well a criticism has also been that the Jews are being portrayed as little more than meek victims, and that no heroism from them is shown. Unfortunately the war didn't offer many heroic opportunities for the Jewish people. There are exceptions to this rule, but most of them suffered without hope, without a chance to fight back. You can look for the exceptions, and criticize Spielberg for not showing that side. Would that be fair on history? Maybe, but let's face it, the exceptions were far and few between, through no fault of the Jews themselves, but because the Nazis had such a firm grip on the Third Reich that a deed of defiance by one hero, could cost the lives of many bystanders who had nothing to do with it. Most Jews simply had to bear every degrading action undertaken against them, and there was nothing they could do about it. <br/><br/>All in all you have to be quite cynical not to be impressed by this movie. It is just too powerful for that. Yes, in the end much is made of making Schindler into a true hero, especially the scene before he flees, where he cries that he could have saved more. Some people hate this scene, and think it schmaltzy, over-sentimental, sanctimoneous crap. I think that it is a great scene, although this scene is very Hollywood, and most probably not an accurate portrayal of the way Schindler fled the factory. But it ends the development of his character, as he finally realises the mistakes he made. He therefore goes from being a cynical crook at the start of the movie, to a man who reluctantly saved people, to a man who enjoys his role as saviour, to finally coming to terms with what he did, and what more he could have done, if he hadn't been busy showing off.<br/><br/>This movie is a true classic. If you can watch it without shedding a tear, please check your heart's temperature, because it probably is frozen solid."
"jordankennerly","9","9","13","31 May 2012"," A Masterpiece of Complexity
","This film is no ordinary war film. There have been many films made from WWII material, but none with this sense of power and desolate emotion. Liam Neeson's performance as the aggressive business entrepreneur turned savior of Krakow Jews, Oskar Schindler is one of deep intra-personal confliction and emotion, that one feels almost sympathetic for the man who is playing such a dangerous game. His goals are simplistic in the outset, make money and use the Jews cheap labor to do so. Progressively as he witnesses the horrors of the Holocaust, so vividly brought to life by Mr. Spielberg, his resolve as a businessman deteriorates, and his drive to save lives is bolstered by things almost unknown. His motives aren't stated, as doing so would ruin the complex, magician like quality he has for getting what he wants, when he wants.<br/><br/>In speaking of scenes unforgettably vivid, the horrors of the Holocaust have never seemed as real as they did as I watched this film. In particular, the savage hunting done by the SS during the Krakow ghetto liquidation is a visual memoir to the relentless and mind numbing slaughter that was. The sheer desperation and cunning wit of the Jews to survive evokes an inspired, yet marred feeling inside one's self as we see them unsuccessfully evade murder. Then, as the film comes to an end, the surviving ""schindlerjuden"" place rocks on Mr.Schindler's actual grave in respect and remembrance of what he had given them nearly 50 years before. The scene delivers such emotion as you can literally feel the gratitude the survivors feel they owe Schindler, as maybe the respect shown can somehow ease the debt the owe to him.<br/><br/>The accuracy of the film seems to be hit right on the head; the adaptation of Thomas Keaneally's novel is seamless, except for the enlargement of certain roles throughout the film. Many first-hand accounts of Schindler, and friend/foe Goeth say that the two actors gave such startlingly real performances, that the survivors began to tremble in sight of meeting them. As for things to be said, or left unsaid, I cannot recall a scene in the movie that I would rather have not wanted to be there. Every scene, no matter whether it was a monologue or mass hysteria, held relevance, emotion, confliction, simplicity, complexity, and sheer importance to the film's message and understanding. Steven Spielberg may have thought he was not qualified for this film, but I cannot think of any other director that could have done what he did with this remarkably dual-themed story. Schindler's List is nothing short of inspiring. Showing that one man can changed the entire country of Poland, whose Jewish population today totals around 4,000 with over 6,000 Polish people being descendants of the ""schindlerjuden"". In the face of uncontrolled horror and death one man boldly and illogically stood against his German brothers and showed the world what saving a life can mean."
"hassan_zakee","10","9","13","12 December 2011"," Moving film about human life and how less it is valued
","Firstly, it must be said that Ralph Fiennes is absolutely stunning as the ruthless and cruel Goeth; it is without doubt the finest performance by an actor that I have ever seen. How he did not win an Oscar for this film is beyond me and probably beyond others. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson also delivers a great performance as a man who lives only for wealth and money but then changes slowly into a man of principle who begins to feel empathy and sadness towards the Jews after witnessing their persecution.<br/><br/>This film depicts the atrocities of man and how it considers power to outweigh the sanctity of life. Only after watching this film will one realise that suffering and destruction are a reflection of reality; how men committed unspeakable acts on behalf of their superiors and how those same men were then led to fight for a purpose which was non- existent. It must be emphasised that this will never change."

","This was originally a nine-out-of-ten film for me, but I'm giving it a TEN just to counteract the incredibly negative opinions of those people giving it 1 or 2.<br/><br/>The film has some flaws and feels very engineered in places, such as the campy scene at the beginning when Schindler strolls up stairwells unhindered like a God, entering into an office full of neatly organised desks and orderly queues when in reality everyone is in utter panic - completely unrealistic and cheesy. And the bit where fat, naked old ladies are running around the concentration camps, cutting to scenes of extremely skinny men being examined, then cutting back to those fatty ladies running around. Poor selection of extras.<br/><br/>However, none of these criticisms can take away the pure mesmerising watchability of this film. I've seen it three of four times and will certainly watch it several more times before I die. Even if you don't like the film, it's still so well filmed, researched, acted and directed that it deserves at least 5 or 6, even if you hate the corny Spielberg take on it.<br/><br/>A TEN out of ten for entertainment from me."

It had a powerful effect on me and most other viewers.<br/><br/>This movie is about the transformation of a war profiteer and how he goes from a self-centered businessman to a rescuer of Jews during the second world war.<br/><br/>The acting is unbelievable. I thought Liam Neeson was okay in the first ten minutes then he really brought his acting skills to another level after that. Ralph Fiennes was great. It was very easy to hate his character.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a marvelous director. All of his movies I seen were great ones and this may be his best. John Williams provided a mesmerizing score that will haunt my mind for a long time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a emotional movie.

It was the right choice not to cast famous actors, it would have taken the seriousness from the film, Liam Neeson gives a strong performance through the film, I mean, he helps the Jewish, but he still sees them as an inferior race, but at the end, when he breaks down in tears after they give him the ring, he recognizes them as people, not workers, people. One of the best scenes ever, I loved the transition of the character. Ralph Fiennes is an excellent villain, I love the inner fight that he has when he ""falls in love"" with Helen, his performance gives you goose bumps. <br/><br/>The symbolism, how it is all in black and white, except for the girl in the red coat, the innocence of a kid walking around corpses, the death of innocence, for me.

It is the traces of sentimentality that actually make it bearable - we watch the film not to relive the Holocaust, but to bear emotional witness to it.

No other movie has never shown the horrific thing's that the people in death camps, including not only Jew's but everyone, were witnesses and part of every single day! Very well done! And i give a big credit for it to a producer, BRANKO LUSTIG, who was an AUSCHWITZ surviver when he was a little kid. I'm sure, as Spielberg sais, that he had a big influence on this movie.<br/><br/>------------------------- <br/><br/>The directing is amazingly beautiful and this is one of the best directed movies ever.

I especially liked the certain part's such as the one when we see a little girl in red coat in the distance and everything except her coat is in black and white. That was a beautiful scene. It really seals in your memory! As does the other part when we see the little girl in the red coat.

How he was nothing but an idiot in the beginning and didn't care about anything or anyone except for his own pocket which he later on completely emptied in order to save the lives of his workers which were brutally killed every single day. I especially loved the character of AMON GOETH! What a great portrayal of a sick and evil man that's even kinda charming at times. I really loved his character. Simply perfect!

","A well made and well thought out piece of work. Overall, I can say this worked in black and white when it's been done to death in other films. Direction, Production value and the Acting is nearly unparalleled. I will not mention names as all deserve equal credit for an outstanding performance. The most interesting bi-play for me was between Schindler and Goeth. As the story progresses Schindler tries to suppress his humanity for the sake of profit and Goeth tries to suppress his evil for profit. Throughout this Schindler cannot deny humanity and tries to force barbarity out as this is the only way he will survive. Goeth, perhaps, realizes the evil and tries to force out his humanity only to realize that his barbarity is the only way to survive in the regime he is in. The struggle goes on, and, I think at the end both men realize they have lost. By far for me the most interesting character is Goeth, as you can see sputters and sparks of enlightenment trying to come through, only to be dismissed. If you can watch this movie and not shed a tear, let me know, I will check you for a pulse. This film, while perhaps not a documentary is still a testament about something that should never be forgotten, much the same as Saving Private Ryan is about the combat troops (Schindler's list is not a war movie IMHO) in the European Theatre of WWII. This movie never lets up on you, there are no moments of levity to save you from an account of a dreadful time in history. Not to be missed."

","Some people believe that Adolf Hitler was possessed by the devil. Well, that may sound ridiculous to some but actually not to me. There is no way someone could be so evil. There have been a couple of films to show how sick he was. One of them was The Great escape. another was the revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds. Both terrific films. One film that I will never forget(those two aren't forgettable)is Schindler's list, which won best picture in 1993. <br/><br/>Schindler's list is probably one of the best films i've ever seen. It has such a great story. It's at times very disturbing. Oskar Schinlder was a great guy. Excluding the fact that he was a part of the Nazi party. But he risked his life for the Jews, with knowing that he'd get in trouble. Schindler's list is a devastating film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has been making classic films for many, many years. He is a genius. I have only seen one of his films that i've disliked. Artificial intelligence. My favorite of his is Raiders of the lost ark. Then Schindler's list. The film may be three hours long. Sometimes when it's a three hour film I can't bear it anymore. Such as Transformers 2. But if it's Lord of the rings, or Gandhi, or Schindler's list, there is no way that I will call the length a flaw.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays a great guy named Oskar Schindler, a business man in the Nazi party. He soon opens up a factory in Poland. When he realizes what the Nazi's are doing to the Jews, Oskar and his friend(the always great Ben Kingsley)hire Jews to work in the factory to keep them out of concentrations camps.<br/><br/>Ralph Feinnes stars as a sadistic Nazi who really just kills anyone. For instance there is a scene when there is a Jew walking through the street and he shoots her. Embeth Davidz stars as his slave. <br/><br/>Nazis were sadistic, power hungry, fame seeking bastards. Every time I watch Inglourious Basterds, I think, if only this were based on the truth. If only Hitler was shot to death inside a movie theater. But Schindler's list is based on a true story. Oskar Schindler was a great man. He saved the lives of about 1100 Jews. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I think. This is a brutal film. And, unlike many films, it actually nearly got a tear out of me. That rarely happens. And when it does, it's either because the film is truly spectacular or because it's just a sad film.

This was because my grandmother and cousin were talking the whole time. I saw it the second time because my friend wanted to see it and I figured if there were ever an opportunity to give it a second chance, then was as good as any. Good thing my friend is quiet. I watched the film without distraction and now admit my initial feelings for it openly and ashamedly, and I both regret and rejoice in my decision to watch it again. Schindler's List is a masterpiece, a brutally honest portrait of the darkest and most despicable chapter of human history that seizes the heart with a black hand and shatters it as each crack of gunfire cuts off the life of another innocent man, woman, or child. I cannot ever watch it again, unless I am showing it to someone who has never seen it. It is the tale of one man who saved hundreds from the undeserved wrath of the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was and forever will be a hero, and this testament to his courage captures every aspect of it, great and terrible.

This movie took great efforts to show that each life is precious, and the sheer number of those murdered should not lead to ignoring that each person had a unique story. What is unfortunate for a movie that attempted to elucidate the amount of human suffering clear from any politics, is that a blatant political statement was made at the end. the line by the Russian officer, 'Don't go east, that's for sure. They hate you there. I wouldn't go west either, if I were you' when the Jews are freed is a clear attempt at a justification for a Jewish state. the entrance of politics could overshadow the othewise far-reaching message of the film, which is a human one. other then that, the movie was impressive at arousing a feeling of human sympathy and compassion."

Well critics rating and its ranking speaks very much about it.We have seen many movies about Nazis hatred for jews, including some really good movies like The downfall(2004),Inglorious Bastards(2009) and many more,but this movie is different..because it shows how a man can help others,if he wants to while remaining in his limits & working under constraints. Schiendler's list emphasize on this aspect of the story.Watch the movie from the view of a person who tried to maintain his position within Nazi and help his so-called enemies in the process.From that point you will really appreciate the movie."

","I just have to chime in and agree with all the praise heaped on this movie. A movie is great when it shows a fundamental truth. What is the fundamental truth of this movie? The truth is that sometimes people will have an extraordinary reaction to evil around them, and can change their basic nature. Why is this so powerful? Because it is so rare. Most people do not change their nature. Especially when confronted by situations where it is easier to just go along. Oskar Schindler makes a moral choice to not go along. It is tough. It is dangerous. Yet, he makes the choice.<br/><br/>I was once watching a show about the holocaust. The show was about a recently discovered photo album, by one of the killers taken at Auschwitz. One comment that one of the narrators said really stuck with me. ""What made these people so monstrous, was that they were not monsters."" That is the true horror. Ordinary people during this time period were just doing there ""jobs"". In other words, what was so horrible about the Holocaust, was not that these people were deviants, but that they were so ordinary, and that this happened in our lifetime.<br/><br/>In the movie Oskar Schindler starts out as an opportunist. He realizes that he can become very rich by moving to Poland and taking advantage of the desperate situation that has arisen there. He does this in a masterful way, and soon becomes very rich. Gradually he realizes what is going on around him he decides that he has to make a choice. The choice is incredibly courageous. What was so extraordinary about his choice was that so few people like him did so during this time period. After the war, most absolved themselves of their responsibility by saying, ""I was only following orders."" An amazing story. Highest possible rating.<br/><br/>Offbeat trivia about this movie This movie was also written into a script of Seinfeld. Jerry and his current girlfriend haven't been able to be alone. He decides to take here to a movie to make out. What movie does he take her to? This one! This has to be one of the funniest scenes ever in a comedy series. Who could write a scene that is potentially so offensive, but yet hysterical. Much hilarity ensues when Jerry is spotted making out during the movie by a relative."
"aamocho","10","9","13","30 October 2009"," Excellent performance..
","This movie fascinated in the sense similar to The Pianist(2002), but the movie forces the viewer to appreciate the beauty of representation of the movie. The scenes in the movie can be offending or heart-shaking, but this is the real quality of a movie that it can successfully urge the viewer to get sentimentally lost inside the movie and the words of appreciation comes out of his mouth. The movie takes a turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation comes out of his mouth automatically.<br/><br/>Regarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and appreciable. The film is better, in my view, that The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which, in IMDb, is the top rated movie. A must watch!!!"

"sddavis63","9","9","13","3 August 2009"," Horrific And Yet So Inspiring At The Same Time
","This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow, it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on Schindler. She's hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in particular?<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through Schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings me to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job - completely believable as he portrays Schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie, especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says ""no - you did so much"" and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10"
"spirit270","10","9","13","2 August 2009"," Spielberg's greatest hit!
","The events of the Holocaust are a sensitive topic to talk about just because there are so many different views/opinions on what happened. Spielberg took a huge step in turning the events of Schindler and the Jews he put on his list to work for him that would ultimately be saved by him. Spielberg executes this very sensitive topic by putting so much emotion in it. The first time I watched this movie was in my junior year in high school in American History class and throughout the movie it was amazing to see the different expressions of shock, stunned, and tears in the eyes of even high schoolers. The movie, although very long, keeps your attention. Spielberg also does a great job with adding in small figures and things to make you stop and think what they mean and how it relates to everything, including the color red that shows up very little, but shows a symbol of color within a black and white movie."
"johnmschofield","10","9","13","27 July 2009"," One of the greatest film epics
","Last January a friend and I travelled to Kracow in Poland for a long weekend and while we were there we visited a town 50 kilometres from Kracow called Oswiecim or what the Nazis called Auschwitz. Had we visited that place 65 years ago I suspect what we would have seen then was graphically illustrated in this film. I do not know whether the film is historically accurate but the horror and degradation did take place and a man named Schindler tried to get a number of people out of that area before they became statistics too. The film in my opinion probably describes the times for those in NAZI occupied mainland Europe perfectly. In order to get anything that you wanted or needed you had to deal directly with people who had the power to have anybody killed on a whim not just because they could but also because they probably liked it. Oskar Schindler was an extremely good actor he must have been to have done what he did. Yes he paid a lot of money for these peoples lives but he had to go along with whatever happened no matter how bad to achieve what he did. The 1200 people he saved would probably not have survived but for his actions. This film may as well be a CCTV tape of those times and is therefore not fiction and anybody watching the film for the first time needs to keep that in mind."
"footballgrl84","8","9","13","13 July 2009"," Consequential Choice
","Everyday people make selfish choices that impact the world around them. In rare cases, random acts of selfishness end up making a positive difference. Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning movie ""Schindler's List"" uses the true story of Oskar Schindler to exemplify just that. Brilliantly, Spielberg captures the human condition in a story which is sure to win our hearts, and make us reflect the impact simple choices make in the world. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Spielberg eloquently evokes the audience to ponder the costs of human life, and the questions that arise as a result. At exactly what point does money not matter anymore? How much suffering should people endure before enough is enough? And is it possible to overcome something as horrific as reducing the value of someone's life to the degree the Holocaust did? <br/><br/>Set in World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory to cash in on the cheap slave labor of the Jewish people. Enlisting the help of a Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Schindler procures concentration camp prisoners to work for him in his factory, at little to no cost to his business. Stern begins to save his family and friends from the horrors of Nazi Concentration Camps because of Schindler's initial blindness by prospective money. As his work force rises, Schindler becomes extremely wealthy on the backs of his Jewish workers. Eventually, Schindler cannot ignore the horrors of the Holocaust, causing his cheap price of slave labor to no longer exceed the cost of Jewish lives. Thus, Schindler creates a list of prisoners to protect from the gas chambers, and convinces Nazi soldiers to keep those people alive. But is it too late? <br/><br/>Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler could not be any better. Neeson strikes the perfect balance between his disinterest and profiteering at the beginning with his compassion and humility at the end. He engages the audience so effortlessly; it is as if we are looking into his mind. Neeson flawlessly exemplifies how simple choices can affect the world around us."
"rcj5365","Null","9","13","19 June 2009"," The masterpiece of 1993....Schindler's List
","Any filmmaker who chooses to deal with the Holocaust faces several serious problems. The first is deciding which story to tell. Conventional heroics are impossible;a realistic look at the horror is too appalling. In Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel,Steven Spielburg found the right balance of redemption and sorrow. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) is an ambitious businessman who realizes that there is money to be made in war. In a masterful opening montage,Spielburg mixed the forced transfer of Polish Jews to cities after the Nazi occupation with Schindler making his own moves. As families register with bureaucrats who sit at folding tables and make their tidy lists,Schindler matches suits and ties,selects the right cufflinks,and pockets a hefty bankroll. The Jews are forced into their ghetto;Schindler goes to a nightclub where he wines and dines high-ranked Nazis. The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern(Ben Kingsley)and offers him a deal. Since Jews cannot own businesses,they should work together. Stern's contacts can provide financial banking. Stern himself can provide the expertise to run a business. Schindler will bring ""panache."" ""That's what I'm good at,"" he says. ""Not to work...the presentation.""<br/><br/>It may not be a fair deal,but once Schindler signs contracts to provide the Wehrnmacht with cooking utensils,he is able to open an enamelware factory that provides several hundred Jews with jobs. Those jobs,the documentation that goes with them,give the men and women a measure of safety as the Nazis' plans for the ""final solution"" grind inexorably forward to the March 13,1943 liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. That is one of the most harrowing series of scenes ever put on film,and it is matched by the concentration camp sequences that follow. In those scenes of mass chaos and slaughter,Spielburg uses a single spot of color to highlight one little girl. In the black-and-white world,her coat is red. It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielburg's Empire of the Sun(1987),in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home.<br/><br/>In those same scenes,Amon Goeth(Ralph Finnes)is introduced. Goeth is a flabby sociopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism. He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and so must be brided and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business. Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from war profiteer to crusader. The exact moment of that change is not shown,and it should not be shown. Though popular films are built around such epiphanies,that scene would be out of place in this careful film. Instead,its an accretion of layered awareness that makes Schindler what he becomes. Though Goeth is a selfish,undisciplined man who drinks too much and sleeps with too many women,he is moved by the mounting barbarism,cruelty,and savagery that surrounds him. Neeson's performance is built on a combination of self-confidence,indecision,and doubt. <br/><br/>Though some have criticize Steven Zaillian's script on the grounds that it makes Schindler more altruistic than he really was,it does stick closely to historical fact in the numbers of people that Schindler saved from the Holocaust. In the same way,the real Goeth was even more monstrous than he is in the film. But the full scope of his atrocities had been shown,the film would have been unbalanced. As it is,Spielburg pushes the limit,showing as much of the horror as the screen will bear. That horror is alleviated,slightly by Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white cinematography. It gives the violence an abstract,dreamlike quality that no form of color could have matched. He won an Academy Award for his work,and the American Society of Cinematopgraphers placed the film at number five on its best-shot(1950-1997)list. John Williams's somber,almost unoticed score adds the melancholy tone. ""Schindler's List"",also was the overall winner at the Academy Awards. Winning seven Oscars including Best Picture of 1993,as well as Best Director and for Steven Spielburg.<br/><br/>Any viewer might be able to find shortcomings somewhere in the collaborative effort,but to what point? Schindler's List demonstrates the potential of Hollywood film-making that is so rarely achieved. When the full financial resources of the industry and best creative people are put in service of an important story,the results can be staggering."

"studproquo","10","9","13","2 May 2009"," Powerful, dark, and beautiful mixed in a pool of madness and hope.
","Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. His films are passionate, have adventure, style, and all of his films have a gifted story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. For example, films such as - Jaws, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Close Encounters of the Third Kind - they are all classics and everyone has just about seen them. And with such talents as his, Schindler's List is now my favorite movie. With so many graphic scenes and so much horror, Schindler's List moves you unlike any other film you have ever seen. For example, the scene where the kids think they are going somewhere fun, only to be walking to their deaths, scenes like that move you, and they are all throughout the film. It's visually stunning as in terms of the Holocaust and is one movie everyone must see to understand the true horrific nature of the Holocaust. The movie does not show Adolf Hitler one time, which kind of surprised me, but it does follow an unwealthy business man, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who asks Jews to work for him during the depression in Germany. He treats them nice, because he does not know what is actually happening to the Jews. Once he sees numerous murders with his girlfriend on horseback, he hates the idea of it, but he claims there is nothing he can do. When he is convinced and he hears the ""worst"" cases of what happens to Jews that are in Concentration Camps, he makes it his mission to make a list and have them all work for him, so he can at least save some people. This movie is truly touching, including the scene where the kids are waving bye on the bus, and of course the shower scene where you think they are all going to die, that really surprised me and I nearly cried when they were about to die and then the showers turned on, and they realized where they really were. This movie is truly amazing, and it did win best picture for the Academy Awards, which I am pleased with. I am so satisfied with Spielberg's hard work with this film and his other successful films. Spielberg is truly a genius, and this film shows it."

Although I wasn't hysterical this time, I cried throughout the film and again asked the same question: How could ""they"" do this to people who'd never harmed anyone? This time, there was no one to answer my question because there is no answer.<br/><br/>The problem is -- we keep forgetting. In Afghanistan, Darfur, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Haiti, throughout the world and throughout the centuries. We teach our children to hate people who have different religions, different types of faces, even different economic stations. <br/><br/>Schindler's List, and the other films of its kind, should be watched regularly by everyone.

","""Schindler's List"" was THE movie of 1993, and nothing came close to touching it in acclaim. It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups (""The Color Purple""), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.<br/><br/>So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it. I don't know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can't help himself.<br/><br/>However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I'm not sure it's fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it very well.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

Those who say its fictional and that isn't how it was and I have no idea what they are talking about. Nazis hated and killed Jews during WWII. Thats exactly what the movie shows and in the middle of it all was a man named Oscar Schindler who really did fool the Nazis by bribing them. His spent millions and saved thousands and it really happened. And Schindler knew a man named Amon Goeth who was a psycho Nazi. The men who played these guys played them as close to perfection as possible. Liam Neeson was fabulous as the man who first cared for nothing but money and his heart was changed after the horror he witnessed (but respectively lost to Tom Hanks for Philadelphia). Ralph Fiennes was great as the crazy Nazi and truly made the performance believable. This movie is probably the greatest movie of the 90s and should have reminded most people at the time that not all modern movies are sub par.

","Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet.

"dee.reid","10","9","13","15 December 2008"," A triumph...
","Filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 1993 World War II/Holocaust drama ""Schindler's List"" is a cinematic triumph. Unquestionably Spielberg's most ""satisfying"" film about WWII (and of his career, perhaps), ""Schindler's List"" is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. This is what Spielberg's vision of World War II was really about: regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I saw it last. I saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. Boy, am I glad I chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because I surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.<br/><br/>Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" I do. ""Schindler's List"" is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then ""Schindler's List"" showed us that that kid has finally grown up.<br/><br/>Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to ""Save one Life, and save the World Entire.""<br/><br/>What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed ""Schindler's List"" at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.<br/><br/>10/10"
"policy134","10","9","13","15 December 2008"," One of the greatest films of the 20th century
","You can't really find anything that is as powerful, thought-provoking and tragic as seeing this superb film from the director, often accused of dealing with more flashy projects. Even so, as tragic as the subject matter is, it is not a depressing film.<br/><br/>We see Oskar Schindler (a brilliant performance by Liam Neeson), con man and war profiteer. He likes the finest things in life (good wine, women and most of all money) but a metamorphosis occurs where he simply doesn't care about any of it and loses everything in order to save his workers, who happen to be Jews. He is himself a member of the Nazi party.<br/><br/>On the other hand we have Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a part that defines evil), the ruthless leader of the death camps where Jews are killed left and right, simply to terrorize the living Jews who mistakenly believes that the Nazis operate logically. He is stupid, alcoholic and a miserable human being. Fiennes plays his part with absolutely no redeeming qualities and the scary part is that you can't figure him out. A bizarre sequence between Schindler and Goeth illustrates this point, where Schindler tries to explain true power. We think that Goeth will take the advice of Schindler, only to learn that Spielberg goes the other way. Quite schocking.<br/><br/>Both Schindler and Goeth pay for their actions and you can't really say that either of them is a hero or a villain. Spielberg doesn't want us too root for anyone, he mainly shows us what happened. Of course, many people consider Schindler a hero but Liam Neeson never plays the hero. He simply seems to have lost interest in all what he held dear in the beginning.<br/><br/>What is so fascinating about this movie is hard to explain. It doesn't have one glamorous moment and there are many horrifying scenes. Maybe it's this: It's a depiction of triumph of the human spirit (sounds clichÃ©, doesn't it?) but it is nevertheless true."

""I could have got more"" . . . scene, really brings the movie to its best.<br/><br/>The movie has become one of my favorite and very close to heart. This comment I am writing after watching the movie for 15th time.<br/><br/>I Thank Steven Spielberg for giving Hollywood such a wonderful cinema.<br/><br/>And I wish people would change their perspective about the value of a Human Life."
"rachel_d_walker","8","9","13","4 December 2008"," A compelling must-see
","This film is long, tedious, graphic, disturbing, and well worth watching. Although there are some critiques on here that claim the film focuses too much on the ""positive"" (if you can say there is such a thing in the midst of the Holocaust) it would be a very different and much less watched film if it was 193 minutes of the worst moments in the history of the Holocaust. It does not sugar-coat the atrocities that occurred, in fact there are many graphic and undeniably violently disturbing scenes. However, without the hopeful stories of those that Schindler saved, the film would be unwatchable. There is an honest depiction of the horrible things that occurred in the Auschwitz, but there is also a story of hope. One that doesn't discount the atrocities that were inflicted on the Jews, but also leaves you with some faith in humanity. The story of a greedy, powerful goyem, using his power and money to save all of the Jews he can from Auschwitz is incredibly moving and is what makes such a depressing film worth watching and prevents the viewer from leaving the experience with a sense of total depression."

","****Classic ****Excellant ***Good **Fair *Tragic<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Shindlers List is a riveting experience from start to end. The resounding performances, the emotional score, the visceral and beautiful direction, the landslide powerhouse cinematography and so the list forever goes on. Spielburg has crafted a masterpiece that sculpulates the granger, the brutality and sadness of the Holocaust. Only one kind of director could have designed and re-shaped the emotionalness, the stomach-churning violence and a cascading event that will forever stay embedded in our minds. That director was Steven Spielburg.<br/><br/>The story, though simplistic, is told in a profound vision that one could only feel like they were there, and Spielburg creates this perfectly.<br/><br/>The story is as follows: Oskar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war. He witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews, and starts to save them.<br/><br/>The way the whole film is shot is only part of it's magnificence, but Spielburg provides substance and deep methodic styles to accompany this with.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes all provide magnificent and powerful performances that only when thinking about it resembles the motives and detail of the characters that are so boldly and tightly-suited to perfection.<br/><br/>The decision to put the film in black and white is exactly true to the time and places that the film took place around.<br/><br/>The backdrops and cold baron Polish wastelands show the best cinematography from Spielburg.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>A phenomenal account of ones mans passion for saving not one life, but many. Spielburg still proves he's the master of modern cinema by delivering a resounding and heart in-sighted belief of showing the most moving event in history."

","Schindler's List is to Steven Spielberg, as the Mona Lisa was to DaVinci. If there ever was an absolute masterpiece of cinema this would be it. All the necessary requirements of film are met: Great story, outstanding cast, flawless camera works, and tempo.<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg departs from pieces about dinosaurs, aliens, and adventure seeking archaeologists by bringing something personal to the screen.<br/><br/>This film is about the difference between good and evil. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who is a German Industrialist, (not an evil trader), who like all other German's in the 30's and 40's became unwilling supporters of the Nazi's. Like the good industrialist he is, he seizes the opportunity of war to make a profit. Schindler, being the business man that he is, accepts Jewish laborers from the Nazi party. Afterall, what business wouldn't want to reduce labor costs. The money starts rolling in and times are looking good. Schindler is happy with the money and the added bonus of Nazi connections while, the Nazi's are happy with decent Munitions, pots and pans, and the added benefit of putting the hated Jews to work.<br/><br/>However, the Nazi's plans are revealed to Schindler, with the assistance of his accountant (Ben Kingsley), when Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes), takes over his workers to put in to play Hitler's evil ""solution."" The good man, and smart business man realize that the SS are motivated by two things: Power and Money. Schindler realizes the sacrifice of his amassed fortune is the only way to save these Jew's from execution.<br/><br/>In the end the film reveals that Good can come the the least likely of sources.<br/><br/>This piece of cinema cannot be topped by any other. Just as every brush stroke of the Mona Lisa defined it as a masterpiece; The black and white setting, the coldness of each scene, and the highlighting of the little girl in Red, and the flame of the candle set this film apart from the pack.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Mr. Spielberg for giving such a wonderful masterpiece of American Art."

","Currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, ""Schindler's List"" remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. If you ask me, the film is not truly about the Jews themselves. For me, the main part of this film deals with the man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the Jews. He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. ""The Fugitive"" is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win. Of course, it is a film like ""Schindler's List"" that truly deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"tonymurphylee","Null","9","13","8 September 2008"," The cruelest film ever made. This is the closest we will ever come to witnessing pure evil in film.
","This, to me, is the cruelest film ever made. Sure, there have been many films that have depicted cruelty in it's most realistic and most non discriminating. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL showed us a very true depiction of the holocaust. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST showed us how far people will go to be known and to be famous. IRREVERSIBLE showed us a nine and a half minute rape scene that is nearly impossible to watch and to sit through without being forever haunted by it. SALO' OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM showed us pure innocence being destroyed and defiled by political right-wingers. HAPPINESS showed us how deeply depraved and how inhuman and mentally deformed some seemingly ""normal"" people are. VISITOR Q depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting, horrific, and depraved and don't even seem to know that what they are all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to. PINK FLAMINGOS shows us two groups of people who act in every bad and evil activity known to mankind, knowing that it's bad and not caring. However, SCHINDLER'S LIST in my opinion, goes even further than all of those films. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a film that all of humanity should be required to watch and sit through. I refuse to watch it again. SCHINDLER'S LIST was a film that affected me so strongly and so deeply that just thinking about it frightens me. I've tried to sit through it a second time and got about halfway through, but I just couldn't handle it and I refused to finish it. SCHINDLER'S LIST is the closest we will ever come to knowing what it was like to be a part of the holocaust. It is among one of the darkest films I've ever seen in my life. The film itself is about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, who owns a company and puts Jews to work in it. However, on the opposite side of the structure we meet a man named Amon Goeth. Goeth is a man who cares so little about the value of human life that he target practices with Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is unflinching isn't doing the violence enough justice. We don't watch the violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it's angriest and goriest. People are shot in this film. We don't see people firing a gun and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel helpless. The people who do it don't see anything wrong with doing it and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a flawless film. The film's ending makes it all worth sitting through. It remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion picture history. The final thirty minutes are so heart wrenching, honest, beautiful, and strong that it is worth enduring two hours and forty minutes of non-stop cruelty. The ending remains to be the of the great endings in motion picture history. We may not recover from the film, but what we gain from the ending alone makes it all worth defiling your mind.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>-Absolutely perfect performances from the entire cast and all speaking parts.<br/><br/>-Unflinching and honest depiction of the Nazi Holocaust of the 1940s.<br/><br/>-beautiful black & white cinematography.<br/><br/>-A true knockout of an ending! <br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>-none"

","Schindler's List is an undeniably the greatest drama epic ever displayed on the silver screen. The film was an institution in itself. Steven Spielberg endeavors with all his strengths to bring alive a magnificent script rendered by Steven Zaillian. Even though based on a book by Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian puts in a lot of effort mingling the originality of the book with the actual events of Holocaust. Brilliance begins from the very first frame of the film and doesn't end until the end credits. Liam Neeson delivers a wonderful performance, very believable. Ben Kingsley offers an equivalent performance. Ralph Fiennes is very good in his role. The emotions portrayed in this work of art are tremendously related to every human that exists in the world. I'm sure every bit of audience had felt the impact this film leaves by its concept. The aura of the film leaves the audience pondering after its end.

I loved how the movie was in black and white and it really fit in with the story and how dull times were during the holocaust. If it had not been in black and white the movie wouldn't have been as good. The picture in this movie was so beautiful and the directing by Steven Spielberg was very good also. Im glad that this movie won a lot of Oscars. The acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Phiennes was amazing but I can understand why Tom Hanks won that Oscar for Philadelphia.<br/><br/>This is one of those few movies that become so emotional near the end that its hard not to start crying. The ending scene gave me goosebumps everywhere. It sure deserves the 8.9 rating and I bet it has a very high score on rotten tomatoes.

","Schindler's List should be a punishment: a chastisement for not reading your textbooks properly about the Holocaust: a horrible genocide in which more than 6 million Jews were killed: an immense population. It gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white photography, Schindler's List is scary because it is real. There is also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns (very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students who've already read ""Night"" or learned in depth about the process of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" unless they find it interesting. In fact, I think ""Life is Beautiful"" is a more uplifting movie to watch in order to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those treacherous Jewish ghettos. Oh yeah, the actors in Schindler's List were brilliant: very convincing. The setting was brilliant. The ending was in my opinion the best part of the movie, so if you start watching it, don't stop during the middle because of the atrocities."
"hayden65","9","9","13","16 July 2008"," Schindler's List is a Masterpiece
","I first saw Schindler's list in my R.Studies class but since it runs for 195 minutes or round abouts, and my R.Studies classes only went on for 60 minutes, i could not watch the whole film but within the first 60 minutes you see the main character of the film, Oskar Schindler, a real man who actually did most of the things as depicted in this film. So after about 2 years of first seeing the film my brother purchased the DVD Schindler's List, the first day he had it and watched it. From the start you see a seemingly greedy and uncaring business man who cares only for money, he is also a member of the Nazi Party, the infamous political party ruling Germany at that time led by none other than Adolf Hitler. Nazi Ideolgy stressed the greatness of the German people and race, they hated peoples such as Jews, Slavs, Roma and homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, the mentally or physically disabled, communists, liberals, and social democrats along with other ethnicities. So from the the moment you know Schindler is a Nazi the general reaction is that he is an unlikeable characters and and through common perception of Nazi-ism, a cruel man. But his character shows not much of the sort, in the scene where he is dancing, laughing and drinking with friends you see him to be a joyous and fun man. throughout the film Oskar Schindlers character steadily changes from the greedy, uncaring Nazi businessman to the selfless humanitarian who, in fact, lost everything to save his Jewish workers ( now known as Schindlers Jews ).<br/><br/>Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler very well indeed and his acting in this film is testament to his overall success as an actor and is, in my opinion, his best film by far. I like how the character Amon Goeth played by Ralph Fiennes, is used to personify Nazi idealism, Nazi Cruelty, Bruttality and a complete lack of respect for human life and humanity itself with scenes such as the ones where he wakes up in the morning, picks up his sniper rifle and hunts down Jews as if they are animals, as if its a sport and when he just point-blank shoots Jewish men without remorse or mercy.<br/><br/>On the whole, Schindler's List is a Powerful and emotional film which is testament to Steven Spielberg's Directing skill and is a must see."

","Well, first of all, this is not my usual type of film. I don't like watching such realistic films, since they really depress me. But since this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.<br/><br/>This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the film, we are able to look into characters' emotions and minds. A lot of character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique. They each give their whole into it.<br/><br/>The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a 'grand' film. The productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones, and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.<br/><br/>Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn't really follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience. Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest work he ever made."

","""This is very cruel, Oskar. You're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that. *That's* cruel!"" Hope, that is the key to getting through this powerhouse film from Steven Spielberg. He holds not bar on showing the violence surrounding the Holocaust and in that he could have gotten bogged down in despair, but he keeps the pacing a flurry like his most frantic works and creates well-defined character who despite being horrifying to degree, especially Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, offer some glimmer of humanity.<br/><br/>The time is 1940's and the war is gripping Europe and in Poland the beginning of the Holocaust has occurred as the Jews are herded into a Ghetto to live a very limited life for time. Into this time of despair and exploitation comes a showman of sorts, Oskar Schindler who sees an opportunity to make a fortune from the misfortune of the Jews. He first builds a rapport with high officials in the Nazi army, knowing later he will need their support. Next he offers the Jews with something left their option to having hope of some life after the war. He does this with the help of a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who becomes both his conscience and his friend. As Schindler is building a well off business off of cheap Jewish labor, SS officer Amon Goeth comes in to jump start the process of concentration camps for the Jews and it is he how heads up the Liquidation of the Ghetto.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the whole journey of all the characters from the start of the Holocaust all the way to the end of the war and it does it expansively and personally taking note of many excruciating situations most often leading up to death. The film is held together by a fantastic timing by Spielberg which mixes grief with hope and death with life. Add to this some of the best performances of the modern age from Liam Neeson as a towering Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the odious and delirious Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as the conscience of Schindler, Itzhak Stern, and you have one of the most powerful movies ever made.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson performance is great because it has such a great transformation that he expresses brilliantly and almost brings you to tears by the end. He starts out as an indifferent business man, a profiteer intent on making his fortune. But he ends up getting very close to his works and thus gaining a heart which is broken by the end of the film by the horrors he witnesses. On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes performance offers different strain of powerful as he pulls the string of the evil character as he shows a sadistic taste for killing from the start. When he first arrives in the film he is approached by a Jewish Architect who informs him that they need to rebuild a building because the foundation is not right. He takes a second to look over what she tells him and then and tells his officers to shoot her. Even though her advice he does heed, having them rebuild it after shooting her in the head, he says he could not tolerate dissent. It is terrifying performance as he hides his love for a Jewish maid by repeatedly beating her. Finally Ben Kingsley performance offers the purest of the performances as Kingsley plays the straight arrow, the man ever with the heart from the beginning to the end showing an ever willingness to do what he can to make life easier for his people. He is Schindler's conscience in forcing him to see the hope his enterprise is effecting for the Jews.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a stark grain of black and white thus tempering some of the violence, but it is still extremely potent as the cinematography gets into the faces of the people showing their etched emotions as well as the horrifying deaths of so many. Streets filled with bodies and ash ridden streets.<br/><br/>This stands as one of the most emotionally draining films ever created and is technically outstanding from the powerfully moving cinematography to the softly straining score by John Williams and the towering performances."

Steven Spielberg one of the best directors our time made an unforgettable masterpiece with Schindler's List in 1993. The story of Oscar Schindler the businessman who saved more than 1000 Jewish life at the end of the German terror is more than a movie. It's a documentary of years full with pain, fear and death. We can clearly see what happened in Europe and most in Poland until WWII. Spielberg's directing art in his most touching movie is phenomenal. The cinematography with the beautiful heart touching music of John Williams and the powerful acting with names like Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson and of course Ben Kingsley made an excellent work. Everyone should see this to never forget and maybe understand what can happen when mankind goes crazy.And if you can go to Poland, You should visit Krakow and the place where the Jewish ghetto was in Kazimierz.

"wendy0422","9","9","13","7 June 2008"," Director has an equivocal attitude.
","the director's point of view shown in the film is something more than that of the Jews. Rather his point includes that of the Germans at the same time by focusing mainly on the storyline of the German hero 'Oscar Schindler'. This whole plot clarifies his intention to make the film hold a balanced view of two sides. Thus, It escapes from a dichotomy which the Jewish people as the victim may easily fall into; beautification of the Jews and demonization of the Germans.<br/><br/>In this sense the director somewhat exceeds the limitation of the nationality. In addition, his viewpoint puts an emphasis more on the individual level than on the national one. There is actually a wide spectrum even among German people in the film; merciless Nazi 'Goeth', merciful Nazi 'Oscar' and most people who sit back and watch uncritically. <br/><br/>It's exactly the individual traits which make the result different. In specific ""Shindler's List"" especially focuses on the motives and acts of such kinds of people as Oscar who gave up his profits in order to save others. Therefore the movie is basically a further study about those who have a great soul which rebels against the atrocities and pursues the idea of 'Humanity'."
"bobsgrock","10","9","13","20 May 2008"," Spielberg's best.
","Steven Spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a German Nazi Party member who became the savior for over 1100 Jews during the height of the Holocaust. This is very dark material and Spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. Here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. The acting is superb with Liam Neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that Schindler went through. At first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. As the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on Jews in the local towns of Poland. He then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in Poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of WWII. This is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. When I first saw it, I cried at multiple scenes. Now, after seeing it for the second time, I was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple German businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. He went face to face with multiple SS officers, including the demented head of the camp Amon Goeth played sinisterly by Ralph Fiennes, in order to save all he can. The last hour of the film showing Schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the Jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. Here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone, Schindler's List is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that I pray will never occur again."

Then this film goes on in black and white. Someone may wander why the director had to make it a black and white film. In my opinion the director made it on purpose. The gray pictures show audience a kind of depression and seriousness. At that period, the dark clouds of death covered the Jews' sky. The color of life has gone; the color of civilization has gone. To be frank, watching this three hours long film in black and white makes me feel uncomfortable, but is this feeling just like what the victims felt in those days? Being in the darkness for so long, they are really eager to see light---the light of hope, and they are longing for color---the color of life. The film let the audience experience this feeling in these black and white pictures. Based on the true story in World Warâ¡, this film tells us a story about a German business man, Oscar Schindler, tried to save more than one thousand Jews and other victims from the Nazi Germans. Oscar Schindler used to live a luxurious life with great ambitions in his business. He was a devoted member of the Nazi party and was in close touch with the Nazi officers. The war provided him a good opportunity for his business, thus he wanted to get every possible benefit from it and decided to manufacture military need products. Just because the Jews are the lest costly labors available, they were brought to work for him. At first when his Jewish workers were killed by the soldiers, he was just angry because it made him lose money. One day, with the words ""today is history"", of Amen, the chief officer of the German troop, the holocaust began. The noise of machine guns was never stopped in that day. The blood of the Jews flooded the streets. Oscar Schindler, who was riding a horse in the wood, happened to saw the killing from the hill. In the mess, he saw a Jewish girl running in the street. In this black and white film, only the girl was in red. This color makes her different. I think the director must indicate something to us. What does this color mean? Does it represent blood and anger of killing, or passion and hope of life? I kindly thought it was hope, but in the later part of the film, we saw the girl in red again among the bodies to be burnt. When I watched the film for the second time, I realize that had not for some good people like Schindler, no one can survive under the beast like Nazi. After seeing the holocaust, Schindler changed. He tried his best to save the Jews. He bought over 1000 lives from the devil. Through the long list with the type machine clicking, we see the light of hope again. In the final of the film, the war ended, and the picture turned to color again. The world is bright again. This is a movie worthies watching for everyone. We should never forget history. Keeping history in mind does not mean keeping hatred in heart and revenging, while forgetting history means betrayal to all humankind."
"I_Love_Spielberg","10","9","13","13 May 2008"," Genius! Pure Genius!
","The Academy Awards made a smart choice when they gave the Best Director and Best Picture award to Steven Spielberg for this movie. It's a sheer masterpiece, and the work of a pure genius.<br/><br/>This is a perfect testimony to the Holocaust survivors as the man who saved them: Oskar Schindler, a black marketeer, whom is beautifully portrayed by Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>What I have learned from this movie is that one man, not an army, but one man can make a difference in the world. I also learned that we should not have hatred or prejudice in our hearts, for hatred and prejudice are the few things that spawned the Holocaust. Now, what's sad about it is that we still have prejudices, we still have hatred, and there are still things like the Holocaust going on in the middle east.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everybody. I think that everybody needs to see this movie and know, regardless of the dramatizations, that this actually happened. There really was a man named Oskar Schindler, and he really was a member of the Nazi party, he really was a black-marketeer, and he really did save over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>This is probably Steven Spielberg's best movie since ""Jaws."" I can see why it would've made him cry during filming. To finish, I'd like to say ""Thank you, Steven Spielberg, for exposing us to three hours of sheer horror and cruelty to humanity. You couldn't have chosen a better project."""

","Its time to comment on one of the BEST films I've ever seen. The movie based on the real life's story about a Nasi guy, Mr. Oscar Schindler (Leam Nesson), who start to make money with the Jews in the infamous II War. With a Â¨littleÂ¨ help of his finance man, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), not very happy with the idea, use the luck of the world and the situation of the German army to open a factory that pay almost nothing and get many money.<br/><br/>As the time passing by the situation of the workers in factory get worst and worst, the Nasi army turn more violent and careless about the Jews, but Oscar Schindler keep watching them like people and feel the weight of the slaughter, specially by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who treat the Jews like something less than animals.<br/><br/>The deal is that the Schindler's factory, inadvertently, becomes a refuge and the mean of salvation for an entire community, and he tries, despairly, to get them out of the fire line.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and a jewel in the films history. Spelberg brings the Schindler's List to life, the story of a man who got nothing and leave with everything.<br/><br/>This is maybe the 5th Nasi story I've heard about, cause am not very interested in the whole Hitler's madness, who should have said it??? Up on the violence and the blood, there's a beautiful story of true power drived by compassion and humility. An action like this, weirdly, is inspired by suffering and the pain of a community, can not be seeing every day, but Schindler did it, and its showed like a daily act. Not like a saint but a defective and womanizer Nasi, and that's why its so charming and inspiriting.<br/><br/>Leam Nesson is the chosed one to take you trough the Schindler's feelings in one of the most notables performances I've ever watch and so damn heartbreaking that made it so hard not to cry, serious.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that if there wasn't Forrest Gump this would be the 1st, and it is, but I can't chose which one is best, thought. Otherwise, beside of being a Nasi movie, is the most beautiful movie I've ever watched, and a lesson to many people."
"Sylviastel","10","9","13","15 April 2008"," Just about Flawless but Painful to watch!
","I have seen Schindler's List once and it is more than enough. This film can be too painful to watch at times. Even though my own family survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland was scarred as well. Schindler's List is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg. I have to say that if ,Holocaust survivor and Polish Jew, Roman Polanski directed this story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe there would be more of a connection. I felt that Spielberg lacked that connection in this film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","9","13","13 April 2008"," Beyond a film: A monument, a memorial, a masterpiece
","""Schindler's List"" can best be described as something more than a movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the Holocaust. But don't cheat the film aspect either: this film is brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful, smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.<br/><br/>The story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn't seem all too warm and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest character.<br/><br/>From the technical aspect, John Williams' score is beautiful. The theme is both tragic and hopeful and it's incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and thoroughly conceived.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an experience."

","I watched Schindler's List a week ago in U.S history class, and at first I thought ""Oh great!. I'm watching a movie on the Holocaust in black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?"" My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the ""boredom fest"" aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into ""necessary story development/build-up"" At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. ""What if we were in his shoes?"" not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a ""WW2 feel."" If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie."
"charchuk","9","9","13","8 January 2008"," Lives up to the hype
","Finally watched it. And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg.<br/><br/>I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.<br/><br/>The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical ""exposition-build up-climax-denouement"" but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel.<br/><br/>This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made."
"gcd70","9","9","13","28 December 2007"," Recognition for Spielberg long overdue
","I think I can safely say that Steven Spielberg is without a doubt the most talented film director of all time. Given any subject matter to cover, or any genre in which to film, he is able to produce movies of unsurpassed brilliance. Whether it be science-fiction, adventure, action, comedy or drama, his genius prevails every time, as he manages to ""entertain"" in each of these fields.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" may or may not be his best ever work, but it most certainly is his most important. The story of Oskar Schindler, member of the Nazi Party, womaniser and business entrepreneur, is an amazing tale of how the Lord God has provided for his people Israel. Schindler saved over one thousand Jews from the atrocities of Nazi death camps and so ensured that generations would continue until time's end.<br/><br/>Spielberg's perception and new found maturity shines as he presents us with a beautifully judged, understated work. He never allows the horrible violence to become gratuitous, and his decision to film in black and white again shows his marvellous insight. Spielberg knew that he would be mistaken to lend colour to such a dark period in history.<br/><br/>Backing Spielberg up of course were some fine cast and crew members too, and the seven Academy Awards that ""Schindler"" won is indicative of its' very professional production values. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski uses the camera to full effect, bringing us some stunning pictures. Michael Kahn's film editing is very efficient and John Williams again scores the perfect music. Spielberg was also very grateful to Steven Zaillian, saying that his adapted screenplay (from Thomas Keneally's novel ""Schindler's Ark"") was beautifully understated and restrained.<br/><br/>The cast round off the whole show with strong performances. The ever enjoyable Ben Kingsley plays a major role as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, and does so very well, but not as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, whose portrayal of twisted and sadistic Commandant Amon Goeth is outstanding, and must have narrowly missed out on an Academy Award. Of course we shouldn't forget lead player Liam Neeson, whose more than convincing performance was well worthy of the Oscar nomination it received.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is a numbing and all too disturbing film that conscientious movie-goers must no miss! After deservedly receiving both the best picture and best director Oscars for the first time, Steven Spielberg pleaded with all educators world wide to teach these horrors of the Jewish holocaust in our schools so that we would never forget.<br/><br/>I have said before that Spielberg will probably never eclipse ""E.T."" for sheer wonderment, and the same must be said about ""Schindler's List"" for the fact of its sheer magnitude. ""Schindler"" is Steven Spielberg's crowning glory. It has given him the recognition that was long overdue him, and has also established him as perhaps the greatest film maker of all time. Congratulations Steven, and thank you!<br/><br/>Wednesday, March 23, 1994 - Balwyn Cinema<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is even better on a return viewing. One is able to acquire a deeper understanding of Oskar Schindler the person and his motivations. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is exquisite in both its detail and its simplicity, adapted superbly from Thomas Kenneally's novel ""Schindler's Ark"".<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg handles all aspects of his film with quiet assuredness, producing a profoundly moving, shocking and revolutionary piece that is almost perfectly weighted, and deftly understated. Spielberg's labour of love is truly the work of a dedicated director.<br/><br/>John William's score is a masterpiece of melodic orchestration, being quietly soothing. Michael Kahn's editing (Academy Award winning) is very astute, Janusz Kaminski's camera is very probing and unnerving, capturing some very memorable scenery. The costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration departments have outdone themselves in recreating war time Europe.<br/><br/>Acting is outstanding, starting with Liam Neeson, who is even better than I recall. His dramatically profound performance is probably the most important of his life. Neeson is truly haunting as he makes Schindler his own. Ben Kingsley is at his competent best in the role of the tentative but brilliant accountant Itszhak Stern, a perfectly weighted showing. Powerful support also comes from Embeth Davidtz and Caroline Goodall.<br/><br/>Final word goes to Ralph Fiennes who, in the role of the sadistic, twisted Commandant Amon Goeth, is chillingly brilliant and mesmerisingly effective. A real find of the year, Fiennes deservedly won an Oscar nomination and followed this success with another strong showing as Charles Van Doren in Robert Redford's ""Quiz Show"".<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" clean swept the 1993 Academy Awards, and so it should have. Spielberg's most intellectually deep, affecting and historically important film is his crowning glory. A must see, though it is at times emotionally upsetting. It is thus hard to describe as fantastic, but one must! Unforgettable!<br/><br/>Saturday, December 30, 1995 - Video"

He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner circle of the Nazi's, though, he began to see the horrors of what was really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to try to save the Jews.<br/><br/>Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler's List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you.

"dkncd","10","9","13","1 December 2007"," ""The list is life.""
","""Schindler's List"" is Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film that explores the life of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved almost 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust through his actions. Spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film. Spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate Nazi gunfire and killings.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler. Schindler is initially a war profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to shield Jews from the Holocaust. Interestingly the character was given an enigmatic quality and generally isn't explicit about his perceptions for a lot of the film. To the film's credit, it doesn't suppress the womanizing aspect of Schindler's character. Ben Kingsley is also excellent in a subtle performance as Schindler's invaluable accountant and assistant, Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great and frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac Amon Goeth.<br/><br/>This film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it is never tedious during its length of over three hours. The film gains intensity from the graphic depictions of Nazi violence and the lingering sense that Jews can be killed at any time. It also shows us how the courage of one individual can have an important impact. Schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important number."

At the end of the film, I was an emotional wreck, both amazed and horrified at the extremes of human behavior.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a film based on historical events. But it does not attempt to paint its characters as pure. Liam Neeson delivers as Schindler, while Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes--hell, the entire cast--turn in some truly powerful performances.<br/><br/>The criticism of this movie astonishes me. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out some people in this world. Let me put it another way--if you are not moved even a little by this film, or if you use snarky, cynical reasons to bash it, you're not even human. You don't even have a soul.

","The word ""absolute"", both as an adjective and a noun, seems to fully capture and sum up my thoughts and feelings for this movie. Spielberg's film not only can be described as complete in itself, perfect, consummate and faultless, but stands out as something inviolate, fundamental and ultimate.<br/><br/>Having seen most of the movies considered ""great"", I can say that ""Schindler's list"" easily surpasses all of them by far. Every frame of it makes a unique, immense impression on the viewer; it leaves a thinking, feeling man completely dazzled by the complexity, deepness and realness of the images and emotions it portrays. And it's not just because of the sheer excellence that everything is executed with, although the shots and the acting, the editing, the cinematography and the character development are by themselves sufficient to secure this production a place among true masterpieces.<br/><br/>It is by means of subtle, but striking contrast that the film carries it's message to the audience. We see equestrians wearing expensive clothing overseeing the ghetto liquidation massacre. We see the merry, chattering SS officers on a party in a villa, illuminated by the concentration camp searchlight. We hear delightful German music from the loudspeakers during the horrors of selection. We witness the Kommandant's relaxed, dreamy face while the panic-stricken people packed into the wagons are panting for air.<br/><br/>However, the movie's single biggest source of strength is, undoubtedly, it's Realism. Something that's ""not a pervasive element in the modern American cinematic vision"", yes. ""Schindler's List"" is a document, accurately depicting real events and people. It is grim, somber, powerful, and it will stay with you forever."

Literally 100% of the viewers were sitting there with their mouths wide open, and that every now and then I checked for this, and it never changed.<br/><br/>Despite the length of the movie, the audience remains spell-bound, and to me this incredible production absolutely merits that. To bring this horrific time in world history to the movie screen in such a powerful and emotionally engaging way is just a staggering accomplishment, and one can only hope that school systems will continue to make it mandatory viewing for their students. <br/><br/>If any movie is a ""CAN'T MISS,"" this is it! <br/><br/>My only question is: how can 5,741 IMDb readers POSSIBLY give this a rating of ""1""?"
"pyrocitor","10","9","13","17 October 2007"," Sears itself into the memory - both emotionally flooring and undeniably uplifting
","Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clichÃ©d anti-war lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler's List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind. <br/><br/>Dispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and Schindler's List is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours. <br/><br/>The historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. And while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. And despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and clichÃ© (Schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler's factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler's neglected wife, and Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth. <br/><br/>Throughout the years, Schindler's List has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out there, Schindler's List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated. <br/><br/>-10/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","9","13","13 October 2007"," one of the greatest modern masterpieces
","While this is not my personal favorite out of all of Steven Spielberg's films, I do have a powerful appreciation for ""Schindler's List"" and I do credit it as the best Holocaust film ever made and probably Spielberg's third-best lifetime achievement and every time I watch some of the film's most graphic and heart-wrenching or even just plain disturbing sequences, I can understand the director's emotional weaknesses he had during filming of the project and he had every right to be so. I find it amazing that somebody who needed so much emotional assistance from friends and family could pull off a film with such amazing detail and craftsmanship. It just comes to show how much of a genius this man really is.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is a film that stretches at least close to, or even over, three hours in length. At times there are instances where I think maybe the film could have dealt with just one less conversation between stars Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) and Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), but once I get down to the last fifteen minutes of the film, I know it couldn't have been any shorter than it is. But ""Schindler's List"" is not just a film about displaying the unjustifiable tyranny and suffering caused during the Second World War, but it also explores the man who saved 1100 innocent lives: Oskar Schindler, who began caring about nothing but himself. Schindler as we first see him in the film, is married, yet he is a womanizer. He bends the law to profit during the war, he initially cares next to nothing about the Jewish people being tortured and shot by the Nazis. He's nothing more than a unsuccessful businessman who suddenly sees an opportunity to make a name and fortune for himself by benefiting from the suffering of others. And yet, as we go on later in the film and learn to understand him, the man is totally transformed, as indeed he was in real life. And he ends up giving everything he has and forced to lead the rest of his life alone and without success, to save the lives of over one thousand innocent Jewish people whose people were being tortured and killed just for being Jewish.<br/><br/>While Oskar Schindler is definitely one of the greatest heroes...both on screen and in real life, Amon Goeth is undeniably one of the most horrifying villains of all time. Here, he is portrayed unbelievably convincingly by Ralph Fiennes. The character of Amon Goeth, as well as the entire Nazi party in the film, symbolize the vile cruelty that the biased Nazi party in real life would place upon their prisoners. We see a scene in the film, where they not only kill them for fun, but also make experiments out of their prisoners. Such as lining up a few men against a wall, sticking a rifle barrel to the stomach of the nearest one, and seeing how many of the men behind him the bullet will still strike. And then afterwards, walking up with a pistol and ruthlessly killing the survivors. Amon Goeth is even more terrifying, in some scenes, he shoots at workers for no apparent reason other than to kill time. And yet while the film explores the cruelty of Goeth, it also explores the other sides of him and how he could still be a friend and even a reasonable businessman who other Germans. The friendship that develops between him and Oskar Schindler never steers in a wrong direction, as one might expect, and they remain good friends throughout the entire film, despite their differences in outlooks upon the Jews.<br/><br/>The music score, composed by masterful John Williams, is one of the finest scores ever composed for a film. Masterful films gets masterful music scores to go along with them and heighten the tension or drama or whatever is necessary for a scene. The opening scores of the film, as they mostly revolve around Schindler's first dives into success, are cheery and intriguing and later on, as the emotional parts begin to arrive, the soundtrack becomes heart-wrenching powerful and sad. The last fifteen minutes of the film are truly amazing and simply rips one's soul apart. And with William's amazing music in the background, you cannot ignore it or refuse to take it seriously.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is filmed almost entirely in black-and-white and it seems most appropriately that it is. I personally can not imagine what it could have seemed like in color. Well, maybe I can, but I cannot imagine it being as pure and artistic with color. It was meant to be black-and-white, because it was meant to be as much like a documentary as possible. And by using actors and actresses who are talented, yet mostly unknown names to the public, it brings more convincing appearances to the film.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest films ever made. And nobody else could have done it any better than Steven Spielberg himself. He did not live in a concentration camp or experience the suffering the Schindler Jews did, but he knows enough about it and brought his visions to the screen with absolute perfection. ""Schindler's List"" is a film that will never be forgotten and will probably never be overpowered by another Holocaust film in drama or purity."

How honest the story is accompanied by visual black and white footage add to some of the rare elements normally found in everyday's film. You could still review it all right in your mind.

It is beyond me how some people do not like this masterpiece or how some people do not think that the Holocaust happened. To the people who do not like this film, you do not know what a movie is and are probably to busy watching movies like Epic Movie.

","""The Nazi's in Schindler's List are portrayed as evil heartless demons who seem to lack any kind of soul (well, Amon Goeth was pretty evil), while Schindler and other ""goodies"", are portrayed as saints with hearts of butter, It's time to wake up people!"" I agree with nothing in this statement. First of all last time I checked the Nazis WERE evil heartleass demons and I'm not sure why you would defend them. But anyone in the film some do have souls. (Not Goeth). One of the last scenes where Schindler gives the speech in the factors those Nazis walk away and let the Jews live. Schindler is not a goody goody thats what makes him the perfect hero he has a heart of gold but he is also shown as a womanizer and war profiteer in the film.<br/><br/>""My grandfather who is now 82 served in the war verses the Germans. I've had many talks with him and his war buddys and I can promise you that what you see in this film, and many others that are ""based on truth"", is purely fictional and shouldn't be allowed to even claim it is based on truth. And if it must it should have to give us a percentage of truth that it is based on, eg: based on 6% truth."" 6% truth huh? There's no way you can give any sort of rational explanation on that. No movie will be 100% truthful but this film is quite accurate the way I see it.<br/><br/>""Some of the scenes which were designed to shock the audience with brutality from the Nazi's towards the Jews were so over dramatized and fake they made me want to blow chunks in my popcorn. I don't mind fantasy but for gods sake don't mix it with truth, especially when you have an audience which sadly seem to often refer to this film when they are in a debate about world war 2 or the holocaust, as if it was some kind of historical reference with any credibility."" Over dramaticised? HA! How can you say that? In fact, as much of a masterpiece this is if anything its under dramaticised just because no film has the capability of truly showing the horrors of something as horrible as the Holacaust but the film is as close as humanly possible of depicting the horrors as I see it."
"stefanbe","10","9","13","16 July 2007"," ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" - Talmud
","The medium of film can be used to present both fact and fiction, with realistic portrayals of historical events littered in the multiplex among the fantasy adventures. Steven Spielberg is renowned for his special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his World War II epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to entertain. His most accomplished film is Schindler's List, based on the true story of a man who saved over a thousand Jews from extermination. Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler's List. This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.<br/><br/>Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.<br/><br/>The images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.<br/><br/>Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not ""just following orders"" like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der FÃ¼hrer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about: the fight against bigotry and injustice."
"SuperBadgerr","10","9","13","13 July 2007"," Amazing Portrayal
","I saw this movie last night, I was so moved by the whole movie, although the first hour is talking, once you see what happens to the Jewish when they are done talking you begin to be afraid for them yourselves.<br/><br/>I think Speilburg's idea to use black and white is simply stunning as is his idea for The Little Girl In Red and the tiny bit of yellow in eyes, it adds so much more. The characters in this make the movie so much more realistic (I've heard they were in talks for Mel Gibson or Kevin Costner to lead) every bit of acting is great even the children that are only on screen for several seconds how they get fear in their eyes. The end, just ends everything so nicely because how else could you end such a tragedy?<br/><br/>So My rating- 10/10 See this movie."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","10","9","13","9 July 2007"," Unflinching Spielberg.
","This film, along with Amistad and perhaps a few others, show that Steven Spielberg is not just a cutesy, non-brutal, gentle director as some of his films make him out to be. This film is not clichÃ© or heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me. Schindler's List is extremely well made, with excellent performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter, old tone.<br/><br/>This is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential, moving film.<br/><br/>One a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things. One would be for making this film for absolutely no money, and also for not turning it into a ""German hate"" movie."
"cgrabar90","10","9","13","1 July 2007"," Great, Dramatic Movie
","This movie while disturbing, is a movie worth watching. It makes you angry at the horrors the Nazies put the Jews through and it makes you question mankind. It wasn't watered down and it shows that there can be good in the heart of someone who seems hopeless. It's not a movie for those made uncomfortable by the sight of blood. The violence in the movie is what really happened to the Jews and the horrors they faced. The emotion of the plot comes across to the viewer and brings it out. Most of the people that I have spoken to have said that this movie brings out what we have been trying to learn for generations. A very good movie that all should see."
"heatherfeather-2","10","9","13","24 June 2007"," One of the Best Films I've Seen
","I've read a lot of the comments on this movie and while everyone is entitled to their opinion, it pained me to see that many people missed the point of the movie altogether. Many people have labeled this as a horrible movie simply because it was made by Spielberg. Others criticize the way he used Black and White film (with the exception of the Girl in the red coat) and still others claim that there was no Schindler.<br/><br/>Just because a movie is made by Spielberg, doesn't mean it's going to be trash. This has to be the first movie of his I've seen that I actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the world a better place. Maybe that seems stupid to some people, but knowing what Schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day I can help someone too.<br/><br/>As for the black and white film, I think it fit beautifully. In the 30's and 40's there really wasn't a lot of color film used, especially for Journalism and the news. It fit with the time period very well. Also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental touch. There actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day of the Karkow Liquidation that caught Schindler's eye and it completely disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a child. What happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the millions of people (Jewish, Gypsies, Homosexuals, etc.) and the fact that no one was standing up for them. The little girl and seeing her running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up Schindler's eyes in the movie.<br/><br/>Many people here have claimed that the character of Oskar Schindler was completely fabricated so that Sielberg could get some money. Fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real Schindler and he really did help them. He wasn't the best of men and he certainly had his faults. He drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he supported slave labor, and he was a member of the Nazi party. . . but despite all that, he still did something good for other people. Oh, and contrary to what some people have claimed, while Schindler did in fact make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save the Jewish workers. He lost everything he had gained during the war to save them.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, I felt, did a great job portraying Schindler and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth. Fiennes in particular was rather frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the Nazi party.<br/><br/>There is a lot of nudity in the movie. Some people complain about that, but honestly, what do you expect? Do you really think that the Nazis told them that they'd turn away while they got changed? No. The nudity in the film (as portrayed by the Jewish and other victims) was necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor people had to endure.<br/><br/>In closing, don't listen to all the negative reviewers out there claiming it's bad because of nudity, Spielberg, or any other number of things. This is truly a movie that you can't judge until you've seen it for yourself."

It illustrates very close to the truth everything that went on during the second world war to the Jew community in Poland. I, being a Jew my self, was deeply shaken by this movie. It's thanks to people like Schindler that i even exist. Mr. Spielberg did a fabulous job along with his crew. A great movie in the loving memory of the 6 million Jew lives taken during that horrible war...

Ben Kingsley is also great but his performance is in the shadow of Neeson's and Fiennes'.<br/><br/>This is the most dramatic movie ever, and is a movie that everybody should watch, either they want to or not.

","Schindler's List is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Grammy winning 1993 movie based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. The movie, adapted by Steven Zaillian and directed by Steven Spielberg, relates the tale of Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten-German Catholic businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The title refers to a list of the names of 1,100 Jews whom Schindler hired to work in his factory and kept from being sent to the Nazi concentration camp.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is consistently ranked amongst the finest movies of all time. It is currently ranked as 9th best film by the American Film Institute [1], and, as of March 18, 2007, rated number eight on the top 250 films on the Internet Movie Database with an 8.8/10 rating"

So my dad decide to show me. As soon as I saw this film I cried so hard,I finally understood what it was like.I may not be a Jewish man ,but I know what it feels like. Hitler was a tyrant ,and thinking that it was there fault was wrong. Steven Spielberg point of view of showing us what Oskar Schindler really was the most brilliant idea.The cast he choose was brilliant.

"LallaHolti","10","9","13","20 February 2007"," A masterpiece of art
","The story of Oskar Schindler saving 1100 Jews is fortunately not only a story made up by a few writers from Hollywood, but it is true. The fact that this story is true shows on the one hand the greatness of people, even existing in a regime like the Third Reich, but as well the horrors of the Holocaust. This movie shows with a lot of respect for the victims, but without any blinders the real horror and the madness of the Third Reich. It really teaches one about the insanity possible in a person. But next to the shown insanity one can also learn so much about the power of one single person trying to move something. The movie teaches one really that if you really want to achieve something that you can do it, even under the worst circumstances possible, even when you have to risk your own safety and life. You really have to believe in yourself and in your actions. If you do so, your plans will work.<br/><br/>Of course not to forget are the unbelievable actors. All of them did a phenomenal job and it would be unfair to mention only one of them. So instead of giving every single name, generalizing will do. The cast was just unbelievable good, especially imagining what kind of movie they made and with which piece of history they had to deal.<br/><br/>To sum things up one can say that this movie is really about fighting for your believings and fighting for those people, who need your help. And I think it is also an enormous tribute to an unbelievable brave man: Oskar Schindler. Just as they did in the movie I think the best sentence to say at the end is a quote from the Talmud: ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" It describes the actions of Oskar Schindler in the best way, in which it could be done in words."
"OttoVonB","10","9","13","12 January 2007"," Heart-wrenching
","World War II is raging. Sleazy socialite and entrepreneur Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrive in Poland and create his own kitchen equipment fabric with an army contract. His competitive plan? Use Jews from the ghetto: they cost less than Poles or Germans. What begins as a profitable business venture will soon suck Schindler into a dark world of madness and genocide, as he discovers not only his true nature, but also, to his horror, the full implications of the nature of his government.<br/><br/>Spielberg had amused and thrilled crowds with a long line of blockbusters before this (few human beings with eyes don't know of E.T., Jaws or Indiana Jones), and had mostly disappointed when trying his hand at more serious material: Color Purple was fair, and Empire of the Sun felt oddly shallow. Being as they weren't really his stories to tell in any case, these films can be excused as mere experiments to prepare Spielberg for this tale which he had held close to his heart for a long time.<br/><br/>What amazes about the story is that, in typical Spielberg fashion, it wastes no time. Each scene has a point, a place, and is maximized, and given the film's length and the nature of its story, the result is positively harrowing. Schindler grows considerably throughout the ordeal: the first cynical and opportunistic businessman starts playing a dangerous psychological game with the commanding Nazi officers, namely Amon Goethe (Fiennes). Seldom has human evil found such a frighteningly real incarnation than Fiennes's horrific officer, whose unpredictable fits of depression or violence keep the viewer constantly unbalanced. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish book-keeper then confidant gives the film a beautiful heart, and the overall acting is universally excellent. Spielberg never lets his actors down, but Steven Zaillian's screenplay truly is a miracle of character development.<br/><br/>Shot in staggering Black and White, Schindler's List feels like re-living History. it is brutal, intense and heart-wrenching. Spielberg has returned to oppression and war since (in Amistad and Saving Private Ryan) but has never topped this, nor ave most great films in existence.<br/><br/>For one of those rare times, a film is worthy of all the huge praise and hype surrounding it... and then some."

","I had to use this for a class paper and I thought the movie was great and very touching. Schindler's compassion towards his prisoners is something that you don't normally see in holocaust movies, and I thought it was wonderful. The movie starts out with you seeing him visiting a mass burial of dead prisoners. After seeing the little girl in the red coat being wheeled to the mass graves and also seeing how the guards treated the prisoners, Schindlers attitude towards the whole holocaust was changed. Through out this movie you can really see a conversion of a man with high power and wealth into a man who dedicates his money and time, even risking his life, to help save his prisoners from a common fate in which most of the prisoners at the time faced."

The best performance, best music, best, score, best acting in one word THE BEST.<br/><br/>For me the most touching moment of the film is the end, of course, the word's spoken by Ben Kingsley: ""Who ever saves one life, saves the world entire"" It is the most powerful line ever sad in a movie it has a lot of energy, sadness, power, love and humanity. I don't cry after i watch movies, because a i am not that touchy, but after this movie, i let the tear go every time i watch the end of the film!! Today its a movie everyone should see, maybe more than ever. This movie, along with a couple of other should be mandatory in our schools, just so that our kids, and the future generations never forget the atrocities that was done to the Jews, gay people, Gypsies, blacks etc during that war."

","Probably the most powerful and important film one can watch in this or any lifetime. The Nazi atrocity is presented in stark images of horror beyond comprehension and even the power of one's own imagination. The scene that brought that all home to me was the one in which the young Jewish boy made his way down into the latrine to escape the nightmare of separation from his family, only to find others had beaten him to it. Such desperation, such will to survival.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are superb in their respective roles. The filming in black and white is only appropriate for an era of history devoid of color. Amon Goeth (Fiennes) crystallizes the Nazi sentiment toward an entire race with one line to Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) - ""I realize that you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word"".<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is hardly the type of film one can consider a favorite, it's reach goes far beyond entertainment. It deserves it's recognition as one of the best films of all time, it's power resides in giving literal interpretation to the message 'never again'."

Naturally, I expected everything of this movie and had already set very high standards for it - Schindler's list didn't disappoint. It is indeed one of the most fabulous movies of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is difficult to watch, but truly touching. Spielberg sometimes shows very graphic scenes, but its never overdone - these scenes only add to the realism of the movie making it all the more human.<br/><br/>I must also comment on the use of black and white. This is one of the rare movies where the conscious choice to use black and white instead of color works well.<br/><br/>the acting was great and the characters were very realistic.

"praveen1013","10","9","13","11 October 2006"," It couldn't have been better
","When I first learnt about Schindler's list, I had great expectations on how Spielberg would have made the greatest ever human tragedy. I expected big shots like Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann... but Spielberg had made the movie with stern, Helen heitsh, schindler and goeth. When I first saw the movie I thought Spielberg had missed quite a lot of incidents. I thought some scenes in the first 1 hour could have been cut to accommodate other incidents and I felt the movie was overrated. But only after watching the movie a second time I realized that the movie was 'Schindler's list' and not a documentary on holocaust. I also appreciated how important each and every scene was and got convinced that there couldn't have been a better version of the movie. While scenes like burning synagogues would have been sensational, It would have provoked outrage. But Spielberg had given this movie an emotional and human touch. Schindler's transformation from a corrupt flirt profit-minded businessman to a great saviour has been fabulously portrayed. This movie, though not a great tearjerker, has a lot of emotional dialogues and scenes.<br/><br/>Schindler viewing the ghetto liquidation from the top of a cliff, Schindler's soothing words to helen, Schindler trying to change goeth by telling about power,Schindler's talk to stern after orders on special treatment, Schindler thinking on what to do one fine night, Schindler saving the ladies and subsequently the children and many more of these scenes simply break you to give a wet eyes. Observe Neeson's body language on all these circumstances and you'll understand how nobel a heart he was and what kindness actually means. The scene where schindler gets furious with a Jewish woman and later brings her parents to his factory is my best in the movie. Goeth's split personality was frightening. The background score of music during the liquidation of the ghetto was moving. The lead trio of Liam neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley have performed exceptionally well in the movie. Its quite sad that none got an Oscar. Thank god that the Reich officials were corrupt otherwise the Schindler Jews would have perished at Auschwitz and the world would have missed this great masterpiece."

","Spilberg did a great job reacting the holocaust he made it seem so realistic it was in black and white but he made the main characters be in color like the little girl with the red dress the movie was so good i had to recommend it to all my family and friends. Th good part of the movie that is like the main parts is when Schindler lets some people go. After watching this movie you want to go back in time and help all the people that Hitler and schindler had killed. This was also a good educated movie to know what had happened to the people and yo cannot make fun because really it is sad also so you know what type of people the German people where back then"

","I was in awe when I saw this film, how extraordinary it is. Steven Spielberg has become a directing phenomeon after his work on Schindler's List. The acting is superb, Ralph Fiennes acting should deserve the Oscar, as the villain of this film, he became an hero like no other. Liam Neeson's acting was extraordinary and Ben Kingsly's acting is great. The score of this film is haunting and connects to the Holocaust and the death of the Jews in the Concentration. What really blew it away was the little girl in the red which was a symbol to the film. After she became murdered was a huge irony to this film and how it became so frightening, Ralph Fiennes's reaction to the little girl's death blew me away and left me in tears how this film. Eric Roth's screenplay really did deserve the Oscar, and I was shocked how this film ended when Ralph became a good character after the deaths and cry from the Jewish people. Steven Spielberg had made art, a film masterpiece since ""Star Wars"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Godfather"", ""Gone with the Wind"", and ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"". I recommend to everyone to watch this film and learn how disasterful and frightening to be in the Holocaust."

I couldn't think of anyone better than than Liam Neeson to play this role.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes.. wow. He FREAKED me out in this movie as a SS officer/commander.

"dmguitar0","10","9","13","18 September 2006"," The best film I have ever seen
","This movie has left me wanting to cry and cheer at the same time. I did actually cry; the first time I really cried when watching a film. I usually can separate myself from the fictional events of a movie, but not during the last ten minutes. I was appalled at the scenes included in this movie, and they were both cold and moving at the same time. This is the best movie I have ever seen. If I had been in a room with a hundred of my peers, swearing to laugh and taunt me for life if I cried I would have still wept. Two of the starring actors' performances were definitely grade 'A'. Liam Neeson puts on a flawless performance in my opinion, as does Ben Kingsley. However, the performance of Embeth Davidtz (cast as the maid, Helen Hirsch) left me disappointed, as did Raplh Fiennes'. As far as story goes, this is a moving and powerful one, that ought not to be forgotten. I wish I could touch on the specific parts of the movie that moved me most without spoiling any of the ending. I also wish I could personally invite the entire Nazi regime over for ""special coffee"" laced with strychnine; especially Goeth, if he was a real person, and definitely Hitler if he were alive."
"Magnanimousto","10","9","13","10 September 2006"," This or Shop On Main Street?
","Only those people should reply who have seen both films, and not those people who wish to isolate one of these films as ""uncomparable"" while being ignorant of the other.<br/><br/>I saw Shidler's List about an year ago, and I really liked it. It's magnificently acted and has a sort of a documentary feel to it. I just saw Shop On Main Street last night and well, Schindler's List is good but Shop On Main Street is absolutely fabulous. What Schindler's List tries to say, and successfully does to some extent, with such a complex story, Shop On Main Street shows with a much more simple one. The whole objectivity of a man who can profit from another's misery but cannot do so is much more conceivable in Shop On Main Street than in Schindler's List. Why? Because quite frankly most of the characters in the List are a little two or even one dimensional and although a lot of List fans will pounce on me for saying this bear in mind that a lot of dedicated List fans agree with me on this, the characters of Shop On Main Street are much more human. Take the main character, Tono, for example, he is a coward and sometimes courageous, selfish and self-less, calm and furious, kind and cruel, conceitful and bent, weak and strong. So in a way as the List shows an absolutely exceptional man giving away kindness like Mother Teresa, Shop On Main Street shows an ordinary man trying to decide between saving himself and saving others like so many Aryans must have done in that time."
"matlefebvre20","10","9","13","3 September 2006"," The greatest movie of the 90s
","For the last thirty years or so, Steven Spielberg has been the greatest star to shine in the film universe. He is already claimed as being the greatest filmmaker of all time even if he still have time to make other movies.<br/><br/>And of all of these last thirty years, one of them must be especially highlighted: 1993. It's by far the greatest year of Spielberg's career. First, he broke the bank and revolutionized modern cinema with ""Jurassic Park"" which became (and still is) the most successful film of his career. It was the summer's highlight.<br/><br/>And for Christmas, Spielberg came out with his crowning achievement: ""Schindler's List"". Based on a true story (yes, a TRUE story!), this extremely dramatic and ultra-realistic tale of a Nazi businessman who saved 1,100 Jews during Holocaust ultimately ended up with seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a well-deserved Best Director Award for Mr. Spielberg.<br/><br/>The first aspect of the movie that strikes the viewer is the filming process. ""Schindler's List"" is mostly shot in black and white, because it matched with Spielberg's ideas about World War II. He said that the only images that came to his mind when he thought about WWII were in black and white. Thereby, the movie brings a very adequate mood which is fueled by fear, sorrow and the most inhuman cruelties and dark feelings that are parts of this abominable war.<br/><br/>But even if black and white is the most prominent filming process, colored parts appear in short, but crucial moments. The greatest example is the little girl with the red coat. She becomes the catalyst of Schindler's altruistic efforts. She is first spotted during the liquidation of Krakow's ghetto and then, Schindler sees her, unfortunately dead and about to be incinerated by the SS officers.<br/><br/>The main force behind ""Schindler's List"" is the depiction of the Nazis' cruelties and racist gestures made to the Jews. And also the Jews' efforts in order to stand and flee from these absurd and inhuman moves. This idea is particularly shown in the ghetto's liquidation scenes which are the greatest, hardest and most harrowing pictures of the movie.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is also a success because of its three leading actors. Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, this Messiah-like figure who used his recently-made fortune in order to save his people. Neeson's performance is extraordinary and we can feel his inner transformation throughout the movie. He is perfectly depicted as a greedy man, but also as a restless seducer and womanizer. Ben Kingsley is Schindler's Jewish assistant Itzhak Stern and he delivers his greatest role apart from Gandhi in the eponymous movie. Finally, there's Ralph Fiennes' unforgettable performance as Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth who is the main representative of the Nazis' horrors and his attractive physique hides a wildly devilish nature, which fuels each one of his atrocities.<br/><br/>Because it runs for about 200 minutes (three hours and twenty minutes), the movie includes several sub-plots which either highlight some passages of Thomas Keneally's novel or show other Holocaust-specific pictures, such as the 'selection' in Plaszow's camp.<br/><br/>Out of all the movies made in the last decade of the 20th century, ""Schindler's List"" is probably the greatest, followed by Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". This is only a 'probable', but some things are surer. For instance, this is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's greatest picture, which is somehow ironic because Spielberg is known for his blockbusters and action-filled movies. So, it's ironic to see that such a war drama can be considered as Spielberg's definitive masterwork.<br/><br/>But, in a sense, only Spielberg could have done a movie like this. He is a Jew himself and the Holocaust can only have more effect on him than any other filmmaker. Roman Polanski did well too with ""The Pianist"", but Spielberg's vision and direction were just superior. From now on, anyone could try to make a movie about the horrors of the Holocaust, but nobody will ever measure up to one of the most unforgettable true stories of the century: ""Schindler's List""."

Although there are gory bits it is a very true account. Another good thing about this film is that it is a true story based on a real person Oskar Schindler who i believe was a war-time hero. To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which will captivate you until the very end.

I knew it would end at 3, but I didn't care because I had wanted to see this so called ""amazing"" film. I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Spielberg managed to create one of the most beautiful films ever. Even though the subject matter itself is depressing and morbid, the way humanity springs from such a destructive environment is beautiful. Oskar Schindler's transformation from a war profiteer to a humanitarian is subtle and realistic. Schindler is human, and feels it too, thanks to great writing and Liam Neeson's wonderful performance.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction has never been better. The executions of the Jews are brutal because there are no cuts; almost every slaying is done in one shot. This adds to the realism and the sheer bestial nature of the Holocaust. The cinematography is amazing in black and white, creating a sense of melancholy in a stark world.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? I could go on about the acting and the writing. I didn't even mention John William's morose, but poignant score, which provides much of the emotion that stems from the film. However, all I can say is that Schindler's List is moving, touching, and altogether brilliant. The final scene almost made me cry, but I didn't because I'm an unemotional robot. But as an unemotional robot, I was still deeply moved by Spielberg's sentimental tribute to those who died in one of history's saddest periods."

","I could'not have better chosen to watch this movie at this time, at such a global scenario. Schindler's List will be a movie that will unshakably remain on my list of most favorite movies, of all time. It makes the viewer think so much deeply about the horrors of Holocaust and the poignant symbolism associated with almost every frame makes you sob silently. It reminds you that for every Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden, George W. Bush and Idi Amin, there was Oskar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa. I loved this amazing movie because the sooner people realize the futility of war and murder, the sooner we can make this world a better place to live in. It is painful to see people fighting and killing each other for land, oil, votes and power.

"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","9","13","19 August 2006"," Its beauty is hypnotizing, its power, awesome
","Oskar Schindler was not a good person in the strictest sense of the word. A member of the Nazi Party, he drank like a fish, gambled, conducted dealings on the black market and cheated on his wife innumerable times. Yet he found salvation by doing something so great even he could not comprehend its greatness: he changed himself for the greater good, saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews employed in his munitions factory from the hatred of the Nazi regime.<br/><br/>1993 was arguably the greatest year of Steven Spielberg's life. First he made the rip-roaring Jurassic Park, a still technologically astounding movie that revolutionized special effects and paid for his kids' educations for the next thirty years. But later, he presented us with Schindler's List, a film as remarkable as Schindler's achievement that beat nearly all other '90s historical dramas into submission and finally bagged him the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for which he had long been unfairly passed over. And if he still hadn't won it would have probably spawned conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>Spielberg has said that the filming of Schindler's List ""was the most satisfying experience of my professional career,"" claiming it is the best film he has ever made. Even if I do say so myself, he's absolutely right. Working from Steven Zaillian's masterfully constructed adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's Ark, he elicits an outstanding performance from Liam Neeson as Schindler (who justifiably lost at the Oscars to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia), and Ralph Fiennes pulls off what is easily one of the scariest performances in cinema history as Amon Goeth, the SS commandant and director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau labor camp whose favourite pastime was using Jews for target practice. <br/><br/>However, this is unquestionably Spielberg's greatest directing job. Utilizing grainy black-and-white cinematography, Spielberg cleverly uses lots of wide panning shots and hand-held cameras to evoke just the right amount of shock and sympathy for Holocaust victims in each scene. Also, he seems to have realized that in order to completely nail a film of such depth and importance as this, you shouldn't even attempt to glamourize the Holocaust or answer the questions it has left in modern society. All you have to do is assess what happened and get the facts right. <br/><br/>In the production notes in the Schindler's List DVD, Spielberg writes: ""No one can do anything to fix the past - that's already happened. But a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must never happen again."" Now I know the chances of you reading this are devastatingly low, but if you are, Mr. Spielberg, you need not worry because as a result of this powerhouse masterpiece you have single-handedly re-awakened awareness of the Holocaust, ensuring that it (hopefully) will never be repeated or forgotten. You are a god among giants, sir."

The glances, the body language, the tension between the actors... I can't point out exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the director did a great job. It's not boring. It doesn't seem like a documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this film is reality.

They shouldn't, though, because this is a story where the ""good guys"" win--German industrialist Schindler and the more than 11,OOO Jewish workers he kept safe in his Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia factory, while their brethren were being systematically slaughtered all around.<br/><br/>A number of viewers find it difficult to accept that the film is liberally laced with humor. But why shouldn't it be? Humor is one of the most effective weapons with which man on earth is armed, and, for the oppressed, humor can literally mean the difference between survival and destruction.<br/><br/>Some of the more humorous moments in ""Schindler's List"" include: ...The scene in which Poldek Pfefferberg (for those who haven't noticed, the same Pfefferberg who, as an older man, first told the Schindler story to author Thomas Keneally) and his fellow black marketeers are arguing about the quality of the merchandise: ""That's not my problem,"" ""That's not his problem,"" et cetera.<br/><br/>...The scene in which Wilhelm Nussbaum and his family have been thrown out of their luxurious home and relocated in a ghetto hovel: his wife remarks ""It could be worse,"" Nussbaum thunders ""HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE WORSE?!?"" and then, as the OTHER new residents of these wretched quarters come filing in politely, he sees exactly how it can be worse.<br/><br/>...The scene in which Schindler holds auditions for a secretary: applicant after applicant is gorgeous but can't type for beans (hilariously, he shows one how to return the cartridge!)while the final candidate is a cigarette-smoking battle-ax who types with effortless efficiency--and in the next shot, he has hired them all! ...The scene in which Emily Schindler tells her husband that she'll stay with him in Krakow IF he can guarantee that no doorman or maitre d' will ever mistake her for a mistress, followed by an immediate cut to her departing on the train--the cut is so abrupt, it's almost slapstick.<br/><br/>...A similar scene in which Schindler is seeking permission to search a trainload of deportees for his manager Stern: he takes the names of the officer and the NCO who are blocking his way, assuring them that they will soon be serving on the Russian front, and CUT, the two Germans are shouting for Stern! ...The many scenes in which Oskar pours drinks for himself and the taciturn Stern, then ends up drinking them both--scenes which, of course, set up the poignant moment when Stern finally shares a drink with Schindler--just before Schindler makes his fateful decision to draw up the List.<br/><br/>And, lest the viewer object to ""manufactured"" humor in a serious story, three scenes are taken verbatim from fact: ...The scene during the clearing of the ghetto when Poldek Pfefferberg is trapped by Goeth and his officers and salutes them, declaring that he has been ordered to clear the passageway. Goeth is so amused by the ""little Polish clicking soldier"" (Poldek had, in fact, been a Polish officer before that army was wiped out) that he allows him to live.<br/><br/>...The scene in which Goeth accuses Rabbi Levartov, the hinge-maker, of being a slacker, and drags him outside to shoot him, only to have not one, but TWO guns misfire, after which Goeth stalks off in disgust and the Rabbi is spared.<br/><br/>...The scene is which the women from the Schindler factory have been mistakenly sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Clara Sternberg is ready to give up and throw herself against the electrified fence. Mrs. Dresner tells her friend, ""Don't do it, Clara! You'll never know what happened to you!"" Again, a human life is saved.<br/><br/>These scenes are sharp, and funny, and add immeasurably to the power of ""Schindler's List."" Such is the quality of this story that the viewer is compelled to IDENTIFY: with the hero, the victim, and, yes, even the villain.<br/><br/>The hero, at first reluctant but later coming to embrace the role, is Schindler, played with avuncular warmth by Liam Neeson. The victim is embodied by Ben Kingsley as the Jewish accountant/manager Itshak Stern. Kingsley virtually ""becomes"" Stern, just as he ""became"" Mohandas Gandhi in that outstanding biopic. And finally, Ralph Fiennes is so incredibly effective as the villain, the sadistic Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, that he lingers in the viewer's memory much as the real Goeth haunted the dreams of his charges (and may still).<br/><br/>When I first saw the film, I wondered why Spielberg had followed up the scene of a shirtless Goeth shooting prisoners at random from the balcony of his villa, with a scene of him walking to the toilet and urinating. Why, I wondered, did we have to watch the man taking a whiz? Then it came to me that the key word is that question is ""man."" Spielberg is graphically demonstrating that the Nazi commandant is NOT some demon from the depths, NOT some alien creature from another world, but a MAN. A man who has a pot belly, as so many of us do. A man who has to pee, as we all do. And a man who kills without compunction, AS WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING.<br/><br/>This may explain why so many, to this day, deny that the Holocaust ever occurred: they don't want to admit, they CANNOT admit, that they themselves are capable of such evil, so they desperately deny the truth they find so unacceptable.<br/><br/>That's the true glory of Fiennes' performance: he reveals the beast that dwells in all of us, and must always be guarded against. Because the beast denied is not the beast vanquished. It merely waits, and watches, and observes the opportunity. It is always ready to emerge again, in any government, in any nation, in any people. Constant vigilance is required to empower the cry of the Holocaust survivors: NEVER AGAIN."
"emasterslake","Null","9","13","30 June 2006"," A very well done Halucaust movie.
","I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.<br/><br/>Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.<br/><br/>A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.<br/><br/>He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.<br/><br/>This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.<br/><br/>It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.<br/><br/>It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well."
"insenlysen","10","9","13","23 June 2006"," Truly thought provoking
","When I was done with seeing this movie I realized that I had stayed glued to the screen for 3 hours without my attention getting diverted.The acting especially from Liam Neeson as Oskar and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goethe is a notch above anything I have seen.<br/><br/>When one realizes that Oskar Schindler,a man who initially started out with the intention of making a quick buck out of the war situation and who after having failed in earlier businesses must obviously be determined to do well this time around, gives up all his money,his fortune and his shot at a good life in order to save the lives of people who were being cruelly butchered,one is moved,deeply moved.<br/><br/>The scenes of the massacre of the ghetto and the way the people trying to hide were systematically hunted down are disturbing scenes..yet they serve to elevate the viewing experience and also are stark brutal reminders of the depravity humans are capable of.<br/><br/>With the rising intolerance the world over this movie acts as a reminder,a warning and also a beacon of hope.it is both a testimonial to what one man's conviction is capable of...on the one hand we have Schindler who almost singlehandedly saves 1200 Jews and on the other we have Hitler who is responsible for the near extermination of Jews."
"carpetg","8","9","13","19 June 2006"," A highly emotive movie
","Spielberg outdid himself with the emotional portrayal of the atrocities inflicted on the Jewish and other ""non master-race"" people of Eastern Europe during 1933-1945. <br/><br/>I was not a total Keneally fan until I read his book, and Spielberg brought the book to larger-than-life in an unforgettable movie. <br/><br/>The most memorable aspect of the film is the little girl in red who appeared to be looking for a loved one through the wall of German Grey. To this day, either in book or film, I am unsure as to what happened to here. <br/><br/>Having studied German for a short time the people of today have not allowed themselves to forget what their leader perpetrated on the world during those horrible years. <br/><br/>""Whatever you do, don't mention the war,"" quipped John Cleese, as Basil Fawlty. Personally, I think not to mention the war would be forgetting these innocent victims."
"paultd","10","9","13","16 June 2006"," A lesson in history
","Standard classroom issue for high school students across the world, SCHINDLER'S LIST is a poignant reminder of the Holocaust. Masterminded by Steven Spielberg and enriched with lamenting tones from Itzhak Perlman, the hearts of these sons of Zion went into the making of this film of films.<br/><br/>The viewer is spared none of the harrowing realities of the Holocaust. Jews with proper education were hated the most, and were killed viciously. Some were spared and mocked rather than killed, as long as they provided entertainment for Nazi soldiers. Not all German officers were iron-hearted. Some were driven mad by the slaughtering. As Schindler said best, ""war always brings out the worst in people."" In only a few hours, the film exposed more truths than months spent reading history textbooks.<br/><br/>Meticulous attention is paid to the development of characters. At the start, Schindler is shown to be a self-serving, wily businessman who takes advantage of Jewish labour to the benefit of his factory. By the end, the horror he witnesses has transformed him into a saviour. He forgets every dream of wealth he ever held, and agonizes over being unable to save more Jews. Amon Goeth, the commander at the concentration camp in Krakow, is a mirror-image of Hitler. Goeth possesses a blind and irrational hatred of Jews. He kills them for pleasure and considers them to be worthless, yet he is attracted to one named Helen Hirsch. Hitler's similar hypocrisies need not be explained. We are given such polar personalities to consider in this portrayal of the human condition. We are witness to inexplicable kindness and ruthless savagery. Through it all, Neeson and Fiennes give such dynamic performances that we forget we are looking at actors, not men.<br/><br/>This is a thoroughly disturbing film. Children who barely know the definition of hate participate in the verbal and physical bombardment of Jews. In countless scenes, families are ruthlessly separated. When Jews are mercilessly shot, the action is quick and brutal. There are no ""Hollywood"" deaths. The sequences are all realistically frightening. Another sickening scene shows Amon Goeth sniping Jews from his balcony simply for enjoyment and target practice. It is hard to imagine such twisted men could exist. Elsewhere, Jews rub their own blood on their faces to look livelier and stand a better chance of being selected for work. Why? Unselected individuals are gassed. After a shake of our heads, we realize that these horrifying details are a testament to the film's true quality.<br/><br/>There is good reason for the lack of colour. It helps emphasize key moments of the story featured in colour, such as the vibrant candles that are lit for a Jewish couple's marriage. Colour signifies hope, and is used sparingly as hope is not something that existed in any great quantity during those days.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is a unique film for Spielberg. He has departed from providing glowing, satisfying, heart-warming cinema. Yet there are bold elements of action and adventure passed on from his earlier works. Look how Schindler's suspenseful dealings with suspicious German officials are played out. See how he dramatically saves the Jews on numerous occasions. We are kept to the edge of our seats by methods only Spielberg could conjure.<br/><br/>Steven Zaillian provides an immaculate script. Nothing feels out of time or place. A few have complained that the spoken language is unauthentically English. Does it matter what language the Holocaust is portrayed in? Can the impact be reduced in any way? Nothing is changed, for the message is universal.<br/><br/>When one thinks back to the Holocaust, one thinks of despair. Within the hopelessness rose an unlikely hero. This movie is a tribute to the Jews, to their struggle, and to the gentile who lent a righteous hand."

","Its hard to believe that this movie came from the same loins that spawned ""War of the Worlds ""(crock of shite). As a male in his late 30's i prefer to watch this movie alone ie; unwitnessed by any females. It never fails to move me. It is up there with Shawshank Redemption and Apollo 13. The soundtrack is just ""spot on "" as it is in the other above-mentioned movies.When u compare Fiennes performance in this vs The Constant Gardner , it shows his tremendous versatility. Likewise , check out ""Sexy Beast"" and remember Ishtak Stern.Kingsley-u are the man.(remember that tear when he finally decides to ""have that drink"" with Oskar) .As for Neeson,this is the movie he will look back on in years to come with the most pride.To all involved, thank you most sincerely"

","It is official. Stephen Spielberg is a G-E-N-I-U-S! Schindler's List is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. And I get around. I have seen A LOT of great movies. Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is (as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images. I you haven't seen this amazing movie, bring some tissues and be prepared for great acting and disturbing images and scenes. It is very moving and very powerful."
"xtreme_at_everything","10","9","13","15 May 2006"," Spielberg's Masterpiece
","Does abusing the system make a man a hero? In ""Schindler's List"" it certainly does. This movie is one of the classic movies of all time and is a must-see for any movie fan. It gives its reader a harsh image of the Holocaust while still respecting the people who were affected by it. While this movie may not be an enjoyable one, it is certainly a very important one. It is beautifully directed, amazingly acted, and heart-wrenching to the core. I highly recommend this movie. It is not just a movie; it is a journey for its viewers.<br/><br/>The movie begins by showing us a typical Jewish family in hiding. They are celebrating Passover. We see them light the candles, and then they disappear, never to be seen again. Our protagonist is Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a man with incredible charm, but truly he is a bit of a swindler. We see examples of this in the movie many times, including when Oskar gives two wealthy men an expensive bottle of wine, giving him the chance to sneak in and dance with their gorgeous women accompanying them. Oskar sees that the Holocaust is opening a great opportunity to make a prosperous business by using the Jews as extremely cheap labor. Without knowing, Oskar keeps the Jews working for him completely safe from death. Soon his Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), tells him that he is saving Jews from certain death.<br/><br/>At first Oskar is hesitant, saying that he does not want to put himself at any risk. However, he receives a glimpse of the horror that the Holocaust is causing. Real people are dying and suffering and people are laughing at them. He decides that he must stand up for this travesty. He runs his factory, but only to keep the Jews safe. He even intentionally makes the production flawed. Nothing is gained in the factory except for lives. Soon the ghetto that the factory is in is closed and all the Jews are moved out.<br/><br/>Schindler buys a work camp, sacrificing his own belongings. The story continues on, and we see how a man can be so charitable. It brings us hope that one man can truly make an everlasting difference. At the end of our journey, we learn that Schindler's businesses after the Holocaust failed. Schindler gave his life to save over 1,100 Jews.<br/><br/>This movie gives us a different definition of the word 'hero.' Schindler was not exactly a perfect man. He conned other people to get what he wanted. His strength was in swindling other people. However, instead of using this talent for bad, he used it to save lives. He chose the harder way instead of the more pleasurable way, and that makes him a hero. Although swindling is not exactly a great thing to do, Schindler shows that it is good to use at times, as did Robin Hood when he stole from the rich in order to help the poor.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly depressing, and will haunt its viewers for a long time. The real life events will be shocking and disturbing for others, but they must understand that this did happen. People were this cruel to others, and certain people actually helped. This movie will give you a shocked feeling. While watching the end credits, you will not be able to move. You will be astounded, confused, and heart-broken.<br/><br/>Again, I highly recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 14. This movie is rated R for nudity, real life violence, and some strong language. You must decide if this movie is appropriate for your child, but I suggest you show him/her this movie sometime during their life, for it is very important to watch."
"fwgrhouse","10","9","13","30 April 2006"," Best Movie about the Holocust
","I saw this movie on DVD afew months ago and when I saw it it just grabbed me by the heart. I gave it a 10 because for one reason, it grabs people's attention and makes you think about the Holocaust and what the Jew's and other people went through during that horrible time. Another reason is because it shows what a great sacrifice a man made to save a bunch of people that he didn't know. It also takes you inside the Holocust and the terrible things those people went through like having to strip naked in front of people, then have their heads shaved, and be forced to do hard labor with little or no food until they were too weak to work and were sent to the gas chambers. I would recommend this film for anyone over the age of 13 because of all the realistic violence, language, strong nudity and sexual activity. But I can guarantee you that once you have seen this film, you will think differently about the Holocust."
"skandargra","10","9","13","25 April 2006"," One of the most powerful pictures in the world, if not THE most powerful. A Must-See flashback, what you won't forget.
","This MOVIE (with all big letters) is one of the most beautiful, and horroristic pictures in the whole world. All of the actors have given their most perfect and powerful performances in their filming career. Ralph Fiennes gives us a breath-taking skill of being a lazy, brutal and ruthless, but still a calculating commander of the Jewish camp, and Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant of Oskar Schindler, almost made me cry (I never dropped tears for a film), when he gives his tenets up (as a Jewish man, he can't drink alcoholic drink), and ask Schindler to give him a whiskey. I think without John Williams' music, this film still could be good, but when you hear the Piano Theme, it will make your soul heavy as a hammer, and you can't think about other things, just the Cruel Reality of the World in the WW2. Steven Spielberg has done a very-very good and exhaustive directing, with all the Black-and-White effects he used and controlled, like a work of art. This film grabs you, climb in your soul, and then won't get out of here until you watch a better movie than this. (it's impossible). Howewer the screen is black and white, the quality of sounds and the effects is cutting edge, and you can fell that you're there next to Amon Goeth, or one of the characters. But these words are nothing, you need to watch this movie to recognize it's true meaning, otherwise, this comment is nothing, it can't bring back the feeling of this picture, and you only will know, how great film is this, when you watch it with your own eyes. Congratulations, Steven Spielberg, you made an instant classic, which is recommended for ALL people in the world, at least for an one-time view with it's three hour playtime, but when you watch it, you grow up. Suddenly, for ever."

I loved the entire film straight through, it promises to draw tears every time without fail. A must see. The film also portrays the sadness of the camps better than being in the camp in person; i have been to auschwitz and berkenau myself. I think Neeson plays schindler excellently, he has the charm to demonstrate the real Schindlers nature with women. I also thought at first that black and white films were not appreciated in the modern age, however, this film shows that black and white can work, you would not get the same effect from the film if it were in colour."

","We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
"August1991","10","9","13","23 March 2006"," Masterpiece - Must See
","Given the number of comments here, it is probably superfluous to add my opinion. Nevertheless, I will - to express my three points. First, this film is a masterpiece both in its content and in its style. Notwithstanding ""Sophie's Choice"" and other attempts to recount the Holocaust, the story of Schindler needed to be told. I am pleased that Spielberg told it and not, for example, Polanski or Scorcese. Spielberg (in some ways a Schindler himself, a guy with panache) relied on image, and feeling. (The most powerful scenes need no sound. Dialogue is often in Polish, German or Yiddish.) Spielberg tells Schindler's story without a Polanski edge, nor a Scorcese wantonness.<br/><br/>Second, the choice of the pre-war Hungarian song ""Gloomy Sunday"" lent authenticity as I watched, and has given me a reminder since. I can't hear other versions of this song now without thinking of this story.<br/><br/>Third, watch for the girl's red dress because that's when Schindler realizes a truth, and somehow changes. At the end, watch for the woman spontaneously touch Schindler's grave with her hand. In all this terribleness, something good survived."
"roghache","9","9","13","22 March 2006"," Powerful and moving depiction of one unlikely hero's Holocaust
","Stephen Spielberg's amazing Schindler's List is an incredibly moving, graphic depiction of Holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely humanitarian hero. The Czech born German businessman, Oskar Schindler, starts up a factory in Poland, intending to make his fortune by taking advantage of cheap Jewish labor. As he becomes increasingly aware of the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 Jews from the atrocities and gas chambers of Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human Oscar Schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties himself. The only other actor that I specifically recall from the movie is Ben Kingsley (who earlier played Gandhi), always wonderful in any role.<br/><br/>Just a trivial detail, but I found very touching the Jewish custom of placing stones on the graves of loved ones. It is used with dramatic effect in this movie. <br/><br/>This is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. The movie serves as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who, through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many lives. It is also a troubling personal depiction of the Holocaust, brought to horrific life to many viewers because of Spielberg's efforts. However, it is NOT of course, by any means, an entertaining film. I have not seen it since its original release and find it too disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time.<br/><br/>Although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false portrait, I'd also recommend the Italian film, Life is Beautiful, for a different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with love, humor, and optimism. Also, although I believe there was in years past a TV movie of some sort (starring Richard Chamberlain?), I'd like to see a major film done on another Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Hungarian Jews. I put Wallenberg in a similar heroic category along with Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a must see movie, both disturbing history and extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen."
"mOVIemAN56","10","9","13","21 March 2006"," The greatest achievement in filming history
","Arguably one of the greatest films ever made, Schindler's List details the struggles of two men who are trying to save as many people as they can during the Holocaust of World War II. Our main character, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German business man who runs a company which builds supplies for the German Army. Oskar employs many Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto because he can pay them near nothing to do long hours of labor. He treats them good and if one of his workers is harmed by a Nazi officer he writes letters of complaints and demands retribution for the damage.<br/><br/>As the movie progress', Oskar meets Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Stern helps Schindler to run the company and is constantly hinting a plea for help to his boss. Slowly, Schindler begins to witness the horrors of the Holocaust after witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the slaughter of hundreds of Jews. Soon Schindler is no longer a cold-hearted German who has a schedule for when his goods need to be made but a man seeking to save everyone he can.<br/><br/>Schindler's Lsit draws you in with the very first scene and holds you until the last credit rolls of the screen. Filmed entirely in black and white except for the first and last scene, the movie brings forth a n awesome sense of realism and authenticity. The sets are stunning and the effects sued are captivating.<br/><br/>The movie also uses some symbolism which is odd for a Spielberg film. The infamous girl in red is the only character in the entire film who appears in color while the rest is black and white. She is put forth to represent to the conversion of Oskar and is used in only two scenes.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is able to captivate the audience with his breathtaking performance. He is cool and quick thinking, a ladies man and a sly talker. He is able to bring forth the desperation of his character by the end of the film of how hurt and damaged his soul is from what he has witnessed. he is able to bring for Oskar like no other with a sense of realism and compassion, he brings forth a man who is trying to save as many people as he can.<br/><br/>I had no idea that Ben Kingsley was in this film until reading the cast list after seeing it. He barely ever talks but when he does, his words will bring tears to your eyes. He brings out the suffering of the Jews and how they are truly innocent of everything the Nazi's hold them accountable for. Kingsley continues with this film to be one of the greatest actors in the industry.<br/><br/>The last of the main characters is Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a troubled German officer and sort of commandant of the concentration camp that Oskar's workers come from. Fiennes kick started his career with this role. Acting opposite of Neeson, he is able to hold his own and bring out the lunacy of what the German's planned to do. You can't help feeling pity for him but also an overwhelming sense of hatred at the same time. It is Fiennes finest role to date.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is one of a very few select films that are able to convey a sense of humanity. It shows that murder and genocide solve nothing and that the greatest power to posses is to be able to have power but spare an enemy. The film moved me in a way that I have never felt before, this film will truly stun you.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 Stars"

","I was a die-hard ""Citizen Kane"" fan. I would defend the film as often as possible, and if I were to watch a movie that was considered a classic the main comparison would be to ""Citizen Kane"".<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" transcends ""Citizen Kane"" in brilliant film-making and acting, however. Its pure believable humanity has such effectiveness that people can be changed by its horrors, drama, and feel-good appeal.<br/><br/>Suspense has never been at the level throughout movies as it is in ""Schindler's List"". Hitchcock made some suspenseful movies, especially ""Rear Window"", but the Auchwitz scene in this film has suspense on a level I have never seen before.<br/><br/>The elements of horror, drama, suspense, and especially humanity throughout this movie are enough to make it comparable to ""Citizen Kane"". However, what makes it better are the stellar performances given by every actor throughout the performance. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Oskar Schindler, and he becomes Mr. Schindler in such a way that other actors throughout cinematic history would have died for to achieve. Even better is Ralph Finnes as Amon Goeth, a man just as vicious as Hitler who was portrayed in one of the great film performances in history.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie does not have the same regard as films such as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" is because it is so young. Thirteen years is not enough time for a movie to age the same way movies such as the classics of the 30s and 40s evolved into what they are today. In another 40 years however, Schindler's list will be among the company of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"".<br/><br/>This is my pick for the greatest film ever made."

This is, by miles, leaps and bounds, Spielberg's best work. With all due respect to Tom Hanks, to think Liam Neeson didn't win the Oscar for best actor is proof the Oscars are a joke sometimes. This movie may have won 7 Oscars, but it deserves all 12 it was nominated for, or however many it was nominated for.<br/><br/>On to the performances: Liam Neeson completely dominates this movie. Ralph Fiennes easily should have been nominated for best supporting actor, and Ben Kingsley was outstanding. Unfortunately, I can't remember the names of everyone else on the cast right now, but almost everyone in the movie gave an awesome performance.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie will stay with you forever.

Now with all due respect to actor Tom Hanks who'd won for his role in ""Philadelphia"" I've always felt that the best actor honor should've gone to Liam Neeson. I don't recall the other nominated actors that year though his portrayal of Oskar Schindler was outstanding and very convincing. And besides the following year at the Oscar ceremony Tom Hanks won the top acting honors for ""Forrest Gump."" Furthermore I've always found that this movie at the time was really over-hyped back in 1994. And today I still consider this movie to be quite overrated! There are many fans of Tom Hanks who'll disagree and that's understandable. I'll even add that Liam Neeson was robbed of the best actor award. I've followed the history of the Jews, the Nazi party and WWII for many years and still hold this film in awe."
"sadrec1","10","9","13","16 February 2006"," A brilliant, sobering film
","Schindler's List is a profound film that gives an eye opening look at one of the darkest, most despicable periods of the 20th century, the Halocaust. It unflinchingly tells the story of 1,100 Jews, who, when millions upon millions of their brethren were systematically murdered by the Nazis, survived, due to the actions of a greedy businessman. Steven Spielberg definitively proved his talents to the world when he made this film. No longer was he merely a sap-seller who made visually stunning summer films about alien landings, swashbuckling archaeologists, and sadistic Semi Trucks. He proved he could direct a harrowing, serious film which from every corner oozes artistry. I can't tell how much I love the fact that the film is in black and white. The medium works perfectly in presenting this grim time many of us only know of in shocking old photographs. More brilliant still are the sporadic uses of color. Much has been said about the moment when Oscar Schindler watches a young girl in a red dress walk quietly through the horror of the Krakow Liquidation, but not as much has been noted about my favorite instance of color. In the first scene, a Jewish family is gathered around a table to observe the Sabbath. The Father reads a prayer, and the camera slowly moves in on the candles on the table as the family fades out of the scene and color slowly dissipates. Soon, only the orange flame of the candles are in color, and they are soon extinguished. This, to me, represents the hope that was snuffed out by the Nazis during the Halocaust. Later in the film, Oscar Schindler, at his new artillery factory, allows some of the Jews to observe the Sabbath. They too gather around a candlelit table to read a prayer, and the flames of the candle glow orange; now that these Jews are safe, this is hope for them again. The performances are fantastic. I both applauded and scolded Liam Neeson as the alternatively brave and selfish Oscar Schindler, seethed with anger at Ralph Fiennes as the detestable SS Officer Amon Goeth, and felt immense pity for Ben Kingsley as the sorrowfully noble Itzhak Stern. Of course one of my favorite things about the film is the music. Not the traditional plagerized pomposity of John Williams earlier scores, the music for this film is carried by a gentle, sorrowful melody, often played by master violionist Ithzak Perlman. This is a film I believe all should see. Schindler's List will, hopefully, open your eyes to the immense evil that man carried out against his fellow man during the Halocaust."

But the overall sense of pain and anguish are the storyline that so many people missed that rated it less than five stars. I could expound forever on this film but just want to share my reactions. At the end of this film, the pain I felt could only be compared to the similar emotional exhaustion I felt when I was going through a divorce that involved losing my children.

","""Schindler's List"" (1993): I see this Monument repeatedly. It's brilliant and powerful, from start to finish. YOU should see it first, in it's entirety, if you're contemplating your children being exposed. Spielberg made his own ""parental warning"" introduction, when it aired Â unedited - on t.v. (a gutsy and triumphant moment for television). I would WANT my children to see it, as long as we had some preparation first, and PLENTY of discussion time after wards. Of course, this is an emotional and horrific story, scene after scene, full of dark insights at every turn, but it is the spiritual growth of Oskar Schindler Â NOT an admirable man when we first meet him Â that becomes one of the inspiring forces. Liam Neesom was great in this role, which helped make ""Schindler's List"" one of my Top Five for supreme Character Studies. You will also see a typically subdued Ben Kingsley, and a brilliant, frighteningly evil-yet-torn, Ralph Fiennes. The music is not overwhelming, but present and effective. The camera work and lighting for this black & white work of Art are flawless. The use of a few tiny moments of color (aside from the start and finish), aren't really necessary, and a little overly poetic, but aren't bothersome. During the film, I often want to vomit, or cry, or scream. I'm glad I feel these things. Steven Spielberg never has to prove anything to anyone ever again...even if he makes another ""E.T."" or ""War of the Worlds""."

"songrider64","9","9","13","31 December 2005"," Shindler's List Still Quite The Film!!
","There has been so much written about this film but I wanted to touch on areas that I found quite impressive and I might have some minor reservations. Ray Fiennes playing the Nazi Amon Goeth was astounding. Yes, he was sadistic but that is only part of it. The scenes he had where you saw into his eyes and there was nothing there. I have know idea how Fiennes pulled that off but it was dead on and I suspect it was probably closer to reality than any other actor to play a Nazi. Usually, actors who are not the nationality of the characters they play sometimes are betrayed by their own appearances if only slightly. That was not the case here. Both Fiennes and Neeson are Irish, but I was thoroughly convinced of the characters they played. This Schindler really looked Czech. Goeth really looked German right down to the eyes and that is why Fiennes should have won an Academy award for his performance. It was so stunningly convincing. I will agree with most of the comments on this film about the excellence that went into producing it. I do however, have one regret that the film does only covers the suffering of the Jews. This is not the fault of the film but a general regret that although 6 million Jews suffered in the war, 3 million Poles and million upon millions of Russians also lost their lives in the war. There are so many stories of tragedy and heroism out there. Let Schindler's List not only stand for the Jewish plight but for all who lost their lives at the hands of the Axis powers."

"MaxBorg89","10","9","13","7 December 2005"," Spielberg's most powerful movie
","Prior to making Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg was known for Close Ecounters, E.T. and the Indiana Jones films - not exactly the kind of resumÃ© studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a Holocaust drama. Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with The Pianist). Spielberg received a lot of criticism before the film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. Of course, it is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the best, most affecting of his serious movies.<br/><br/>Based on Thomas Keneally's bestseller (deftly adapted by Steven Zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in a time as brutal and inhuman as World War II. The story is that of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who first came across the ""Jewish situation"" in Hitler's Germany when he decided to employ Jews in his factory in order to save money. He wasn't an outspoken anti-Semite, nor did he oppose the Nazi regime - to him, it was all about business. Case in point: when he first meets his new assistant (Ben Kingsley) and the latter says he's a Jew, Schindler's matter-of-fact answer is: ""And I'm a German."".<br/><br/>The famous list doesn't enter the game until much later, when the cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the SS, particularly the stunningly cruel Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent lives as possible. His actions, which could have cost him his life had he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary events of all time.<br/><br/>If told the wrong way, Schindler's story would have ruined Spielberg's career. Luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes - Spielberg doesn't linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows it exactly as it was. The one element in color in the whole picture (a girl's red dress, reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now) isn't a concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally present in Spielberg's filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy of it all. The sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other aspect of the picture, most notably John Williams' Oscar-winning score and the three main performances: Kingsley's talent was never in doubt after Gandhi, and Neeson and Fiennes will probably never do better than here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully).<br/><br/>This painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won't repeat, not even in a thousand years. It's a look on the past that serves as a warning for the future, and as such, its power will never diminish."

The transition of the man is one of the greatest beauties I found in the movie. The performances left me open-mouthed as well. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Finnes were near-perfect in their roles. I was especially struck by the performance of Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, the Jew. In what is one of my favourite scenes, when Schindler dictates his ""list"" to Stern, he looks up at Schindler and says ""This list is life."" How his voice was choked with emotion!

In 1993, that drought was ended by Schindler's List.<br/><br/>When Poland is subdued by the invading Nazi armies, Oskar Schindler attempts to form a business, employing only Jews and freeing them from the Ghetto. However, the Holocaust and the Final Solution begin to take hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but Schindler continues to try and get Jews into his factories. However, as the year begins to draw to a close, Schindler begins to draw up a list of Jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory.<br/><br/>What a film! It is fantastic. It is supremely well made, exquisitely written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. It is a tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from Liam Neeson as the benevolent and great Schindler, Ben Kingsley as the mistreated Jew, Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the homicidal and psychotic Goeth. It is simply sublime from all.<br/><br/>John Williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise indeed). The photography is superb from Janusz Kaminski and they all help to make a film that has two strong bases. The first is Steven Zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. The second is Spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. He deals with the case of the Holocaust in a suitably stark way but he also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in one man at the very least. He also uses his skill to the maximum. In particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her re-appearance later in the film Put simply, this is a film that is veritably great.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be seen by all."
"btodorov","10","9","13","23 October 2005"," a high praise of the spirit of capitalism
","I had avoided to see the movie for a decade. The Holocaust is so absolute an act of cruelty that it does not give good food for originality. I underestimated Herr Schindler, just as I naively underestimated Herr Spielberg. No other movie has so boldly approached a fundamental ethical controversy of this size. Was Herr Schindler a prudent man or a remorseless exploiter? Did he help or use his workers? Didn't he decide to save them only when realizing he would be hunted down by the Soviets? Schindler is depicted as the most human of humans - his conversation with Amon Goeth over the real meaning of power and control can easily be included in college syllabi. And yet being so human, he is neither good nor bad: there are forces beyond him - his greed and his love of life, that allow him neither to refrain from war-time profiteering nor to subscribe to the absurd legal degradation of the Jews into lesser beings (are they less kiss-able just because they carry the Yellow Star, would ask Schindler?).<br/><br/>But still, Schindler plays only the supporting role in his own story. The central figure is Itzhak Stern - the bookkeeper who turned himself into a voluntary slave to the arrogant Schindler in order to be able to protect his kin. The scene in which Stern was brought out of the train taking him to the concentration camp, and apologized to his boss for his absent-mindedness - he got arrested because he had left his work permit - is of true biblical proportions. What is the message contained in Stern? That salvation does not come by itself. Schindler's Jews did not beg for mercy, they negotiated with him on their own terms, they made themselves useful to him, they invested in their own physical preservation. So the movie is not about Schindler being a hero or not, it is here to prove that good has a price and we cannot expect salvation for free - a moral philosophy inherent to Capitalism and incomprehensible for both the feudal or the social welfare states in which benefaction from above, be it from the feudal lord or from the all-powerful bureaucratic state is conceived as the necessary condition for man's survival."

But it does seem to me that ""Schindler's List"" is in a class of its own. More recent films like ""The Pianist"" have tackled the same subject well, but nothing can quite compare with Steven Spielberg's triumphant presentation of Thomas Kenealy's great book. <br/><br/>Perhaps the test of greatness is to answer some questions:<br/><br/>Â Does the story matter? Â Is it real (true) or believable? Â Does it touch all the emotions? Â Are there lessons to be learnt? Â Are the performances strong? Â Are the settings realistic and credible? Â Are the characters true to life? (Heroes we can learn from; Villains we can comprehend) Â Does the film have the capacity to change the way we look at the world?<br/><br/>To me ""Schindler's List"" scores more highly than any other film on all of these criteria.

No film has ever hit me with such powerful emotion before.

I bought this movie on a hunch that this one would be different. Well, it really wasn't, but I can't deny the absolute perfection of such a blatantly Hollywood movie. In typical Spielbergian fashion, the movie lifts you up and throws you down throughout, but never enough to make you very happy or sad, but at the end... The end is where the real kick is. I've never seen such a blatantly obvious attempt to make a person cry, but, even though I tried not to, I still did. It was an impossible temptation to escape. Sure it's propaganda, sure it's a Hollywood, ends happy, leaves you with a good feeling inside type of movie, but it was still more powerful than many other movies could even try to be."

","I just saw the film for the very first time today (25/8-05) and i regret that i have never seen it before. This is one of the most brilliant films i have ever seen, it shows true emotions from the actors (Who plays awesome). Schindler's List has just been added to my personal top 10 list! If you have not seen this, DO IT! Schindler is a person i would have liked to know! He saved all these people but still he wanted to save more. A pure heart of gold!! I love this film, it gives a good glint of how awful i must have been to be a Jew in that war, god rest the souls of every single one of them! A thing i don't get though, is how the Germans could lie about killing all of these people."

","In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.<br/><br/>The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre.<br/><br/>Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.<br/><br/>I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece."

","Throughout the history of historical drama's, Schindler's List has been recognised as the most powerful and emotionally distressing film ever made. The film tells the amazing and capturing story of Oscar Schindler who was an experienced war profiteer and was incidentally a member of the infamous Nazi party, but it is the incredible triumph of one man who saw through the brutal demise of his comrades and therefore committed himself to give him up his livelihood to save the lives of 1,100 Jews. Schindler's List is the one and only film that explores the triumph of this one man who has saved generations and the film itself has become the most compulsive drama ever made. The most realistic thing about this epic is the camera work, in order to make the film look more realistic to the times, Steven Spielberg wanted the film to be filmed in black & white, the ending sequence was actually considered to be unusual as the survivors from the Holocaust do the vow to commemorate Oscar Schindler by placing rocks on his grave which is considered to be an old Jewish tradition. Due to the authenticity of the film, Schindler's List garnered an astounding 7 Academy Awards and has now been recognised as the most greatest epic ever made."

","'Schindler's List' is a true account of how Oskar Schindler, a Czech factory owner, saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The film is based around his story, but also includes other occurrences such as ones relating to Amon Girth, concentration camps, extermination camps, gas chambers, ghettos, the War etc. As a student, watching this film helped me to gain more of an understanding of the Holocaust and what happened during that horrible time. It captured a side of the story in a more real way than out of a textbook, it showed me the human side, the emotions and fear that can't be described in words. In a surprising way, I enjoyed watching the film, even though it upset me at points. The Holocaust is an event that no human should ever avoid, and as horrifying as it is, I don't regret watching this real-life tale. I think people could call 'Schindler's List' many things, but no one could ever call it boring. I found it really interesting, and I think it's a film everyone should see and learn from."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","9","13","21 June 2005"," one of Spielberg's finest and a work of incredible importance
","SPOILERS Sixty years is a long time. When you compare the world today with 1945, so much has changed. People complain about multiple different things which really are quite petty. In contrast, all those years ago, the World was in a terrible state. Millions dead, countless cities destroyed, humanity took itself to the verge of extinction. Through brutal and inhumane methods, vast quantities of people were wiped off the Earth. One of the biggest groups of people to suffer were those of Jewish faith.<br/><br/>Detested by Adolf Hitler due to a belief that they were responsible for the decline of the German power, Jews were slaughtered in huge numbers. Not all Germans followed this route however. Through the work of German 'heroes' like Oskar Schindler, some were saved. Telling the story of Schindler's list of Jewish workers, Steven Spielberg's 1993 film is not easy watching. At over three hours long, it is a powerful black and white piece which shows the brutality of the Nazi extermination of the Jews. It is an amazing piece of work which is understandably shown in schools. Just like Spielberg's later ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"" reminds us of parts of the war and it is a film which is crucial to the future development of the human race.<br/><br/>As the German war machine spread across Europe, Hitler's army began to spread his beliefs across the land. Rounding up Jews and putting them into ghettos, the Nazi party began the slow process of wiping out a race of people. German industrialist Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) hated these events, and under the excuse of manufacturing for the war effort, he set about saving as many as he could.<br/><br/>From the first moment to the last, it is hard not to be taken aback by this film. Ironically beautiful in a well shot black and white form, it recreates the ugly side of human nature. Whether it's Ralph Fiennes Nazi commandant or the misguided child spitting at the passing Jews, ""Schindler's List"" is not afraid to show this nasty side of humanity.<br/><br/>Successful at the Oscars with awards for best film, director, adapted screenplay and others, the one disappointment is Neeson loosing out to Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"". Hanks was outstanding in that film as a man with aids, but throughout every scene of this film, Liam Neeson displays the finest acting he has ever done. From the first moment of exploitation of high ranking Generals through to his heartbreaking final scene, Neeson is outstanding.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Neeson is not alone in his quality. The amazing, and perhaps even more powerful, thing about ""Schindler's List"" is the way in which every single individual on the screen has you believing them. From the main characters through to the random five second Jew, every person on that screen is wonderful. You watch the actors playing a difficult role, and they do it so well, that it just makes the film even more powerful than it already is.<br/><br/>One of the most crucial aspects about ""Schindler's List"" is the sense of the numbers. In any film where genocide is committed, it is incredibly easy to loose track of the numbers and become dehumanised to the suffering. Steven Spielberg shows throughout this film how aware he is of this. In the clearing of the ghetto though, Spielberg gives his clearest indication of bringing the individual back into focus. As the film progresses in black and white, during the ghetto scene, Spielberg has a little girl in a bright red coat running along innocently. This girl, this child, is trying to escape the danger, and both the audience and Schindler notice her distinctively. Spielberg focuses on this girl and then half an hour later we see her body amongst a pile of the deceased. We're reminded, brutally but crucially, that these are not just statistics but individuals with lives, families and dreams. We are shown that all this waste of human life is terrible, and that little girl stops us from ever growing numb to the vast quantities of dead.<br/><br/>The issue of the Holocaust is not an easy topic to portray. If it is badly written, the story looses it's meaning slightly, if we are just shown large numbers of corpses we become desensitised. Steven Spielberg knows this. In ""Schindler's List"", Spielberg has created a masterpiece. Beautifully written and acted, the film is particularly powerful because it manages to use an attractive method of filming to show something truly terrible. From the first five minutes through to the conclusion, ""Schindler's List"" is an amazing piece of work. It is powerful, it is moving, and to try to prevent something like this happening again, it needs to be shown regularly in schools. Like a small number of films, ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece which reminds us of events we should never forget."

","This film does not have one error in anything in it: This film is absolutely brilliant in any standard, it is flawless, perfectly executed, shocking (REALLY SHOCKING), extremely violent (the many scenes of Jews being executed are definitely the most graphically realistic, totally believable brutal killings ever put on film, AND I MEAN THAT.) and extremely intense, in every sense of the word. This film does not have a false note in it's execution scenes, storytelling or acting. And this film is so moving (especially for Jews) and so engrossing that it felt like this whole film was really happening around me when I watched it (and I was dead scared, don't get me wrong) There is no way anybody will be offended by this film. The last great, unforgettable, internationally critically acclaimed 5-star and classic film of the ages. And it is all based on a true story.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is extraordinary as Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party who saves the lives of 1,100 Jews by employing them to work in his factory. Ben Kingsley is compelling as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and WHY wasn't he at least nominated?) and Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as the foul-mouthed Nazi Commandant. Both Neeson and Fiennes were nominated (they should have both won) Neeson for Best Actor, and Fiennes for Supporting Actor."

","OK - so the film was good - but its unrealistic the way that Schindler remembered 1100 peoples names by heart :s <br/><br/>taking into account that the factory workers were employed on the spot - and unlike today where employers may remember your names from the interviews - Schindler managed to remember all their names by casually walking through his factory a couple of times, and sometimes saying hello to them..... <br/><br/>but overall i thought the film was good.....but not as good as 'la vita e bella' which is a CLASSIC.....(and it has less unnecessary nudity, and overall delivers the same ideology, but in a much more sympathetic and heart-crunching way)"

"SpiralWire","9","9","13","4 June 2005"," Beautifully conveyed
","Schindler's list is truly a excellent movie, not simply the way in which it is shot, but also the way it conveys exactly what it meant for one man to save a few lives. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler, a Nazi industrialist, employs Jews and ultimately negotiates for their diversion from Auschwitz and into his factory. On the outset we are given the impression that he is merely a businessman, regarding the Jews as nothing more than money-making tools. But we are able to slowly learn that it is only by giving this cold-hearted impression to the Nazi officers he barters with that he could be successful - to simply fight the cause of the Jews would probably have seen him hanged. No, Schindler is cleverer than that, and manages to save the lives of over one thousand doomed Jews; men, women and children. His humanity slowly emerges throughout the film, sometimes in palpable acts of kindness such as insisting that the trains carrying Jews on a hot day are hosed with cooling water.<br/><br/>In stark contrast, the Nazi commandant in charge of the labour camp, Amon Goeth (Ralph Feinnes), is a psychotic killer whose methods of operation run to arbitrary killings and a total hatred of the Jew race. It is he who Schindler must befriend and gain trust from in order to save as many people as possible. <br/><br/>The film avoids simply documenting a piece of history that we have heard before. By focusing on a handful of personal experiences, an emotional anchor is provided for the audience with which we can go much deeper into the meaning of what is happening. The atrocities carried out principally by Amon Goeth and by other Nazi officers, which involve harrowing scenes of fear and suffering are integrated with the importance of recognising how important each individual person is. Whilst we see Goeth taking pot-shots at working Jews in the morning from his balcony, and thus demonstrating his total indifference to Jewish lives, we are shown Schindler, who at the end, weeps for every single life he couldn't save. This is manifested superbly by him looking at his gold pin badge: it would have bought him one more person to be saved.<br/><br/>And so we learn that Schindler's acts were not about numbers, since as his Jewish assistant reassures him, saving one life is saving everyone."

","Although this movie, is quite accurate to all that I have heard about the Holocaust, it is quite interesting, and sad at the same time. It is hard to understand the reason behind all that was done, but it shows the true meaning of why we can never forget what happened to the innocent. Mr. Spielberg, did a marvelous job, compiling all on screen, with the way that the music would be played out as well. Anyone, who can handle a true account of what happened, should sit down, and pay close attention to the wonderful video, that sums it all up. Although there is the language barier at spots, the video is still simply explaining what happened to all of the innocent; and shows why Schindler was one of the very few Nazi party members, who was willing to put his life on the line, in order to save the lives of those, who Hitler would have killed."

","This film is unexplainable. There are no words to convey how amazing this film was. Watching this gave me chills, made me shake, cry, and stare astounded and astonished at the end of it. The Holocaust is perhaps one of the most shocking and horrific times we will ever learn about. True, events this like that have occurred before, but this is the one that everyone knows about, survivors from this event still live and are able to talk about its terrors. It's beyond most of our imaginations, the systematic killing of races just because they are different. To us, it just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The eleven or some say up to twelve million people who were murdered became victims of a cruel, heartless, callous, and brutal time; an atrocious idea that it was OK to carry out the ""Final Solution."" It was not OK. The Jews, Gypsy's, handicapped, Slavs, mentally ill, etc; anyone different from the way the aggressors thought people should be. Anyone who opposed them went away as well. It is so unheard of. Call me naÃ¯ve, but everyone is the same. Do we not all laugh, cry, bleed, loveÂthere's only one race and that's mankind. Hatred and scapegoats leads to forceful and concentrated suffering. No one should ever have to deal with that. In my school's One-Act play, we adapted some events from Schindler's List that made our show even more intense. The black and white theme is remarkable, and the touch of the little girl in the red coat is so overwhelming and deep. The authentic and actual landmarks, the recreation of such images that make us the audience gasp in fear, and cry out in agony. It felt like we were there, witnessing the fact, but we couldn't do anything to help them. We were frozen in time, glued to our chairs, shocked at what was happening on screen. Seeing it on screen was real enough, imagine witnessing it for real. Something like that must never happen again. Ever. Oscar Schindler really was a hero who doesn't get enough credit. I'll bet few people even know his name. The millions who died are simply martyrs for a cause; a cause of loyalty to one's faith, family, friends, and a deep devotion to never surrender. We could all learn something from this movie. Generosity goes a long way. Thousands of people are alive today just b/c of Oscar Schindler and the millions of victims and survivors who never gave up. That movie is the only one that has ever made me cry; it is just so powerful..."

","The film which centres on the courageous deeds of a German industrialist who shelters his Jewish workers from impending death is one of the finest films ever made. Not just because it was about the holocaust.Even if one were to divorce the Holocaust from the film - or put it more simply, as holocaust deniers would have us believe that it never happened - this simply remains one of the finest executed films . Right up there with other greats such as Amadeus. The decision to shoot the film in a quasi documentary black and white style is skilfully handled by the cinematographer Janus Kaminski, and for the whole three hours never lets the attention wonder off. The screenplay brilliantly explores the complexities of Oscar Schindler showing his zest for life and his humanity, and the arch Nazi Amon Goeth cannot hide his attraction to his Jewish maid whilst harbouring hatred towards her race. The film intricately shows how Schindler starts his factory from nothing, peddling money from Jews from the ghetto, succeeding as an Entrepreneur and then deciding to sacrifice all of it to save his workers. The interplay between Schindler and the various Nazis who he charms and bribes is brilliantly performed by Liam Neeson. Sir Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic low key performance as the keen accountant who quietly paves the way for more workers to be protected within the factory under the nose of his boss. The score by JohnWilliams is definitely a career best as is every aspect of the film."

The lasting effects this film had on me were monumental. For the first time in my life, I felt I had witnessed Hell. And the sad part is that this was a Hollywood version of the actual actions that took place.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler, a womanizer, a crook, a money-hungry fiend, became the greatest hero to some eleven hundred Jews. He became a god for the people at a time when God seemed to have abandoned His people.<br/><br/>This is expertly displayed throughout the film, with no details spared. The scenes in which the Jewish people are being rounded up, the crematory scenes and the shower scene, are just some examples of the true horror experienced by these poor unfortunate souls.<br/><br/>Spielberg has created a masterpiece.

","First of all it is a reminder of the crimes committed in the times of World war II, and second it is a homage to Schindler, something that he really deserved and he wasn't always recognized for what he did.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the story, Schindler is with no doubt another Nazi, with the same mentality of them, and so he decides to take double advantage of the war, not only manufacturing things for the armies but also hiring Jews to pay them less than he should , so his benefits were going to be spectacular, he really makes lots of money doing so, but with the course of the war he sees with his own eyes what was actually happening to the Jews and he begins to change his mind about that, it is true that the character played by Ben Kingsley helps to the change even though with a low profile, so that's when he realizes that he can save people instead of taking advantage of them, how? When he hires Jews he is automatically saving them from death, so he does so, but only in secret he knows the real reason of Jew-hiring otherwise, he would be accused of betrayal against the Germany.He even gets to pay money to the Nazi's to hire Jews, and that's when he makes a sacrifice and invests the money he made from the war, and so he proofs once again why he is worthy of acknowledgement.<br/><br/>All that is about the plot, but i have to say that the way Spielberg carries the story is really interesting and makes you stay still in front of the TV, he shows us a view of World War II from another perspective than the traditional of the battles, it shows us how much that group of people suffered in that particular period of history and why we shouldn't forget the past to don't make the same mistakes in a future.<br/><br/>First, when the movie is just beginning you wonder why is it in black and white, but then you realize it is some kind of history lesson, and Spielberg didn't actually need the colour for this movie, it had no special effects and was focused in the plot, and the development of it. In this movie he demonstrated why Cinema is considered as another art.<br/><br/>For all this is that this movie deserves to be with the greatests movies ever, and mainly because the story told is true and no fiction."

"slayerholmes","10","9","13","26 January 2005"," My conclusion why he did it...
","First: is this a great and an important movie? Of course it is, like all the films about the holocaust. Truly, have you ever seen a bad movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the subject? I haven't. Like most great, based-on-facts tragedies, stories about concentration camps require too much serious thinking, talent and at least adequate budget to start with before anything happens. Filmmaker just couldn't fail with real-life drama of this magnitude in his hands. Neither could Mr. Spielberg.<br/><br/>Well, still, even considering above-mentioned, Spielberg did an excellent job. ""Schindler's List"" is technically brilliant: beautifully shot with its vast use of different camera distances and angles, and stark b/w realization (which always adds extra-interest for modern day film-enthusiastic). Cast is also superb (Liam Neeson to me is almost the very personification of 'trustworthy') and set design perfect, naturally, due to on-location shooting in Poland. The only, but nevertheless quite notable complaint is length; the movie is by definition unnecessarily overlong.<br/><br/>So, why did Oskar Schindler do it? Now, I'm a Finn with some German-Swedish heritage, and there's very unlikely one Jewish cell in my body. And I'm no bleeding-heart liberal either, pretty much vice versa. But I'm an intelligent guy with very strong comprehension what comes to 'right' and 'wrong'. So, given the same opportunities, money and influence, I would had for sure at least attempted the same kind of rescue-mission Schindler accomplished. Because I couldn't bear either just stand aside and watch an absolute and continuous torment of innocents. That's the very and simple reason for Schindler, a human being, too: he HAD the money and chance to save those people and he did. Only it took courage and an ability to successfully deal with crazy monsters (Nazis). And I, too, think that when there's a decision between life and death to be made, money means nothing. So it's so easy for me to identify with Oskar Schindler. Only the world this rotten and greedy even questions his motives.<br/><br/>Still, one possible and a little more cynical explanation, which I anyway think must had played at least minor part considering Schindler's (AND also that German officer's in ""The Pianist"") motives: Germany had already clearly lost the war. One can only guess if they would had acted exactly the same way in other circumstances..."
"Foot_Freakin_Master","10","9","13","20 January 2005"," The Best?
","This is a complex issue, but I still think this is the overall best movie I have ever seen. The characters, acting, storyline, cinematography, and general atmosphere and emotional depth combine to make a movie like no other.<br/><br/>Haunting, exciting, once in a while funny, gripping, rewarding, moving, significant, etc, etc. Wow!<br/><br/>It may paint a slightly rosy picture of Oskar Schindler, but, remember, it is a movie. I think this picture almost perfectly blends a documentary and cinematic feel. I is literary, artistic, and substantial. <br/><br/>I love Casablanca. Citizen Kane is a classic, maybe the best by many standards. But Schindler's List is movie of the modern generation which achieves classic status by both prior and current critical standards. <br/><br/>It is the last ""great"" film I have seen at a cinema. No doubt there are great films I have not seen. Any suggestions?"

","It's a great movie and i recommended it to anyone who wants to see a beautiful film about the great tragedies of the holocaust. This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story."

","This film gets sucked up as fuel for propaganda by those in the west who continue to nurture the Holocaust industry for all it's worth. This film stays true to the filmmaker's desires, which is to present a quasi-historical, quasi-fictional account of the German incarceration of Jewish prisoners in WWII.<br/><br/>The film does a good job of depicting the dehumanizing treatment and mental torture, as well as the robbery of prisoners' personal effects.<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the pace is lively. For a long film, it's easy to watch.<br/><br/>It's good that there are films like this, but it's a pity that Hollywood hasn't made a similar film about the Palestinians who are holed up in the refugee camps, with Israeli occupation tanks and such surrounding them. It would make an interesting epilogue. Perhaps one day."

","Last night, after reading many fabulous reviews, I was lucky enough to view Schindlers list, a supposed ""masterpiece"" directed by the famous, the fabulous, Steven Spielberg, creating masterpieces such as E.T. and Jurassic park. So I went into this 3 hour epic with high hopes.<br/><br/>It starts off rather depressingly, but picks up. Directed beautifully in black and white, to give it a more old fashioned sense, it clearly shows the films class. Schindler's slimy personality is soon introduced (we see he has affairs with more that one women) and cannot promise his estranged wife she is the only one he will truly ever feel for. Then, we are introduced to Ralph Fiennes (Goeth) a rather brutal member of the Nazi party. So both of the characters ""politically incorrect"" frames are introduced.<br/><br/>The film is simply too long for me to comment on every happening, but it becomes blatantly apparent that this film didn't win 7 academy awards for nothing. Both hopeful and poignant (showing some rather graphic violent scenes as well) this truly is a masterpiece that should be viewed by all.<br/><br/>Final summary: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)"
"davideo-2","10","9","13","21 December 2004"," Extremely rewarding film
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World War 2.<br/><br/>I'm not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a red jacket looking like she'd popped right out of a Butlins advert!)What he's succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch of film noir for good measure.<br/><br/>As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.<br/><br/>It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives than them.<br/><br/>Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish people.There's good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!) as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's wearisome accountant.<br/><br/>Overall,this film doesn't manage to be quite as shocking as it was trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a hurry.*****"
"Tolbert","10","9","13","29 November 2004"," Thought provoking but hard to watch certain scenes
","Spielberg did a great job of depicting the horror of what went on during the holocaust. It's very historically accurate (a rarity now a days). I have a whole new respect for this film in learning that Spielberg refused to take a salary for it. His reasoning behind it is admirable also.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert)<br/><br/>There were a few scenes where my stomach was in knots and I needed to take a break from it. One was the scene where the little girl in red (seen running in the streets early on) is later seen dead. The one handed machinist execution was hard too. The very worse part (emotionally) is the Auschwitz scene, It's not so much what you see, it's what you do not see. The Jews are being lined up for their own deaths. The only thing you really see is them being lined up to go into the incinerator room. That's enough though, the image of the smoke stack is enough to make it real. Near the end when the Russians hung Amon Goeth, I remember thinking it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Also the speech that Schindler gave to the remaining guards at the camp was really something. They had a choice between murder and doing the humane thing. When they left as ""men instead of murderers"" that was moving. It's almost like there was a glimmer of hope there. I highly recommend this film to anyone, just make a point to take a break from it every so often."

There may be a basis for that question, but what Spielberg did was also make a piece of amazing piece of film-making. Despite his phenomnal successes, it seems as if he was hiding his hand at what depths he could demonstrate. After years of awing and amazing us, he now had the skills and power to deliver a most potent work.<br/><br/>To be honest, I haven't seen it since it's initial release. Yet, what I do remember is that Spielberg was able to make a three hour film on the Shoah and make it move a brisk pace without letting up on its impact. That's why it is brilliant."

","In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims. <br/><br/>This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.<br/><br/>The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre. <br/><br/>Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.<br/><br/>I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece."

","Any one who care about Cinema in what so ever small manner and also who sympathize with people perished or survived in holocaust will do a great disfavor to themselves will if they do not go and watch this movie, may be to just get shocked. A brilliant camera work along with the print used in the accompanied with the most adequate lighting adds to the horror of the situation. The jarring camera work immediately transports us to that era of which we have only black and white memory. As far as the script is considered I think it will be much more than ten textbooks any one will read in script writing. Acting if Liam, Ralph and Ben have been most natural you will find in any kind of Cinema. It seems they never supposed that they were recorded on Camera. And finally coming to direction it is Most Brilliant. I just wish to be present at the point when Spielberg would have been explaining his scenes to his actors and the perfect coordination with the people at back ground and foreground. Some scenes such as small children's not more than the age of fine throwing stones at the Jew when they were moved to camps, the horror which women witness when they were moved to another camp and they apply there on blood on there cheeks to look radiant and young were beyond imagination and end I think is beyond what has ever been ever filmed. In every way it is a classic and much more. It is history in life."

","Schindler's List was by far the best movie of 1993, and it could vary well contend for title of ""greatest movie ever made."" This is because it was made to portray suffering of innocents at the hands of sadistic evil, and all that a lone good man can do to save them. Because this movie is so well made, directed, acted, etc., it nails its goal, and leaves the audience completely moved by the story it spent three hours witnessing.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is tremendous, and winds up being crucial towards capturing the story's emotion. 1993 Best Actor should-have-been Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley, who should have walked away with a Best Supporting Actor award, steal the scene as the heroic Schindler and his good friend, right-hand man, businessman and (sometimes) sense of good, Itzhak Stern. Their performances, combined with the evil Ralph Fiennes injects into his role as the monstrous Amon Goeth, make for a film that rises above any other historical drama and is placed into the upper echelon of movies and masterpieces. The emotion, pain and suffering is all real, and when you combine this with superb acting and flawless directing, you wind up with a film that demonstrates completely the passion of the Holocaust. Schindler's List moves the viewer in a way no other movie has approached, it takes anyone with a heart and makes him or her recognize their emotions and feelings on the matter. This film is important, and should at some time be viewed by everybody."

In any case I sure can't be in a laid back mindset ready to watch an action flick and substitute Schindler's List at the last second; I gotta be ready for it.<br/><br/>I've watched it 3-4 times, the first time in a theater with my sister who was dying of cancer and wanted to see it. I remember one of her sons theorized that the Holocaust never happened and it was a way to justify the destruction of the Nazi regime, or some other BS, that I've heard variations of before. They just don't have any grounding in history. Even the Nazis who were hung for it didn't deny it; they were just following orders.<br/><br/>Its quite a movie with all the talent both on and off the screen doing some of their best work ever. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes really should've won Oscars, but it won so many others I suppose they wanted to spread them around a little.<br/><br/>The fairly recently released DVD package is a bit of a throwback with an odd case and a single double-sided DVD. If there's some special reason for it I don't know what it is. It has a DTS soundtrack but the B&W video was quite harsh on my screen with very bright interior lighting sometimes bombing details to smithereens. I had to adjust my screen to watch it.

"TonysLittleFriend","10","9","13","4 September 2004"," The List is Life
","Adapted from the best-selling book by Thomas Keneally and based on a true story, filmed in Poland with an emphasis on absolute authenticity, Spielberg's masterpiece ranks among the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust during World War II. It's a film about heroism with an unlikely hero at its center--Catholic war profiteer Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who risked his life and went bankrupt to save more than 1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps.<br/><br/>By employing Jews in his crockery factory manufacturing goods for the German army, Schindler ensures their survival against terrifying odds. At the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley) and negotiate business with a vicious, obstinate Nazi commandant (Ralph Fiennes) who enjoys shooting Jews as target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison camp. Schindler's List gains much of its power not by trying to explain Schindler's motivations, but by dramatizing the delicate diplomacy and determination with which he carried out his generous deeds.<br/><br/>As a drinker and womanizer who thought nothing of associating with Nazis, Schindler was hardly a model of decency; the film is largely about his transformation in response to the horror around him. Spielberg doesn't flinch from that horror, and the result is a film that combines remarkable humanity with abhorrent inhumanity--a film that functions as a powerful history lesson and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the context of a living nightmare.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is filmed in black and white, with one notable exception: a little blond girl running around in a red coat. This is where Schindler's transformation begins, and when the true horror of war, will sink deep and hit you hard as a moment you will never forget. The whole film has stuck with me for about 6 years now, and that one particualr scene(s) that involve the child, i'll never forget. Schindler's List is to me, a life altering experience, and is much more than a movie.<br/><br/>****/****"

It was very much a personal project for Spielberg. After the success of Jurassic Park he was able to make any film he wanted, and has said that he didn't expect many people would want to see a Jewish story. However, in Neeson's flawed hero Oskar Schindler, Kingsley's quietly desperate Jewish administrator Itzhak Stern and Fiennes's bloatedly evil concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Spielberg had a dramatic engine that pulls an audience along through the heartbreaking story of the enslavement and massacre of Poland's Jews. <br/><br/>It won buckets of Oscars, but its best tribute is the shocked, tearful silence of audiences everywhere.

"snakejenkins","9","9","13","7 August 2004"," Spielberg's Finest Work
","There is a reason Steven Spielberg is a household name. He is, quite simply, the greatest director in the history of the medium. He understands film and how it works, but more importantly than that, he understands his audience. he understands how he can best communicate the story he wants to tell to the masses, without sacrificing truth and his own identity. Schindler's List is a glowing testament to that fact and it is Spielberg's finest work to date. Do I ever think he'll surpass Schindler's List? It's possible I suppose, but I think the story was so personal, that he won't really want to. This is Steven Spielberg's Magnum Opus.<br/><br/>There are conflicting truths about Oskar Schindler and what type of person he was. When you compare the movie to what his family say about him, there are small inconsistencies. Before I had seen the film I had heard both sides of the argument and felt fairly safe in feeling that both sides of that man were represented on screen. The business man, and the savior. I think the film portrays him as a business man who doesn't really understand the good he's doing until it's almost done. I like that. That's truth. That's human. That's who I'd bet Oskar Schindler was.<br/><br/>Looking back on the film, I'd say it's one of the best looking films I've ever seen. That's not to say it's pretty. It's high contrast Black and White was an inspired choice. I'm partial to Black and White anyway. There's something mysterious and nostalgic about it. But the lighting and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (his first collaboration with Spielberg) are a glory to watch.<br/><br/>I particularly liked Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler. It was quiet and reserved until it needed to be loud and booming. I liked how he was able to shift character to blend with the Nazis then right back to dealing with his workers. It was a very nuanced performance. One of his best.<br/><br/>All in all Schindler's List is a powerful film about saving lives. One man spends all his life making a fortune, then spends every cent of it to bring safety to 1,100 Jews. That is beauty. Within Schindler's List there is a small bit of dialog about what power actually is. Honestly the answer doesn't come until the end of the film.<br/><br/>Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."

The plight of the children in the camps as depicted in the film is particularly awe inspiring. To see them separated from their mothers and while others hid in the toilets was almost too much too bear watching.

Schindler's list, presented in a black and white format enhances the visual wounds, and emotional feelings of this dark chapter in human history, without actually being involved in this era of time.   We begin the film by meeting Schindler, an excellent performance by Liam Neeson, of which we see he is a successful, generous business man. As the film unfolds, we see him changing as a person as the thousands of people are forced out of their homes, separated and sent to the camps, continued by mass killings, torture and larbour. The film also illustrates in detail the other horrors endured by the Jews, plus Schindler's friendship to Itzhak Stern, and eventually concluding by his speech, in which he announces the war is over, followed by Schindler breaking down after the years of murder he has just witnessed.<br/><br/>The film as a whole then ends, returning to colour, making Spielberg successfully creating a field of depression in the 1940's, seperated against today's world: a more human place to live! It is here where Schindler is remembered, and the results of what he did are shown as how it matters today!<br/><br/>Personal rating: 9/10"

","This is a horror film.  Not a visual horror film but a mental and spiritual horror film. It drags out every kind of fear that can be expressed. It shows how not just one but two men can have an effect on a vast number of people. Hitler murdered 6 million Jews.  Schindler saved 1,100 in the most trying of circumstances. As mentioned in one of the previous comments, it will not be long before the survivors of the holocaust will be gone and there will only be the memorials and films to remind us of the sickening atrocities that were carried out. This film serves as a learning guide to what can happen and an emotional journey beyond what most films can take you on.  It should be shown to every child to let them know that the holocaust did happen.  This is not a figment of someones imagination that was written and published.  Within 6 years, 6 million were dead in those camps. What is more concerning is that there are countries still at war with families being torn apart.  Have we learned nothing!

"JohnBoyRoy","8","9","13","5 May 2004"," Haunting and visceral realism
","I had not seen Schindler's List in it's entirety for a few years.  The last time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full.<br/><br/>Of course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows.<br/><br/>I was mesmerised by the performances of Liam ""I'm Retired"" Neeson and Ralph Fienes.<br/><br/>Even Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce.  His motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror.<br/><br/>Fienes is such a complex character it's untrue.  Spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites.  They are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot.  This brotherhood means that Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think.  At times he appears to take on board Schindler's advice and passificity.  He doesn't really hate the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill.  At one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel.  At heart he is a vulnerable coward.<br/><br/>The various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's and is much more powerful.  It is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'SL'.<br/><br/>This really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on.<br/><br/>8/10"

","well I have only just seen this film recently due to the new DVD. I was in a way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and the fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to me. But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly intrigued by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.<br/><br/>I have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn. If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were treated and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an excellent film.

","Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character. A little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her, that sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be."

","""Schindler's List"" is a movie so epic and far reaching in its impact that one stops watching it and says, ""...so that's why film was invented."" Steven Spielberg takes us back to the haunting horror of war-torn Poland and its condemned Jewry during WWII in a film so impeccably well filmed and performed there need not be any kind of ""suspension of disbelief"" on the part of the viewer. Liam Neeson delivers the performance of his life starring as Oskar Schindler, a true person who takes pity on the imprisoned Jews and helps over 1,100 to safety. He does this against the will of supervillain Amon Goeth, masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes in what in my opinion is the finest theatrical presentation ever captured on film. The film is primarily historical but beautifully touches at the theme of the survival and triumph of the human spirit. Truly, the only disappointment about ""Schindler's List"" is that not enough films such as this grace our lives. END"

","Eventually, I would have had to have seen Schindler's List. Not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies (although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which I had never seen before.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.<br/><br/>Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.<br/><br/>On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.<br/><br/>Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for war violence and language."

","I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen on the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must see movie for all people interested in history."
"jasonsurety","9","9","13","13 April 2004"," Shade of Hope
","Oskar Schindler represented a snippet of hope and optimism for an otherwise beleaguered people.  The fact that one man could be responsible for saving well over 1000 people is astonishing in itself.  The story Schindler's List tells magnifies our astonishment.  How a man who seems so self-absorbed and moneygrubbing could end up sacrificing his fortune and risking his own life to save others, is what the film principally deals with.  This interesting subject, shown in the midst of the Holocaust, and combined with other interesting subplots, makes for a stirring movie experience.<br/><br/>One detail quite noticeable and frequently discussed is the occasional use of color in this black and white picture.  The most obvious of these being a small girl in red coat.  We see the girl and follow her path for a short time in the film.  This is symbolic on many different levels.  I see her mostly as a glimmer of hope in a tenebrous world for the Jews.  Later, her red coat looms on top of a pile of dead bodies.  Here, we see her singled out among the dead to remind us that while 6 million died, each individual's death mattered.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful.  Liam Neeson plays Schindler subtly but with the right emotion at the right time.  Ralph Fiennes plays a pertinacious German officer with zest and complexity.  The rest of the cast, especially Ben Kingsley as an intelligent Jewish accountant who starts out helping Schindler but finds a way to help his people, too, all play their roles accordingly.  Certainly, anyone who enjoys film should add this to their collection."

","It won't be very long before the last survivors of the Holocaust as well as their rescuers are dead.  Their children will, with varying degrees of passion and understanding, repeat stories long told or wonder about experiences barely hinted at.  Then that generation too will be gone and the dense record will largely interest those committed to studying history, a minority.<br/><br/>Film can have much to say about the world that not so very long ago convulsed with the agony of a war that included among its terrors unprecedented state-directed genocide committed with, for its time,  cruelly efficient technology.  Steven Spielberg produced a masterpiece with 1993's ""Schindler's List"" and it will remain a painful, at times agonizing, recreation of a very special craziness.<br/><br/>Winner of many awards including the Oscar for Best Picture, the cast brings to life an enigmatic and, probably, not very likable man, German small-time industrialist Oskar Schindler.  Schindler profited from the war and he was a skirt-chaser of extraordinarily ravenous tastes.  What set him apart was his rescue of some 1100 Jews from the jaws of the Nazi extermination apparatus. Compared to the tally of the murdered this seems a small number but every life is precious and Schindler did what he could.<br/><br/>Why did he set about rescuing people destined for the gas chambers or death through individual murder or, simply, by overwork?  No one really knows including the survivors themselves.  One has been quoted as saying that everytime he asked Schindler about his motives during postwar encounters he got a different and incomplete answer.<br/><br/>Perhaps Schindler himself never knew.  But results are more important than reasons.<br/><br/>There have been some notable films about Nazis, concentration camps and genocide.  Some like ""Life is Beautiful"" reflect too much development of a star and seem almost obscenely clean, even with the killings.   ""The Pianist"",  a recent fine example, shows the suffering of a gifted and wounded man against a supporting backdrop of horror.<br/><br/>In ""Schindler's List,"" the hopelessness of the victims stretches from frame to frame and the first senseless killings seamlessly lead to a growing orgy of dehumanization.  Liam Neeson is extraordinary as the German factory owner and Ralph Fiennes as the SS concentration camp commander is both repulsive and fascinating as a warped man whose violence ebbs and flows without any rational inciting events.<br/><br/>Some dismiss Fiennes' character as one-dimensional and unreal but, in fact, any study of SS types who commanded those camps reveal the same split personalities: people who could be fine family men before setting off to work to superintend mass murder, stopping on the way to commit the occasional individual atrocity.<br/><br/>The DVD release has been digitally enhanced and the sound is crisp. Spielberg declined to provide the usual extras found on most DVD releases, stating that his original film should speak for itself.  But augmenting the movie is a documentary where some who survived because of Schindler recount their experiences.  It must not be missed: some of these voices are already stilled-all will be soon.<br/><br/>A very unusual item in the DVD edition is an envelope soliciting contributions to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and to teach its lessons to young people increasingly remote from the war.  The solicitation is appropriate-I'm posting a check.<br/><br/>Tonight was my third viewing, the first at home on DVD. An amazing, disturbing, brilliant film that will continue through the decades to be invaluable. <br/><br/>10/10"

I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because it time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history. Especially now when people really needed to see it to know the danger of misconception and the horror of misleading propaganda where power does corrupt, even when it involves religion.<br/><br/>This is a perfect time for this movie to come out."
"apkacdh","Null","9","13","8 March 2004"," The Passion of the Jews ... DEVASTATING! Excellent movie, but devastating.
","First of all, I hope that no one takes my title out of context and thinks that I like watching movies that show the suffering of ANYONE, unless, of course, the suffering is on an obvious villian or villians,  thank you.<br/><br/>I also need to mention that I have seen this film at least three times before I even HEARD about what Mel Gibson was working on.<br/><br/>Anyway, after seeing ""Passion of the Christ"", I thought that was THE most devastating (but excellently done) film ever made about Anything or Anyone that took place in History.  Then I remembered watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" (another Spielberg movie, excellently done) and it's being so intense that I literally had to remind myself a few times that I was in my living room watching a video; the intensity of the scenes and the sound made me almost FEEL bullets whizzing by my head.<br/><br/>Then I remembered THIS movie.<br/><br/>It is one of the hardest movies to sit through.  And it's hard to sit through almost the ENTIRE TIME.<br/><br/>Even though everyone and their brother has at least HEARD about the Holocaust, this is a movie about two things.  A)Yes, of course, The Holocaust, and B) a person who was a womanizing, sweat-shop owner type (who was, at first, only nice for the sake of production) member of the Nazi Party who eventually SAVED so many people from annihilation.<br/><br/>It is one thing to see the story of some ""Plain old guy"" save a life or two,... but to see someone who was FRIENDS WITH THE ANNIHILATORS manage to save over a thousand Jewish people and still be more or less friends with the Nazis during that time ... <br/><br/>All I can say is WOW!!!<br/><br/>Before any violence even takes place, a dark cloud forms just by watching the Jewish people being marched toward the ghetto and there's that girl screaming out ""Bye, Jews!"" over and over again along with other people being nasty.  <br/><br/>A) It's like watching a whole bunch of Jesuses being marched down the road to their eventual crucifixions while the crowd throws insults and objects at them.  B)You don't know whether you want to jump into the film and strangle her for her hatred (or her parents for teaching it to her, perhaps), or cry because of her innocence of not knowing better because the parents TAUGHT her that level of hatred because of buying into what was Politically Correct at the time and place.  <br/><br/>I know it was just a fictitious character, but such things as hatred toward specific types of people being taught by the parents DO happen in REAL LIFE.<br/><br/>I won't tell what actually happens with the women at Auschwitz (or was it Dachau?), but that was another one of the most chair-gripping ""Oh no ... Oh GOD NO!"" moments in the picture.<br/><br/>And, of course, there are all the ""Liquidation"" scenes and the especially significant scenes with ""The Little Girl in Red"", which requires a cast-iron stomach to watch at that point in the film.  By the way, don't you, Dear Reader, just love that euphemism ""Liquidation""?  ACCH!<br/><br/>Not to mention, all the people who get picked off simply because ... well, they were ALLOWED to be.  Double-ACCH!<br/><br/>I read earlier of a comment about how there should have been more focus on Hitler, as it was a movie regarding the Holocaust.  But this movie wasn't about Hitler's List of People He Wanted Dead; it was about Oskar Schindler's List of People He Could Afford to Keep ALIVE!<br/><br/>Even after all the carnage is over, it still makes anyone who is a human being get a huge lump in their throat when Oskar is breaking down because of however many more he could have saved with his own possessions.<br/><br/>As I said in my title and opening of this commentary, this is one of the best movies ever made about something that took place in history, but it's also one of the HARDEST movies to watch.<br/><br/>I really gotta give Spielberg credit not just for making this picture, not just for releasing it with as much as it has intact (after editing and getting past the authority boards and such), but ESPECIALLY for having the ""juice"" to get American television stations to show it without a single frame edited or altered.  Even the private parts you DIDN'T want to see when the prisoners are given physical exams and they're so skinny that their spines are almost glued to their belly-buttons.<br/><br/>Take a bow, Stephen.<br/><br/>Aaannnnd ... cut!<br/><br/>That's a wrap."
"TheMovieeGuy","10","9","13","4 March 2004"," Steven Spielberg's best dramatic film is finally on DVD!
","I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.<br/><br/>This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.<br/><br/>The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.<br/><br/>This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!<br/><br/>This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!"
"asticht","Null","9","13","11 March 2004"," Even eleven years later, still an impacting movie
","When I first saw Schindlers list in the theater when it first came out, I was left stunned and emotionally drained. Now with the release of the film on DVD I am still in awe of the precision and accuracy that it portrays of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during the second world war.  Stephen Spielbergs decision to make the movie entirely in black and white was pure genius and shows why he he is as successful of a director as he is.  This film is such a departure from other films that Spielberg has made and is a testament to his sincere embracing of the storyline and content of the story.  While this film is long by most standards, nearly twice as long as most contemporary films, it does not drag and keeps the audience rapt attention.  It is the type of film which comes along once in a great while which truly captures the imagination of the audience.  The subject matter makes this film one which one truly cannot express as an enjoyable film, but on a higher level it is insightful and inspires one to really see how one person can truly change the world, at least their part of the world.  Oskar Schindler was a scheming war profiteer who had no interest in any part of world politics, the winds of war were blowing in his direction and he took full advantage of it.  As the war progressed and he became a witness to the horrific acts committed by the Nazi's against the Jews he became to see the Jews in a different light to what the political propaganda was saying and he developed a conscience which ultimately led him to expend vast sums of money in bribes and political favors to protect his workers in his factory, initially under the guise of needing to keep trained workers in his factory to maintain production, but eventually because he could see how his workers people were being made to suffer and were being brutally murdered simply because of a misguided political doctrine.  Acting in this movie is superb, Lliam Neeson was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and ultimately lost the award to Tom Hanks portrayal of a dying HIV positive lawyer in Philadelphia, this was truly one of those times when the Academy had a very difficult decision to make as both actors justifiably deserved the award.  Ralph Fiennes was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the homicidal concentration camp Kommindant Amon Goeth, he ultimately lost the award to Tommy Lee Jones for his work in the Fugitive. Surprisingly one actor who did not receive a nomination, but should have would be Ben Kingsley who deservedly could easily have won the award for his portrayal of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who cooperated and assisted Oskar Schindler in running his Enamelware factory and ultimately used his intelligence to manipulate the system to encompass as many unskilled laborers as possible into Schindlers factory, persons who otherwise would have gone to the death camps as they were primarily musicians, writers and teachers, all who were considered high priority execution material by the Nazi regime.  This is a truly remarkable, emotional and moving film that will easily stand the test of time and remain a classic for years to come, it would be highly recommended and should be mandatory viewing material for all high school aged students who wish to graduate, as this film is not just a depiction of the events of World War II, but is also a reflection of the inner monster that lives within all mankind, hatred, and how there also lives within us a capacity to do great good for our fellow man."
"kingtanichi","Null","9","13","1 March 2004"," It really is that perfect
","WARNING: ONE MINOR SPOILER<br/><br/>This film has often been accused of being so emotionally powerful as to suppress objective analysis. It's almost thuggish in how hard it makes it to step back and rationally look for the flaws you know must be there, but you've been so shaken by the experience of the film you don't want to look for them.<br/><br/>And to these accusations I say: CONGRATULATIONS STEVEN SPIELBERG! In an age when too many Hollywood epics have you checking your watch (you know who you are Cold Mountain), it's nice to see one that instead makes you check a mirror to see if your tear-stained face is too dishevelled.<br/><br/>
Liam Neeson demonstrates just why he is the best actor around for playing secular saints (or Catholic, in this case, but in general...), Ralph Fiennes creates one of film history's most complex villains; Goeth is evil, no doubt, but there are still moments when we genuinely like him. As for Ben Kingsley, well he gives another great performance in a career full of great performances. The black and white photography is not pretentious, it's perfectly natural for the period atmosphere the film creates. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well in colour, plus, they wouldn't have been able to do the girl in the red dress, which in itself justifies the decision. And yes, this is a very violent film, but it's not ground-breakingly bloody, and as with Saving Private Ryan later on, Spielberg avoids being gratuitous.<br/><br/>Are there any problems? Well, I've seen the film three times, and there's only one thing that bugs me: the scene near the start where the Jews are being herded into the ghetto, and the little girl scoops mud up from the gutter to hurl it at them, shouting ""Goodbye Jews!"" There's just an annoying screech to her voice, and it isn't improved by having her repeat it over and over in exactly the same tone. There's a sincerity that seems lacking.<br/><br/>
Given that my sole quibble lasts 10 seconds at most, out of a three hour-plus movie, should about close the case. It's a masterpiece."

","There's the ancient story of Orpheus who's going into the underworld to free his wife and who failed. Then there's another story of a man who's going into the hell on earth called Auschwitz to free some hundred women and their children and he succeeded. The difference between these two stories is that the last one is true. Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave. Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot. I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if he's not looking away."

","SOME SPOILERS<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece, `Schindler's List' is not only a historical account of the atrocities of World War II, but also a passionate tale of survival and finding humanity over greed that all films dealing with the Holocaust must live by.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is about Nazi war profiteer, Oskar Schindler , who, with help from Jewish accountant Itzak Stern  attempts to save money in his pot and pan producing factory by using cheap Jewish labor. Through the story, his motives change from earning gains to preserving life, as he uses his factory as a safe haven for Jews who otherwise would not have been saved;  such as the elderly, young, handicapped. 	<br/><br/>The film is a historically educational as it is emotionally scaring, launching the audience far past the point of tears to the edge of gut wrenching so powerful, it makes them want to vomit from the horrors committed on the innocent by fellow man. <br/><br/>I, myself, am a weeper when it comes to movies, and no matter how hard I try, can't seem to muster the strength to not cry like a ten year old girl by the end at Schindler's emotional breakdown on the footsteps of his factory; casting aside a pin that could have saved one more life, or a car that could have saved ten.<br/><br/>
The film itself is as close to perfect as a movie can get, and by no means, a casual watch."

I bought this film after seeing it, that's how good it was."
"johnny-m","Null","9","13","11 December 2003"," On the Verge of Sanity
","Spielberg's craftsmanship in direction had to wait the ultimate praise until 1993, when he produced the extraordinary epic ""Schindler's List"". It was the film that brought him the first Oscar, the first Golden Globe, the first David Lean (BAFTA), and most of the directing awards existent at that time. And yet, the king of blockbusters produced a work that was greater than him, a work that rose above humanity. Even John Paul II considered it as the best film of all time in what was to be known as The Pope's Oscars.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is the adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel about Oskar Schindler, 'a German bon vivant, speculator, charmer, and sign of contradiction', who during World War II saved the life of more than 1000 Polish Jews. It was the only important thing in the life of a small industrialist who gained popularity under the Nazis, and who disappeared into oblivion just as the war ended. 'He was fortunate', would remark his wife later on, that 'between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who had summoned forth his deeper talents'. <br/><br/>We are exposed to crude cruelty and absolute goodness, both touching each other and dismissive of any contradiction. The Black and White negative gives the great charm of ""Schindler's List"". We are transposed to the forties so elegantly, and so passionately, that we become one with the setting. We feel the coldness of the concentration camps, the smell of burning bodies, the breath of hiding children in the communal toilets. Everything is captured as if by our own eye, when we suddenly get to notice a yellowish flame of a candle, the little girl dressed in a red coat hiding from the SS. A masterful cinematography under the eye of Janusz Kaminski.<br/><br/>It is not a film you watch for the end, but one you absorb and regurgitate. The time passes as passionately as the events of the film, so boredom is the last thing on one's mind. And how can you be bored with such an impressive cast, most giving the performances of a lifetime? Liam Neeson is the perfect Herr Direktor Schindler, full of charisma, capable of cruelty, unbothered of changing women like underwear, and still a man that would not produce a gun that can shoot in his factory, that would lie, and risk his life for as many souls he could save. And then there is a young Ralph Fiennes playing the sadistic SS Commander Amon Goeth. We have a total transformation towards brutality, inhibited lust, sado-masochistic alcoholism, the complete loss of power and humanity Â all characteristics of the best supporting performance the screen has ever witnessed, probably second only to DeNiro's portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II. Ben Kingsley is the tender, honourable, devoted Itzhak Stern, Oskar's right hand throughout the entire war. Caroline Goodall and Embeth Davidz give two memorable performances as Schindler's wife, and Goeth's Jewish maid.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is one of those films that lack the ability to be summarised in a few words. It is an experience in itself. It teaches, though not dogmatically, that Heaven is relative, that beauty is salvation, that the love for life matters more than the integrity of our own souls.<br/><br/>Excellent picture of the most horrid period of the last century. Perfect for an evening of meditation. A perfect classic."

","Right after ""The fellowship of the ring"". I liked the second one more because of its story, effects, sound, acting and its a really magnificent movie. But on the other hand we have a moving, perfect movie. It presents a so important part of history, reminds us of what happened in a very emotional way, but never gets boring (sorry, but many other great movies have this HUGE ""error""). With Liam Neesons (Oscar Schindler) and  Ralph Fiennes (Amon GÃ¶th) we see two of the best performances ever (together with Marlon Brandos and Robert de Niros Godfather).<br/><br/>It has also some moments which stand out from the whole movie and will stay with me for all time (what is a proof for really good movies). Here are 2:<br/><br/>-When the first train wrongfully brings the Jews to Auschwitz and we see a colon of people walking into a building. Then the camera moves slowly to the top where we see a huge chimney, out of it coming black dust and we hear only the sound of the fire...<br/><br/>-When Schindler is ""recrouting"" people for his factory he also employs a teacher. When the teacher is sad by the Nazis he isnt ""important"" he cant understand it. He says: Since when arent literature and history important? I love this sceen and its in my opinion the best of the movie. History-we must know the history so we dont make the same mistakes as people already made (racism...). and literature- literature represents of what are humans possible. Creating something beautiful, that has not really a practical use (dont misunderstand this!) but its made for higher reasons. The Nazis dont understand higher reasons, they just want them to work, so they can win the war. There is no space for something beautiful.<br/><br/>-Finaly one of the last scenes: When Schindler is driving away at the end. He starts to compare things to human lives...: This symbol, its made of gold. For it i could save two lives!...<br/><br/>And there are much more!

"narcissadoll","10","9","13","14 September 2003"," See it for the plot, stay for the Fiennes [SPOILERS]
","I rented this movie not knowing quite what I'd be getting into, and was rewarded quite pleasantly -- I'm aware it's not the most historically accurate of films, but it is quality. The screenplay, cinematography, and acting bring a sort of grace to the film that wouldn't be evident otherwise. The chiefly black-and-white film with only the coloured accent of a girl's red coat may seem unnecessarily artsy, but I like artsy. It's a matter of opinion. Schindler's List is a depressingly beautiful film that stirs up some kind of emotion in everyone (even if that emotion happens to be hate) -- one of those films that's either loved or hated.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes's portrayal of Amon Goeth alone makes the movie worth watching time and time again. Schindler and Stern, the ""saints"" of the film, sort of fall into the shadows when Goeth is on-screen -- the man has presence. Even out of uniform, when he walks into the room one thinks ""this is the Commandant"". Fiennes's acting skills are unrivaled, owing to an amazingly three-dimensional character who has style, presence, and is smoulderingly attractive in that well-groomed sort of way.<br/><br/>It's clear that Goeth's character is a sadistic Nazi officer -- however, Spielberg and the script-writers (as well as Fiennes himself) shy away from the ""Big Bad Heartless Goon"" stereotype -- in fact, the very first scenes in which he appear make him seem rather petulant and whinging. He barely listens to Hujar's rundown of the basics of Plaszow, instead complaining, ""That's not a villa. That's a HOUSE!"" Throughout the film, he proves himself to be quite the character -- a cruel sadist, but not exactly brutal -- the way he conducts himself holds too much style and arrogance to be considered barbaric. A man who, from the mouth of Schindler himself, ""loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money -- and killing."" He smokes, he drinks, he sleeps around, he's a Nazi officer who kills people for work and for fun, oh, and on top of that he's capable of real love. Despite Goeth's sadism, the crew still persists to nudge the character shy of the ""inhuman"" stereotype with, among other things, his love for Helen Hirsch and the fact that instead of letting it redeem him, he denies it, even hurts her. He's amazingly 3D -- a second, third, fourth look at the film will only pronounce it further.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the ""I pardon you"" plot arc was by far the best addition to the film. One knew it was over when we saw Goeth's tainted hand poke the gun out the window -- unlike Schindler, Goeth isn't pointlessly redeemed by one scene. In fact, he dies loyal to Hitler's cause, and clings to his life to the point where the crate has to be *manually broken in half* by two officers. Goeth and his amazing portrayal are by far the best aspect of the movie. Even if I found the rest horrible (which I certainly didn't!), I'd watch it time and again simply for that. He was cheated out of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Oh, and Ralph Fiennes has lovely hands.<br/><br/>10/10."

The red coat of the little girl. This color adds to the sad situation the girl is in.<br/><br/>The story<br/><br/>The story is very unique and original: A German businessman is saving the lives of Jews.

This is a movie about a little known hero who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust by letting them go to work in his factory. The movie starts with a small color scene with a Jewish family chanting in Hebrew, and the rest of the movie is in black and white. Liam Neeson plays the main character, Oskar Schindler. He does quite well for such a dramatic role. The story is meaningful and touching, and of course based on real events, which gives it an amount of depth that other movies just can't equal. The sheer seriousness of the movie leaves many who see the movie slightly altered. You cannot watch this movie without it changing your life, in at least some way, however small a way it may be.

","Extremely well written drama centered around the horrors taking place within the Holocaust of World War II. But, I don't think the Holocaust is entirely the point. The point is moral choice and the ability to choose freely even when everything around you has gone to hell; and a real hell at that.<br/><br/>So many millions lost their lives in the Holocaust, and for that I pay my respects. But is a film good simply because of it's subject matter? Some people seem to think so. But I don't. I think this particular film is good because of it's pace, good writing, good acting, and good music.<br/><br/>And surprisingly Spielberg attempts to create a style of his own here; unlike his plagiarizing Kurosowa's action film techniques. It's so subtle, but at times it is highly artistic for a Hollywood director.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Amon Goeth - in probably the best performance of the entire film. It's brutal and he takes no prisoners. For which I feel he deserved the best supporting actor Oscar.<br/><br/>One nice moral point of the story is conveyed through showing the one little girl in red. In doing this the film suggests not to classify it as tragedy for the millions who died, but in terms of tragedy on purely personal levels for each of those 6 million (give or take) people. Each of them suffered, and each of them are remembered as such.<br/><br/>B+: Fans of actors, directors, or material should give it a look. It's worth your time."

","Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.  Abraham Lincoln<br/><br/>The 1993 black and white ""Schindler's List"" was directed by Steven Spielberg.  The Holocaust based movie lasts about three hours and fifteen minutes.   The movie is based on a true story about a man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi businessman. In 1939 Oskar Schindler tried to convince Jewish people to give him money to open a factory.   Coming in contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingdley), a Jewish accountant, he arranged a financial agreement with him.  Osker's idea did not really take hold until 1941 when the Jewish dollar was basically worthless. In 1941 there were several elderly people who decided to invest their money in Schindler's idea, during this time the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik was built.  Hired as cheap labor to work in the factory, the Jews soul purpose was to make pots that would be sold to the army.<br/><br/>When compiling his list of Jews he wanted for workers, Oscar had one blank space left at the bottom of the page.  Going to Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) with his list, Amon noticed that there was a blank space at the end of the last page.  Schindler wanted to add Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), Amon's maid, whom Amon had fallen in love with and not even realized it. At the end of the movie, we learn that Schindler managed to save 1,100 Jews from a cruel death.  From those 1,100 survivors, we now have 6,000 Jewish descendants. I find it interesting to watch and to learn about one of the most horrific times in history. One of the most memorable remarks for me was one made by Oskar Schindler: `This car. Why did I keep the car? Amon would've bought this car. 10 people right there. This pin, 2 people, This is gold! 2 people he could've given me 2 people at least one. One person. One person who is dead. One person I could've gotten out and I didn't!!' It seemed like the Jews were just workers.  It did not seem like he cared what happened to them. Oscar did not make any kind of emotional connection to the workers; they were just people whom he could purchase for little money.  When he made this statement and almost had a nervous breakdown, it seemed like he cared for the people and did not want to see them killed. If I had to rate this movie I would give it 4 out of 5.  One of the things that I did not like was when they would talk in German.  Unless we know how to speak German, we do not know what they are saying.  This movie gave a vivid visual of what life would have been like living under the rule of the Nazi party in the 1930s."

The colourised coat has been criticised, but there is really no other way to show the individual tragedies of the holocaust so well.  Lifetime best performances are given by all of the leads, Neeson in particular giving a magnificent portrayal of Schindler's moral conversion.  Spielberg uses the medium to the limit, to create a lasting and moving testament to those who died."

The first time I saw Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the cheek. She then said, ""thank you,"" and left. Was she or a member of her family a holocaust survivor?  I'll never know but it was great to see a movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national Holocaust museum in Washington DC.

Spielberg does an incredible job as usual using his keen sense of angles and dimensions that make every scene speak volumes. The cinematography by Janucz Kaminsky captures a lot of the feeling of the second world war, yet it didn't blow me away.<br/><br/>I found it interesting that in this film the characters seem to take a secondary role to the setting, history and true story of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson played Schindler well, but did not affect me like other characters in great films. Even Ralph Fienns character was played well but also failed to register as a memorable one.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film and the message it sends.

That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to  Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time."

","Steven Spielberg directs what is arguably considered one of his best films, the poignant and terribly depressing SCHINDLER'S LIST. Shot in stark black and white to display the gritty atmosphere of the<br/><br/>concentration camps, SCHINDLER'S LIST portrays the life of Oskar<br/><br/>Schindler, a greedy, womanizing Nazi businessman who has a change of heart after witnessing the slaughter of the Jews during the Holocaust. Playing the role of Schindler is Liam Neeson, who expresses a profound mix of feelings that his character must have endured: loyalty for his fellow Nazi comrades, and sympathy for the victims of the travesty. Quite the opposite is Ralph Finnes, who portrays the stone- cold Nazi stooge Amon Goeth. There are no feelings other than disgust and resentment towards Goeth, who callously and thoughtlessly kills every Jewish prisoner in his camps. The excessive images of carnage and gore might turn off some viewers, but they're shown to prove the horrors of the Holocaust, and the rampant, hateful image of the Nazis.

"Lee-107","10","9","13","17 March 2002"," History in Vivid Hues
","After the release of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a ""war"" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in WWI and WWII. Spielberg's purpose in 'Schindler's List' which he made five years before 'SPR' is much the same. With calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. A third World War may not have the Nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the Nazis were to the Jews. I've seen war films before(the series 'Escape from Sobibor' which I think was the most vivid), but Spielberg manages to show war in 'Schindler's List' with such a  menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. The story of Oskar Schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. But this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. Liam Neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of Schindler. His facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the Nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make Schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. Liam Neeson deserved an Academy Award that year as much as Tom Hanks for 'Philadelphia' did. Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the Oscar and give the Award to both! Because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like Neeson playing so complex a character as Oskar Schindler... Ralph Fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'The English Patient'), also gives a charged performance as Amon Goeth. His feelings for Helen, the Jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively.<br/><br/>This movie leaves you with images, you remember the camera tracking behind Neeson and into the bar, you remember him looking at the destruction of a whole town watching from a hilltop, the Nazi soldier playing Piano as people are getting killed, the doctors and nurses mercy-killing their patients so that they'd be dead before being shot by the Nazis, the little boy who saves the life of his fellow prisoners by his clever repartee to Goeth, the beautiful scene between Helen and Schindler in the wine basement, the boy running and hiding in a sewery, the girl in red escaping and hiding under her bed...images that linger long after they are seen. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is awe-inspiring! He treats us to a visual poetry in black and white, the way he did two years later in color in 'How to Make An American Quilt'. Spielberg's decision to use black and white is laudable, it suits the subject perfectly. Even where he has used color - showing the little girl's red dress, the yellow tones of the candle burning when the rabbi is chanting in Yiddish - the effect is poignant and symbolic.<br/><br/>To say that 'Schindler's List' is a memorable film would be to understate its majesty. It is an altogether breathtaking cinematic experience!"

"BadWebDiver","10","9","13","7 March 2002"," The Best Drama, with top comic asides.
","I rank this as THE best drama story ever. When it got released, I was chatting with a co-worker in the staff room who said: ""I know I should see this movie, but I don't think I could handle sitting through two hours of watching people suffer in the concentration camps."" and I totally agreed. If only we'd realized how great this film tells its story.<br/><br/>I think a scene that best demonstrates this film is the Train Rescue scene. I can just imagine a lesser production putting a heavy-handed sentimental moralistic sob speech right in the middle of it (which would have turned Oskar into a very quick martyr for sure). Instead, the characters are trying to cope with the immediate concerns of the situation. They're almost in a state of self-denial about the implications of what's going on; and it's left to the unspoken sequence at the end to bring home the emotional impact. As Alfred Hitchcock said: ""A good filmmaker doesn't tell you something, he shows you something"".<br/><br/>Another aspect that makes this film work, and one I don't think gets acknowledged too much, is it's effective use of dark humor. Examples include the Chicken Thief scene, and Oskar negotiating with the Aucshwitz Commandant. (I also reckon the sequence where Goeth tries out Oskar's ""benevolence is power"" idea, and decides it doesn't work is humorous - but that may be just me!). This film almost has the personality of a Hogan's Heroes episode - and I mean that as a sincere complement.<br/><br/>It reminds me of a Yiddish joke I heard about a Nazi sympathizer and a Jewish businessman who bump into each other on a street corner at the start of WW2. The Nazi sympathizer snaps ""Schweinhund!!!' and stalks off in a huff. The Jewish businessman brushes himself off, tips his hat, and murmurs; ""And **I'm** Goldberg.""<br/><br/>But the thing that really makes this film work is the fact that is plays on the viewer's expectations. The film is made for people who have seen WW2 documentaries, and think they know what happened. The prime example is the shower scene (which I think is more psychological than PSYCHO). This film works because it doesn't preach at you, it plays the situations and asks you to respond to them. And I think that's the secret of great storytelling."
"SJGSOCCER","Null","9","13","4 March 2002"," Hero: Schindler or Spielberg?
","First of all, for those of you that critique this film for it's cinematic purposes, you may be right in your critiques, but maybe that is not the point.  Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time, and although he is not the best, he can do something extremely important: display the purposes and stories of cinema to a generation that struggles with the concept of film for a purpose.  Although there may be better directors, thier masterpieces are pretty much wasted on the new (any my) generation.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to keep meaningfull cinema alive and in the public's eye.<br/><br/>Now on to the story, that's right the story not the movie. Obviously great acting and the reality of this tale made this movie great, but what made this a masterpiece was the plain balls shown by Spielburg to produce such harsh reality to the American, and worldwide, public.  Obviously Schindler is portrayed as a hero, even though his historical prospective was mixed between hero and a man in the right place to have a change in heart.<br/><br/>Yet I find Spielburg the real hero here.  You can not underestimate the service he has done to society by preserving this tale that reminds us how important the lessons of WWII are to our society, and how the real trajedy would be to forget.  After all, many have tried to take over the world, many wars have been wages, and millions have been wrongfully and ruthlessly killed.  The only reason for repitition is that we forget the lessons these awful spots in the history of mankind.  Truely if the moral lessons from this story, and the war are preserved, it would be an unprecidented victory for mankind.  Imagine....  John Lenon wasn't dillusional, he just knew his history.<br/><br/>Spielburg, who is a great director, I now see as a great man, for I cannot over-emphasize the importance of this tale that he re-tells. Truely, Spielburg is a hero in his choice of tale here.  One more note, the only way this movie would go to waste is if you did not see it.  This is a must-see for anyone with half a brain and even a quarter of a brain."

At the same time we have a growing number of historical revisionists trying to rewrite history. (The revisionists are a part of ""historical school"" trying to deny the existence of the holocaust.)<br/><br/>As a film this is not a perfect one. In truth it is maybe a 7/10 but what makes it important is that it makes an important moral/ethical/historical discussion easily accessible. Even the most uninterested student of history can take in the importance of remembering  just how horribly cruel we humans can be. But it also shows that we can all make a stand for what we think is right and not only for what is right for us.

","(please ignore my previous comment as it contained some errors)<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that the thousands of you out there who worship ""Saving Private Ryan"" should think twice about labeling it 'the best Spielberg film of all time'.<br/><br/>Schindler's list is by definition a masterpiece and in my opinion Spielberg's finest work to date. Unlike SPR, it focuses on true events and not only uses true locations and dates. SPR has a group of men risking their own life to save one whereas SL has one man trying to ""save the world entire"". Which one is far fetched though? Both, you would say unless you are historically inclined and know that Oscar Schindler(Neeson) did in fact exist and save more than 1100 people during the holocaust. Miller and his team, although loosely based on true characters do not depict an accurate incident in the chapter of world war 2.Thus we find Schindler's List more gratifying to watch as a film but also absorb as a historical guide.<br/><br/>The acting mind you, is exceptional in both cases and hadn't there been charming old Bennigni hopping and bouncing on the chairs of the Academy - Hanks would have certainly taken Oscar (forgive the pun) home to meet his other two brothers.<br/><br/>Schindler's list is deeply moving, and in every scene you get the feeling that you are there living in that misery and thanking your lucky stars that you have pulled through another day. What is most disturbing (and equally ingenious of Spielberg) is the way the Jews are killed. Sometimes they are lined up and shot at to save bullets, other times they are wounded and then shot in the head to make up for the 'mistake' (the scene where the woman dies in the hands of her husband spraying her blood all over him after the shot, is one of the strongest in the film). But Spielberg's genius does not emerge through the portrayal of gratuitous violence. It emerges through the way he shows what HAS to be shown. At times he creates tension by NOT showing an actual death (like the scene of the boy who couldn't clean the stains out of Goeth's bath and then gets killed by his sniper rifle) or else when you think someone is going to die - and they don't (the rabbi ) such subtleties always leave us uncertain as to what is going to take place next and always leaves us on edge.<br/><br/>The girl is the red dress contrary to what many think, is also a stroke of genius. Spielberg includes her for two reasons :<br/><br/>1) We are taken on a journey through which we can relate and through which we can feel what is happening around 'us'. Because she is marked her in red, we can easily follow her through the streets of the ghetto and not get lost in the violence which takes place around her.<br/><br/>2) She becomes a symbol of lost innocence when later in the film she is seen in a pile of corpses. Had she not been in red ( a very empathic colour) we might have not recognized her, or we would not have focused on the tragedy of her murder.<br/><br/>When the flames later on in the film are lit to celebrate the Sabbath (notice they to are coloured) we get the impression that hope is re-emerging and good will triumph in the end.<br/><br/>I particularly admire the scene where a German plays Mozart on a piano to the rhythm of stuttering guns being fired around him. This not only creates a macabre atmosphere but it also shows how cold blooded some Germans where (""is that Bach? No Mozart"").It is not surprising however that the film is praised in Germany today because most German's disassociate themselves rightly with the atrocities their ancestors committed against the six million Jews murdered.(one must notice the scene where the German soldiers decide to ""go home as men rather than murderers"", showing that not all Nazis where NAZIS, if you know what I mean.)<br/><br/>The portion in colour at the end then, always sends goose bumps down my back. Probably because we are seeing real people (the actors and actual characters still alive today (well 1993) like {amazingly enough} the girl Schindler kisses at his birthday party!) The very last scene then, where the road built from gravestones is panned on and ""Directed by Steven Spielberg"" appears, has me sighing and thinking ""wow"".<br/><br/>Add to all this a great character analysis (the typewriter's audition scene is amusing because we learn more about Schindler's character, and the scene where Fiennes says 'I forgive you' to the mirror shows us how hatable he really is) and development throughout as well as a heart pounding score by John Williams and what you've got is a film which I would surely beat myself to death for not rating it: ***** (Excellent) so I will (rate it 5 stars that is)."

","Astoundingly magnificent, meticulously great, as this is one of the greatest movie ever done. Boasting seven Academy Awards and taking home two of the major Oscars in Best Picture & Best Director respectively. Blockbuster mighty Steven Spielberg won his first of two Oscars, he will go on to win his second five years onwards for 'Saving Private Ryan', has crafted one of the most mesmerizing and importantly structured movie in the history of motion pictures. With a screenplay by Steven Zaillian which earn him an Oscar for his in-depth accuracy and depictions. With a wonderful array of art and set direction done by Allan Starski and Ewa Braun provides the perfect tones to the screenplay. John Williams harrowing original score garnered him an Oscar also, while Michael Kahn whose previous collaboration with Spielberg on 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' will also carry him home an Oscar for Best Editing. It was the flawless cinematography though by Janusz Kaminski that stands out, his first of two Oscars was well appreciated to this master, who took his game to a higher level when he won his second Oscar for his collaboration with Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. With a great performing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley just help attributes the films well rounded orchestrated extravagance. Schindler's List is the only movie from the 90's that made the top ten list by the American Film Institute"

","Few Films on this planet can meet the feeling you get from watching this film. An amazing amount of emotions run through your veins and its through this emotions we are manipulated into seeing through the eyes of Steven Spielberg's amazing vision. After seeing this film for first time I cannot tell you the amount respect I felt for Jews and my fellow person. This film makes you realise who you are and what we need to become to put our petty differences aside. Liam Neeson is magnificent, his portrayal of his character is perfect and he shows a softness and a love for people throughout the film and Liam Neeson portrays this perfectly, his character is a womaniser yet he is very aware of his faults and to the viewer its remarkable how much you can understand from him. Through the actors Steven Spielberg brings this epic to life. Ralph Fiennes one of Britain's amazing exports shows how a character can be consumed with hate and be able to survive with the things he has done. The acting in this film is creative and very very believable. Ralph represents the element of fear. As his character develops and matures we see that his character can change yet he doesn't want to. here is a amazing amount of subliminal messages which are put in this film and the viewer can identify with this everytime. Ben Kingsley is absolutely perfectly cast as he plays his role with an amazing amount of power and strength eventhough his role is supposed a very fragile person. he portrays this person perfectly, but allows the viewer to see the hope and the hate in others. This is how Spielberg not only has made the perfect film but he manipulates our fears and our truths and shows we can change, he does this in amazing fashion. 3 hours plus this film is short and its short because you cannot feel it, if you are prepared to give this film the chance it deserves. Its beautifully set and the black and white colour of the film portrays a meaning that only a viewer can interpret, Ill leave that to you."

","Steven Spielburg finally proved to everybody that he is indeed a great director.  We see here a movie that cannot be describes with simple words. What, I believe, gave this movie its soul is that fact that the director and his crew truly dedicated this remarkable feat to the victims of the darkest pages of history.   Frightening as the scenes were,  so was its message of final redemption.  Concentrating on the few who survived rather than the millions who perished was indeed a dangerous step that could have offended many.  And yet Steven pulled it off.  Through the survivors he honoured the dead.  Such complex feelings I had never felt at the movie theatres before. More words are useless."

","Arguably Spielberg's finest film. The acting, direction & scripting are all superb. Spielberg's films sometimes suffer from being overly sentimental. Here he very wisely avoids sentimentality letting the story tell itself.<br/><br/>The unusual choice of black and white film helps here -- the film would not have had the same atmosphere shot in colour.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this story are all depicted as being thoroughly human, a fact which not only underlines the horror of the Nazi regime -- these were real people, not comic-book villains -- but also underlines the film's ultimately optimistic message. Even when humanity is acting at its most beastly, some people will find it within themselves to resist this and help others escape the worst of it. As the case of Schindler shows (he started out simply exploiting the situation for his own gain) this may sometimes spring from unexpected quarters."

","Excellent film, and probably the best movie made in the 1990s. Schindler's List is a somewhat long film and definitely not something for small children to see, but it is an intense story that will still be relevant 100 years from now. Filmed in black and white (an effective idea by Spielberg), the Holocaust is show in unsanitized form, and you do not forget the images once you see them. Instead of just showing footage of the camp, Spielberg digs deeply into the minds and psyche of both the prisoners and the Nazis and we learn what their motivations and hopes are. By looking deeply at the Nazis, they come across as complex individuals and not just faceless monsters, something that had not been explored previously in other films about the Holocaust; they are still portrayed as incredibly evil as they were in history, but Spielberg does a good job of explaining their psychology to us, which adds to the understanding of the Holocaust. Not a pleasant film to watch at all, but a movie that must be seen."

But let us not forget that the holocaust happened to the jews,but many other races.<br/><br/>Now, looking at Shindler, and all the wonderfull things he has done<br/><br/>to the jews. Why would a person like him who is a briber, womanizer, and a Nazi, even care ? Is it because the sake of saving lives?, is<br/><br/>it for the sake of going against the flow or rules of the country?,is<br/><br/>it for being bold?, is it to be loved and admired by a minority?, is to be rememberd by history?, is it his duty assigned to him from god? or is it to fill a need iside himself?.

Does anyone one know why Nazis were<br/><br/>against the jews and many other races? It is an injustified and mad<br/><br/>world. In my opinion this is the movie's theme.

This film is one man's (brilliant) interpretation of actual facts. If you don't like his interpretation...rent a holocaust documentary. Also, you probably aren't aware that Spielberg couldn't put some facts in the movie because he knew the audience couldn't or wouldn't tolerate them. The scene where Ray Fiennes is standing on the balcony of his quarters and firing at things being tossed in the air by one of his soldiers is based on fact. Just not presented the way it really happened. In reality what the soldier was tossing in the air was Jewish babies. Would you have stayed in the theater after a scene like that? I doubt it. This is, without question, one of the best films ever made. I would even put it in the top five. I will admit, after 3 viewings, I probably won't be able to watch it again for years.

Two more soldiers stop in the<br/><br/>doorway and banter lightly about whose music he's playing, Bach<br/><br/>or Mozart.

","Believe it or not...I rented this movie back in 93 or 94 when it was first released, and didnt understand much of it and didnt even watch all of it. I turned it off out of boredom and confusion. At that time I knew nothing about WWII, nor did I really care.<br/><br/>Lately, I have been reading alot about WWII,Hitler,Himmler, and have been reading survivor stories from concentration camp survivors, particularly Auschwitz. I have also read many stories on the other concentration camps, and have come across many more stories of camp and ghetto survivors, and have read them all with sadness, but with interest. I have even had the pleasure of corresponding with an Auschwitz survivor and Schindlers List seems VERY realistic as to what actually happened in the camps and ghettos.<br/><br/>The movie is very easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of WWII and the holocaust. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a NAZI businessman who wants to hire some camp jews as cheap slave labor to work for him (as many many companies did back then). These people that work for him are treated with a little respect and given decent working conditions. Soon many other Jews are depserate to work for him, as they realise that could mean they will not die in the camps. Oskar starts to get extremely irritated when he learns that the evil camp SS Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) is killing many of his workers without good cause and wants the killings to stop. He then finds out that many of his workers will be sent to Auschwitz, where death is almost certain, unless something is done. He then uses his power and money to bribe many high ranking Nazi officials to bringing his workers to another country via train to have them work in a plant, where they will be saved from execution. Although he loses just about everything in the process, saving the lives of more than 1000 Jews proved worth it in the end, afterall, ""You save one life...you save the world entire."" I was surprised they even threw in a small role of the ""Angel of Death"", the evil Dr. Josef Mengele, who basically was responsible for the death of many many Jews, via the gas chamber, and his horrible, cruel,useless experiments. He was the one at Auschwitz who walked around determining who was fit to work, and who should die. If you were an older person, sick, weak,or had a small child, you were most likely sent to the gas chamber.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding movie and I'm very glad I rented it. I highly recommend it to everyone. Kudos to Steven Speilberg for this masterpiece."

","This is Spielberg's masterpiece. Most members of my family found their end in the gas-chambers and so Schindler's list was a very personal movie to me. Before seeing it, I never would have thought, that a director like Spielberg, would be able to create such feelings of total distress, desperation and hope. Only the ending with the jewish rites of the stones on the grave of Schindler was a little bit disapointing. In my oppinion nothing else than a bow to the box office.<br/><br/>Schindler's list is a great film. It shows the holocaust as it really might have happened and leaves you with a feeling of fear that it might happen again in any country, at every given time."

","Everyone who's seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 1993 film distributed by Universal, has loved it. Most even cried (myself included), due to the realistic Holocaust story. The film takes place, of course, in WW2. Starting in 1939, a German man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) comes into quick fame at a Nazi private party, using only his money and suave manor. With help from high-ranking Nazi officers, he starts up a pots and pans factory to help the Jews work. After a few years, when we have seen many Jews massacred and shot, Schindler makes a list of Jews, to be escorted to a German arms factory in his home town, and saves them from a trigger-happy, power-mad Nazi officer (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes). After YOU (who haven't seen it) see it, you will agree that it will not soon be a forgotten masterpiece."

","Schindler's List grips from it's first moments and holds audiences far beyond the final credits. Spielberg documents Otto Schindler's success in saving many Jews from the horror of Nazi death camps. More importantly the film chronicles, in horrific detail, the nightmare that Polish Jews went through.<br/><br/>Thankfully avoiding sentimentality or romanticism Spielberg takes us into the gettos and camps, dispassionately observing moments of heartbreaking tragedy, we watch horrified as a young Jewish woman, an architect, is shot for being right, or as the camp commander 'plays' with the Jewish prisoners by shooting them from his balcony.<br/><br/>Shot in stark black and white (except for the final ten minutes) the film convies beautifully the worst and the best of humanity. One exceptional touch is worth mentioning; as Schindler watches, in black & white, the Jews being hearded from the getto, he spots a little girl in a red coat, the camera follows her until she is swallowed into the teeming crowds. Later we see the red coat on a lorry of disgarded clothing, but no little girl.<br/><br/>Spielberg has never been better and no Hollywood film has captured so accurately the human tragedy of the Hollocaust."

","Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, 'here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.'<br/><br/>We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade. Still I think the concentration camp bits from Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, were better. But maybe that's faulty memory. And filming the whole thing in black and white and then turning it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was a bit stagy, although I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

This movie is THAT good.<br/><br/>Where to begin? After seeing this, and my all time favorite movie, Saving Private Ryan, I must say that Spielberg is the greatest director of our times.  Hyperbole?  Maybe, but you find me another film with the power of Schindler's list and SPR.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is an acting god.  Only he could've pulled this transformation off without making it seem hokey.  I guess that's what made all the performances in this film so great, from Neeson, Kingsley, and Feinnes down to the slightest extra, was the lack of all the acting flourishes; all the melodramatic conventions that might have gotten an easier emotional payoff, but would have cheapened the movie.  Take Feinnes.  His character is evil personified, Feinnes is never over the top.  The cold, emotionless look in his eyes as he kills people is chilling enough.  And when an element of humanity slips into his character, Feinnes makes it believable, not added in.  His character isn't a stock villain.<br/><br/>I'm probably running out of room.  Let me just say this film pulls no punches.

","This movies is one of the most emotionally shattering and ultimately uplifting movies ever made. Ther story of one man who begins the movie eager to make a profit from the slave labor of the Jews, and ends it by sacrificing everything to save them. Neeson's central performance is solid, if unspectacular - he is overshadowed by Fiennes, who shows a frightening ability to capture unspectacular and always human face of evil - but his somewhat stolid performance may simply reflect a trait that allowed Schindler to dupe the Nazis. Kingsley, in the other central role, tends to slide into the background.<br/><br/>The decision to shoot in black and white - as a confession, I love the look and texture of black and white - was perfect. Janusz Kaminski's black and white cinematography is a brilliant example of why B&W is superior to color in any film with an intimate feel or that deals with moral ambiguity. <br/><br/>The trouble I have with the movie was - SPOILER - the two scenes at the end; one with Schindler breaking down when the Jews that he worked to save go free, and he weeps over the lives he could have saved with his car, or his ring, or his suit, and the pebble scene at the end. It felt like a return to the mawkish sentimentality of earlier Spielberg movies: a blatant attempt at jerking tears from me, which I resent all the more because it worked, I suppose.<br/><br/>If Spielberg could have resisted the emotional hammer on this ine, it would have been a true classic."

","Schindler's List was Spielberg's confirmation as one of America's best storytellers. Despite Spielberg's extraordinary body of work, straight drama was one of his shall we say, less successful line of storytelling. Yes, The Color Purple was a fine film, but at times it showed Spielberg's desire to overendow the viewer with his good intentions. This was also the case with his Empire of the sun.<br/><br/>Spielberg doesn't seem to believe in evil, unless it is cardbox evil as in Raiders... So, how do you tell a story about evil without going overboard and try to usurp the viewers with your statement?<br/><br/>Spielberg used the best way of storytelling. He based his film on characters and not around scenes or plotlines. His characters flourish as the story enfolds them. Yet on two occasions in the film Spielberg forgets about his storyline and inserts two scenes to portray the real persona of his story. First, you have a scene where Ralph Fiennes shows his affection for his young housemaid. Obviously Spielberg's intent was to show us the nature of this character. Unfortunatly this doesn't work, because from our own backround and the story itself, we know the nature of that character and this scene breaks the rhythm and the credibility of his story. The second scene is the end, where cast and crew present their respect to the dead. This is all nice and well, but it makes you realize that you've been watching a piece of fiction and therefore the movie loses some of it's unbearable strength.<br/><br/>Visualy the film is Spielberg's best and once again he states himself as an extraordinary actors director.

"nunculus","Null","9","13","27 October 1999"," The lost world
","The critic Terrence Rafferty put it best: SCHINDLER'S LIST has a primal emotional power that hasn't been felt since silent film.<br/><br/>
Those who prefer the post-structuralist beard-scratching of Claude Lanzmann's unbearable SHOAH to this movie are denying the potency of great populist art. Like Dickens and Griffith, Spielberg uses melodramatic techniques to make ideas palpable to a mass audience. In America at least, public perception of the Holocaust will be forever changed. You can carp that the audience's experience is synthetic, Disneyish, but is a fictional re-experiencing of these events worse than an abstract and remote noodling over them? Is it worse to represent the Holocaust in fiction than to leave it as a concept--and, as history bears out, a deniable one?<br/><br/>As a work of filmmaking, it ranks with the greatest. In LIST, Spielberg arrives at a point--shoulder to shoulder with Scorsese --as the most dexterous and gifted of filmmakers working today. Scene after scene displays an offhand, unplanned-feeling mastery of the medium that staggers the imagination in its power. The cumulative effect--as in the best of Spielberg's earlier work--is of a long and sustained, almost unbearable cry of loss. Intellectuals have come to so despise Steven Spielberg, the mogul of Century City, that they have become blind to Spielberg the craftsman and artist. (Spielberg's smarm while receiving his first Academy Award didn't help this perception.) SCHINDLER'S LIST is the only film I've seen in my adult life where the screen disappeared; I was no longer aware of the construction of the movie and entered into it as spontaneously as a child. Surely Spielberg will never again find material that engages him so profoundly. But this film, far dwarfing its aspiring successor SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, places Spielberg at the first rank of film artists."

","Don't get me wrong, this was a magnificent film, which portrays an accurate picture of the horror and inhumanity of Hitler's Germany.  However, Spielberg still does not make the film he should have made.  Granted Schindler was a hero and a legend for his humanity, although his motives at first were those of profit. Eventually he found his own humanity and redemption.  As a Jewish director Spielberg felt obligated to make a Holocaust film.  Why he didn't make a film focusing on one or more Jewish families struggling to survive is beyond me.  As the son of Holocaust survivors I have heard first-hand accounts of the unique struggles and tortures endured, and every story I've heard is touching, horrifying and wrenching.  One day a powerful Hollywood director is going to make a real Holocaust film.  It may not be Spielberg, but someone will.  It is also possible that Schindler's List is the closest thing Hollywood will permit to portraying the graphic horror of the Holocaust.  I still remain hopeful. Steven Spielberg is one of the most amazing directors ever and deserves a great deal of credit."

Very few directors will ever reach this standard.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfect. Neeson plays Schindler with just enough power. We know this man is special but Neeson doesn't play him like a legend. Fiennes is evil but humane. Kingsley gives a very touching performance as the only Jew Schindler actually gets to know.<br/><br/>But this is Spielberg's film. His heart is in every shot. He knows how important a film about the holocaust is to the Jewish people and he doesn't let them down. A Jew himself, he associates with them and delivers one of the greatest movies ever made."

Steven Spielberg has made the most accurate and haunting portrait of the Holocost ever.  I am glad that I had the chance to see this movie, but I wish that I never would have needed to.  This movie shows what high school students should know about that horrid event in world history, but don't. The hardest scene, in particular, for me to watch was when Schindler walked out into the street and it looked as though it was snowing.  Upon closer inspection, it isn't snow: it's ash from the people who were being incinerated.  That one scene was the hardest for me to watch.  It is a remarkable story that should be told, and was definately the best movie of 1993. I am glad the Steven Spielberg made this, and I am also glad the schools in my district are now showing us ""Schindler's List"".  It should have been made, for the people who died in the holocost, for people who lived through it, and for people who do not even know what it was."

"Chuck-149","10","9","13","8 September 1999"," By far Spielberg's best movie.
","""Schindler's list"" ranks in two categories of films: The best movies in cinema history as well as in that category of movies whose subject is what people want to see transfered to the screen.  What I mean by that is this: The story of ""Schindler's list"" is how a Nazi works against the rest of the Nazis by making sure that all the Jewish people he can find will not be killed in concentration camps but work in his factory instead.  In other words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie.  And it's great.<br/><br/>  Liam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII.  Ben Kingsley is very good as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the factory.  However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful.  His role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a great job at it.  In fact, I believe he should have won best supporting-actor in ""Schindler's list"".<br/><br/>  Moving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten list.  It also has the great advantage of having been directed by another one of the masters, Steven Spielberg.  You've got to see it."

It inspired me to apply (as a mature age student) to University to study History, in order to try and understand this period in human history.<br/><br/>I wasn't interested in the Holocaust when I watched it - I was more interested in Liam Neeson. But since then I have made an effort to try and understand it from the three different angles - the Nazis, the Jews, and the Rest of the World.<br/><br/>Awake your social conscience and watch this movie. If you've already watched it and can't understand what I'm saying, then read some accounts of the Holocaust - try 'The Diary of Anne Frank' - then watch it again.<br/><br/>It has had a profound effect on how I view and judge people."
"Spleen","10","9","13","7 September 1999"," Appreciate it - but do so for the right reasons
","Steven Spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film.  It's no more `about' the holocaust than it's `about' Eastern Europe.  It's about Oscar Schindler.  More to the point: it's about an amoral small-time capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances mould him into a hero.  It's about a man led to the path of morality as much by his belly as by his heart.  It's a study in the banality of goodness.  I don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no better way of putting it.<br/><br/>It's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. `Schindler's List' is not a lesson about the what happened to European Jews under Nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson.  It's fiction.  I'm not, of course, saying that it's false - I gather most of it is true.  Nor am I saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. When Superman saves a thousand people we can always say, `That's all very well, but I can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway, Superman is supernaturally virtuous.'  When someone as flawed as Oscar Schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make excuses.<br/><br/>There's a good story here.  Many people do some of their best work in telling it.  I don't think that Neeson, Fiennes or Spielberg have ever performed better than they do here, and John Williams writes fine music in an understated style he hasn't used for a while.  But it's really the story that makes the movie.  Spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen.  Probably this film has been praised a little more than it deserves.  Oh, well.  Excess praise will be washed away with time.<br/><br/>One minor point: when the book was first published in Australia, it was called `Schindler's Ark'.  `Schindler's List' is the (inferior) American title.  Sadly, after the success of the film the book was called `Schindler's List' even here.  Spielberg could have called his film `Schindler's Monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have dutifully re-named the book.  It's a pity he didn't use his power to restore the original title."

","I thought I would watch the movie again before I reviewed it, which is easy since I have it on tape. I have seen this movie a number of times and it still impresses me. Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's most extraordinary movie. It's the true story of Oskar Schindler a business man who saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It won 7 Academy Awards inaddition to a number of other awards including the Director's Guild. The Cinematography for this movie was brilliantly done, it was truly haunting. This film had some of the best performances I have seen. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent acting job when took on the character Amon Goeth. Amon a man who likes his Jewish maid a little too much, he seems to be quite disturbed and also is quite brutal. Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed. The unearthing of the bodies scene is haunting and disturbing. The ending of this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime. An extraordinary film with a compelling story and stunning score. 10/10 for this masterpiece. Number 9 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies."

This isn't a movie you want to see over and over again, but you'll want to see it at least once.<br/><br/>The dark, much talked-about cinematography and the Itzhak Perlman's sublime violin work are so, so sad. Ralph Fiennes is the very personification of human evil; Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is an opportunistic war profiteer. He doesn't have any grand epiphany or sympathy for the Jews. He just knows somewhere that he has to help how he can - despite his fear and greed.<br/><br/>Like Saving Private Ryan, however, the core of the movie's power is the documentary-like scenes that bring home the atrocities we've heard about our whole lives, but never maybe never FELT like this."

But of course, I don't have any choice in the matter, because it's simply too disturbing to never see again.  I don't believe there is any finer monument to the horrors of the Holocaust than Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List.""  People may tell us of the horrors, of the concentration camps, of the deaths, but this film puts us there, among the survivors.<br/><br/>This is, of course, Spielberg's crowning achievement.  As far as I am concerned, there is no other film ever made anywhere that has the power and emotion of ""Schindler's List,"" least of all the technical expertise that is so evident here.  For instance, Janusz Kaminski's frenetic camera work whips us through the ghettos in such a way that we can not help but be terrified, and yet is calm enough to let us catch a breath, cry a tear.  This is also, in my opinion, John Williams' finest score.  It is so sparse, so beautiful. For any classical music fans, I can only compare this score to Henryk Gorecki's Third Symphony, ""A Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.""  But I'm getting off the topic.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless, with performances from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes.  And, of course Steven Zaillian's moving script that puts us everywhere, from the heart of the horror to the outskirts of it.<br/><br/>Let me go back to what I said at the beginning of this review.  I do not like ""Schindler's List.""  I love it.  And yet, I don't love it quite it the way that I love any other film.  What I can do is recommend it without reservation to anybody who has never seen it.  There is no better film than this.  Period.<br/><br/>Of special note, Spielberg apparently donated a copy of this film to every American high school.  I can not thank him enough for that, because it was in class that I first saw ""Schindler's List.""  I just pray that others have been as affected by it as I have.<br/><br/>**** out of ****."

","""Schindler's List"" is easily one of the greatest films ever made.  The technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and displayed in its nakedness like it is here.  Steven Spielberg richly deserves life-long accolades for creating this film.  His choice of b&w cinematography is brilliant.  Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are all fully realized.  Spielberg's epic is a far cry from normal Hollywood movie making and that unto itself is an amazing accomplishment for the misguided 90s filmmakers.<br/><br/>Easily, the greatest creative element for this film is Ralph Fiennes. Without his central protagonistic presence, ""Schindler's List"" would certainly be a flawed examination of the Holocaust.  Instead, Fiennes' character displays uncontrollable impulsive fits of rage and unpredictability which epitomizes the Nazi aura.  Fiennes' performance is the best in recent years, and his finely drawn and provocative character richly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest ever drawn up!<br/><br/>True to life affecting drama has never been better and it seems incomprehensible to expect a motion picture of this magnitude and quality to appear again in our lifetimes."

"DButcher","10","9","13","7 July 1999"," Transcendental Film-making
","Back in December 1993, I drove into Kansas City to view Schindler's List at a midnight showing. The film, which dealt with something as simple as human compassion in a time when compassion was far from simple was truly one of the most magnificent pieces of film-making I had ever seen. But as truly moving as the film was, my distinct memories come after the film, at 4 AM on a Wednesday, driving home through the Plaza Area of KC. Anyone who has ever been to Kansas City knows the beauty of the Plaza Lights. With nobody else on the road, with the frost glazing the streets, the stillness of the moment still haunts me. I know that if it were any other Wednesday morning, I perhaps would not have appreciated that beauty quite so much as that particular Wednesday. The real power of Schindler's List and its simple story of a man who did the right thing at a time when there was madness all around him is not just one of the most important films historically, not just one of the great films artistically, not just one of the most powerful films emotionally, but it stands as an achievement that transforms the very way you see the world. I know that watching this film on video, picked-up at the video store on some rather ordinary Wednesday cannot really convey as much power as it did to me on that winter night 5 years ago. Watching it on video is still more moving than many other films that could never even imagine itself to aim so high. But the real magic for me is that this one of the films that made me realize the power that comes through in the dark of a theater, or through the dark of night."

Why God gave us the capacity to experience these heinous emotions and desires is beyond me. But for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the darkest periods in our existence as human beings.  There certainly are other dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous.  And before I saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a people.  And from a man that gave us films like Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, many may have not expected to see a masterpiece like this. But no one should ever be surprised at what Spielberg can accompish.<br/><br/>Schindler's List gives you the horror right in your mind.  It paints pictures in front of you and you cringe with every stroke of cinematic genius that is presented before you.  I felt sad and disgusted to watch the horrors before me.  It made me sick to see that humans could be so cruel. Do we not have any compassion towards the living?  Apparently not.  And this film shows that, along with Mississippi Burning, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and even pictures like Boyz N The Hood, we are a sad creation and one that whoever is the supreme ruler of us has got to be angry at the way we turned out.<br/><br/>This is one of the most important films ever made and it also one of the most disturbing.

It will provoke that kind of reaction from most everybody.<br/><br/>As important and as brilliant of a film as this is ( I rate it a ten out of ten ) I only saw it once at the theater and then only through the most persistant of begging, once more on video four years later.  It disturbed me too much.  The images were too real for me and it gave me nightmares for a few days later.  What Spielberg has done here is not only make an important film, he has taken a subject that causes so many people pain and he has opened it up for the rest of us to understand.  And for that, no Oscar can ever repay him for his contribution to society.  I know I am a changed person because of this film.  And to me, Saving Private Ryan could have almost been an unofficial sequel to Schindler's List.  They both have opened my eyes to the horrors that mankind has caused.<br/><br/>Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are proof that Speilberg is the king of Hollywood.

He imprinted in our brains a great lesson of history, maybe one the most remarkable and... shocking.

"zkonedog","10","10","15","7 March 2017"," The Importance Of One Man
","When watching a movie like ""Schindler's List"", there are so many ways that it can be appreciated. It's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once. For me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Schindler's List"" focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high- ranking member of the Nazi party during World War II. When the German Nazis invade Poland and begin rounding up Jews into ghettos, Schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using Jewish labor. While raking in the dough on the backs of the Jews, however, Schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the Nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps. Thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality.<br/><br/>As a history-based epic, ""Schindler's List"" manages to capture the essence of the moment AND yet still be subtle about it at the same time. Director Steven Spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism. The acting performance from Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi Commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps. Essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to American high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust.<br/><br/>Perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of Mr. Schindler. He starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it. To me, that was the most endearing message that I took from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""Schindler's List"" to be a masterpiece of American cinema (although, what should I have expected from Mr. Spielberg?!). It is compelling on both a historic and personal level simultaneously. Even though it is quite long, there are very few wasted moments."

Meanwhile, ethnic German businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) had also arrived at the Krakow Ghetto, hoping to make a fortune as a war profiteer.<br/><br/>Bribing high-ranking officials to build a factory for the production of army mess kits, having a Polish Jew in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who is an official from the Krakow's Jewish Council as his accountant and administrator in his factory. Stern would also be credited for typing the list of names eventually famously known as Schindler's list, the Jews who would come to survive the Holocaust because of his boss Oskar Schindler. Schindler had originally hired Polish Jews instead of Polish Catholics because of cheap labour, but he soon realises the horror of what some of his workers were going through. It is in view of SS Lieutenant Amon GÃ¶th (Ralph Finnes), who at the concentration camp, oversaw the massacre (which eventually came to be known as the Operation Reinhard in KrakÃ³w) where those who were protesting or appeared uncooperative were to be shot.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler who saw what was going on from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, become increasingly affected by those whom he call 'his' workers. Mindful of his friendship with GÃ¶th, Schindler brides him to build a sub-camp for his workers in order to prevent any more random execution.<br/><br/>There is a reason why Oskar Schindler will always be celebrated for what he did for the Jews he had managed to save during the Second World War, despite the various faults he had as a person. Acclaimed film director Steven Spielberg, who based the film on the novel 'Schindler's Ark' written by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally (which the inspiration for the work in Poldek Pfefferberg, who is one of the many Schindler Jews was the one who decided to bring the story of Oskar Schindler to the wider audience), has make the film such that we are being transported back to the actual war years itself with the black-and-white images. That is with the exception of the opening sequence and what happens after the war ended where it is in colour.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson played well in his role of Schindler, while Ralph Finnes perfected the role of SS Lieutenant Amon GÃ¶th, to the extent it was rather convincingly that it could be really GÃ¶th himself.<br/><br/>While it is a film depicting the horrors of the war and how one ethnic German decided to go all out to save as much as he could despite his Nazi connections, it is also a film which is still relevant in the times we are living in apart from the fact that the Holocaust denial is still alive in certain quarters and neo-Nazism has not really gone away."

","I just saw this film for the first time and I have never felt so touched by any other movie, and I'm only 15. It was so sad and heartbreaking when you see all the cruel things the Jews had to go through, but at the same time very uplifting when you see how far one man is willing to go to save these Jews. Especially when you see how he cries his heart out when he learns that he could have saved one more life by putting her name on the list (the maid/servant that Goethe liked, I think?) I had previously seen a few Holocaust movies, particularly liking The Pianist, but Schindler's List has much more of an emotional depth and impact on you when you watch it. For instance, when the two guards took away the old man with one arm, I knew he would be shot, but even when I saw it, I was still horrified as if I didn't know. To think that this really happened, and for so long, makes me believe that the only possible reason God allowed this to happen, is to show us good people how to defeat true evil and to make sure that it never happens again. I liked the color scheme, especially with the girl in the red coat. I saw her just almost waltzing through the liquidation, minding her own business, and the whole time I was thinking, ""How is she doing this? Is she even real? Or is she just a figment of Schindler's imagination meant to represent how the Jews will persevere through all this horror?"" I thought at first that Schindler looked like sorta a bad guy: how all he was concerned with was making money rather than saving lives. But after seeing all the burning bodies being carted out, he had the ever-important pang of conscience. The rest is history. I believe that Spielberg has created something that can never be matched in ours or any lifetime. I wish I could personally meet him and shake his hand and say, ""Thank you for making Schindler's List."" It's a real eye opener into human perseverance, be it in trying to survive (Jews) or in trying to save as many lives as possible (Schindler). This is one instance where the movie was FAR FAR better than the book, which I have read and will re-read. That 3 hours it took to witness flew right by for me, and I will be forever happy that I took those 3 hours to see it. Steven Spielberg will forever more be remembered for some of his other masterpieces like ""ET"" and ""Jaws"", but I will always remember him for Schindler's List."

","Everyone knows the story of The Holocaust.  Very few, including myself, had such intimate, detailed imagery to deal with.  From Issac Stern's masterful rendering of John Williams' opening until the very end I was unable to tear my eyes from the screen, much as I wanted to.  This film demands, in the name of those living and dead, that you watch, that you have this monstrous example of human depravity burned into your very soul.  This film also does something wonderful; it gives hope.  Amidst the human wasteland we find a small, inextinguishable flame of decency and justice survive that evil wind's every attempt to snuff it out. I came away from this film exhausted and bewildered.  Every emotion I possess, vying for dominance, assailed me in a blinding white noise. Should I rage at the evil, the stupidity, the casual indifference?  Should I weep for the suffering and loss?  Should I rejoice that, ultimately, a choice for right and good was made?  Eventually, I recognized that of course I must do all these things and more.  I must insist that every one I meet see this film that reminds us of our obligation to history and to each other.  I must speak out when I see injustice being committed.  And I must never, never forget."
"krumski","7","10","15","15 June 2003"," Some thoughts
","SPOILERS WITHIN. Don't read unless you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>At this point, almost a decade after its release, Schindler's List is what it is: it has become a cultural touchstone, and its reputation rightfully precedes it. It certainly has an aura and a cachet that goes beyond any single endeavor to praise or criticize it; therefore, I plan to do neither, but merely to share some of the thoughts I had while watching it. Some will be positive, others more negative - but none of it is meant to (or will be able to) diminish what Spielberg has achieved with this movie.<br/><br/>First off, I must say that all the scenes with Schindler himself I found riveting: Liam Neeson - not an actor I usually warm up to very well - was absolutely mesmerizing: he gave the character an authority and a charisma that was totally captivating, while still preserving the basic enigmatic nature of the man. (He reminded me again and again of a young Richard Burton when he was at the top of his game.) The tug-of-war of conscience in the scenes between him and Stern (Ben Kingsley, underplaying nicely) were, though a bit schematic and obvious, nonetheless powerful - no doubt because of the enormity of the topic at hand. Holocaust movies, of course, can very easily get a free pass because of that very enormity, and Schindler's List is no exception: scenes that might otherwise have seemed simplistic or overplayed are imbued with power because of the context in which they occur.<br/><br/>One scene that stuck out for me, though - and not necessarily in a good way - was the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. It is of course a tour-de-force of filmmaking and technical prowess (a foreshadowing, say, of the Normandy Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan), but its reason for being I found suspect. Ostensibly - on the level of the story, anyway - it was there to bring Schindler face to face with the horror and waste of the Nazi policy toward the Jews, and so to suggest a reason why he converted from shameless profiteer and exploiter to Jewish savior.<br/><br/>Except, as such a scene, it doesn't quite wash. Schindler indeed is displayed as witnessing the liquidation, but from his vantage point - a hill overlooking the ghetto - he would in no way have been able to see the scene in the detail, and in all the different locations, that the movie makes us privy to. No, this scene is designed not to be played before Schindler, but to be played before us, the moviegoers.<br/><br/>So why does that bother me? Well, it seems to me a break in form. A movie that had been, up until that time, focusing narrowly on one man, suddenly opens up to wanting to display the panoply of characters and lives that were directly affected by the Holocaust. Problem is, by adopting such a large-scale approach, no one individual (or family) is able to claim our full attention, and so Spielberg becomes guilty in his own way of `ghetto'-izing the Jews - that is, grouping them together facelessly as victims, rather than showcasing any of their dignity or humanity as individuals.<br/><br/>My bias, I suppose, in films dealing with the Holocaust, is that the enormity of it is just lost on most of us. It's impossible - unless we lived and survived through it - to do justice to both its scale and its horror. Therefore, a film-maker shouldn't try. Not that Holocaust-themed films shouldn't be made; it's just that, to be honest and effective (not necessarily the same thing - particularly when the artist is Spielberg) they should focus themselves on a small *microcosm* of it - a family, a person, a survivor - and attempt to *SUGGEST* the full horrors, through the particulars of that person's story. Actually trying to show those horrors outright (to put us, as it were, `inside' the Holocaust) is frankly impossible, and I think Spielberg's ambitions to do so, through this liquidation scene and other similar ones in the movie - are, though perhaps high-minded, ultimately wrong-headed.<br/><br/>But, as I say, when he's focused narrowly on Schindler himself, the film works wonderfully - and is far more able, in my opinion, to get across the horror and waste of the Holocaust than when it's concentrating on its big (but impersonal) `herd up the Jews' scenes. The making up of the list itself is extremely powerful in this regard: `More names! More names!' Schindler demands, and his mania in doing so tells us all we need to know about the absolute desperation of the times (particularly as it comes from a formerly amoral man only interested in himself).<br/><br/>And as such, I must take exception to all those (and there are many) who find the last scene - Schindler's breakdown - to be completely maudlin and ill-advised, a detriment to an otherwise marvelous motion picture. To me, it was the best scene in the movie. For, in the character's hysterical insistence that he `could have done more' - coming on the heels of all the people we saw that he *DID* save - it serves to remind the audience - in absolutely unambiguous terms - that what Oskar Schindler did, though momentous, wasn't'even a drop in the bucket compared to the number of lives taken and/or disrupted by the Holocaust. That this man - driven to bankruptcy and ruin by his (eventual) unceasing efforts to save the Jews - could claim that he `didn't do enough,' only shows how much there was to do, and how much of it was left undone. That, to me, is the kind of moment that brings home the enormity of the Holocaust - not the use of hundreds of extras to be herded onto trains and into showers. We can tell ourselves (and be right) that those scenes are fake (staged for the movie). The point made through Schindler's breakdown at the end is the deepest kind of truth - the kind that never should be forgotten or cast aside."

","This film, is without a doubt, Spielberg's best work to date.  This film captures the horrors of war like no other film before it has.  The fact that is centers around the suffering of civilians rather than the military singles this film out from others in the genre.<br/><br/>Filming it in black and white was ingenius for several reasons.  First, it makes the film look much like a documentary, thus increasing the realism, and at the same time creating more sympathy for the people in these dire situations.  Secondly, I believe the film would be far too graphic in full color.  I was also very impressed with the unique use of color in a select few scenes (the little girl with the red coat).<br/><br/>I must admit that this is one of only a handful of movies (and when I say handful, I mean 2 or 3) that actually brought tears to my eyes.  This film gripped me like no other.  I recommend this movie to anyone who would like to see a reasonably accurate, but not overly graphic depiction of life in World War II Poland.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This film is easily my favourite ever. It's unbelievably well acted, the backdrops are flawless and I don't think that the cast could have been any better. Also, I think that this film, though criticised for being seemingly ""historically inaccurate"", comes closest to depicting the Holocaust as it most likely was. All the rushes of emotion that come to you are powerful indeed. The fear, horror and anger leave you shocked at what that generation had to go through, and happy and relieved that nothing of that caliber has yet to befall our generation. I think even that it can affect the actors, as well as the audience, not unlike ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a more recent film. I have heard Ralph Fiennes say that Amon Goeth was and most likely will be the most difficult role he's ever had to play, simply because of the complexity of the character. Liam Neeson is also brilliant, and I think his character best sums up the majority of Germans at the time: taking advantage of the situation, because they don't know what's going on. Then they find out, and views undergo complete modification. My overwhelming view is that the movie is a wonderful commentary, full of sophisticated symbolism, yet isn't over the head of an average viewer. A work of art."

It shows how the one man can make a difference.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler(Wonderful performance by Liam Neeson)is not a saint: He is a lousy husband, a womanizer, drinks too much, and has no luck in business. Poland provides the stuff of his dreams. He opens a business and makes money, he has a nice house, nice clothes and money. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of the Jews of Poland. He uses their labor (They don't get paid for the work they do for him) and their homes(A Jewish couple was forced to leave their home, which Schindler eventually takes).<br/><br/>Amon Goeth (A Chilling Ralph Fienes)arrives to create a forced labor camp outside Krakow and proceeds to ""liquidate"" the ghetto. This part of the film is incredibly brutal: men, women and children are shot to death throughout the ghetto as a little girl in red (Equally chilling, since the film is in black & white)wanders through the horror. <br/><br/>What Schindler does at this point in time, watching the little girl in red, is to become a hero. He begins to use his wealth and power to save the Jews that are working for him. However, when the labor camp is closed and the Jews are marked for Auschwitz, he comes up with a plan: Buy the workers. With the help of his accountant Stern (Brilliantly played by Ben Kingsley), he creates a list of the workers, a list of people to be saved from the gas chambers of Auschwitz. <br/><br/>From start to finish, this film is a history lesson. You see the good the can happen (The change in Oskar), as well as the evil that men do (Goeth's morning ""target practice"" on the labor camp workers is horrifying). Spielberg created a masterpiece in film making, as well as an object history lesson of the Holocaust. Have the Kleenex at hand whenever you watch this film."

Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an influential business man in the Nazi party, looking to make an enormous profit due to the was.  Schindler brings several hundred Jews onto his work crew and starts manufacturing.  Schindler runs into trouble a few times with keeping his work crew from being killed by Nazi rule and their general way of running things.

The focus of the movie revolves around Schindler's relationship with his workers and their struggle through the war.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a black and white movie which turns a lot of people off, however it was a wonderful concept that was executed very well.  Schindler's List made more of an impact being in black and white.  It gave the movie more of a sense of actually being involved in the war era.  Spielberg did a good job at directing this movie, but could have altered a few things to make the movie less awkward and more focused.  For instance, there were a few shots of nudity that were completely unnecessary and could have been avoided and modified and still effectively portray the concept being presented.  The nudity with a few individual lovers of Nazi members, for this movie, took the film from an engaging story with meaning to a meaningless question and cheap entertainment thrown in to captivate the audience.  In my opinion the film did not need to be ""perked up"" to keep the audience awake.  However, there was mass nudity during a few scenes, both male and female, which I felt was completely necessary and helped in presenting a more real illustration of the camps the jews were forced to dwell in.  Schindler's List was an excellent film that did an extraordinary job at portraying the Jewish struggle and Nazi politics during World War II."

Of all, Ben Kingsley was most definetely the best, but great performances by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as well. John William's score was the most masterful, powerful, and beautiful I have ever heard. Normally most Nazi movies tend to focus on one family surviving, and although that isn't bad, Schindler's List is much better. It shows the Holocaust as it really was. I hear people criticize Spielberg because he showed full nudity of both sexes, and many acts of violence, and I say, shut up. Now that isn't to say that this is a movie for small children.

","There has been a long-standing debate whether the holocaust could ever be captured in a meaningful way by art. Can an esthetic form be used to describe its antithesis? What should be the purpose of an artistic rendering? Spielberg has proven that the artist can convey the impact of this event that leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. By selecting an isolated event, the fate of the 1,000 Schindler Jews, Spielberg allows an oblique glance at the vast enterprise of this historically unique genocide. The understated tone of the picture and the brief allusions to the well-known horrors of the time,while concentrating on a small group of protagonists allows the viewer's imagination and emotions to experience the atmosphere of the time in a profound way. The most gripping scene is the evacuation of the Krakow ghetto. During the mayhem of soldiers, gunfire, attack dogs and terrified victims a small girl walks through the black and white scene in a spot of color. Six million victims are not fathomable, but one little girl can represent them all. Spielberg has shown the power of art to describe the indescribable."

Set in the Nazi German concentration camps of World War II, filled with thousands of innocent Jewish people, where greedy, unsuccessful businessman Oskar Schindler (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Liam Neeson) hoping to make profit from the Jewish slave labour manufacturing. Later we are introduced to one of the lead villains, overseeing the progress of the camp, the evil Amon Goeth (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes). As time goes by, more and more Jews are trying to escape capture, torture and death by the Nazis, Oskar sees how much pain and suffering these innocent souls are going through, and starts having changes in heart. So with the help of friend and almost colleague Itzhak Stern (BAFTA nominated Sir Ben Kingsley) they begin to type a list (hence the title) for all the Jews he can afford to buy and take away to another camp for a new manufacturing business. He manages to ""evacuate"" approximately 1,100 victims, and he becomes the unlikely hero (after not doing much earlier) by releasing all of them. Also starring Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler, Jonathan Sagall as Poldek Pfefferberg, Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch and Malgoscha Gebel as Victoria Klonowska. There are horrific and memorable moments of realistic suffering, torture and death, a hideous real villain and a great unlikely real hero, moments of colour (i.e. the beginning, the girl with the red coat, and the ending) and a teary ending with many survivors paying their respects at Schindler's grave.

This movie is source of a special experience. And the causes are numerous:<br/><br/>1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.<br/><br/>2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience. So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only clichÃ©. The bad Nazi, cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After ""The Night of the Generals"" this character type is absurd.<br/><br/>3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out of any description's form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson's acting; the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his mission.<br/><br/>4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching. His character is heard of a miracle and the tension, fear, expectation and force of gestures, the short words and the look transforms Itzhak Stern in conscience of fight for some people for who to survive is fragile dream.<br/><br/>5} The option for monochrome image is essence of its perfect beauty. The mixture between ashes and human ash, between lead, tension and free cruelty of irrational monstrosity , plans of escape and lies gives form of a wold's fragile definition .<br/><br/>6} It is a great masterpiece for the sensitivity of looking. The film is a remember and a decent homage for a special hero and for his strange war. But not story is important. The only virtue, the real virtue is the image of story teller's spirit reflected in each syllable of tale."
"FilmSnobby","3","93","200","2 March 2004"," Can we criticize this movie now?
","I mean, has enough time passed?  Or has the release of  *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?<br/><br/>Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama.  I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie.  Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable.  Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject:  Francesco Rosi's  *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras'  *Amen"".  Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama.  (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.)  For that matter, Polanski's  *The Pianist*  gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with:  a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler  (Liam Neeson)  who, despite all the war-profiteering  (read:  ""initiative""), turns out to have a heart of gold.  Or marshmallow mush.  Please don't bother pointing out that this is a ""true story"":  those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for  ""dramatic license"".  The biggest example of this is the  ""villain""  of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth  (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance).  The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning:  he's crazy as a loon.  So much for the  ""banality of evil"":  instead, we get, via Fiennes'  Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity.  Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite  ""Hath not a Jew eyes""  speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes.  Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard  ""Lifetime Channel"" movie about an abusive husband.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time:  even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in  *Schindler's List*  are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving ""Schindler Jews""  appear  (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them.  They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave.  Moving stuff.  Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention.  And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question:  this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed.  The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed  *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz:  it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.<br/><br/>But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre.  It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders:  ""Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today.""  Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance?  You decide."
"aghaghia","Null","17","30","31 January 2007"," this picture is the image of impression.
","This is also one of those movies that can turn into your number one movie. The whole story (according to the footage left by Spielberg as the essential historical documents) is based upon a load of facts that has been discovered by an Australian years after Schindler's accusation of numerous crimes. It's a story of a man making sacrifices to keep more and more Jews alive sometimes by making some profit out of them and sometimes not. <br/><br/>First thing is to intrude the Nazi party by wealth and personal charm techniques and he did well. Then the liquidation takes place little by little when he realizes that cash won't work proper anymore he bribes more and more Germans and agents. One nice scene is the one that a history and literature teacher is left out of his workforce and he wonders why his work isn't essential, he finally gets in as a metal polisher or whatever. Schindler is gonna choose out of these people, but on what criterion? It's a place that it won't be a matter if the person is well tempered or good looking; the election's based upon the wealth, technical ability or creation that those people can make to the community, that's all. <br/><br/>Ben Kingsley's performance and also Ralph Fiennes' are just breathtaking in most of the scenes (as expected). Throughout the movie Schindler comes with a keen nose for women but it fades out as he gets more and more involved with paying off his money to save more lives. It's all filled with dramatic scenes, the scene when the German trooper pours a full wad of golden teeth is a good example, but I guess it's been stuffed with those seen a little bit too much sometimes. <br/><br/>An interesting point is the three different scenes that the movie turns into color while the rest of it is black and white; these are the moments of redemption.<br/><br/>The music is masterfully composed, it's one hell of an impressing piece of art; You have no idea how many times I myself listen to those tracks. The music is so original and has unbelievable harmony with those scenes. <br/><br/>Last fifteen minutes are the best when the Germans are leaving and Oskar's about to get arrested. The whole sentimental moments he gets through and Stern's sympathy is just unforgettable, also the scene where the worker's all are moving to where they're gonna live along with the music is the image of unity, sorrow and victory."
"John-423","1","127","283","9 November 2002"," Overated and weak retelling of a tired theme...
","I admit, I have never been a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan."
"kmorse8","2","76","163","27 July 2006"," This interesting story is based on largely unsubstantiated anecdotes.
","This interesting story is based on largely unsubstantiated anecdotes. Unfortunately, there is little or no documentation for the events which are portrayed in this sort of ""Docudrama"".<br/><br/>That a Schindler existed is verifiable, but beyond that the film takes huge liberties with the few known facts. It is in fact, a ""Fabricated History"", and has a propagandistic purpose. The novel and film based on it are entertaining , and Spielberg is a skillful entrepreneur, but the dark side of it was that it was more than likely undertaken by Spielberg as an attempt to exploit the sufferings of victims of the war for his own profit, and as a part of his continuing evident agenda of retribution against WWll enemies of three-quarter of a century ago. The perpetuation of hatred is not a noble purpose"

"sohylejain","10","9","14","15 April 2017"," A masterpiece in every sense.
","Released in the year 1993, Schindler's list is undoubtedly one of the best works of Steven Spielberg, based on the book by Thomas Keneally, which has won over seven Academy Awards including another 74 wins and 26 nominations. Basically dealing with the Jewish persecution by the Nazis during World War II in Poland, Schindler's list is a American epic historical period drama and biography of Oskar Schindler, who gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis. Shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in color, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning.<br/><br/>In Krakow during World War II, the Germans had forced local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Krakow Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, an ethnic German, arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the Nazi Party, Schindler lavishes bribes on Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials and acquires a factory to produce enamelware. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley a local Jewish official who has contacts with black marketeers and the Jewish business community. To highlight the incongruity of this self-serving attitude, Spielberg contrasts Schindler's increasing prosperity with the declining fortunes of a handful of Jews. Schindler is careful to cultivate mutually profitable relationships with a number of high-ranking German officers, one of whom is Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), the commandant of Paszow concentration camp. One of the movie's strengths is that it attempts to gain some understanding of the motivations of a character like Goeth, rather than taking the easy route of simply portraying him as an unthinking Nazi monster, and Fiennes is frighteningly convincing in his depiction of a deeply disturbed man who is all too aware of â and haunted by â his own shortcomings.<br/><br/>I personally felt the movie was a little slow paced at times, but I thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning till the very end. This movie has morals and emotion which one can hardly ignore. Filled with violence and gore, it was uneasy to watch it a couple of times. Dialogues were amazing, as well as the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, especially was impeccable. It did not even once occur to me that I had been watching a black and white two decade old movie the whole time, thanks to the brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and the editor Micheal Kahn. Among the dialogues, ""Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't."" was the one which appealed to me the most. The movie begins with a calm feeling and ends with the same calm, but during the whole time we pass through a lot of emotion, which brought tears to my eyes, blew my mind, ultimately leaving me speechless. The movie is beautiful and a magnificent work of art, which is a sheer pleasure to watch. Last but not the least, Music by John Williams adds a lot to the various emotions as well, without which the movie would not be the same. <br/><br/>A terrible chapter in humanity's history but one told so well by Spielberg and company. While Schindler's List is ultimately an uplifting story, it's also an incredibly harrowing and emotionally draining movie. A classic movie which needs to be watched by every single person, to know how lucky we are and what 'Life' is all about yet again."

","* There is a possible spoiler to anyone who, by some fluke, never heard the stories of the holocaust. Nothing specific, just the overall basis for the film. More of a synopsis. <br/><br/>Once again Steven Spielberg has created a master piece. However, I do believe this one is his greatest work. Or at least among the greatest. Absolutely the most Powerfully Moving and Thought Provoking Film I personally have ever seen. Certainly, I do not stand alone in that statement. It is my observed opinion that a great many others will agree with me. In my opinion, Steven Spielberg is undeniably the greatest filmmaker, director, producer of all time.<br/><br/>When this film first came out in theatre's across the country; everyone was talking about it, everyday. I quickly realized that this film was a must see for me. In Schindler's List (1993), Steven Spielberg spawns world wide interest in one man's Heroic acts of humanitarianism... while recreating the most horrifying historical events ever known. Thousands upon thousands of people's lives were at stake. Schindler (Ironically, a member of the Nazi Party), putting his own life in danger, becomes the peoples hope for any possible future. Ultimately, Schindler heroically saves some 1,200 Jewish lives. No comparison to the shocking new evidence that claims Nazi's killed up to 20 million people. Truly a must see for everyone. I am not Jewish. But I do tend to feel strongly for other peoples pain. This film provoked a Bleeding Heart in me. I have since seen this film about 2-3 other times. Every time, this film causes a heart wrenching pain down deep in my soul.<br/><br/>Hear this warning! This film is deeply emotional and thought provoking, a heart wrenching like never before. The horrific acts perpetrated upon the Jewish people during this historic era is absolutely, completely, and undeniably the worst crime in the history of the planet. If you are among the younger society, this film may leave you feeling like this was far too horrible; that you can't imagine it is actually real, that these events never really happened or that it was in some way fabricated. Well, Let me tell you my friend.... it did happen and it was a very real event; an historical stain on our civilization.<br/><br/>Be sure to have some tissue available. Because this one is a tear. This is a beautifully crafted film. Partly in black and white, bringing more realism in this the film. Watch and enjoy! jerker."
"grantss","8","9","14","3 February 2017"," Powerful, edifying, emotional movie
","The true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who, in World War 2, saved thousands of Jews from execution by the Nazis.<br/><br/>Powerful movie. Shows well the extremes of man's inhumanity to other men (the Nazi concentration camps and the systematic extermination of the Jews) and how there is also good in the world, fighting this evil. Quite graphic in showing what the Jews went through. This makes the saving of many of them from this fate even the more emotional.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Liam Neeson in the lead role. An equally compelling performance comes from Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic SS concentration camp commander. No cartoon villain, Fiennes inhabits the role and makes him a worthy adversary for Schindler and an evil that must be vanquished."
"Zoete2207","10","9","14","8 January 2017"," Topper
","The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.<br/><br/>There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10 Absolutely Recommended!"

Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not included, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how everything was black and white, and there was only color for a few seconds in the beginning and end.

"razorclw","10","9","14","18 October 2016"," Fantastic Depiction
","Usually when I see a modern film that is shot entirely in black and white I roll my eyes because the intended effect is usually far from the level of serious that I actually perceive. This is not one of those films. The black and white is perfect for the subject matter and REALLY adds to the story in ways unknown to someone who hasn't seen the film. The amount of hatred and malice displayed in this film puts one in an uncomfortable state that easily shows how serious the subject matter is. Albeit the Holocaust was no laughing matter, however if you are one who knows nothing about the history of WWII, coming into this movie will definitely open your eyes. It was once said that ""When Steven Spielberg first showed John Williams a cut of the film, Williams was so moved he had to take a walk outside for several minutes to collect himself"". I felt exactly the same way. I had plans to get some at-home work done after watching this movie, but was put at a standstill for so long after seeing it that I ended up being 30 minutes behind schedule. This is not a bad thing. If you have not seen this movie, it is an absolute requirement."

Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centered around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall.

I got this movie from one of my friend and I copied to my personal laptop, its been around 7 years I kept this movie in my laptop without watching it. I apologize for that. whenever I open this movie, the beginning scenes were not fascinating to me, that why I turned off and switch to other movies. 2 days before I decided to watch this movie without any distraction. I started watching at midnight 1 o clock. and I finished it around 5 o clock. I felt very guilty for not watching this movie for 7 years. But actually it was 22 years if I calculate from the year movie released. <br/><br/>What a movie !! I never felt this much emotional for any foreign language movie. But this movie touched my soul. I could not control tears rolling out of my eyes. <br/><br/>This is not a movie. This is lesson to everybody. And it shows what one rich man can do this to the world. We wont find any rich man like Oskar Schindler in todays world. He was rich at his heart. The moment Schindler started to realize the urge to help the Jews are really wonderful, only god like human can do it to them. I personally believe Gods are living in the world in form of men like Schindler. <br/><br/>About Spielberg, only Spielberg could create this much of emotional as he is Jew. <br/><br/>At last, movies like these are essential to make our world better. After watching Schindler's List I started feeling all the entertainment movies are crap.<br/><br/>If we deliver more number of movies like Schindler's List, our world would become full of wonderful people. <br/><br/>Finally, I prayed to God for Schindler's family for having person like this in their family.

When I composed myself enough to make it to the car, I balled and couldn't stop crying for some time.<br/><br/>I'm Jewish, but never knew much about my heritage and the holocaust. My grandfather escaped the Warsaw ghetto, but died shortly after I was born. My father, who was older than my mother, in part, grew up in a Japanese prison camp, and was stamped in Dutch, where he grew up. So when I saw all this come together and knew my relatives died in such horrible way, I realized what I lost and how I lost them, Regardless of heritage, this film must be seen by everyone so we can see man's horrific side. Sadly, I want to say so it will never happen gain, but it happening right now in North Korea.

","This is pretty much Steven Spielberg's cinematic coming of age. It hits every element perfectly and it's a masterpiece. The movie is not afraid to be highly brutal and it does an amazing job showing us the ugliness of the concentration camps. All movies of this genre should not be afraid to have this element of brutality and Schindler's List does it perfectly. It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can tell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very powerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only strengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and white undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie was expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film shot better then this.

"andreperaltas","10","9","14","12 May 2014"," Steven Spielberg brings his vision in a great style
","""Schindler's List"" tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a nazi at WWII that decides to save jews from a concentration camp. At first, he did not intend to save them, he was only interested in money, to buy jews to work in his factory, and make him money. But lately, we see Oskar change his mind, and secretly, saving the most people as he can. It wouldn't be bad if Martin Scorsese had accepted the offer to direct this feature, but Steven Spielberg shows the story in a magnificent directing, cinematography, screenplay, score and performances. With 7 Academy Awards, ""Schindler's List"" is considered a classic of movies and keeps touching all kind of people's heart."
"jose-cruz53","9","9","14","16 October 2012"," Spielberg's Best
","This film is a very solid offering from a not so solid director, Spielberg, who made some solid films, such as E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but never managed to attain greatness, until this film. Easily the best film he ever made, Spielberg showed that he is also able to direct serious stuff besides escapist adventure films. I would put this film among my top 50 favorite films.<br/><br/>This film is technically flawless and shows how sophisticated Hollywood filmaking had become by the early 1990's. Though I would question the use of black and white in the film: color is good and the Pianist showed it can be used in a WW2 tragedy film. However, this film is not the best WW2 film ever made either, Grave of the Fireflies, by Isao Takahata, a film detailing the suffering of two children to survive in Japan in the final months of WW2, is easily superior to this one and if you think this film is sad, thy watching Takahata's masterpiece."
"jturnbull-398-395794","10","9","14","3 July 2012"," Very possibly the most important movie of all time
","I watch this movie on DVD once a year so that I can keep a grounded position towards life. Things go wrong, business deals fail, relationships break down but nothing most of us have to contend with come remotely close to what happened in the Holocaust.<br/><br/>This is a grim, bleak movie, no doubt why it was shot in B/W. But throughout it, until its dramatic postlogue, we see that hope can always exist. Good can overcome evil. Evil things can only happen if good people do nothing. And that surely was the story of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is exceptional. We witness Schindlers journey of discovery from a smug, arrogant, greedy, amoral being to the ultimate saviour of 6,000 people, at great risk to himself. We see his people grow to love and respect him and perhaps even recognise that not all Germans are Nazi's.<br/><br/>While this film may be Liam Neeson's finest moment, the performance of the seriously conflicted Ralph Fiennes, as Amon Goeth,is the highlight for me. Has anyone better portrayed pure evil like this before? Yet like the portrayal of Hitler in Downfall we see something boyish and sensitive about him. We loath him but understand that he is not all completely bad.<br/><br/>I could go on about this movie; its superb acting, technical execution, screenplay etc but it has all been said before. Simply the best."

","I first saw Schindler's List when I was fifteen. I had read a lot about it on Wikipedia and IMDb but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer horror I witnessed on my TV. Schindler's List is not a movie. It's a true, enduring film. I made the mistake of first watching it solely as a film and not for what it truly stood for. Schindler's List is something everyone should witness, because that is all you can be when you watch the film: A witness. Steven Spielberg's brilliance and perseverance gives the world the final truth in film of the Holocaust. The masterpiece creates an epic yet eye-opening view for me into the Holocaust. Spielberg is not present in the film. You cant name one trademark he has on it's finished product. I didn't cry when I watched Schindler's List, but I will go back again soon to cry for the terror and inhumanity Steven Spielberg gave me. Schindler's List is a film everyone should see, but only when you are ready to face the truth, and have it give you a stare straight back. I love this film, and I cant wait to go back to it when I am ready to face the horror of 1939-1945. Steven Spielberg deserves a thank you from the world, for giving us the terror, horror, inhumanity, and final truth of the story of Schindler's List.

","Schindler's List is almost too painful to watch - a remarkably subdued but traumatically powerful account of the greatest evil ever perpetrated by mankind. I can't watch it without weeping, not just crying, but every time, I just weep. <br/><br/>Spielberg sets aside all sense of melodrama and instead gives us not only remarkable characterization in Oskar Schindler, Amon Goeth, and Itzak Stern, but also brings an enormous sense of humanity and dignity to an almost impossible subject. <br/><br/>I cannot begin to say what it was like to see this for the first time in the cinema the week it was released - it was simply the greatest film I had seen - it truly captures something about human dignity and hope as well as evil and complacency that go beyond words.<br/><br/>I could write about the magnificent production, and filming, grading, editing and care - but above and beyond this there is just the power of the true story - that one man did make a difference is almost impossible to comprehend given the odds and given the circumstances.<br/><br/>Cinema at its very very best can capture both the reality and the hyper-reality in a way that no other art form can - Schindler's List does - and it remains a living testament and the most powerful reminder that we all can and must choose good over evil. <br/><br/>Schindler's List remains for me one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film I have seen and I always knew it would be my 500th review. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and I hope it will serve always as a reminder why courage and good really matter."
"ElMaruecan82","10","9","14","23 July 2011"," My review of ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"" ...
","INTRODUCTION :<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg always developed an interest for WW2 more than any other film-maker of his generation, mostly concerned by the Vietnam War and its cultural impact. Therefore, he revolutionized the Industry of film-making, not the mentalities. He never made thought-provoking or introspective films like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Taxi Driver"".<br/><br/>This attachment to the past, to childhood cemented Spielberg's indisputable talent to entertain and touch hearts, genuinely or deliberately. Spielberg had a traditional view on film-making, which consecrated him when the 80's saw the return of a more conventional style. In the early 90's, he was the most successful director capable of the best like ""Duel"", ""Jaws"" or ""The Color Purple"", movies where, ironically, his touch was less present, as much as the worst like ""Hook"" which caricatured the Spielberg traits to the extreme.<br/><br/>When Spielberg dilutes himself behind the camera, he can be incredible, when he indulged himself to express some sentimentality; it rarely worked after the 80's. That's why my favorite of his films, ""The Color Purple"" is the most misunderstood, why ""Jurassic Park"" will never surpass ""Jaws"" and why ""Saving Private Ryan"" is weak compared to the movie I'll review now : ""Schindler's List"".<br/><br/>SCHINDLER'S LIST :<br/><br/>The movie opens on a religious ceremony, the colors slowly fade, like a painful flash-back into an episode forever rooted in memories. And the black-and-white cinematography suggests the haunting presence of death in the minds of people whose only ""crime"" was to be Jewish and the hearts of us, viewers, whose only ""excuse"" was to be born after that tragedy. And there starts a tragedy of epic proportions following different levels of grief.<br/><br/>DENIAL OF EVILNESS : When a one-armed old man is killed like an animal because he's useless for the Third Reich, I was caught by surprise. When kids were shot, I was shocked. And I have no words to describe the whole Krakovia Ghetto massacre sequence. The duality of horror as the most atrocious form of barbarity that contaminated civilized men ; how can a man who plays Bach or Mozart, exterminate a family with the same hand? Or a beautiful gift allowing sick people 'to never hear the gunshots'.<br/><br/>ANGRY INCOMPREHENSION : One of the most despicable movie characters ever, Amon Goeth, whose leisure consisted on killing Jews in the most gratuitous way, doesn't even deserve to be called 'villain' as his evilness transcends any cinematic perception. The shooting of the engineer Diana Reiter is the part I couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in Concentration Camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun.<br/><br/>DEATH ACCEPTANCE : The absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a Roman Emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the Jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority.<br/><br/>DEVASTATING SADNESS : The word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and John Williams' sober and emotional score. I understand this must have been painful for Spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. My heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end.<br/><br/>LIGHT OF HOPE : Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. However, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a War profiteer. This characterization proved to work for characters like Rick Blaine (there's something strangely Bogart-esque in the way Neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. He's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. It's ironic how he, the German, and his Jewish assistant, Yitzhac Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. <br/><br/>Who saves one life, saves the humanity Â <br/><br/>CONCLUSION :<br/><br/>Whatever I said in this review concerning Spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to ""Schindler's list"", his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for Humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages.<br/><br/>But the criticism starts again regarding the reception of ""Schindler's List"". The film has been described with so many superlatives that I really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. Does ""Schindler's List"" really deserve to be in the American Film Institute's Top 10? Is it really that iconic in American Pop Culture? <br/><br/>I also read that ""Schindler's List"" was voted the best film ever made by the German film magazine 'Cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. I hope I am wrong because I truly love ""Schindler's List"", but I just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised.<br/><br/>But I sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as Steven Spielberg."
"StevePulaski","10","9","14","4 June 2011"," A strong standout worthy of its placement on the top one hundred films ever made
","For a movie as monumental as Schindler's List, I believe a review should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.<br/><br/>1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.<br/><br/>2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.<br/><br/>3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.<br/><br/>4. The film's desire to ""show it all."" When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.<br/><br/>5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say ""Good work."" They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.<br/><br/>Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.<br/><br/>Starring: Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagall, and Embeth Davidtz. Directed by: Steven Spielberg."
"johnnyboyz","7","9","14","25 October 2010"," Fascinating tale about the hope of life and the promise of safety linked to one man and several thousand others, unfolding amongst an ocean of carnage.
","Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.<br/><br/>Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.<br/><br/>The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.<br/><br/>Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon GÃ¶th (Fiennes), GÃ¶th additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, GÃ¶th is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. GÃ¶th arrives on the scene, a KrakÃ³w suburb called PÅaszÃ³w, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work â construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, GÃ¶th himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as GÃ¶th is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out."
"MartianOctocretr5","9","9","14","27 September 2009"," Powerful message conveyed with brutal honesty
","One of the finest productions ever put on film; also one of the most difficult films to watch that you will ever experience.<br/><br/>It pulls no punches; therefore, it conveys just what a horrifying evil World War II's Nazi Germany really was. The reality of just what hatred and bigotry can influence one person to do to another is shown as ugly as it really is, and it's truly painful to see. The atrocities of this perverse dictatorship could easily be dismissed as a fluke of a violent era, but this film's underlying theme warns it could happen again.<br/><br/>Spielberg outdid himself in this brilliant work. The hopelessness that must have been experienced by the victims of this vile time are captured so well on every level. The acting is superb: the psychotic Nazi colonel was a standout. Liam Neeson is memorable as the guilt ridden German businessman Schindler who endeavors to rescue political prisoners right out from under the Nazis' noses. The many Jewish people targeted and viciously abused in concentration camps are ably portrayed by the cast with strong conviction.<br/><br/>Explicit scenes of ruthless killing and other abhorrent violence are not withheld, and this film is a rare case where such brutal honesty is appropriate and effective. There were scenes where I had to look away; I could almost feel the kick, the punch, the spit, the bullet. It was painful empathy for the terror of those in peril, and witnessing the many disgusting indignities they endured.<br/><br/>It's a guarantee this is not a pleasant watch; some of the imagery may horrify you, especially with the realization that these things depicted actually took place. You will see the lowest and most detestable behavior by people imaginable, and it will stick with you. However, it is a necessary precautionary message. This was Spielberg's finest hour."

","Everyone needs a slap in the face once in awhile to jar their senses...and this movie was that slap for me. I needed to be jarred awake from my apathy over the events of the Holocaust. In 1993 I got that awakening thanks to this film by Spielberg.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the most graphic and compelling accounts from a Nazi death camp, juxtaposed to more modern fare, say ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" which left me very disappointed and unmoved.<br/><br/>Schindler was very moving. It made me cry. At times the images shocked me enough to want to look away, but I did not. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I loved the use of black and white film, except where the color red was splashed in (i.e. the little girls coat at the beginning).<br/><br/>I've made it an annual ritual to rent this film and watch it.

"retasulover","10","9","14","20 February 2009"," Steven Spielberg At His Best!!!
","It's difficult for any one person to pick ONE movie by Spielberg that stands above all his others. However, if i had to choose his greatest movie when it came to sentimental value, and pure power, Schindler's List is THAT movie.<br/><br/>It's very painful for anyone to see such authentic acting displaying the mistreatment and sorrow of European Jews during WWII in Nazi Germany, but it is especially hard for me, as i am actually Jewish, and my grandfather was a German soldier in WWII in Russia.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a very faithful and powerful film send up of the novel of the same name. Liam Neeson delivers an incredibly devoted and emotional role as Oskar Schindler, who is indeed one of histories few true heroes. The slow transformation in Oskar Schindler from greedy businessman to savior throughout the movie, is one of the greatest character developments in film history.<br/><br/>It's rather difficult to pull off a memorable villain role when it comes to being historically accurate, but Ralph Fiennes pulls it off as the sadistic and crafty Nazi officer, Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes truly knows how to chill the viewers to the bone when his presence is nearby, especially when he is upset, and therefore probably going to kill a few Jews just to shake off his bad mood. The scene where a hungover Amon wakes up with a naked woman still in his bed and he wordlessly grabs a sniper rifle from his villa balcony and snipes a few working Jews in the camp at the foot of the hill is especially shocking, showing just how heartless this man truly is.<br/><br/>One of this films strongest points, is the masterful soundtrack that is made up of a slew of traditional Jewish folk songs, and a heart-wrenching violin score by John Williams and Itzhak Perlman.<br/><br/>An especially emotional scene where the music is at its best is of course, the finale when the war in Germany has officially been declared finished. Oskar notifies the 1,100 Jews he had saved from Auschwitz by taking them to work in his factory that the Allies will come looking for him and most likely kill him. Perlman's violin score is almost able to send goosebumps up your spine as Schindler leaves for his car and is given a solid gold ring made from one of his Jews' golden teeth as a token of gratitude, and he breaks down crying, while lamenting that he didn't save more. Truly, this is Liam Neeson at his best.<br/><br/>Anyone who couldn't find any good points for this film, would either have some very strong Nazi beliefs, or not truly appreciate what a good film really is. For any Spielberg devotees like myself, this is a film that I strongly recommend. Let it be known lastly, that this is a very emotional movie, and it was just the same backstage too, as Spielberg has noted that he was actually crying while behind the camera on multiple occasions while filming Schindler's List.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest movies ever made, and should always be recognized as such."

","Schindler's List is a masterpiece. No one but Steven Spielberg could so vividly and dramatically capture the essence of such a tragic time. While the film begins with an amusing and charming twist, Spielberg draws you into the reality of the events in a way that truly brings them to life. He strategically bases the film from the point of view of a man living a life of comfort and safety, not unlike that which we as Americans live and take for granted every day, and showing us the horror of the Jews' lives therein. To the point and yet very fluent, this film is sure to bring a tear to your eye, if it is given your full attention. The harsh reality of a seemingly forgotten past lingers still, and Steven Spielberg has brought the memory from the shadows."
"brianrange","10","9","14","2 March 2008"," It doesn't get any better
","Schindler's List epitomizes everything film making, at its best, can be. For Spielberg to make a movie about the holocaust, the most delicate of subjects, after previous ""close encounters"" with popcorn fare is a testament to his vision and devotion to humanity.<br/><br/>I particularly like the use of black and white in the film, and the colorization of the one girl in red. The one moment of color brings the mass depravity and destruction of the holocaust into focus by demonstrating that all of the thousands of bodies were once an individual, living, laughing, loving human being.<br/><br/>I also recommend watching Spielberg's Munich sometime after Schindler's List. It is, in some sense, the sequel asking, after the holocaust, how does that affect the Jewish sense of justice -- right and wrong?"
"hazrry","10","9","14","24 February 2008"," Schindler's list review
","A masterpiece. That is how I would describe Schindler's List in a few words. Schindler's List is based on the real life story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Of course when we think of a film based on a real life we usually think that it is just a ploy to gain people's attention, but this film really does bring real events back to us such as the horrors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the how people like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) would indiscriminately kill men, women and children just because they are Jews. Steven Spielberg came at this film with the right respect and didn't even receive a salary to direct citing that it would be 'blood money'. He choose to make it as realistic as possible not leaving out a single crying child, a single drop of blood or a single horror anywhere. Many parts of this film are difficult to watch, but if they weren't then this film wouldn't be a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong though, this is not an action film but more of a thriller. To say that the music 'fits' into this film would be a crime. John Williams's scores don't fit the film but make the film. If you wanted to get an Oscar in a film you had made then all you would have to do is get Williams to do the music for you, it wouldn't matter how bad the film was his music would make it come to life. Also there is a mix of both diegetic and non-diegetic music like when the Krakow ghetto is being liquidated a sad monotonous Jewish song is being sang by children which is clearly non-diegetic as no singing could take place in the confusion and death of the ghetto and also shows what a horror the Nazis were committing. The music then stops for a while as the Nazis wait for the Jews in hiding to come out and as the shooting starts a piece of diegetic music also starts which is in total contradiction to what is happening as it is jolly and 'bouncy'. The piece of music is by Beethoven and is being played by a German soldier trying to escape the real world where all the death is happening. The direction is genius to say the least. This film shows just how good Spielberg can be when he wants to be. It creates a very dark subtle humour which messes with your emotions. Such as, going back to the liquidation scene, when the Nazis soldiers are searching for hidden Jews and they shine a light round the room and it reveals a cluster of them and they all raise their hands which brings a smile to your mouth until you realise in horror that those Jews would die and you had found it funny. He also builds expectations that make you think one thing is going to happen and then he makes another thing happen instead. An example of this is the day when Goeth tries to take Schindler's advice on power is when you have every right to kill but don't. The first thing that happens is that Goeth saddle is on the floor and you expect him to shot the guy looking after the horse but he doesn't. After he comes back from horse riding, the Jew who is supposed to be cleaning his bath reports that it couldn't be cleaned. Now you think he won't kill him because he's on a good day and at first the film goes along with that but then as the Jew is walking away a bullet hits the ground at his feet. This makes you think that he is going to kill him but then he misses again and you think he is just playing with him changing your emotions again, and the final bullet hits him in the back of the head killing him instantly. Fiennes plays Goeth beautifully here and in the rest of the film but in this particular scene he makes the warped personality come out extremely well in because Goeth had no reason to kill the Jew and had just 'pardoned' him and yet after he touches the mirror and his nail gets chipped which makes him kill the Jew. Spielberg also gets an excellent performance out of Liam Neeson portraying him as the bad guy in the beginning before bringing in Goeth who is a character so bad he makes anyone look good. This is Neeson's greatest performance by far. Spielberg also uses the popular genre of Neeson's characters as a mentor to great effect getting him to comfort the Jews with opaque realism and develop his own character into someone we can emphasize with and makes us think what we would do in the same situation. The script is an amazing piece of work. The plot doesn't lose a single second of interest in it's over 3 hour running time. This is a feat in itself but then it doesn't just keep your interest but holds itself in your memory forever. Whenever you see that it is being shown on TV you plan to watch it days before it's on and then make sure nothing will interrupt you in that entire time. Each time you watch it you find something you didn't notice before and you can never watch it to many times. The script paints the background of the Victoria Falls in a master piece and leaves the foreground for Spielberg to paint the butterfly. Perfection is not something that easily comes to humans and is something only really found in the night's sky, the largest rainforests and the deepest oceans. It eludes us like a frightened cat and speeds past us like a rocket. This film has not achieved perfection but as the spice train past by it grabbed a handful of perfect and is seasoned all over with it."

","I saw this movie last month and was extremely disappointed and at the same time really happy. Disappointed at the fact that I took so long to watch this movie and happy that I didn't miss it out!!!!<br/><br/>Definitely the BEST movie I've ever seen. The direction, cinematography, acting...in fact everything was really good. But at times I felt some scenes were too long, especially the torturing scenes. But then I realized that maybe these scenes really gave the over all impact to the movie. This movie is shown at the backdrop of one of the most darkest period of human history (World War II).... Its shown in black and white due to that very reason!!!!! This is the shocking true story of Oskar Schindler, who never lost his sight when everyone from his own land were blind, who never lost humanity when he was surrounded by animals!!!<br/><br/>Never before have I got so involved with a character in a movie that I felt each and everything that went through Schindler's mind. Who do I have to praise that for, the style of direction or the well written script???? In the climax part when Schindler breaks down to tears I was shocked to find myself break down to tears for the first time after seeing a Movie!!!! Thats the power of this film!!!!!<br/><br/>If there is anyone else out there who hasn't seen this movie yet then PLZ....Please....Don't waste your time reading this or any review, instead rush and watch this movie as soon as possible!!!! In fact this has to be watched by everyone at least once in their lifetime, not for the purpose of entertainment but for a wonderful LESSON!!!!!"

","If you could call a holocaust movie spectacular, then this would be the one. The Holocaust was a period in human history that should never have happened, yet it has become the most reported on in all of human history. In Schindler's List we see only a small portion of Hitler's ""Final Solution"", the plot to eradicate a segment of humankind from the face of the earth. We see a businessman who wants to make money out of war, dealing with a sick Nazi, who only cares about doing his duty, trying to survive a world war. Eventually we see how the Nazi mentality takes over the soldier, and how a man finally realizes the inhumanity of the regime he is serving. The fitting portion of Schindler's realization is when he holds the ""Nazi Party Pin"" in his hand and realizes he could have freed a few more people for that small piece of gold. This is a movie that all should watch and wonder how each one can contribute to the humanization of this world of ours."
"kenbarr-ny","10","9","14","9 September 2005"," Spielberg's triumph
","Eventually every one should see this film. I say eventually because there are several scenes, particularly the latrine scene, that will turn one's stomach. This movie is stark in its portrayal of The Holocaust, with depictions of human depravity not meant to be viewed by younger audiences. What makes ""Schindler's List"" not a maudlin or sensationalistic movie is that it stays very close to what really happened in Poland and Bohemia/Sudetenland between 1939 and 1945. This movie must be seen for it bears witness to one of the monstrous periods of history. However, great care must be taken with younger audiences. Mr. Spielberg himself said that he would not screen it to children younger than high school age."

","My uncle who came all the way from a rural area to downtown Chicago and showed off his Schindlers List tickets to us, the night of my graduation party, I was 12. Because this movie was banned in the Philippines for frontal nudity we had to wait it out until the video came out. At first I didn't expect much, was even disappointed it was in black and white. The movie is so detailed, so graphic. It seems to tell you all the secrets that you will never read in any history book. The detailed part of other people's lives is what captured me. Most particularly about Amon Goethe and his Jewish love interest, which was bitterly ironic. He chose to even let her go in the end. While it was creatively written, it doesn't focus on Hitler at all. In fact I do not remember Hitler's face being shown in the movie. The movie is all about Herr Oskar Schindler. The other good part about this movie is that one can politely assume not ALL Germans are Nazis. Oskar Schindler had a very big heart for ladies as well as Jews. Because it was focused on Oskar Schindler, it doesn't attract contempt from people who think otherwise. It captures almost all sides of the war, from the Jews point of view and from the German's point of view. Never a dull moment."

"EijnarAmadeus","10","9","14","21 February 2005"," Spielberg's Finest
","Steven Spielberg was a bravado kid before this, he'd spent his directing career showcasing his ""whizz-kid"" skills in such as 'Jaws', 'E.T.' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - but in 1993 he suddenly turned another page. Spielberg crafted the Holocaust-drama of SCHINDLER'S LIST, a true WWII story about Oskar Schindler who saves 1100 Jews from certain death. And if anything, in the same year of 1993 Spielberg also released his other project, the dino-adventure 'Jurassic Park' which was a roller-coaster-ride, and felt more like the resonance of his 80s projects. SCHINDLER'S LIST on the other half, was a Spielberg the world hadn't seen, a director who took his task so seriously that he had kept postponing it since the early 80s - never feeling mature enough to handle its powerful story. In 1993 he felt and certainly was mature enough - this is a masterclass in film directing; shot in black&white there's a sense of no hope here, and it elegantly but affectingly changes between a disturbingly raw documentary-style to a German expressionism in which Spielberg uses every bit of his heaven-sent talent.<br/><br/>The acting performances are all over fabulous, John Williams' score is soaringly beautiful and the cinematagrophy is fantastic, just the minimal use of colour in two sequences eschulades hope into a movie so bleak and dark. For those who then didn't believe in Spielberg as a serious film-maker, they were here proved wrong. This is a film in which Spielberg gave it to the audience honestly and disturbingly - and it paid off, not only becoming his biggest box office success but also earning him his first Academy Award."
"dream_on_100","9","9","14","9 February 2005"," An Intense and heartbreaking film
","Winner of seven Academy Awards in 1993, this three hour epic is based on a true story, by Steven Spielburg, it very well portrays the horrors and sadness of the Holocaust. Although three hours of black and white may put viewers off, once you give it a chance, it's quite interesting and rather intense.<br/><br/>The horror of the Holocaust is unfolded through a member of the Nazi party, drinker, womaniser and ultimately war profiteer: Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who initially employed Jews from ghettos of Poland to start a factory during the war, making pots and pans. He witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews, and starts to save them covertly under the eyes of Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who is in charge of the ghetto and later moves all the Jews to a forced labour camp.<br/><br/>Schindler ensures their survival against odds, at the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who rescues those that are 'expendable' and at the same time negotiate business with a vicious, obstinate Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who enjoys shooting Jews as target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison camp. The film is largely about Oskar Schindler's transformation in response to the horror around him and learning the corruption of political power. Although the whole film is in black white, a significant Jewish girl is seen about, wearing a red coat which is prominently shown in the film, the colour red is rather shocking amongst the black and white surroundings and the theme of mass massacre. We follow the little girl to the point where even she, herself is killed in the gas chambers. At this point we realise the full horrors of the Holocaust and this is the turning point where we see the development of the Schindlers list. The film depicts Schindler's ultimately successful attempt to rescue 1,100 Jews from Hitler's ""Final Solution"" of mass massacre by getting them to safety outside of Poland. This beautiful movie allows viewers to feel like they're actually a part of one of the darkest, most horrific periods in history."

","The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.<br/><br/>The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work."

"capnmike6680","10","9","14","8 August 2002"," Spieldberg's Masterpiece
","Schindler's list begins as the story of a man who believes he can use a war that takes millions of lives, and a Nazi regime that murders millions of innocents, to turn a profit. But as the story progresses he begins to see the human side of whats going on, not just the profit margin. After learning of the hardships of those imprisoned, and of the murderers who control the camps, he begins on a quest to try and save not only his soul but the soul of everyone around him, and to keep the flame of humanity lit during the dark destructive reign of Hitler. This is without a doubt the best film of Liam Neeson's career as well as the best film of Steven Spieldberg's career. It shows you how even during a time of chaos and evil, goodness can still be found. It also shows a level of character development that I've never seen in a movie before or after it was released.

"Coxer99","10","9","14","25 March 1999"," Schindler's List
","An intense and moving motion picture that shocks, astounds and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. Liam Neeson is superb as Schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of Jews at the start of the 1940's. As time went on, he saw the demise of the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, ""Is he changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found peace with himself and with God. <br/><br/>Steven Speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could bring to us. He brings real life horror. A horror many people cannot confront as a survivor, let alone as an actor. Every actor should be commended for their courage in telling this important story. I am not Jewish, so all I can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took place, but I cannot the anguish the countless families have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents and children alike. <br/><br/>With an intense screenplay from Stephen Zallian and cinematography and art direction that is the finest in years. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the Nazi soldier who treats Jews as cattle. The scene where he awakes, picks up a rifle and commences firing on a Jewish woman standing alone is true horror. <br/><br/>Through the course of this film, I turned my head away countless times, not knowing what made people do what they do. Was their hope? Hope. That seems to be the key word in describing this movie. Hope is what Oskar Schindler gave 1,100 Jews. He gave them hope. He gave them life!"

"iskra-3","Null","9","14","29 August 2001"," An Incredible Experience
","Schindler's List is as incredible a film as we are likely to come upon in American cinema. The story of the opportunistic Oskar Schindler's metamorphosis from greed to generosity is truly as powerful as it gets. Taking Polish Jews into his metal working factory as cheap labor, he initialy takes advantage of the people. The opening of the film is laced with wit and Schindler's magnetism. In a crucial turning point, he witnesses the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto and the movement of the people to a forced labor camp run by the vicious and puzzling German commandant Amon Goeth. From this point on, Schindler is forever changed and does whatever he can to help the Jews.<br/><br/>Schindler's List has an incredible script, full of wit and humor at certain points, then sadness and humanity at the next. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are exceptional in their roles as Schindler and Goeth respectivly, but the standout is Ben Kingsley as Schindler's quiet Jewish accountant Izshak Stern. His growing subtle passion and strength make the last scene with him simply beautiful. John Williams, better known for his booming musical companions to Spielberg adventures, delivers a score of beauty equal to the film. The cinematography is brilliant beyond description, it must be seen to be believed. Steven Spielberg should have won two Best Director awards for this film.<br/><br/>The movie urges the audience to never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and the reality of its destruction. Despite the tragic situation of the Jews and Schindler, the film is also uplifiting. Schindler's achievement outweighs the merciless killings by Goeth despite the lopsided statistics. Somewhere around 1400 Jews escaped death thanks to Schindler, and the lives he saved will always triumph over the Nazis. As Stern proclaims in the heartwrenching finale, whoever saves one man, saves the world entire."

","After having finally seen 'Schindlers List', I can say that it is an absolutely fantastic and emotional experience.  When I was finished watching the film I was left completely speechless.  I couldn't actually find the words to describe it.  I'll give it a try now.<br/><br/>    On technical aspects of the movie, everything was solid.  It was a very beautiful film to look at.  Shot in black and white, there was very little color, except at the very end of the movie.  Also, a little color is inserted into the film highlighting the often mentioned girl in the red dress.  It is a beautiful scene, but I am a little unclear as what the symbolism of it actually was.  Even being unclear about it, one theory I saw was that it highlighted her as an individual, and in doing so it creates and individual story, showing that every person there was an individual in and of themselves.  I'm not sure if that is true, but it makes sense.  I often found myself wondering about her fate, so my theory is that Spielberg gave us a person to wonder about, if they had lived or died.  Then we may feel like all the Jewish families who were not positive of the fate of there loved ones until much later on.  <br/><br/>    There are way too many powerful, and at times sad and disturbing scenes to talk about right now.  Of these scenes, there is the all to disturbing liquidation of the ghetto.  The forced labour camp scenes as well were very disturbing.  They were mostly disturbing because of the head of the camps, Amon Goeth, a very ruthless and awful human being that just seems to shoot people for fun.  Just because.  And its disturbing to watch the disregard with which he does it.  <br/><br/>    Amon Goeth was played disturbingly by Ralph Fiennes, who should have won an Oscar, but thats neither here nor there.  He was some absolutley disturbing scenes that are just brilliantly played out.  I can point out a few, for instance a scene when he is talking with his Jewish servant(I will not tell you about what)and he does the whole conversation himself. Watching him just change his tone, psychologically, in a matter of seconds is amazing.  Another I remember, is one when he is going to shoot a Jew in the back of the head, and his gun won't work.  Its just a terrifying scene in many ways, but Fiennes plays it in such a way that you can tell he has no morals or cares for Jews, but a blood lust.  Other than that though, his stare, his evil stare showed nothing but hatred, and I don't know how Fiennes did it, but it is a horribly evil stare.  His eyes said everything. This was the highlight performance in the movie.<br/><br/>    However, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley put together two great performances as well.  What is amazing between these two is watching their relationship change throughout the movie, until Neeson(as Schindler) is repentent and changed, and really sad he didn't do more, as he felt he could have.  Really, one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film is when Schindler feels he could have done more and that he just didn't do enough. In the film he goes from an opportunist to a true hero, an unselfish one. The gift he gets from the Jews, and his embrace of Itzhak Stern(Kingsley)are truly wonderful and, apparently real moments.  Its hard not to be touched.<br/><br/>
    Not surprisingly however, the direction was absolutely brilliant. Spielberg made a movie that was close to his heart and this was a labour of love, and it will stand as his masterpiece.  You can always tell you are watching the hand of a master, and I knew that when I started this film, Spielberg was going to give me something special, and he did. <br/><br/>
    The only mild flaw, most people seem to think, is the small portion of the film at the end that is in color.  It seems a little out of place, and that Spielberg added it on maybe for himself.  And I think he should be allowed to do so after the three hours before hand that were extremely emotional.  I didn't hate the very end like some people though, because to me it was a way to show us that this disaster, the Holocaust, happened only very recently, only fifty years ago(at the time this movie was released). The fact is that some people who lived through this tragedy are still alive, and Spielberg, I feel, uses the end of the film to bridge that generation gap and remind us how recently this all happened.<br/><br/>    So finally, all I can say is wow.  Not many movies has left me speechless.  This was one of the most emotional films I may have ever seen, remembering that I ended up crying a bit in three different places.  Usually I might cry once, but not three times.  It is subject matter that isn't taken lightly, and shouldn't.  Everything in its three hours are necessary and brilliant.  Everyone should see this movie once, if for nothing else than an education.  Just a brilliant film.  10 out of 10."
"HelenHiwater","Null","9","14","16 August 2001"," In Spielberg's defense...
","I don't see why people have to trash this movie. It's been called everything from ""boring"" (!) to ""ham-fisted and manipulative"". To be honest, I was too immersed in the story and the drama to care about Spielberg's techniques. The black and white didn't detract at all from the movie. In fact, many modern photographers choose to use black and white film because it brings out form, light and shadow. The red coat helped me recognize the little girl who otherwise would've been lost among all the other grey corpses. Schindler's List was no more manipulative than most other movies, certainly not for the ""loaded"" subject matter it was dealing with. The scene at the end with the survivors laying pebbles on the grave *was* unnecessary, but that's a pretty small fault for a three-hour-long movie.<br/><br/>To RipePeach: You said that Spielberg characterized Germans as just a bunch of self-interested, evil murderers. Since when was it required that all movies that deal with specific ethnic groups include a token ""good ambassador""? Would you rather have Speilberg bring the movie to a grinding halt in order to introduce a nice, pro-Semitic German character that had nothing to do with the story of Oskar Schindler? Read ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"" and face the facts. Most Germans during the Holocaust were anti-Semitic. While there was significant public outcry over the mistreatment and slaughter of Slavs and the retarded (I think the Nazis stopped the T-4 project as a result), very few people opposed the extermination of the Jews. They were hated almost universally. This isn't to single out Germans as uniquely vicious people, or to insult present-day Germans. Granted, had the long-standing social conditions been in place, the Holocaust could've happened anywhere, including my home country. But it happened in Germany in the 1940's, so deal with it. In short, Spielberg wasn't being prejudiced- he was just being honest.<br/><br/>To Edvard Nicholas: You didn't like the happy ending? This isn't fiction. Oskar Schindler was real and he saved the lives of more than a thousand Jews. Therefore, the happy ending was necessary. Why lie about the fate of the Schindler Jews and make the movie even more depressing?"

","Words are not enough to describe the overall impact of this powerful film about a profiteer (Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler) during World War II who uses the Jews as cheap labor in his factory until he decides to save over 1,000 of them from death in the gas chamber. Nor are there enough adjectives to describe the performances--especially Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Schindler, a complex man who ironically becomes a saviour of Jewish souls. Although lengthy, it never once loses tension or interest and the decision to use black and white photography was a wise one, considering that all the war footage in the '40s was seen only in monochrome. Ralph Fiennes gives a masterful performance as the chief Nazi villain and should have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work. The John Williams score has a haunting quality--his main theme is a fascinating example of his uncanny ability to connect with the material he was scoring. As powerful a film as ever emerged about World War II, this film will undoubtedly increase in reputation as the years pass, fully deserving of all the praise it reaps. So real that some of it is difficult to sit through--but no serious minded filmgoer should miss it."

Now, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>At 3 hours long, Schindlers List is a forceful look at the true story of Oskar Schindler (brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson [Rob Roy, The Phantom Menace]) who saves Jews from extermination in concentration and death camps by way of putting them to work in his enamel ware factory. Although, it is confusing about whether he really wanted to save Jews or whether is was all about the money and the lifestyle: mistresses, drinking. This he shares with Commandent Amon Goeth (chillingly evil portrayal by Ralph Fiennes [ The English Patient, Quiz Show]). Amon is an exceedingly evil character, exampled by him standing on the balcony of his villa over looking Plazow forced labor camp and randomly shooting people with his sniper rifle. Ben Kingsly, well known for his role in 'Ghandi' gives an excellent performance of Itzhak Stern, a smart Jewish businessman, hired by Schindler to keep his factory in order.<br/><br/>This Oscar winning film is definately worth a look.

"tfrizzell","Null","9","14","27 June 2000"," Quite Possibly the Best and Most Important Film of the 1990s
","Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" is a top-notch film in every sense. The production values are extremely high, the cinematography (shot almost completely in black and white) is a sight to behold, the original score is amazing, the screenplay is complicated and unrelenting, and the performances are some of the best ever from any film ever produced.  However, it is Spielberg's direction that makes ""Schindler's List"" the instant classic that it is.  The film deals with a businessman (Liam Neeson in an Oscar-nominated role) who looks to profit from World War II by producing war goods for the Nazi Army and employing ghetto Jews as cheap labor.  Ben Kingsley plays a Jewish accountant who acts as Schindler's right-hand man who makes sure that he gets as many Jews as he can to save them from imminent deaths at Nazi war camps.  When Schindler witnesses what is really going on he has a change of heart and starts to save the Jews of Poland by buying them from a sadistic Nazi commander (Ralph Fiennes in an Oscar-nominated role).  Needless to say, Schindler develops the ""list"" with Kingsley and over 1,000 Jews were saved from certain deaths at the hands of the Nazi army.  ""Schindler's List"" is one of those utterly brilliant films that are rarely made today, or at any time for that matter.  This is also one of the most important films ever made.  When this film was initially released in 1993 some doubted the Holocaust had ever actually happened.  Many professors from prominent universities were convincing young people that the Holocaust was a fictional tool of propaganda used by the Allied Powers to create support for their cause.  Of course this is ridiculous, but many people were believing this trite.  That is the primary reason why this film is such an amazing success. Spielberg had an urge to do this project way back in the early-1980s, but did not feel he was quite ready for the harsh material (he was probably right in waiting).  He offered the project to Martin Scorsese (who also did not feel comfortable with the material) and even Stanley Kubrick (he was not interested).  Billy Wilder, well in his 80s at the time, also showed considerable interest.  However, Spielberg bought his time and went forward when he finally felt the time was right.  The timing was perfect and this film is perfect.  Easily one of the top 10 films of all time.  5 stars out of 5."
"riverdavis12","10","9","14","1 June 2000"," With Schindler's List, Spielberg completely shattered the limits of what I thought film can do.
","Schindler's List is by far the most powerful and profound movie going experience I've ever had.  No other film I have seen even comes close to the kind of power generated by Schindler's List.  Spielberg did things with the medium of film that I never dreamed were possible.  Somehow he managed to raise the artform to a transcendant, supernatural level - something that no other film in history (at least that I have seen) has accomplished. Citizen Kane may have set the standard for film, but Schindler's List completely shattered it - breaking free of the realm of normal movie making.  Viewing Schindler's List went far beyond a merely passive experience of viewing a poweful film - for the first and only time I can remember, I was living the experience in a way that is almost inexplicable to me.  It was a truly awesome existential and spiritual experience.  There are single scenes in Schindler's List that are more brilliant, profound and powerful than entire films I have seen. There are sequences and images that haunted me for years afterwards and still haunt me.  To this day I get choked up and tearie-eyed when I recall certain scenes or images to memory.  Apart from that, the film is brilliantly shot with the best black and white cinematography I have seen since Citizen Kane.  The screenplay is remarkably subtle and the performances are first rate all around.  Liam Neeson, who has amazing screen presence, was the perfect choice to play the character of Oskar Schindler - a man who is likeable and charasmatic, but ultimately mysterious.  And Ralph Fiennes was mesmerizing as the evil and complex Amon Goeth character.<br/><br/>Although this film is by far the high point of all my movie going experiences, it is also the low point in that every other film that I have seen since (even really great ones) seems so mediocre and ordinary in comparison."

"amillerz3","10","13","22","11 May 2012"," Schindler's List: A flawless masterpiece of Spielbergian proportions
","Schindler's List is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, an affluent German businessman who made his fortune in the pots and pans industry during World War II. After recognizing the atrocities committed by his fellow Germans towards the Jews, he hires as many Jewish day laborers as possible, paying off officer after officer, in order to ensure their safety and freedom. <br/><br/>I am a guy who likes to watch movies more than once: first to watch and enjoy, and the second to analyze and pinpoint the meaning of everything the director does. However, this film leaves such an impact and is so traumatic and horrifying that I could only watch it once. From the little German girl's foreshadowing words, ""Goodbye, Jews!"" to the death of the girl in the red dress, this movie depicts the abhorrent horrors of the Holocaust, like innocent men, women and children being sent off to their inevitable death in cattle carts. <br/><br/>The liquidation of the ghetto was, in my opinion, the most petrifying and tear-jerking sequence ever attempted. Everything you think you know about common decency and humanity is just thrown away: you are sucked into this world where everyone is a potential threat, and where you can die at any given second for doing some petty, meaningless little thing, like stepping out of line.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is honestly the bravest man in the history of filmmaking. He took a tragic era in world history and displayed it for everyone to see. People know the facts: 6 million Jews were killed over the course of 6 years, the gas chambers, the incinerators, the concentration camps, etc. What people don't (or should I say didn't) know are the stories. Who was friends with whom? Where did they live? What was their number in the concentration camp? Who lived, and who died? That is what Spielberg reveals to us. He shows us the horrors and hardships suffered by a specific group of people over the course of 5 or 6 years.<br/><br/>Then, Oskar Schindler enters the picture. He, at first, appears to be a greedy man whose only concern is money. However, then the horror show begins, and people begin to die at his feet. At first, he only saves the Jews because they are cheap labor. Then, he realizes that it is his calling to save them, not for money, but for humanity. He spends his entire fortune saving Jews, and in the end, he still thinks that he could have done more. ""This car. Why did I keep this car? ten more people."" In one of the best acted scenes in the history of film, Oskar Schindler, a strong, emotionless man, breaks down into tears when he sees what more he could have done. Although he is told over and over that he did enough, he keeps on thinking that he could have done more. In the end, it isn't about who he didn't save. it's about who he saved, and statistically speaking, there are more descendants of Schindler's Jews (as they are called) than Jews living in Poland. That just shows the impact that Oskar Schindler had on the Jewish population. As my Hebrew school teacher always said, ""Saving one man is like saving an entire world."""

I have to say, this movie touches your crying spot with the final scene, showing all the surviving members of the List. Absolutely amazing film. Another comment on cinematography was the girl in the red dress. I applaud Spielberg's choice of allowing her dress to show, highlighting her in the crowd and the later when bodies are being loaded, her dress shines bright among the dead. This proves to be the catalyst that makes Schindler's quest all the more important. The last act when all the Jewish people are freed and Schindler goes on the run, one word comes to mind for this...Enthralling. Liam Neeson hits the character spot on, and his heartfelt sentiments at not being able to save more induces tears in your eyes. Bravo. Bravo."

","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.<br/><br/>Oskar Schindler was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the KrakÃ³w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""<br/><br/>It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbor any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himselfÂ and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.<br/><br/>With the arrival of Amon Goeth, a HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of itÂ. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""<br/><br/>This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and- white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. Its realism, depth, and willingness to touch on sensitive and dark topics cannot go unnoticed. It is one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, and for good reason. Few movies draw out such emotion from the viewers. It is movies like this that will hopefully keep humans from committing such atrocities against each other in the future."

Color in it includes the red dress of a little girl that is killed and at the end. The dress is seen as red when the girl is walking outside and when she is dead with everything else in those shots in black and white. The movie has a lot of very disturbing scenes.

","The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII.

People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gas ed, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.<br/><br/>Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening portrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young Jew remains as one of my many fa-vs!"
"sourabhjkalmady","10","10","16","25 October 2016"," one of the greatest movie
","This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. It depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation, and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tag line says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world"". And this film shows us that no human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!"
"aliciailskov","10","10","16","20 October 2016"," One of the most memorable movies
","This movie always leaves quite the impression on me. I have seen it multiple times, and every time I walk away feeling gratitude, humility and in awe. Not only does this movie portray light in a scary, dark point in history - it also shows filmmaking at its best. The acting is superior, the direction, the cinematography etc. it's all there! And last but not least, the music - it still makes me cry every time I listen to it. This film deserve all the praise that it is getting. It truly is one of the best films ever and the story is so well written and well portrayed. If you are to watch a film about WWII, let it be this one. You will most certainly not regret or forget it. Schindler's list is one of the great ones."
"hall895","8","10","16","10 July 2012"," A hero amidst the horror
","Oskar Schindler did not set out to be a hero. He set out to make money. He was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of Poland's Jews. They were cheap, easy labor. But somewhere along the way things changed. Schindler saw what was happening all around him. The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. But this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. Even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. There is room for a hero.<br/><br/>Setting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. You have to celebrate those who were saved. But you must also honor those who were lost. Steven Spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. He told his uplifting story of Oskar Schindler. But the bigger picture was never lost. The horror of what took place comes through very clearly. Spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. The pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. Seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. Seeing the bravery and heroism of Oskar Schindler restores that faith.<br/><br/>Spielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. Liam Neeson played Schindler so beautifully. Here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and Neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. War-profiteering Nazi or heroic savior of Jews, whatever the moment called for Neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. Who was Oskar Schindler really, why did he do the things he did? He was an enigma who Neeson portrayed wonderfully. Ben Kingsley played Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. At first Schindler and Stern have very different motivations. But a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. And Stern plays his part in helping to save his people. A quiet, yet determined, presence whom Kingsley personifies so well. And then there is Ralph Fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil Amon Goeth. Any story of a hero needs a villain and Goeth, as played chillingly by Fiennes, is as villainous as they come. Perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. But in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. Kingsley is very good, Neeson is terrific but Fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. He makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality.<br/><br/>The three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. But Spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. Some play characters who we get to know a little bit. Many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. The hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. Spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. And the specter of death always looms. It's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. It grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. And there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. One scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. And you're just watching, people actually lived this. This was such a challenging story to tell and Spielberg tells it so well. The Holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. But here a hero was found. And Oskar Schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world."
"ViddyG","10","10","16","11 December 2002"," A Masterpiece of our Time
","After many a year producing films of high entertainment, but lesser intellectual class, Steven Spielberg finally created a true masterpiece of our time. Consistently overlooked for Oscars for his previous films, the Academy had no choice but to pour glittering praise over this cinematic adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-selling book.<br/><br/> I will not go into the details of the story as this should be imprinted into the mind by the images of the film itself. Rather, I would like to make special commentary on the direction of Spielberg, the screenplay of Steven Zaillian and the excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. The controversial decision to film in black and white must also be specially commended, as it adds to the atmosphere of the film greatly.<br/><br/> The thing which sets the film apart from any I have seen before or since, however, is in the quality of acting. In parts, you lose the fact that it is ONLY a film, and not a live-action documentary. Of particular note is the exceptional British acting trio of Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler), Ben Kingsley (Itzakh Stern) and Ralph Fiennes (Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth). Although the performances by the first two were magnificent, I do not believe I have ever seen an acting performance to rival that of Fiennes in his role as the Komandant.<br/><br/>It is all the more remarkable considering that this was his first role in a major film, having being plucked out of relative obscurity by Spielberg having seen his performance in the television movie ""A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia"" the previous year. It was an absolute travesty that none of these acting performances were rewarded with an Academy Award, showing the Oscars for the shambles that they really are.<br/><br/> I would like to end by making the point that I have never been left so astounded by any film as Schindler's List. Some may say that it is part of the propaganda machine that Spielberg has also used in other films, such as Saving Private Ryan, and there may be some truth to this. However the simple truth is that this film depicts life during the holocaust as closely as we could imagine it sixty years on. Humanity would learn a great deal if our young were taught about the mistakes of the past, and films such as this should be a part of the educational curriculum in every country in the world (as is the case in countries such as Great Britain and New Zealand, where Schindler's List is a mandatory part of every 15 year old's history lessons).<br/><br/> Finally, if I were to find one fault with the film, it would be the final credit of the film - ""Dedicated to the six million Jews who died in the holocaust"". Spielberg seems to have conveniently forgotten the five million gypsies, physically handicapped, mentally handicapped etc. who were also murdered by Hitler's death squads. I believe the film should be dedicated to these people also, truly reflecting the thankfulness we should all have for a world in which Nazism did not prevail."
"Board","10","10","16","5 October 2002"," A true masterpiece
","A fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. I rarely use the word superb, but superb isn't even enough for this movie! A true masterpiece, as I said in my summary. One of only two movies that I would give that grade (the other being ""Breaking the waves""). This comes in as the second best film I've seen my entire life! This movie isn't a brutal film like Spielberg's other WWII movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which also is superb in my opinion), but deals with concentration camps instead of the battlefields. One of only a few emotional and moving movies I've seen - and one of the best!!"
"Angry_Arguer","10","10","16","4 October 2002"," Not of love and hate, but of hate and tolerance (spoilers)
","The European Holocaust unleashed by Adolph Hitler and his deranged madmen will always be one of history's darkest moments.  To present this on film is one of the most difficult things to do, how do you present all the tragedy, horror, grotesque, and evil of the events from 1939-1945 outside of Western eyes for six long years with the sense of hope that still remained in many minds...many didn't live to see that hope come true in the form of liberating capitalists and communists.<br/><br/>Spielberg has gone from creating fun films like Indiana Jones to drama of the first order.  Many scenes oft mentioned by critics still can resonate in our minds with both visual beauty and unflinching brutality.  The Krakow ghetto liquidation, Schindler making his various deals, the near executions and the ones that fall through, the burning of the bodies at the camps. All of this is done in a fashion unlike Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's other big WWII movie.  Neeson is perfect as the man who is both human (immoral, corrupt, and sinful like all of us) and savior (do-gooder, compassionate).<br/><br/>Six million Jews were burned, gassed, shot, or died of starvation in the Holocaust, such equivalence would be nuking New York.  For such horrible loss, the Jews gained a nation to call their own.  THAT is why for 70 years they have continuously fought the Arabs and never lost, to prevent another Holocaust that the UN could never stop from occuring.<br/><br/>By far the most psychologically unique character of Schindler's List is Amon Goethe (most excellently portrayed by Ralpy Fiennes) as the cruel, SS commandant.  When he is first introduced in the Krakow winter, he is being shown the ghetto.  After his guide is almost finished, what does Amon say? Not sum racist comment or other Nazi-related speech on Aryan superiority, rather: ""Why is the roof down?  I'm f***king freezing!"" He doesn't care about people, later he takes potshots at his own prisoners and uses a method of extracting information from suspected thieves that would have Primetime drooling.  In a moment of possible humanity by being remotely polite to Helen, his Jewish ""maid"" brought in from the camps. Possibly resisting the urge to rape her, he beats her instead when his self-control runs out.  We are not sorry to see him die at the end.<br/><br/>If the end or some point near the end does not cause you to reflect on your life or even just cry, you have missed the whole point of the movie that we can never again let anything like the holocaust happen--understood in places like Rwanda it is too late for that but our thoughts must be of tolerance and not blatant hate."
"bosco9765","7","10","16","24 June 2002"," It may be the most important film you'll ever see...
","The movies should inspire, and provide a view of things the way they ought to be.  Schindler is both.  This is probably the most difficult movie you will ever watch.  The liquidation of the ghetto, for instance, or the shower scene, are among the most heartbreaking images ever filmed.  Yet this movie might cause you to rethink the meaning of egoism when you see it manifested in this enigmatic man."

This was the first film I saw him in and he grabbed my attention immensely. I couldn't possibly think of anyone else who could play his role. The film takes you on a roller-coaster of emotion and despite being a long film, I found myself to be totally absorbed and invested in it from start to finish. I found that I that I really started to care about the characters and the poignant decision o the director to keep the little girl in colour is so powerful and heart breaking. I highly recommend this film as a real insight in to the horrors of this war and the hell people had to go through just to survive for their religion."

","1354/5000 The guy who revolutionized the movie scene, Steven Spielberg proves that he does not just blockbuster, told in an extremely melodic way, it is impossible not to empathize with the characters, the film is extremely sensitive and insensitive as well, showing all the cruelty that human nature Can provide by elevating life to the condition of nothing, talks about the power that corrupts and elevates the human being to a higher degree, this is all a great analogy of Nazism, which in the end, is nothing more than an advertisement, and our protagonist Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) has realized this and decides to act. It is impossible to talk about Schindler's List without mentioning his photograph that puts us straight into the 1940s, and this was a very good choice for Spielberg, we have some colorful scenes that are absurdly significant, like the scene of the girl in red who Symbolizes hope, and then ... With a soundtrack and convincing performances and an impeccable script, its 3 hours are not even tiresome, on the contrary, you want to see more, live longer, get more excited. And as if that were not enough, Spielberg mixes elements of cinema with real life, leaving the film extremely more tactile.

","I don't know what to say about this movie. I had never seen it, so when I received it this spring I was eager to watch it. I find the subject of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in. Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in the movie came across as wooden figures to me.<br/><br/>Now comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.<br/><br/>I can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part."

","This is an amazing film in every detail. The acting is emotional powerful and extremely convincing. I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music). I will never not cry or be moved by this film."

Well the Nazis wiped out a lot of other groups beside Jews too.

Jurrassic Park, great escapist fantasy,Raiders, handed to him on a platter by Lucas, Jaws, brilliant horror,Close Encounters, a virtuoso UFO riff. In Schindlers List and Amistad we see two oppressed groups, the Jews and the African slaves are unable to help themselves without help from the oppressive white man who is subjugating them to begin with! Wouldn't a story about the Holocaust or Slavery be more satisfying if it showed how the oppressed helped themselves instead of implying that THE STORY to tell about this particular period of history makes the victims unimportant, interchangable, of NO consequence except to motivate the ""HERO""?? Also who is reading these scripts? Isn't the little girl in the red coat the SAME plot device( I don't even know what to call it, motif, ornament, twist??) as having Tom Hank's character release the german soldier that ultimately kills him.?!?

","Steven Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" is all but considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and I can hardly disagree with such a statement because this is an incredible film that isn't always easy to watch but is the peak of writing, directing and acting. Liam Neeson and Oskar Schindler gives the greatest performance of his entire career in this film, Neeson brings a complexity to his character and a captivating nature to Schindler, Spielberg doesn't try to paint Schindler as a hero he builds him up as a man in an impossible situation trying to complete a mission he believes in and he has some truly amazing scenes with his ""power"" monologue being possibly one of my all time favourite movie moments. Neeson also has some truly astonishing scenes with Ralph Fiennes who is absolutely incredible in this movie not only is he a completely terrifying presence but Fiennes is able to turn him into a sick human being which makes him much more interesting to watch. Like I said this film is a hard watch at times but that's ultimately one of the films greatest strengths, that it refuses to glorify the holocaust and this film has some truly disgusting moments that gives you a hint at the naive nature of humans themselves. Of course John Williams scored this film and he composed one of his finest achievements for this film. Spielberg added a very personal touch to this film with the know iconic girl in the red coat, it's a moment that is chilling to begin with but almost goes completely over your head afterwards but it's truly horrifying when it comes back later on and gives you an impression that truly nobody was safe from the grip of the Nazis. While Neeson was the one who turned Schindler into such a captivating protagonist it was also the excellent writing that made his character worth watching, he at first comes across as a complete bastard but once he gradually changes his ways it feels earned and you understand the heartbreak that Schindler goes through when he begins to realise that he may not have done enough. This film is very iconic for the fact that it was completely shot in Black and White and that's because it works so well, it gives the film and documentary style that makes it feel real. <br/><br/>Schindlers List is a masterpiece it's has such a captivating look at humanity, it refuses to show events any way other than how they happened. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give the greatest performances of their entire careers in this film and in my opinion should have both received Oscars for their work. <br/><br/>A+/100%"

Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film, and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi commandant.

Not a shot misused or not an actor miscast. Not a line unnecessarily said.<br/><br/>All of Spielberg's sensibilities as a filmmaker are displayed in here, from his depiction of the elitist people whom Schindler hangs with at the start.. to the horrors of the Nazi oppression. Neeson and Kingsley are great, but just as infectious is Ralph Fiennes whom Neeson has many exchanges with that take you inside the mind of a fascist. Fiennes also is a holder of some of this film's more disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>What is great about Spielberg is his ability to tell a story in full circle, never compromising denouement and character arc, Oskar Schindler's transition couldn't have been portrayed any better. Perhaps the horrors of totalitarianism are what redeems a man of greed, arrogance and a cold heart. As usual, Spielberg frames every sequence with meticulous attention to biomechanics and composition... and I couldn't tell it was John Williams either in the scoring, which is a good, No - an excellent addition.<br/><br/>Was it Casablanca or North By Northwest as my top 1 greatest movie of all time?

","Since before I could remember, I have had an interest in World War II. When we began to learn about it, I was even more interested. Then I heard about Schindler's List. Sure, I've heard the title before. I just didn't know what it was about until High School. Never bothered looking it up. Then I saw it. Spielberg has never made a movie this good.<br/><br/>Ever since Star Wars Episode I, I've always been a Liam Neeson fan... And I feel this was his best performance ever. Ralph Fiennes was good at making me hate him (hard to believe that's the same guy who I thought was cool from the Avengers). <br/><br/>This movie makes you wonder why. Why would the NAZI party go through such great lengths just to make Jews suffer? The only difference is the difference in beliefs. Was it that they needed someone to blame for the depression? But why the whole religion? I've been asking these questions before I saw this movie, and this movie doesn't answer them... perhaps we never will know the answers.<br/><br/>This movie is really good. I give it a 15/10."

Using the subtle but startling shadings only black and white cinema can produce Steven Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in content and scope.  Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant  shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted.  Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling.  John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews  he can from certain death.

","Schindler's List is really Spielberg's first movie that deals in the genre of Drama. Up until then, he had done the Indiana Jones trilogy, ET, Jurassic Park and so on.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is simply the tale of a wealthy German businessman named Oskar Schindler who begins to save the lives of Jews as World War II continues. The premise to the movie is that simple and so, its wonderful The pacing of the movie can be a little slow and I did find myself bored at the start of the movie. The movie does feel long, clocking in at over 3 hours long. Some parts of the film seem quicker and better than others but by the end of the film, everything turns out well.<br/><br/>The acting by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes is just brilliant. The music in the movie is brilliant, nothing less than John Williams' expected standard and the directing and writing of the film is superb.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are relatively good though I feel some characters could be fleshed out more The movie, however, is very emotional in the last half hour which really changed the movie. Had it not been for the way the last 30 minutes was, I would've probably given this a 7.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is a well told emotional drama of Oskar Schindler, with brilliant acting and directing, solid writing and superb music as well as good characters. Do I think its one of the best? No, not really but I certainly think this is a very good movie. Definitely a movie that is worth to see for any movie fan"

"J-55","Null","32","68","23 January 1999"," Emotional pornography.
","Spielberg's much hyped film is a dangerous piece of work. It is unforgivably manipulative, using cinematic effects to connote horror and emotional involvement which serve only to distract the viewer from any sort of truth (in particular: the girl in the red coat, trite heart-string pulling). Yes, I know the intentions were good and that something like this should exist to continue the memory of the holocaust, but this is not it. This is emotional pornography, it's worthiness is sickening and it's heavy-handed nature merely bruises the audience into submission. This is how the tragedy of the holocaust will be remembered, a single story (with a seemingly happyish ending) with a hero. It's not totally factually accurate, yet it holds itself up as evidence. It is not. It is a fiction BASED on real events. Spielberg, with his influence, has rewritten history forever, a morally dubious thing to do. The photography is good, there are a couple of good performances (especially Ben Kingsley), the special effects are superb. But this is not a brilliant film, aesthetically or morally. It is disgraceful. If Spielberg was not Jewish himself, there would have been an uproar. It is a dangerous document. And as for playing it in schools (along with Amistad and Saving Private Ryan - both of which are as bad if not worse that SL) as has been suggested above, that I find very disturbing.<br/><br/>This film, preaching on high morals has made a few people a LOT of money. I know it was in black and white and over three hours long (which is uncommercial) but if Spielberg wanted to get closer to 'truth' (b+w IS NOT TRUTH, these things happened in colour! Newsreels are not TRUTH, they only act to remind you of the distance between you and what you are watching) why didn't he use all German and Polish speaking actors with subtitles? Because it wouldn't have made as much money, that's why. I'm sick of all this worthy praise of such an incredibly dodgy film. Watch 'SHOAH' instead and maybe you'll all actually learn something."

Unfortunately, his undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history."

","Don't get me wrong, Shindler was a great man who did some amazing things in his efforts to save some Jews from certain death.

For example, the at the end of the movie...Shindler left with a whole lot of money, which he could probably have used to save even more people, but elected not to. This should not in any way detract from what he did, but it, among other scenes, made the movie a fundamentally dishonest one."

","This is a wonderful educational film for kids, I mean the youth between 12-18, to inform them about the horrors of Nazism and the Holocaust, but for adult Viewer who knows a lot about the Fascism and Concentration Camps this film will seem too straightforward and even tasteless. It is not enough to use a serious theme and a black and white film to make a good picture. And I definitely do not understand the viewers who behave as if they haven't seen any of anti-fascist films of much higher quality.<br/><br/>It is true -Mr. Spielberg is a great Master, Master of Manipulation and a great specialist of Exploitation Cinema. This is what exactly he does here - he exploits the Important and Painful topic of Holocaust (or it can be slavery, terrorism, etc) being perfectly aware that many would praise the film not for its artistic merits but for the STORY and the MESSAGE, and if one dares to say that the film is lousy - he/she will be immediately accused of being a revisionist, indifferent to peoples suffering, holocaust denier and almost Neo-Nazi. <br/><br/>Let me put this straight - I am none of these and still I think that Spielberg film is not good. It is not good as a piece of art but it might be good as an awareness raising reel - for those who had no or very little idea about Nazism and holocaust, but for those of us who don't need a gaudy movie from a Hollywood hack to know basics of history - there is nothing of interest here - I can name two or three dozens of feature films of documentaries that dealt with Holocaust much better, I suspect many of admirers of this film simply have not seen any of those. <br/><br/>Uneven script and even worse direction is camouflaged with the important messages and arty shell of BW photography. What comes tomy mind is another film about Nazism - somewhere in mid 70-ies Art-Porn maker Tinto Brass (of Caligula fame) took Nazim as a background for his film Salon Kitty. He invited famous art house stars Tulin and Berger who had previously acted in very highly regarded anti-fascist film of great Lucino Visconti and made own film about fascism. The result? Despite the sets, the stars, the important issues - the film still ended up being Art-Porn - as this was the only thing Mr. Brass could do. The same is problem with Spielberg - he might be really willing to make an important picture but still ended up with what he is best at making Â exploitation movie. <br/><br/>As to the rain of Oscars Â well, didn't ""Around the world in 80 days"" once get an Oscar?"

","OK, I really don't like this film.  So I'll start with the positives.  That would be Ben Kingsley....ok, I guess that's it.<br/><br/>First of all, there's the obvious fact that Spielberg was gunning for the Oscar on this one.  He picked an issue that was popular in the politically correct world of Oscar voters, one that nobody can remedy or do anything about but they all like to discuss to show how much they care, and ran with it.  The full weight of the concentration camp massacres can only really be seen in that French documentary (the name eludes me.)  And if you want to get a feel for life in Nazi Germany, you might as well watch the propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will,"" giving the viewer a chilling glimpse at the culture of national socialism.<br/><br/>Spielberg's attempts to be ""artsie"" are incredibly phony, particularly the ""red dress girl""'s presence in a B&W film.  An Liam Neeson simply does not pull off his part.  At the film's end, you REALLY want to sympathize with Schindler when he laments that he could have saved ""one more,"" but Neeson's performance in that critical scene is unconvincing.  He plays the cold and reserved parts of Schindler's character so strongly that the character development leading to that emotional climax is lost.<br/><br/>People rate this film highly because they feel that they're supposed to. Don't take their word.  The film (with Kingsley as the exception) is poorly acted, drawn out, and pretentious.  If you've been fortunate enough to miss this film so far, keep up the good work."

","The film has this weird gimmick if colorizing specific things like a little girl's coat or candles. It really wasn't used enough to warrant the gimmick. To my knowledge, no actual World War II footage was used during the film. If they had done that, I could understand filming the movie in black and white. There was a small scene that was shot for shot copied from Citizen Kane for some reason. Another odd thing, Hitler was never mentioned in the film. I would have expected at least some mention of him. I don't count that against the film though. As for the story, it jumps around a lot at first. It's just several nameless people being killed by nameless Nazi soldiers.

It SHOULD be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust.<br/><br/>There's little plot and as much as I like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression.<br/><br/>It's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. Then there are incongruously lyrical monologues.<br/><br/>It's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding.<br/><br/>Also, this is in English and that's not OK.

It manages to be both beautiful, horrifying, hopeful, and depressing all at the same time which is incredibly hard to do. With this film, Spielberg really shows what masterful director he is. Liam Neeson also gives a jaw dropping performance as Oskar Schindler. I can say without a doubt that this is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Every single line, ever single emotion, Liam Neeson acts it out perfectly. The next great performance is what I consider to be the greatest performance of all time: Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes' plays this character so good, that Amon Goeth is arguably the most unlikeable, despicable character to ever appear on screen. (Amon Goeth being a real person makes his performance even more stomach wrenching). This is a once in a generation performance. Ben Kingsley also has an incredible performance in this, playing Itzhak Stern. In my opinion, Schindler's List is the most powerful, emotional and important movie ever made.

"buzoncontacto","7","18","41","27 July 2007"," Extraordinary pictures - not so great script
","It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by IMDb comments: either they label it ""masterpiece"" or ""a sappy, manipulative banalization of the Holocaust"". Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? And then ""La Amistad"", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).<br/><br/>And then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. In Schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. ""What can we do"" ""If I were you, I wouldn't go East. They don't like you there. Neither I would go west"". Next scene: we see all the survivors in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS. In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT dumb?"

","""Schindler's List"" is a powerful movie that is a reminder to the world of where hatred can lead to. The movie shows the Holocaust in the most powerful and confronting way possible. It doesn't hold back with its images or story. In that regard ""Schindler's List"" is a daring movie but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined. The movie tells the true story of Nazi-party member Oskar Schindler, who as the war progresses sees more and more horrors of the Holacaust and decides to help the Jews in the best way possible for him.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever created. Since almost everything in the movie is based on true events it makes it all even more powerful. It's hard to imaging that these horrible things all actually truly occurred. The movie is filled with graphic, confronting and humiliating images. It provides the movie with some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on you. Never has the Holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such a detailed and confronting way. Not everyone will be able to handle watching ""Schindler's List"". It really is not a movie for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>Spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also most personal and best movie. The storytelling of the movie is perfect and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on. It follows many different Jewish characters who all had their different experiences.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward the ending but in this case I forgive Spielberg. It in no way makes the movie any less powerful or meaningful. The message of the movie comes trough very hard and direct. Everyone should watch this movie, not only because it's such a good one but especially because it's a very important one.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in black & white. I think main reason for this was to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and realistic emotions of history. It's not a movie that tries to shock, it's a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. Whatever the real true reason was for making the movie in black & white, it works really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. The lighting of director of photography Janusz Kaminski is really phenomenal at times. Also the dramatic musical score by John Williams is impressive and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful.<br/><br/>Also the acting is great in this movie. The Jewish persons are mostly played by unknown and unexperienced actors. It makes them. in their roles, extra credible and believable. We see them as persons, not as actors playing persons. That's also another reason why the movie works powerful, the characters are all very real. Not only the Jews but also the Nazi-Germans. The movie launched the careers of both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson is great as the main lead and Ralph Fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander Amon Goeth. Another fine impressive role is being played by Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>Among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it's a very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never happen again.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This movie was made to win Best Picture, to deny it that would be blasphemy. Is it my favorite movie of all time?  No it is not (only because this isn't the kind of film you watch every week to enjoy), but it is the greatest piece of film-making I have ever seen.

","Schindler's List is unquestionably the finest re-enactment of Holocaust horror there can ever be. Dubious historical accuracy aside, it's infinitely more important for the audience to recognize how perfectly the film duplicates the emotional impact of the Holocaust. One cannot feel such fear, shame, rage or love for humanity through any other means. To see this film is to witness the full potential for human good and human evil, side by side. To weep as you watch is not to fall prey to the director's manipulative imagery, but to acknowledge the abhorrent events of the time. You can watch it any way you want; my recommendation to take the fullest advantage of the magnificent craft employed by the director is to let yourself be placed right inside it as you watch, without fear or trepidation."
"SKG-2","10","9","18","4 March 1999"," Profound meditation on good and evil
","Steven Spielberg showed he could make grown-up movies with this powerful drama about the Holocaust and about one of the handful of people who tried to save Jews rather than kill them or allow them to be killed during this time.  It's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of evil.  The good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of Oskar Schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives.  Contrary to what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a complex, enigmatic human being, and Liam Neeson plays him that way splendidly.  I do agree the scene where Schindler wishes he could have saved more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin is Ralph Fiennes, in an absolute chilling portrayal, as Amon Goeth, who represents evil here.  Yet like Schindler, his is not a simplistic portrayal, but is someone who doesn't feel anything, except contempt and maybe a little greed.  He kills not out of pathology but rather out of boredom.  The only time we see any feelings come over him is when he decides, as an experiment, to spare people who do wrong, rather than kill them, and it shakes him, so he goes back to killing.  Also he's undone by Helen Hirsch, his maid, so he lashes out at her even more than if it was just some servant.  The genius of the movie is to see him and Schindler as closer than we would like to think.  Also, Ben Kingsley is very good.<br/><br/>Spielberg was trying to bring the reality of the Holocaust to people who didn't know about it, and maybe were being bombarded by all the hate groups who are spreading a disinformation campaign by saying it never happened.  And I think he suceeded brilliantly."
"Tet-5","10","9","18","25 December 1998"," Very impressive
","Everything about Schindler's List is impressive. Never before have I seen a more painful portrayal of the Holocaust. The horrible images about the humiliation, the fears and the pain of the Jews are combined with the extraordinary absorbing story about Oskar Schindler, great camerawork, music and acting, both from the principal characters as the minor characters. A quiet, but nevertheless very impressive scene was the one in which the personal belongings of the Jews, who just had been put on transport, were sorted out. The first time I saw Schindler's List, this shot just seemed to go on and on, and thus gave me an idea of the enormous extent of what happened to the Jewish people. We witness how war can bring out the worst in men, like it did in Amon Goeth. Men like him were given the power, the opportunity, to develop the evil qualities in their characters. Luckily, Spielberg didn't portray only the evil side of Goeth, he also showed his audience that this horrible man still was capable of feeling something for another human being, even though he didn't want himself to. Thanks to the superb performance of Ralph Fiennes, the Amon Goeth character is in every way believable. We see how war also can bring out the best in men, like it did in Oskar Schindler. Spielberg very subtly develops the relationship between Schindler and Stern. They both know Schindler's feelings changed during the war, but neither of them talks about that. But still, the audience knows, just as Schindler and Stern know. Liam Neeson was very impressive, Ben Kingsley gave one of the best performances in movie history. Many people say that Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's best movie, but I don't agree. Schindler's List has much more depth, and touched me far more deeply. It's a real masterpiece. A tip: Read the book! It gives a lot of details Spielberg couldn't show us, because of the limited length of the movie. It's worth your effort."

Slowly but surely, the National Socialist, simply called, the Nazis worked their way up.

","I saw this film at school as part of my history GCSE. Our class sat down to watch and were all rowdy and chatty as usual. After ten or so minutes the room was silent.

The reason for this was that Spielberg left nothing to the imagination, he showed every detail such as the one-armed man being shot while clearing the snow, the girl in the red coat on the pile of burning bodies, I could go on. I think that the most moving part was at the end of the film when the actor and the actual person put a stone on Schlinders grave, at that point, I could see that some people in the room were close to tears.

The whole first hour was just about this guy setting up a pots and pans factory. I was ready to just walk out at that point, but my friends wanted to stay so I was stuck there watching the rest of this.<br/><br/>I've seen many documentaries on A&E, History Channel, etc on the holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too. Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking to myself ""lets just get the heck out of here"".<br/><br/>If you never get drawn into a movie at the beginning, it can sometimes be too late - no matter if it gets better later on you can just lose any interest in it."

As a real documentary lover, I can quite distinguish the difference between a documentary and a film but this film is even much more bias than those bias documentaries. There are inaccuracies and bias towards what really happened. It is all based upon crocodile tears. One of the films that are once-a-decade-film-for- Jewish-propaganda maybe this one is sort of different because this outnumbered them in many ways.

Subsequent viewings have however confirmed that this is in fact a Masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.Take out the ""quirky"" black & white photography, which I actually found to be a bit of a wank, (the jews and nazis experienced this all in real colour not in mono in a sterile cinema), the feel and strength of the photography made me weep... I was there, I was a victim. That probably sounds very pretentious from a white, middle class, Catholic Australian, but if a movie can move me the way this did, it must have something going for it. I have seen this movie 4 times now and although the shock value has been diminished somewhat, the message remains... ignorance is deadly!

","After seeing this movie, I regret not seeing it on the silver screen, as this would have done this terrifying, magnificent, powerful film even more justice. As it is, on the TV it is a mesmerizing and gripping story. <br/><br/>I have long ago decided not to have a favorite movie. Too many films offer their own unique pleasures, and singling one out as a favorite is simply to difficult a task.<br/><br/>That being said, 'Schindler's List' is definitely one of my favorites. I am surprised at the criticism I read, but I guess that is what makes us the human race.<br/><br/>The only real flaw in the movie that I saw was near the end, where Schindler is berating himself for not saving more lives. I hope the scene occurred in real life, otherwise it just seems contrived and unnecessary. If it really happened, then the worst you can say is the Neeson simply could not convey the impact of the scene. Or perhaps Schildler really sounded like that at the time. Either way, it was a minor scratch on an other-wise magnificent film. <br/><br/>I won't comment on the films realism because my knowledge of history is weak and I expect Hollywood to take liberties. As long as they kept the spirit of the story alive, that is all that matters to me. <br/><br/>To any one who hasn't seen this movie, I definitely say: see it! It is not light viewing and parents taking their younger children--even their older children, really--should be in attendance, and remember not to dismiss this movie and the scenes therein as mere Hollywood magic. <br/><br/>While I don't pick favorites, I do believe this movie will rate higher than any other movie I have ever rated, with a 9.8 out of 10.

Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch.<br/><br/>It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it.  Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions.  Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson did give a good performance.  His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes.  Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character.  Still, I rooted for him until the end.<br/><br/>If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel.

"jbartelone","9","7","14","13 April 2008"," Almost Perfect, But Has One Serious Flaw
","There are so many heartfelt words that describe the beauty, passion, and heartbreak of Schindler's List that it would be impossible to list them all. Spielberg's captivating story of how Oscar Schindler saved 1000's of Jews from the Nazi's death camps is one of the most inspirational moments ever captivated on film. Particularly brilliant (mild spoiler here) is the director's use of black and white photography, spare a haunting scene of a little girl in a red dress crying out ""Goodbye Jews."" It is absolutely chilling, and hauntingly spell-bounding.<br/><br/>The question is, why can't I give this movie perfect 10/10 stars? I have to mention another spoiler here to explain this. There is a scene in the movie that is a sharp contrast from reality where one of the trains that is supposedly headed for Auschwitz gets misrouted, and the prisoners on the train get a cold shower with water instead of the poison gas. This one scene has always bothered me. All documents of the Holocaust show that tragically, and horrifying, when the prisoners were forced to leave their homes to go to the death camps, they were either gassed to death or tortured to death by doing some of the cruelest labor work imaginable. If you survived, it was through some of the greatest courage and determination ever known, not because of a misrouted train and ""regular"" shower.<br/><br/>In reality, no one ""escaped"" with just a water shower. But here, instead of showing the realistic horror of the death camps, Spielberg pulls away from the reality by choosing ""not to offend."" This makes no sense to me. A movie about the Holocaust should be graphic, it should be horrifying, and realistic in its telling. ""The Shower Scene"" wants viewers to think ""some lived because of a misrouted train."" This one scene sugar-coats the horror of the death camps, and hurts what otherwise is so close to a perfect film. But I will tell you about a film that is just as good as Schindler's List, even better, because NOTHING is sugar-coated. It is the NBC mini-series from the late 70's, Holocaust. That picture is still the best Holocaust film ever made. Schindler's List could have been just as good as Holocaust. Unfortunately, the fictional shower scene hurts this otherwise landmark film.<br/><br/>(I also will copy this review to the Message Board, because I want as many people to see this comment as possible. I have a feeling that I am not alone in this view of the film.)"

But maybe my view is skewed by the fact that I have actually seen other movies that deal with this subject -- from ""L'Enclos"" (out of print) to ""The Pawnbroker."" ""The Pawnbroker"" is a devastating indictment of man's inhumanity to man. ""Schindler's List"" pales by comparison.<br/><br/>Looking at the details of ""Schindler's List"", the movie opens promisingly with a wonderful assortment of authentic German cabaret songs coupled with black and white period scenes meant to evoke the raciness and fun of Berlin before the Nazis rose to power. <br/><br/>All well and good. But then the movie falls apart in its depiction of a drunken, debauched and undisciplined SS concentration camp commander whose romps take place in a cliff-hanging house overlooking the camp.<br/><br/>This is so far from the reality of what took place in the camps, and the way they were organized, as to be silly.<br/><br/>Schindler's rescue of the Jews is decently portrayed, but the movie goes into ""overblown"" mode with its drawn-out portrayal of the train approaching the gates of Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Were there crashing cymbals, a hundred violins playing, and trumpet fanfares to signify to the audience that this moment was tragic in case they hadn't already figured that out? <br/><br/>I don't remember. Let's just say that Spielberg's approach -- in this and some of his other movies -- is the very opposite of subtle.<br/><br/>Now, I really have nothing against this movie otherwise. It's okay, that's all. <br/><br/>But I'm amazed at the adulation it is receiving from an apparently uncritical cadre of adoring fans.<br/><br/>Turning the Holocaust into what amounts to a soap opera and an ego trip for the director strikes me as pathetic.

I have the disagreeable feeling that in Germany - maybe elsewhere, too - the message of movie is: ""Yes, there *were* Germans opposing nazism, but  now lets no longer talk about this topic.

There is a substantial, guaranteed segment of the cinema-going public that will accept schmaltz as art. They simply do not know the difference.<br/><br/>So, while I will accept that this is a good movie, there is no way it belongs in the top 250. Or even in the top 2500. There are too many historical inaccuracies, too many factual liberties, too many scenes overdone for deliberate shock value. The whole thing is fake. It is only vaguely based on what actually happened. Yet it is presented as a factual historical drama and has been widely accepted as such.<br/><br/>The excesses of Hitler's Germany can never be forgotten or swept under the rug, but embellishing them and making gaudy parodies of the real thing does not well serve the memory of those who suffered through it.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" was not a perfect film, either, but it is a lot better than this one."

","""Schindler's List"" (1994)<br/><br/>Schindler's List is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Grammy winning 1993 movie based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Adapted by Steven Zaillian and directed by Steven Spielberg, it relates the tale of Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten-German Catholic businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The title refers to a list of the names of 1,100 Jews whom Schindler hired to work in his factory and kept from being sent to concentration camps, and falling victim to Nazi officer Amon GÃ¶th, a sociopath who perceives Jews as ''vermin''.<br/><br/>Whilst Steven Spielberg's breathtakingly superb masterwork Schindler's List contains a vast amount of stunning shots, the one that sticks in my mind the most is found about half the way through the picture, an image of Amon GÃ¶th and Oskar Schindler sitting atop a balcony over GÃ¶th's concentration camp. The shot captures the most prolific of contrasts contained in the film. Firstly, a man so sadistic we instinctively see him as a human embodiment of 'evil'. Then on the other side of the frame is a man caught between two extremes, gradually discovering who he is and the power of the individual. Usually of course, we don't have such roles, just simply 'the good' and 'the bad'. Although this is not this case here, as we are given characters built up imaginatively and yet realistically and as a result remain incredibly deep and complex personas throughout. The majestic depiction of power in this image is so significant that the viewer can sense the stench of sovereignty coming off these people- but the mastery of the two men differ drastically. We have one who relishes in the rewards of his immorality and the scale of his power and influence. And then we have our protagonist, if you can call him that at this point in the film, at war with his own conscience, giving us the centrepiece and motivation for one of the most exquisitely told tales in the history of cinema. A superb piece, which presents massacres as real events, not figures, and portrays a complete moral transition subtly and believably, as opposed to clichÃ© smiles and corny montages. <br/><br/>Schindler's List works primarily on obvious aspects; it's ability to capture the Holocaust on a grand, monumental scale, it's glorious character study and it's staggering cinematography. But this you all know, or can decipher within your first viewing. This isn't to say these traits aren't spectacular, but we find several examples of greatness, such as the passionate directorial effort, the historical accuracy, the career-highlighting performances, the light- hearted comedic moments, the Schindler/Stern relationship and the film's emotionally stirring closing sequence, to name a few. At one point we are shown the interior of a KrakÃ³w church, which artistically transcends beauty- and yet, within seconds, we are shown the shady deals of crooks and hustlers in the rows of seats below, contrasting wonderfully. Another example is present in a a foggy shot of the Jewish ghettos, a visually stunning image, contrasted immediately by gunshots and killings. It is as if the literal contradictions mirror Schindler's moral conflict.<br/><br/>Schindler's character is, in a sense, the centre and heart of the movie. He is an example of good will, hope and ultimately help in a helpless situation. Despite this, Schindler is a womaniser, a gambler, greedy and out for himself- he isn't a leader, an idol or a superhero. He is a businessman. Midway through, a spot of colour is dashed onto the pallet, as a young girl sports a red coat, standing out immaculately over the black and white background. Does this mark Schindler's change of heart, his transcend to goodness, his epiphany? Of course not, such an occurrence wouldn't generate a total change of belief so suddenly. The image marks a realisation Schindler has about the horrors going on around him, perhaps even tapping into his conscience, but it is much later in the film that he actually acts on this in total selflessness. The motivation behind Schindler's decision is gradual, he is not a hero, nor does he wish to glorify his position as a saviour. He just truly wishes to help people, something portrayed in total realism, making it even more heart-warming. Such a pure character development creates not just a good film, but a powerful example of cinematic brilliance.<br/><br/>The film is shown on an epic scale, and admirably remains intimate and touching simultaneously. It is beautiful yet harrowing, heart-warming yet heart-wrenching, inspiring yet dismaying and all the way through displaying excellence. Schindler's List is undoubtedly a contemporary classic, and rightly so. It's ability to take us into the heart of darkness and capture the essence of hope is simply breathtaking. Whether granting lives or taking them away, brilliance is present in every shot. 10/10"
"mleu","10","9","21","26 January 2001"," One of the best movies ever made!
","Watching this movie is just three hours of full excitement. I personally have seen it several times and I am sure I will enjoy it again. Especially Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job playing the role of Amon GÃ¶th. It certainly was not easy to play this psychopath. I also like the fact that this movie crosses out, that they were also ""good"" Germans during the Nazi time. All what Oskar Schindler did at the very beginning was for his very own benefit. So it is quite amazing how he turned to be such a caring and helpful person. And the part of Itzhak Stern is also just great! First he played along with Schindler's plan because this brought him to the position to help his fellow people. He did not like Schindler at all, he even refused to have a drink with him. But step by step he realized how Schindler's character really was. And near the end, when Schindler offered to have a drink with him at the end of the war, he preferred to have one straight away. In my opinion watching this movie is just a MUST!!"
"jew102","10","9","21","30 August 1999"," This is what movies are all about.
","This is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, yet it is uplifting to hear a story about a man who cared so much.  In a time of great sadness and tragedy, it's nice to know that not all men were mad with thoughts of world dominance.  Oscar Schindler earned the praise that this movie gives him.  Of course anything Steven Spielberg makes is almost destined for greatness.  I applaud Mr. Schindler for his courageous actions in World War II and Mr. Spielberg for giving Schindler his due respect.  This movie gives you a feeling that is almost unexplainable.

The topic of the holocaust is all there on PBS specials as well. There was an Elvis t.v. series done in b&w in the 90's, and it sank after 4 episodes. Mention Saving Private Ryan as a great current war movie, gritty,witty, and you might hear a pin drop. SPR became a turning point when movies became more of a risk with the audience.Less about the income and more about the outcome. I am reading Collapse, How some modern societies are in danger of killing themselves. Just because we fought off Hitler, it doesn't make it our choice to get personal with it's history. It was a war that had to be fought, and put behind us like you do with work that is done."
"precision_spared","8","5","10","23 September 2014"," Missed the Point
","I don't want to say that this film is bad. I am part Jewish, though my family, at least the part that I know about, was already in the the U.S. I hate that this is THE film about the holocaust, because to say anything negative about the film has become almost an antisemitic statement, as characterized by the Seinfield episode where Jerry has sex in the movie theater playing this film.<br/><br/>This film is just not a top ten film any way that you cut it. The acting is good. The camera work is stellar. This is a beautiful film. There are parts to this film that are pure genius. The concept of fleeting life and showing characters shot dead and flailing lifelessly are amongst the most poignant and cinematic in the history of film. So why is this film ""over rated."" It was Kubrick that once said that this film is about hope in the face of loss, and the holocaust was about that very loss and the failing of humanity to stop it. Like many of Spielberg's films, this is a melodrama that attempts to educate us about this tragedy through our heart. So much of the plot is dedicated to the womanizing of the title character to exhibit his arc. This is a film about one man's redemption in how he saves the Jews. <br/><br/>It is much in the way that Saving Private Ryan is about redemption in combat and saving that one man. This films are about saving things with tragedy in the backdrop. The tragedy and the random horrors of life are never treated seriously. While Schindler's Jews survived, many of the Jews that even made it to the end of the war did not. Many more did not than did. By trying to show civilization's humanity during a period of time where it did not exist, you attempt to own history and look down at it from a place of contempt. We know so much better."

","Contrary to popular belief, the Malaysian Government did NOT ban the film. All the Govt wanted was to edit/delete NUDITY scenes in keeping with the country's strict censorship laws (and laws against public nudity) which applies to ALL films, not just this one.<br/><br/>However Mr Spielberg's petulant & intransigent insistence that the film be unadulterated (no one censors HIS films, you see) meant that the film could not be seen at cinemas.<br/><br/>Malaysia did however allow the DVD to be rented/purchased hence people could still see the film in the privacy of their homes. The same policy applied to Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of Christ"" where the Government did NOT ban the film. It simply stipulated tickets be sold strictly at Christian churches only. Not bad policies & compromises when you consider that this IS a Muslim country."

","This film is Spielberg's true masterpiece.  It depicts something that is so hard to describe, a story so hard to tell in true honesty.  But it was. True brutal honesty.  I can definitely see why this film won Best Picture.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that this was probably the ONLY film I have seen that has brought me close to tears, it has other characteristics that also make this such a technical work of art.  The black & white tone of the film was not only there to make it seem like a dark and dreary film, but to make other, more important aspects, stand out.  In one scene you see a girl running into a building; the girl is wearing a red coat.  It stands out among all the shades of gray to symbolize something important: the death and suffering of the holocaust.  In another scene, dead bodies are pulled away as Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) watches.  The corpses' blood is pure red, to show the major amount and therefore pointlessness of their bloodshed.  In one of the last scenes in the film, Jews light a bright orange flame which is ignited on the candle.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that this is the most spectacular piece of work ever accomplished (after all it was pretty slow and almost 3 1/2 hours long), but it is something.  This is a film that can never, ever be forgotten.  Well done, Spielberg.<br/><br/>10 / 10 stars."

","It's not that Schindler's List is a bad movie; in parts, it's quite powerful.  What has always annoyed me about this film, however, was the way it was so unreservedly embraced by critics and unsophisticated moviegoers. Seriously, am I the only one who was unimpressed by the main ethical point of the movie? Really, what does this film have to say beyond, ""the Holocaust was a bad thing?""  I'm sorry if I don't consider this to be groundbreaking, cutting-edge historical analysis.  Furthermore, am I the only one who was offended that Spielberg made a fundamentally ""feel good"" movie about the holocaust?  Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)?  Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)?  What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself.  I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before.  Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long.  The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better."

"j30bell","7","8","20","20 December 2004"," A heart warming tale of mass murder and genocide
","""Gawd bless you mister Schindler"", is one of the few phrases not to appear in Schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a Frank Capra film. Well, to be fair, the phrase ""Shoot her now, on my authority"" isn't in It's a Wonderful Life either. <br/><br/>Schindler's List - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand Jews from Krakow Ghetto during WWII - is one of the Sacred Cows of modern cinema. This is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of Stephen - ooh what a long film I'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - Spielberg. <br/><br/>Schindler's List is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. Kingsley reprises his role as Gandhi and Fiennes and Neeson look fab in black and white. There is also nice mutual tension and understanding between Schindler and Goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable. <br/><br/>Having said all that, the film can be really infuriating. <br/><br/>Why, for instance, does Spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? Does the film really need this kind of ""legitimacy"" for audiences to take it seriously?<br/><br/>And where are the Jewish characters? I can almost hear Spielberg with his screenwriters... ""Woody, hi, I'd like you to do Schindler and Goeth"". ""Ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! But what about the Jews huh - I think I could do really good job with some of the Jewish Characters"" Woody Allen replies. ""Yeah, hear what you say Woody, but I've promised that to my old buddy George Lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the Yellow Peril, or the Phantom Menace or something"". One review of Schindler's List describes Stern as ""Schindler's conscience"" and that's just about it. Spielberg has outsourced his casting for Jewish characters to Jimny Cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity.<br/><br/>In fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see Spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. You get the sophisticated monster clichÃ©, with the Stormtrooper playing Mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto. You get the violent guard cooing over a Jewish baby ""Ein kind, ein kind!"" You get the Goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. And, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where Schindler makes his final transition to Avatar of the Almighty.<br/><br/>Then there's the death. Young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - I wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. But, you know, I struggle to remember any adult Jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. Did these deaths not count? David Irving would be delighted.<br/><br/>However the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in European history. It deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. Tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, Spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us ET and Close Encounters. Surely the point about Schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. The danger of this film is that the MTV generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction Â there'll always be a saint like Oscar Schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10."

","Schindler's List is undeniably one of the most emotionally moving films ever made, not only for the Jewish people, but for humanity. The perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if they felt like it, for no reason. <br/><br/>The film has a great cinematography, that really captures the intensity of the situations and scenes. The plot is good, and moves along at a good pace, though it will test your patience if you aren't interested in the subject of the film (though I don't really see why anyone wouldn't be, at the very least, interested). The acting is all great, by every single actor, but the one I really noticed was Liam Neeson, who portrays Oskar Schindler, a character who undergoes a major development through the film. The script is good, as it allows the audience to see an accurate depiction of just about every single situation that Jews were in, during the war. It is a depressing film, yes, and a sad one, since it tells a very disturbing story, but it should be seen by just about anyone who can sit through it(it does have some violent scenes, but nothing very graphic), as it is a very important and beautiful movie. Any person who considers him or herself to be literate and intelligent should see this movie at least once. You don't get a more accurate portrayal of the horror of being a Jew during that time than this. I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit through it, both concerning the length and the violence in it. 10/10"

If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the surviovors.

I couldn't even watch it at once. I had to do it in increments because it was just too emotionally wrenching for me, even at that age. I applaud high school teachers who show this to their students because of its cultural significance as well as as accurate a representation as you can get to seeing those horrific events in human history through film media. That being said, it's a hard watch and it stays with you for a long time after you see it. A very long time. When the little girl in the red coat hides under the bed and her coat changes to black and white... I just can't. You just can't handle the sadness (at least I couldn't). At the age I am now, I definitely understand and appreciate the film more, but I have only watched bits and pieces of it since. However, I still can't sit down and watch the whole movie. I was never a Spielberg fan, but this movie shows what a genius he really is. As a side note, Liam Neeson was robbed that year at the Oscars. He was no doubt best actor."

"mackrj-34546","10","2","3","13 November 2019"," Schindler's List
","It took legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg to direct The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, both certainly very underrated films of his filmography, to earn himself as a ""serious"" director doing ""serious"" movies for a change. It was 1983 and Sid Sheinberg, the then President and CEO of Universal Studios, bought the rights of a book based upon the story of Oskar Schindler and handed over to Spielberg, which - at the time - Spielberg refused to do the movie because he wasn't ready. Ten years later, he was ready and made one of the most historically significant movies ever made. Without further ado, this is my review of Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Based upon the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, this true story is about Oskar Schindler, (Liam Nesson) a womanizer, war profiteer, party animal and a member of the German Army. It was the beginning of World War II in September 1939 where the German Army defeated the Polish Army in two weeks. In favor, the German Army and the Third Reich has invaded Krakow, to force Jewish communities to work for them and caused the murders of innocent lives. Out of the blue, Schindler notices that the Jews are suddenly decreasing in their population. As Schindler bribes the German Army to put Jews into his factory, more lives are being saved, including Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. (Sir Ben Kingsley) Taking notice of this going on is Commander Amon GÃ¶th, (Ralph Fiennes) a psychopath who murders many innocent lives for, sometimes, no apparent reason. The more Schindler bribes him, the more lives are saved and Schindler, with Stern on his side, creates a list of names for the Jews to go to his factory in his hometown. When the war is over, after six long years, Schindler had saved more the 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. Because of what he did, he inspired generations.<br/><br/>I first saw Schindler's List when I was fifteen on VHS, unaware that my favorite filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, has directed this movie. The moment the movie was over after 195 minutes, I left my room stunned and couldn't fall asleep that night. The movie was a shocker and unlike any movie that I had ever seen before. It was an un-Spielberg type of film because I'm used to his science fiction filns like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind and action films like Raiders of the Lost Ark. I went to school the next morning, still mesmerized and thinking about the film of how gritty, painful and beautifully shot it really was and still is today. Then, I felt inspiration in it that all kinds of people can save innocent lives from the curse of evildoers in the world.<br/><br/>Today, since I'm a grown adult, I watched the movie again and I couldn't find any flaw whatsoever in this marvelous story of good vs. evil in the history of film. The direction by Spielberg was so much more than just brilliantly done, but it's as though he was like Sir David Lean behind the camera. He masterminded the subject matter that must be seen by, not only fans of cinema, but for people all over the world to see how horrifying the Holocaust was at the time. The movie is also well written, well designed, well photographed, well edited, well casted. It was very well done. It still shocks me to this day that Tommy Lee Jones won Best Supporting Actor for The Fugitive over Ralph Fiennes for his incredible acting of a cruel man, in this case ""soldier"", with a mental illness. The movie overall won seven Oscars that year, including Best Picture and Director, and it was rightfully deserved.<br/><br/>Before I conclude this review, I want to give a special shout out to the man who created the emotional elements to the film in the music. John Williams. Of course, the man is a legendary composer and conductor, but the score is beautiful, heartbreaking and tear-jerking to this day and I still find myself wiping tears from my eyes from listening to the Oscar-winning score. Bravo, Mr. Williams!<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a must-see film that the entire world needs to see. Even if there is Holocaust-denyers in this world, but ignore their denial and watch what really happened in those six painful years of suffering, death and slavery. This is not movie magic. It's not even a movie to feel entertained. It's an informative piece of art that describes how moviemaking can change to the next level. It's the eighth greatest movie of all time, based on the American Film Institute. If you are watching this movie for the first time, bring lots of tissues, skip the popcorn and soda and pay attention to this movie. I highly recommend this movie, even if you think Spielberg is overrated. Always remember the man that, not only saved one life, but saved the world entire.<br/><br/>10/10"
"cinephile-27690","10","1","1","14 May 2020"," The Most Human Movie Ever Made.
","This is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. I dare you to challenge this. Sure, ET is great, and so is Jurassic Park, and so forth. But of all the movies Spielberg has directed, how can any of them top the power and importance of Schindler's List?<br/><br/>Schindler's List is the true story of Oskar Schindler, portrayed wonderfully by Liam Neeson. He is a German who saves the lives of over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. Schindler does this out of greed, making them low wage workers in his factory for his benefit, but then he does it out of compassion for his fellow man.<br/><br/>That's the theme of the movie that echoes throughout long after the credits roll, and from where the film's power stems. The Nazis considered Jews to be ""vermin"" and not humans worthy of love, care, or compassion. Oskar Schindler over time sees that they ARE in fact worthy, and uses this basic human value to change the world.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg waited over a decade to make this movie. He wanted to it after making E.T., but he felt that he wasn't ready to tackle the Holocaust yet. (Note that Spielberg himself is Jewish.) The time he took is well worth it, since he crafted it so well.<br/><br/>The movie won 7 Oscars, including Steven's sole Best Picture win and his first of 2 Best Director wins(the other being for Saving Private Ryan). All 7 are well earned for this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg also chose to shoot this in black and white, based on documentaries he saw with actual Holocaust footage. This was done to make the movie seem even more real, and this goal succeeds.<br/><br/>This was also done so a girl with a pink coat can stand out. While she never speaks, she inspires Schindler to have compassion for the Jews, she's a sight that speaks to him louder than words. In addition, the black and white cinematography is glorious to look at.<br/><br/>Since this movie is centered around the greatest tragedy in all of human history, the film gains an R Rating for it's realistic violence. Prepare for Jews to be shot, burned, or gassed for what they believe in. It's hard to watch, but it's the most effective quality. There were people who took pleasure in killing millions of their own kind, and Spielberg exposes this horror to perfection.<br/><br/>I first saw this in 10th grade in History class, so I was 16. I would say 15 or 16 would be the best age to see this, and 13-14 if there is parental supervision since younger teens may have questions about the Holocaust, and for emotional support. I say this because while everyone should see Schindler's List, it is not for the young, and historical prior knowledge is necessary.<br/><br/>Aside from the flaw of crimes against humanity, my only critique of Schindler's List is that the German accents of Non-German actors are so thick that I needed subtitles to follow the dialogue. Apart from this, Schindler's List is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Despite it's grim subject matter, Schindler's List must be seen, even if just once. Seeing it for the 4th time in my life put it in my top 10. Thank you, Oskar Schindler for your heroic act, and thank you Steven Spielberg for telling us his incredible story.<br/><br/>This is a powerful film that will leave a great impact on you. It should never be forgotten. If all but a few movies are wiped away from human memory, let Schindler's List be one that remains.<br/><br/>Note: This ties with Shoah in my top 10. This is a 9.5 hour documentary with real survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust. It's $100 from the Criterion Collection. This is another movie that I consider to be a must see, despite its cost and run-time."

","The problem is that people in the US have lowered their standards and are accepting more and more mediocre crap instead of insisting upon quality. Surprisingly many American people claim ""The 300"" as their favorite movie. They believe it's based on a true story! No wonder Schindler's List didn't make an attempt to ward itself off from the wire of sh!t out there in Hollywood. I think Hollywood is completely out of new and original ideas. Plus the quality of actors has gone down a lot... In addition to this, I think they try to rely too much on special effects and theme music to push a movie nowadays. The plots are thin and don't make any sense at all, the actors have no feeling, there's no character development and everything is pretty much clichÃ©' or just a patchwork/ remake of other movies (like the Matrix, Blade, Star Wars, etc...) They don't know how to balance special effects and acting anymore. <br/><br/>0/10"

A note about the use of black and white.  This is a master-stroke by Spielberg.  The impact is extreme especially when the few touches of color are added for effect.  <br/><br/>Another note about the director.  In SO many of Spielberg's movies, he is right up front with his direction.  When you see one of his movies, you KNOW it.  If I did not know Spielberg had directed it, I would have been surprised to find out.  He steps back from the material and lets the story tell itself.<br/><br/>EVERYBODY should see this movie at least once.  Spielberg will NEVER do anything as good."
"virek213","10","9","26","31 July 2001"," One of the most important films of modern times
","Some events in human history are of such a magnitude that no single film made anywhere, least of all Hollywood, can ever do them complete justice. But in 1993 Steven Spielberg put all his heart and soul into a film about the greatest injustice that Man has ever foisted upon his fellow man--the Holocaust.  SCHINDLER'S LIST is the result.<br/><br/>This epic movie, shot in a somber, documentary-style black-and-white, focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a savvy Nazi businessman who had opened an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland after the Nazis basically overran it.  Schindler was every bit the womanizer and con man, and initially he saw the Jewish people of the Krakow ghetto as potential slave labor, nothing more.  But when it became rather clear to him what his fellow Nazis were doing to the Jews, he began to use his powers of persuasion to shield his workers and their families.  In doing so, he somehow managed to save twelve hundred lives from extinction.<br/><br/>Spielberg clearly does not gloss over Schindler's gamier side, though he may be accused of romanticizing it.  But he also does not spare us the horrible fact of the Nazis wiping out at least six million people because they were Jews, and perhaps three times as many more of other ""inferior"" peoples. Ralph Fiennes is about as chilling a villain as there could possibly be, since he's portraying the notorious Auschwitz death guard Amon Goeth.  This is a film about pain, death, and murder on a scale never before seen in human history (and, if we're lucky, which will never been seen again).  But it is also about redemption.  Oskar Schindler was no saint; and for each life he saved, at least 5000 more died.  But he did as much as he possibly could, and went broke doing it.  For that, there is a place in heaven for him.<br/><br/>Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Director (which Spielberg clearly deserved long before this), SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important films of modern times, a monumental statement against hatred from a master of the cinema."
"clermontd","10","9","26","27 July 2001"," One of My Favorite Films
","I first saw Schindler's List on it's opening weekend.  The theater was full. One of the most remarkable things I observed was the stone silence of the audience, I felt awkward just picking up my soda.<br/><br/> As a person who has a great deal of interest in the Holocaust and WWII in general and has been to both The Holocaust Museum in Washington and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, I found this film realistic and deeply moving.  For those who found the film 'boring' or yet another opportunity to question Spielberg's ability I am sorry that they missed a great movie.<br/><br/>The appeal of this film is that it is based on a true story. If this were not so, it would not be anywhere near the top ten as a movie.  The power of this film comes from the fact that Oskar Schindler and his list actually existed.  This powerful reality of 'Schindler's List' overrides the lack of whiz bang entertainment or the minutia of fine film making.<br/><br/>I judge a film by how I feel about it immediately afterward and again the next day.  Normally, I stand up, grab my keys and get back to reality. In the case of Schindler's List I didn't shake it for a while, I wasn't even conversational for probably an hour.<br/><br/> I also would like to address the issue of the little girl in the red coat. The value, to me, in this twist was to point out that each death was a personal tragedy, that these were individuals, not merely faceless masses from a black and white documentary.  If any of us sat and wondered about her individual story, even for a second, Spielberg was successful.<br/><br/> I will leave the analysis of character development, casting, and Spielberg himself to the pseudo-intellectuals who frequent this site, but to me Schindler's List was a powerful film."

","OK, first the good. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent. So is the casting. The movie-making is good. The choice of stories was phenomenal. The last scene (the one in color) was exceptionally powerful, deserving to be on the greatest scenes list of all time. <br/><br/>Now for the bad. <br/><br/>Schindler's List is a holocaust movie made without a fundamental understanding of the Holocaust. Yes, they get the bare bones facts right enough, but the movie is two dimensional at best. Everyone in the movie fits into a different category, with very little variation in characters within a given category. Either they are Jewish or they are non Jewish, and if they are non Jewish, they are either evil anti Semites or reformed heroes. If they are Jewish, they all act the same. Their reaction is uniformly ""if only I could do something, I would, but I can't, so the only thing left is to live and die honorably, which means being silent when things happen."" There is one Jew who can do something, but other than that, they are all like cardboard cutouts. For me, the impact of a movie comes from seeing people react to different situations, even painful ones, but from seeing REALISTIC and THREE DIMENSIONAL people reacting to situations. Schindler's List totally lacked that, so, to me, even though the movie is about something I am very interested in, the movie was exceptionally dull and uninteresting. It was not powerful at all. In addition, the historical accuracy was marginal."
"jon_hughes78","4","6","16","27 October 2007"," There are pieces of a good movie here, it's just not a good movie
","Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan share similar questions: in the former, how much money is a life worth; in the latter, how many lives is a life worth? Very good questions, and Spielberg ham-handedly beats a response out of us in each film. He employs two story-telling techniques, both to the utmost extreme: visceral sensationalism and morbid sentimentality.<br/><br/>To turn the focus on the movie being reviewed - Schindler's List uses a horror film approach to movie-making to keep us properly frightened and cowering in the corner. At some point it stops being about somber remembrance and turns into a gruesome series of predictions: he'll be shot - he's too overly sympathetic; he'll make it - he had too much screen time to be executed; she'll die - the violin telegraphs it... and so on.<br/><br/>Spielberg's greatest sin is that he underestimates his audience. We don't need to be bludgeoned into three minutes of silence. The atrocity was great, and sixty years later the wounds are still painful. All we need is to be simply ushered into a fresh realization of the holocaust - and Schindler's story is a particularly poignant way to accomplish this.<br/><br/>At some point during the movie Schindler speaks of true power - the ability to pardon. Yet Spielberg drags this movie past the three hour mark, emotionally executing each and every viewer. My edit of this movie would have excised the sloppy and insincere sentimentality, and spared (pardoned) the audience so many streams of blood that the scenes lost any impact the victims' deaths might have contained. (not to mention, my edit wouldn't try so hard to convince that all women in WWII slept topless!)<br/><br/>I also fault the movie for setting Schindler up as Jesus Christ (we're bought with a price!). I'm still trying to decide if Spielberg wants to insult or convert the Jews he is sympathizing with. After Schindler dropped his cross... er, ring in the sand I half expected him to be crucified for war crimes.<br/><br/>I give the film credit for a tremendously impacting ending. We see, and can truly honor for enduring hell, the Jews whom Schindler saved. <br/><br/>For a properly restrained and truly honoring treatment of the topic of the Jews during WWII, watch Episode 9 of Band of Brothers. Thanks for that anyways, Steven."

","This is almost certainly the finest film I have seen to date, with Saving Private Ryan, another Spielberg film coming a fairly close second. Everything about this film is designed to try and raise awareness of actual events in their gruesome detail. Spielberg should be credited for using moderation to get the message across. There are scenes of violence, but overall the film is all the more effective for the implication of what is to come. Fiennes is chilling as the camp commandant, doubly so when you realise that this was an actual person who actually did the things shown, and all this less than a lifetime ago. Cinematography was superb throughout, and the brave decision to shoot in black and white adds to the authentic feel of the film. The final scenes are particularly emotional, and many people in the cinema were crying at the end. This film should be required viewing for any holocaust denier types, or just to those who have no concept of how evil men can be to their fellow man. Many people in Germany were left shocked after watching this film, because it's not the sort of thing that is discussed in depth over there (according to my German friend). 10/10"

","Oh-dear; I'm afraid I must inevitably ruffle some self-righteous feathers here.<br/><br/>Before the Juggernaut rolls, let me just say that I am not a holocaust denialist. Quite the contrary; I have several books relating to the subject including Martin Gilbert's acclaimed, definitive and enormous work, which I have read right through, and thoroughly accept as fact.<br/><br/>What is shown in this movie is almost certainly as meticulously researched, if for no other reason than that some - like me, perhaps - would shout out 'hey; that ain't true', and make a big fuss about zionist dishonesty etc, etc, if misrepresentations came to light. In any case, there are still enough survivors with suitably vivid memories and whose witness testimony is readily available. One suspects that they, of all people, would most object to any omissions or inaccuracies, depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>So we can take as a kosher work.<br/><br/>But somehow this just didn't cut it for me. I didn't find the principal characters believable. I didn't understand Schindler at all. His reformation from grasping capitalist to saintly cost-no-object saviour was never adequately explained. Perhaps the man himself was too much of an enigma to be understood by others. Whatever the case, I couldn't identify with him. There were times when his suave slightly-reckless, man-of-action persona bore an uncanny resemblance to Indiana Jones, and I began to wonder if Mr Spielberg was having slight de-ja-vue associations with his most famous creation.<br/><br/>Neither could I begin to understand the motivation of Ranulph Feinnes' character. He was evidently a lunatic from my standpoint, but attempts to portray his personality left more questions than answers.<br/><br/>The scenes of brutality were, if anything, rather less harrowing than some of the descriptions I have read. Though they were frightful to behold even so.<br/><br/>And I thought the lighting itself - especially at night - was well worthy of the Oscar that it gained.<br/><br/>It's not clear to me why a child was singled-out for colour treatment in what was a specifically black and white production. Did the director think his audience was too dumb to recognise her, despite the constant camera-tracking? This struck me as particularly crass.<br/><br/>It was a long movie, and perhaps deservedly so. But the specialised nature of its subject makes it one for students of the holocaust rather than mainstream movie fans.<br/><br/>I've described this movie as Jewish propaganda and that deserves explanation. Propaganda is not necessarily lies, but sometimes the truth can be told in different ways. Selective bias, if you like. In this case, we have a movie that was directed by a Jew, financed by Jews, using Jewish facilities (Hollywood), and starring Jews. And, moreover, it depicts Jews as victims and never victimisers - Which is probably how they envisage themselves as a people. And with the best will in the world, I cannot see how that can be anything BUT propaganda.<br/><br/>When the day comes that I see Mr Spielberg make a movie about the sufferings of a people of that ghetto we may not mention - called the Gaza Strip - a people who are crowded together just as the Warsaw Jews were, who are brutalised by their Fascist task-masters in Tel-Aviv; who are starved, beaten, bulldozed, bombed, summarily arrested, tortured and murdered, denied electricity even for essential services, and whose land is stolen by a master-race that claims a higher title to it - well, then l'll begin to believe in the unbiased nature of Hollywood. And the devil will be wearing thermal underwear.<br/><br/>By the way, there are no prizes for guessing why and how it won so many Oscars."

The cruel joke/ thriller element to the old man who is nearly executed but is saved by the sheer chance that a gun jams twice! The scene had the same potential to keep an audience on its seat as say, an actual thriller!<br/><br/>4. The overly simplistic view of the Nazis as completely evil. This one I can understand. I wouldn't expect any Jewish person to even attempt to see Nazis as nothing more than aberrations of humanity.<br/><br/>5. An incredibly manipulative collection of closing scenes; first the ""I could have done more"" speech that Schindler gives as he's inundated by those he saved is tailor made for emotional assault, as he's praised like a strangely Christ-like figure.<br/><br/>6. Final shot of the actual Schindler Jews paying tribute to his grave. What about the other six million? <br/><br/>7. And finally, the worst of the worst - the girl in the red coat. In order to fully grasp that the Holocaust is bad, really bad - because otherwise Jews and gentile alike would not be able to grasp this - he displays a girl in a washed out red coat and then shows her red coat on a cart of dead bodies. If that isn't cheap, exploitation, then honestly tell me what is.<br/><br/>In the end the movie is typically well made - excellent cinematography, seamless editing, strong acting, entertainingly fast paced - in other words a Hollywood movie. Should that be the definitive way to represent the Hollocaust?"

","I thought SCHINDLER`S LIST was a masterpiece when I first saw it a few years ago and having seen it again a couple of times over the years I find myself admiring it less and less after each subsequent viewing . This is down to my gut feeling that the film sugarcoats many events , especially the eponymous character . Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one ."
"natyakar","10","4","10","25 October 2013"," The movie could have shown a little more about Oskar Schindler
","The movie picks up the essence of the man Oskar Schindler. The movie could have done with a little more portrayal of his actual background like his joining the intelligence service of Nazi Germany in 1936 or his joining the Nazi Party in 1939. The movie also doesn't mention the fact that In 1939, when Schindler obtained the enamelware factory in KrakÃ³w, Poland, it employed over 700 non-Jewish workers as well. A little bit could have added on how Oskar siphoned them off. However, the compiling and typing of the list of 1,200 Jews using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg by GÃ¶th's secretary Mietek Pemper is portrayed as realistically as it gets. It congeals the title ""Schindler's List"" and essence of the movie. A snapshot of real history Overall, the movie stays true to the spirit of Australian novelist Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"". In my book, this is the most serious work of Spielberg. A must-see. And even if one doesn't like 'serious', the storytelling is as grabbing and inimitable as only Steven Spielberg can tell"

","Reading other comments I was surprised... Everybody calls it ""the best Holocaust movie (somethimes even the best movie) ever made. Well, I believed this statements. But when I watched the film to the end I understood that, letÂ´s be fair, that is Steven Spielberg, one of the most commercial directors of modern Hollywood, and everything he makes is considered to be brilliant - either it is ""Jurassic Park"", filled with plastic dinosaurs or black-and-white Holocaust film ""SchindlerÂ´s List"", which is considered (I donÂ´t know, why) his masterpiese, and  the best Holocaust movie ever made in HOLLYWOOD - remember that ""Schindler's List"" is a UNIVERSAL PICTURES AMBLIN ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS. But ""Schindler's List""  is far not a masterpiece. It smells with Hollywood and has a happy end, oversentimental episoodes (In the end Schindler suddenly falls in tears and regrets he could not have saved more jews)... Although Spielberg in each interview keeps saying that he ""had to change his usual style"", but unfortunately he didnÂ´t succeed in this. By the way, the last five years Spielberg seems to be very interested in the tragic moments of every nation - maybe because it is a very politically correct and successful production. After ""Schindler's List"" he made ""Amistad"" a boring and spielbergian saga about black slaves. Then - ""Saving Private Ryan"", the movie, which topic ""touched"" Spielberg no more than the topic of ""Titanic"" touched James Cameron. No, Spielberg just wanted to tell us that he is still the greatest director in the world, and that he is still able to shoot patriotic and touching films about americans saving the world. No doubt we can expect him to do features about the sufferings Chinese, Russian or Serbian people in order to win more Oscars and earn more money. So, please, watch this movie more attentively and you will understand what am I talking about."
"vbz","8","4","10","20 April 1999"," By no means perfect
","This grandiose opus Spielberg directed to cement his name as a ""serious"" filmmaker, stands in a very dubious position : its very subject is so sacred and untouchable to the civilized world (including film critics), that questioning the film's integrity as of late has been almost equated to denying the Holocaust itself. The truth, however is bitter: ""Schindler's List"" is far from perfect. Spielberg, previously known for his family-oriented, gawking adventure yarns that usually were as far away from tangible reality as possible, indeed has surprised everyone with the heartwrenching brutality of the Jewish victims' suffering, which he vividly depicts. The most powerful scenes in the film work on a purely instinctive level: they're silent and do not involve familiar individuals, they play almost like some perversely voyeuristic yet priceless footage of Nazi atrocities. The wisely chosen, eloquent black and white cinematography is a definite highlight. Everything else, for the most part, has Spielberg at his old game: he was always best at spectacle, and worst at character development. A dozen or so Jews are singled out as ""types"", and are traced throughout the film. In over three hours, we learn absolutely nothing about them, they're merely sheep to be saved by Schindler. The man himself is provided with almost no real explanation for his change from an opportunistic slaveowner to a righteous saint-like figure. In the last ten minutes, he simply steps out of character and lapses into a stagy farewell; seductively tearjerking, but completely out of place in a movie that aspires to an authentic representation of the Holocaust. The only character that even begins to approach three-dimensionality is the local Nazi henchman , (Ralph Fineness), one of the most interesting portrayals of a villain in recent cinema. Despite its considerable problems, ""Schinler's list"" is still widely used to introduce the new, unsophisticated audience to the mid-twentieth century horrors: whether or not is should be, remains open to debate."

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","5","14","22 October 2007"," How could Jews be that submissive?
","This film was and still is a revolution in our approach of the Shoah, the Holocaust, the extermination of the Jews during the second world war. It reveals in shocking images the tactics used by the Nazis to capture the Jews, here in Poland, in order to seize their possessions and to transform them into slaves. In each city of some importance all the Jews of a region were compelled to regroup and live entirely within the militarily controlled limits of a ghetto. Then the Nazi Party imposed the election or appointing of a Jewish Council to manage the ghetto, that is to say to implement the orders from the Nazis. Then some businessmen, essentially industrialists came to provide the Jews with work and there the Jews became consenting even if forced slaves and later on the ghettos will be liquidated and forced labor camps will further transform the Jews into inmates forced to work for the businessman and kept in order by some SS unit. The value of the film comes from the fact that the industrialist concerned in Krakow, Schindler himself, comes from previously independent Czechoslovakia and is a member of the Nazi party with important connections in Berlin that gives him the upper hand even on the SS. It is unluckily slightly difficult to believe it since the connections are not brought within our knowledge. Who could in Nazi Germany be more powerful than the SS? The film will show how much money this man was able to make with that slave labor. Real fortunes that enabled him to double his political influence with financial corruption. But there it shows how the Jews from the very beginning (the order to go and live in the closest ghettos) right to the very end (either their being sent to Auschwitz to be gassed or being saved and freed by Schindler) will always disbelieve the worst news they could get and always believe in some kind of higher order that will either sacrifice them or save them, that order being from another dimension of time and space. Is it divine, is it a God, is it some kind of cosmic force? No one knows which one, but it is a force against which you cannot do anything. You have to submit and survive if it so pleases this force. This submissiveness is never questioned and hardly contrasted to some Jewish individuals, and only individuals, who would have thought of resisting, or at least escaping. No matter what happens, they sing a song of lamentation or a song of thanks, but they were reduced to a herd of cattle and they submitted to that fate. It is pathetic to see how Schindler's Jews do not protest against any violence or whatever. They just, on arriving in Auschwitz, call the name of their ""Nazi Master"", Schindler himself. They have been reduced to being Schindler's herd. The vision is absolutely disquieting, disturbing, sickening. That definitely is the worst part of such a war. And that absolute alienation is constantly brought back by any war, be it in Palestine, in Lebanon or in Iraq. That's were the film is poignant and at the same time finds its limit. The film avoids all other types of exterminated group, ethnic or not, because all these other groups produced another attitude: rebellion, refusal, fight, struggle. It is also important to see that even in Poland, even in these ghettos, even within these Jewish Councils there was some refusal, rebellion, even a rebellion in the name of freedom in spite of it meaning immediate death: better die than submit to the final degradation, alienation, internalized victimization. Stephen Spielberg hence does not reflect the whole historical truth but favors one approach only. That explains why the film feels as having aged with time and the end definitely becomes morbidly sentimental: love and gratefulness for the one who made them slaves and only saved them because they were his property that he bought with the money they produced. He is only saving his own possessions, like a rancher would protect his herd. The ending thus is too positive to be acceptable. If the Jews had been able to massively move into rebellion, resistance, guerrilla warfare or even plain warfare, the war could have been different. We are speaking of more than two million Jews just in Poland. To run down such a human wall you need time and quite a lot of tanks and planes. Hence it does not bring in any profit but cost a tremendous amount of money. Could Hitler have afforded it without having to cut some further actions short? A beautiful black and white film but that only shows one side of the picture.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

"moviefan-50","7","3","7","13 April 2001"," Powerfully disturbing film with lack of credibility/unnecessary storyline of Oskar Schindler
","No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though, if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no ""other"" unnecessary characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.<br/><br/>I do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the imprisoned actually was. Please watch documentaries on the Holocaust, research more through books and legitimate media, if you want the true facts."

","I'm not going to say that this film was boring and black and white is stupid because those things would be wrong. I am part of the group of people who dislike every film Spielberg got his hands on. Spielberg has a way of making the imagery mild entertaining and the story not the least bit compelling. It always has the annoyance through-out his films that just makes me think that he is doing everything wrong. An example of how much I hate his films: I thought Jurassic Park III was a masterpiece compared to Jurassic Park I. <br/><br/>Onto the film. This film has quite good cinematography, which is probably the only reason why I kept watching it. As far as the performance of Liam Neeson, I wasn't convinced in the least. Which confused me because he was pretty good in everything else. Also, I read that Billy Wilder wanted to direct it because he had many relatives die in the holocaust. Steven Spielberg turned him down. Now, that just angers me. One, I hate him. Two, that makes him a terrible person. Three, this could've been an even better movie than what PEOPLE think it is right now. I went into this movie with expectations of an average movie. It wasn't that I was extremely let down from what I thought was a masterpiece. I was extremely let down into thinking I was going to be watching an average film.<br/><br/>I don't want anyone to think I don't have the attention span or the understanding of films to understand this film. ""Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler"" is one of my all-time favorites. I'm not going to lie here. I did like the IDEA of the part where Oscar Schindler was going around saying that he could've saved one more life. And I think he dropped to his knees. But the acting Spielberg directed Liam Neeson to do made it worse than it should have been."

"nathanielqwilson","3","4","11","25 August 2018"," It could have been amazing but it's just oscar bait.
","What I really dislike about this movie is that it I think I was really mislead about what it was. Whether the movie itself, its marketing or just word of mouth is to blame I can't say.<br/><br/>I believed it was meant to be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews. Which I was fine to see. But what I got instead was some candid exhibition of the holocaust with the Schindler plot kind of tacked on for good measure.
I can agree that we should have a really well-made holocaust movie out there but it's the duplicity of the picture that sits unwell with me. The scenes are disconnected and episodic which would have been appropriate if only it could have been established that this experience was the focus of the movie but since there is a pretence of a linear plot that we only get glimpses of they just feel like filler. I barely remember how this thing of saving anyone developed or how he did it. It was really just a marketing gimmick and is in its own right really not that interesting beyond its premise.<br/><br/>Maybe if it had been some kind of hybrid of ""Shoah"" with ""Waltz with Bashir"" it really could have been something; with real people relaying their experiences which were then dramatized. But because of the way these episodes are contextualized, they just seem pornographic in the sense it is more about a sadomasochistic voyeurism on this example of genocide, relying way too much on its production values and the gruesomeness of what it is showing so to me it is basically just a slasher than rips off reality. At least ""Friday the Thirteenth"" tried to be original.<br/><br/>Another design flaw is the film's desperation to show you things to make you recoil. Once you establish crimes against humanity to be on the stakes, the endless parade of candid shootings just seem redundant. It doesn't matter how bluntly they the lady gets shot, the apathy to human lives already blatantly obvious. It's just ""what's going to happen? Oh? Another person got shot? Shocking..."" This candour is also jarringly contrastive to strangely lyrical dialogues and monologues that make it very unclear what tone the movie really wants.<br/><br/>Powerful moments asides, it's a very sugary experience, and the horror of its subject matter does not excuse the handling. As you can tell from the cover art used on this website. I respect the use of black and white, it's very appropriate and usually the colour against black and white thing would greatly appeal to me, but it focuses on a little girl which is just pandering. The same kind of physiognomy that Nazi Propaganda used. Maybe I'm slow but the point that it was to personalize the impersonal nature of mass killings was lost on me.
Perhaps most insultingly of all, the movie, despite how keenly it fetishizes holocaust imagery, doesn't give any kind of reflection on why the holocaust happened. No one is entirely sure but there is surely something to say about it. It's happy to talk about why people went along with it, but the mentalities of the axis peoples are lacking. That these people don't have more of a presence is a big hole in this movie.<br/><br/>Also, it's in English, which costs it a whole point out of ten from me. It should be in German. I am not German.<br/><br/>As snooty as this must sound, I am inclined to think that this movie was a case of people really falling for a sentimental, well produced collage of an historical even we all like to hold in mind but not really think too carefully about that compromised the art (and the very story it was supposed to tell) for artsiness."

","Schindler's list tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson)who is a Nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' Jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS. When Schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general Amon Goeth (Fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how Goeth and his men are treating them, Schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible.<br/><br/>If I was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. I also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the Holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. I also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. Finally we come to the acting and for me it was Fiennes that shone as the evil General Amon Goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. Neeson and Kingsley were great too, but for me Fiennes put on the best performance.<br/><br/>So having said all that, you might be wondering why I'm only rating this 7/10? Well for me, it is technically perfect, but Schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). The first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. It was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. I personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Having said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. It's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. As a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments I've ever experienced when watching a film. Great film - but a tad too long in my opinion."

","This is a film that is made by a filmmaker at the height of his powers. The dramatization of the Holocaust is some of the most intense footage ever made. In so far as the end goal was to get the viewer to experience even a small part of horrors European Jews experienced the film succeeds wonderfully.<br/><br/>But the film's focus is critically off in two ways. Schindler's story of moving from an amoral capitalist to a humanitarian saver is compelling but it is not what the Holocaust was. It was genocide, murder and pointless brutality. There's no good reason to tell Schindler's story as the central point. It was and is an anomaly. This problem is really brought home with the fake out sequence in the Auschwitz showers/gas chamber. Most people who entered that space were murdered. It is almost as if Spielberg cannot bring himself to display the actual horrors of genocide directly. To tell only the story of Schindler's List is fundamentally misleading.<br/><br/>Second, I don't understand why Stern isn't the protagonist or why Schindler is. To frame the Holocaust through the eyes of a German gentile is gross. Schindler, for all his goodness, was not the target of the genocide. Moreover, certain beats in Schindler's story trivialize the Holocaust if treated as the focal point. The famous sequence of the young girl in the red coat is the moment Schindler changes. It is when he first sees the humanity of Jewish people. But that isn't what matters. What matters is the mass murder that is occurring. If the film made Stern the protagonist this problem would be greatly lessened.<br/><br/>This is a film with messed up priorities."

","At the end of the film, when he received a golden ring from a surviving Jew with Hebrew text: To save a person is to save a world. Mr. Schindler should be emotionally collapsed. He always thought he had done a lot. A good sense of justice also lost power and frustration. He pointed to his car and said that he could exchange 10 people with Goethe officers, and pointed to his brooch, that he could change 2 people or even more. He burst into tears,
He complained that he didn't work hard enough to make more money, so that he could save more than 1,100 people in the Jewish talent district. That scene really moved me. Before losing his home and going to exile, Mr. Schindler finally showed his great side thoroughly. I am sure that he has a great love for all innocent human beings. At that moment, I really wanted to cry. Truly great people never pride themselves on their achievements, but they are still reviewing their deficiencies as sin.
In fact, just like the proverb on the ring, Mr. Schindler was the brightest light in those darkest years. His love and devotion provided the basis for the revival of the severely damaged Jewish nation. When he saw the description at the end of the text, the Schindler Jews had nearly 6,000 people, and felt deeply comforted. At that time, in 1994, 15 years had passed, which is far from this number, right?

","The definition of a norm described by Robert Axelrod in his article ""An Evolutionary Approach to Norms"" brings me the case of Oscar Schindler when I try to understand the term. The definition is that ""a norm exists in a given social setting to the extent that individuals usually act in a certain way and are often punished when seen not to be acting in this way"". Well, in my view Oscar was not punished after all. Or maybe he was?<br/><br/>Oscar Schindler, the main protagonist who saved hundreds of jewish people's lives during the World War II time in Poland, seems as an outsider in the story or in the society where the story goes on. The story goes on in Poland, where an austrian businessman who runs a factory and needs a labor force. Thus he comes to a labor camp and gets several jew people for his factory to work. As the plot continues, and thousands are jewish people being killed, something changes in Oscar and he starts to save his jewish workers. The history of a Holocaust is bloody and terrifying, however, the story of jews who worked for Oscar Schindler, ironically, could be counted as lucky for staying alive.<br/><br/>Now the question of norms comes out, what kind of norms holds the story? And why I call Oscar Schindler an outlier in this story? Schindler is a rich and ""not jewish"" man whose beginning purpose was money and business, however, during the story, he changes his actions of using his privileged identity. Helping and saving jewish people, hiding them would count as abnormal in this story and he commits those abnormal actions and saves lives. The motives of his actions can just be guessed by me but not explained, because when it comes to the norms that powerful and key people accepted, there is no question of the ""humane"" and ""not humane"" acts since those are very subjective terms.<br/><br/>In ""Schindler's List"" the terms of norms and question of being humane contradicts, in my view. If the norms are, even temporarily only for that period of time and only in that region, getting rid of jewish people and it is considered as normal phenomena by people - the scene where a soldier shot a jew because he had ""that mood of killing"", - but the ""being humane"" is Oscar Schindler who's probably conscience suddenly got awaken. The discussion of norms and behaviour under those norms often connected to the values. In this movie's case, the values of a particular character, Mr.Schindler got changed overtime - from money and wealth to people's lives. This switch can be seen and understood by his words at the end of the film when he says "" I could have get more out. If I'd made more money..Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there. Ten people. Ten more people."""

And what it causes the deepest is the trauma to people's hearts, the distortion of people's human nature, which is an indelible mark on people.<br/><br/>Schindler is an outstanding entrepreneur in Germany. When he was in business, he recruited a large number of Jews to work in order to reduce his own costs. But when he was awakened by the shootings in front of him, he couldn't sit still. He wanted to get up and do something, and that was-salvation. In order to redeem the Jews, he spent all his possessions, but only over 1,200 Jews were saved by him. He felt helpless, he felt regret, he regretted his profligacy during his lifetime, he regretted what he did, he felt that he saved too little, too little, and he held them crying like a child.<br/><br/>The whole film is black and white, and the only color used in this is a little girl in red.

","Schindler's List is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. Personally, it is one of my favorites, as I have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. Some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality. Not being Spielberg, I have no idea what his intentions were, but I would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of Nazi rule in Germany. Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made. Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous. This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness. It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction. Do we really expect film to be reality? I don't. I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before. Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not.

"Eric_Ruan","4","4","12","11 May 2012"," Mediocre and overrated
","The story is about the efforts that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a World War II profiteer, put out in order to save the Jews from Plaszow concentration camp. Let us make it very clear: from the starting point, Schindler has no interest in saving the Jews. His sole interest, at first, was to make money. How was this man converted from being an opportunistic businessman into a courageous human soul who was willing to save thousands of lives? He even appeared initially unaffected when SS-Lieutenant Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennce) blissfully murdered innocent Jews. How, then, could this man break down at the end of the film because he could not save just one more life is baffling. Agreed that he was surrounded by good Jews, but the probable reason for his transition (encountering a dead Jews who thanked him) was utterly self-congratulatory. Was he even terrified by the murders that were going on (if he was, he never showed it on screen any way)? Perhaps, only the extraordinary Schindler himself could help Spielberg realize it. Or did Spielberg care about strong characterizations, at all? There was no complexity here. <br/><br/>However, Liam Neeson's Schindler was given pretty decent treatment when you consider the other elements in Schindler's List. Particularly was, the vicious monster of the story, Lieutenant Amon Goth. Was he the only one who killed (or loved killing) Jews throughout this whole affair? I had this question on my mind when the film exclusively focused on him insanely shooting random Jews from his bedroom. Giving a mad figure the special treatment of being the leading culprit of this mass murder is a laughably simplistic way to make sense of the Holocaust. And it fits into the general audience's banal understanding of the event. The key to Holocaust is the diffusion of responsibility among the persecutors and the lack of moral convictions on the very part of the human race. Those complex concepts were given no treatment in Schindler's List. Instead, everything is reduced to insanity. The very possibility of the Holocaust, therefore, remains alien to a whole audience, who, perhaps, come to see the film just to feel a sense of grandness and liberal guilt. Raplh Fience was terrific in his performance. However, his role, sadly, served as a springboard for the audience to blindly put their blame on. How revealing!<br/><br/>In short, the treatment of both Schindler and Goth shed no light on the ambiguity of human nature. Schindler suddenly became ""good"" while Goth was inherently ""bad"" (This only makes the visual comparisons between the two men all the more exploitative). Everything seems pretty common sense, and obviously very digestible. However, if there is a most deplorable injustice being done here, it was the presentation of the Jewish community. Perhaps, everyone who has watched this film can recall the scene of a little girl splashed in red that Schindler spotted during the liquidation of the concentration camp. Anyone could have been fooled by this imagery, whether a film amateur or a veteran film fan. However, if you sit back to think about it, the image is pretty fortuitous. What does this present exactly? Hope? Love? Future? Or even blood? This middle-browned attempt to convey some visual meanings does not succeed in any meaningful way. Worse still, it is an exploitation of the bathos of childhood innocence, which does not make sense in this circumstance. We are dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, not some selective individuals that were singled out from this whole in order for us to dwell on 'sophisticated' feelings of loss and hope. If there is a lesson that is unforgettable about the Holocaust, it is the unjustified prejudice and hatred inflicted upon the Jewish community as a race, not just the brutality and violence that any particular Jew experienced (if you want to know about brutality and trauma, you can ask the 20 million Russians who were dead also). Why not color every Jew red then? Any selective visual presentation in this case is misguiding; and manipulative. Even the sequence that precedes it, a moral struggle between mother, daughter and childhood friend during evacuation does not feel like a climax. It is so trite, so predictable that one might just allow himself to rumble with all the emotions that Spielberg has designed for him. It feels as if, the audience is told what they already know, and all they need to do is sit there, ruminating like an act.<br/><br/>The saddest thing is that at the end, when the credit rolls ""In memory of the 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust"", I wonder what the whole film has to do with those 6 million deaths. If you are inattentive and easy-going, you would freely accept it as an earnest tribute to them. But really? Telling the clichÃÂ© story of a thousand who were alive is the tribute to the 6 million who were dead? What does this film have to do with the dead anyway? The desperation, the horror, the pain, the shame and the doubt of those who went dead were not adequately conveyed. Oh, just tell the marvelous story of saving lives to make the audience open their mouths and wonder. And we can forget about those who were dead. What a lovely tribute that Spielberg made!<br/><br/>The real story is extraordinary. But there must be a way of telling it without this pretentious sense of self-importance that makes it so easily consumed by an uninformed audience. At no point in this film, do I feel a sense of desperation, that sense of ""needing to get out of this horrible nightmare"". It was just like watching a prodigious show that make you feel ""wowed"" (and admire, and cry?). But remember that grandness cannot replace substance. Indeed, Holocaust is a very difficult subject matter. It needs to be approached first with intelligence. But Spielberg evidently failed to do so."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","4","12","1 April 2010"," Emotional, but lacking.
","Articulating my thoughts on this movie has been difficult, given my mixed feelings for it. Schindler's List introduced me to the holocaust and encouraged me to learn more about it. No film has ever made me cry more. Yet I find myself agreeing with some of the common criticisms of the film, that it is emotionally manipulative at the expense of promoting a more complex understanding of the Holocaust. <br/><br/>I respect Spielberg for showing little restraint in depicting the horrors of the holocaust. Schindler's List provides a general overview of the subject, from the initial discrimination against Jews, to the liquidation of the Ghettos, to the concentration camps. This is without a doubt Spielberg's most emotionally gripping film. Some of the more memorable moments for me were the scenes where children escape death by hiding in toilets, and the chimneys at Auschwitz. John William's theme earned the score an academy award all on its own; the rest of the movie might as well have had no music. Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performance as the film's villain, Amon Goeth, and the black and white documentary style gives it an unparalleled feeling of authenticity.<br/><br/>To be honest though, that seems to be all there is to this movie. It is purely emotional, with little intellectual value. I believe this is in part due to the way Spielberg treats his characters. The two supporting characters, Itzhak Stern and Amon Goeth, would have been more interesting characters than the lead, Oscar Schindler. Stern, as Schindler's personal assistant, is able to avoid many of the hardships faced by his fellow Jews. I would imagine this would present an interesting moral dilemma for Stern: it is in his best interest to remain Schindler's assistant, but how can he remain loyal to his people in this somewhat privileged position? He soothes his conscience by trying to prod Schindler into saving more Jews. Goeth is presented as a psychopath who shoots Jews from his balcony for sport. The historical record verifies that he indeed partook in such abominable acts, but Spielberg tries to meld him into a three dimensional character with only partial success. Goeth kills Jews because it makes him feel powerful, but Oscar Schindler challenged this definition of power when he said that true power is permitting someone to live, rather than killing them. Goeth attempts to exert Schindler's definition of power by not punishing a Jewish servant, but he quickly reverts to his old ways by shooting him on his way out the door. Another scene involves his sexual attraction to a Jewish servant, but he ends up severely beating her, and blames her for trying to subvert him. These two characters are very different, but they have one thing in common: they are involved in a personal struggle over their own beliefs. Stern has to find a way to remain loyal to the Jewish people while saving his own skin, while Goeth attempts to change his sadistic ways, but fails. Unfortunately, their status as supporting characters limits what Spielberg can really do with them. The film never explains Goeth's brutal ways other than chalking it up to his psychopathic, sadistic tendencies, which pertained to some Nazis, but not all. Nevertheless Goeth is one of the more interesting characters in the film.<br/><br/>Oscar Schindler, the main character, does not have an equivalent struggle over his own identity, only a moral struggle, over whether he should challenge the Nazi power to save his workers, which would put his life, as well as his business, in danger. He is strictly an observer to the horrors around him, not a participant, which makes him the least interesting character in the film. He witnesses a series of atrocities and looks sadder and sadder each time. Basically, the message about this character is pretty clear: he's a greedy businessman, but he has a soul, and it's only a matter of time before he does the right thing. He decides to save 1100 of his workers, ending the film on a happy note, but still reflecting on the millions who did not make it. A flawed character such as this would make for some great character analysis, but he feels distant, like an empty vessel for the audience to slip into. Perhaps this was Spielberg's intention. But the character's development takes such an obvious, unsurprising course that it almost feels like the film is just delaying the inevitable for three hours.<br/><br/>Optimism is truly Spielberg's forte. Whenever he takes on a depressing, complicated subject, he portrays it in the most simplistic and comforting ways. I find it most interesting that Spielberg, a Jewish filmmaker, would make a Holocaust movie that does not focus on Jews that much. Stern is the only Jewish character who is developed to any degree. I am not trying to accuse Spielberg of being anti-Semitic. I just believe that focusing on the Jews in this story would have been inconsistent with Spielberg's optimistic style of film making, because only Schindler had the power to save them. But focusing on Schindler so much almost robs the Jews of any agency, making them all the more pitiful. This gives the film a strictly emotional core rather than an intellectual one. I admit this is more of a subjective criticism than an objective one, because who says the emotional route is not as legitimate as the intellectual, but I believe a film can be emotional and intellectual at the same time.<br/><br/>Schindler's List packs an emotional punch that few films have matched, and for that, it is a must see. Despite this, the most admirable quality of the film is not a characteristic of the film itself, but how it has promoted awareness of the Holocaust. Schindler's List is an excellent introduction to the Holocaust and I believe it will continue to encourage people to learn more about it, but if you are looking for deep analysis, look elsewhere."

","Based on the life of Notorious Nazi Party Manufacturer who uses Jewish slave labour in his factory in Krakow. Spielberg's visual accounts of the atrocities committed by Nazi's on the Jews is factual but restricted as most were too horrific to show the general public. It is a well known fact that the wealthy Jews bought their way into extended ""Freedom"" by paying big bribes to actually work in Schindler's factory rather than being shipped off to extermination camps. It is also debatable as to how long the 1100 Jews Oscar Schindler ""saved"" would have lasted as Jews were often worked as slaves until death after Hitler's ""Final Solution"" was declared. <br/><br/>There are more profound stories about German Officer's who turned against their own when witnessing the atrocities by their fellow Germans but the overwhelming fact remains that it is largest and most efficiently executed act of genocide in Human History committed by one Race over a particular race and religion. The Nazi's murdered six million Jews of the six and half million in Europe and of the 275,000 survivors 250,00 had died by 1970.

","Schindler's List is one of Steven Spielberg's first ""serious"" Oscar-bait attempts and it is a superb (near flawless) piece of film-making up to a point. Spielberg has chosen to relate the horrors of the Holocaust through the biographical story of businessman Oskar Schindler. Schindler was an opportunist who decided to exploit the Jews affected by Hitler's final solution and utilize them in his factory. As he witnessed first-hand the repercussions of the Holocaust, he gradually began to take active efforts to save the 1100 Jews in his employ by literally buying their lives. Spielberg's stark black-and-white photography enhances the realism of the film and he directs the material with a refreshing no-frills approach. Spielberg is usually known to be a very sentimental director and what is astonishing about his work for much of the film is how cool and unsentimental it is. This is not an insult, the approach works wonders. He let's the tension and the terror of what unfolds speak for itself without embellishing with tired Hollywood clichÃ©s and intrusions. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is nuanced, enigmatic and entrancing. He is a person that one never truly gets to know, but his evolution from unconcerned businessman to one who in a sweaty frenzy tries to beat the clock to remember all of the names of his employees in order to save their lives is amazing acting. Spielberg and Neeson never try to turn Schindler into a saint and we get a warts-and-all central character. Ralph Fiennes is also astounding as the thoroughly amoral Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley contributes one of his finest restrained performances as foreman Itzhak Stern. I also found Embeth Davidtz moving in the peripheral role of Helen Hirsch, a young Jewish woman who becomes the beleaguered object of affection for both Goeth and Schindler. The film is required viewing for anyone interested in history, the Holocaust or simply masterful film-making. In fact, the only thing that prevents me from ranking the film at its highest level is its conclusion. Spielberg in his latter years seems to have a problem with providing satisfying codas to his films Â the more serious ones provide the greater difficulties. Schindler's List is no exception and I believe that he panders in the final few moments and fails to accept the intelligence of his audience for processing what went before. He has just crafted a perfect account of the events and torn our hearts out in the process Â viewers are fully able to comprehend the depth of the accomplishments of Schindler. However, Spielberg seems to feel we need a refresher course. He adds a totally unneeded closing where the real surviving Schindler Jews and their offspring march side-by-side across the screen (all the better to marvel over their numbers) and pay tribute at Schindler's grave. While I must say I was mildly interested in seeing the modern-day equivalents of some of the characters I had just seen on screen, it was like a subtle, insightful film suddenly brandishing a sledgehammer and adopting a totally different approach to make its point. Still, just in case any is still slow on Schindler's accomplishments as a savior, Spielberg then literally types it out for us to remind us exactly how many were saved and how many offspring from future generations have been saved by Schindler's selfless efforts. I really found this drawn-out and needless climax to shatter the mood generated by the earlier portions of the film and it prevents me from rating this a masterpiece."

","From what I see, most people seem to like this movie very much. I'm not criticizing them. It's just that I don't like war movies, so I don't understand how can anyone like them.<br/><br/>First of all, before watching this movie I thought a lot if I should do it or not. It wasn't only because this is a war film, but also because it is shot in black & white and especially because it is 3 hours long.<br/><br/>I knew that this would be another Holocaust movie, but this one has something different which made me wanna give it a try: a Nazi named Oskar Schindler saved almost 1200 jews during the Holocaust. I thought that was incredible. I also know that this is based on a real story, which makes this somehow a biographical motion picture.<br/><br/>In fact, yes, it's admirable the hero that Oskar Schindler became by saving nearly 1200 lives. That's what happens by the end of the movie, probably the most emotional and powerful part of the film. Oskar Schindler even wished he could have saved much more lives, which is perfectly understandable. His emotions are particularly very well shown in this part.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does a great job and steals the show by portraying the German hero Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is Steven Spielberg's most serious movie ever. It shows us a very realistic foresight of what the Holocaust was: the cruelty of the Nazis, the killing fields, the war, the destruction of everything, how thousands of jews's lives were taken and much more. It is a shocking film and the fact that this is shot in black & white increases this painful environment. Even so, considering that this is a war movie, it isn't one of the most violent.<br/><br/>However, this is a film that requires lots and lots of patience. It is a slow and very long movie which might very well take one to the limits of his/her patience, especially for those who don't like this kind of movies or aren't interested in these subjects.<br/><br/>There's something else I'd like to talk about. Why does every single movie about the Holocaust has to win Academy Oscars? I mean, every single movie that comes out about the Holocaust is regarded with a rain of Oscars. I understand somehow that they do that, but is it all that necessary to exaggerate?"

"general-melchett","9","3","8","11 October 2006"," A very powerful, authentic film, but like all successful films, has its flaws.
","Schindler's List has been hailed as Steven Spielberg's best ever film, and is #6 on IMDb's top 250. It won loads of awards, including seven Academy Awards. Despite the fact that it is not quite an epic with its relatively low budget, it justifies its existence with great acting, directing, a very well-written script, rich characters, and authenticity that no other film has yet equalled. But unfortunately, it is marred with a slow pace, some pointless scenes, extremely unnecessary sex scenes and nudity and the lack of any real originality in the acting. No acting awards were won, but the most memorable performance was hammered home by Ralph Fiennes, who played Amon Goeth. His real villainy and spite made the film even colder. This film not only hammered home the true horrors of Nazi regime, it also shows that there are good people in even the most villainous clans, and those good people end up being remembered for what they did.<br/><br/>This is not a gory action flick like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - there are only a few shootings in the whole three hours. But there is lots of blood when there is a death, and the complete unfairness of the killings make this film even more shocking and powerful. But the main problem of this film is that none of the characters really change. Goeth does learn a lesson from Schindler, who gives some wise words, but he is still a Nazi through and through. Schindler does get some inspiration on and off, but he never really deteriorates, and Liam Neeson really does not own the role 100%. The last minutes of black and white are reminiscent of many Western films (you see my point - man rides into a village on horseback to liberate people, a huge crowd of people come over the horizon of a desert), and John Williams' score is not used enough. However, Mr. Williams actually put some care and thought into his music, unlike in the Jurassic Park score of the same year, which was just full-on Hollywood ham. On the whole, all of the characters in Schindler's List do deliver good performances, unlike ""Aeon Flux"" in which every character was flat and dull.<br/><br/>To mouth off about Schindler's List is wrong - there is nothing duff about this film, and every second comes from the heart. Though it isn't gripping, it will fascinate, and will take you back 60 years with ease. However, it is not quite perfect, and perhaps a teensy bit overrated. I may need to watch it again. But on the whole, Schindler's List engaged, and worked perfectly as a film. However, I am still more with ""Saving Private Ryan"" as Spielberg's best war film. But may I make this clear - this is the most authentic film ever made, and must be seen. A stunning job! 9/10"
"chtfj21","5","3","8","31 January 2006"," Too cheesy for a film as serious as this one.
","I suppose this is an ""important"" film, and it deserves some merit for educating simple folk about the Holocaust. But as a film it's rather mediocre. Schindler's List would have ended up as just another war film among thousands had it been set in a Russian, rather than a German concentration camp. This is a sensitive topic and I didn't like the degree of sensationalism used by Spielberg, as if this were a purely commercial Drama. Most of the characters are stereotypes, which fulfils a purpose I guess, as it depicts the Nazis as unambiguously evil, but it doesn't add to the quality of the film. The plot was predictable and, just like in most Spielberg films, a little bit too ""clean"" and not gruesomely random enough. The scene with the bare chested Nazi shooting people from his balcony was distasteful in my opinion, and I would have been more moved and ""shocked"" (as was no doubt intended) had this repugnant Nazi character been depicted in a more life-like way and as less of a caricature. The graphic scenes of women screaming in the showers were unnecessary. Often the true horror of an atrocity can be conveyed by omitting certain parts, and I don't think Spielberg got it right."

"shattenjager777","5","5","17","23 April 2007"," How this film has received so much praise, I may never know
","""Schindler's List"" isn't by any means a bad film, but it's not particularly good either (a decent way of describing Spielberg's entire career). Some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall mediocre work that certainly doesn't deserve the high praise it has gotten (much of which is because of Spielberg's treatment of the film itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high schools around the country, etc.).<br/><br/>The film's issues begin with its main character, who begins the film as a complex, interesting character who seems to possess a moral flexibility that would have been a great asset in such a changing society as his and then is reduced to a simple man with a conscience despite his surroundings. The transformation is unwelcome and not at all credible, since it seems to be precipitated by absolutely nothing (The holocaust has already begun around him, so that cannot be the precipitating event.) The change is made all the more ridiculous by the epilogue of Schindler's later life, which makes it clear that the first version of his character is more accurate. Liam Neeson performs very capably in the role, especially in the vastly more interesting opening scenes, but his performance is not enough to save such a ridiculous character arc.<br/><br/>There is also a terrible lack of focus in the film, as it spends such a large amount of time dealing with its villain, Amon Goeth, as to take away from Schindler's presence in the film. Goerth is also a more exciting character than the second Schindler and performed with such an incredible menace and dark intelligence by Ralph Feinnes that the viewer can easily long to see more of Goeth and less of Schindler, which is not a good thing for a film with such moral certainty.<br/><br/>Beyond these problems, there is the visual style of the film, which is a blatant rip-off of Alain Resnais's ""Night and Fog."" The black and white past with color present footage, intended to connect the past to the present, is clumsily done, as the subject of the holocaust's connection to the present is never once broached within the film. The colorization of the red swastika and girl's jacket also adds absolutely nothing to the film. It's pointless and smacks of Spielberg trying to prove his own depth.<br/><br/>However, ""Schindler's List"" does have its fine points. The film is still quite pretty to look at, including an incredibly beautiful, depressing image of Jewish graves as a Nazi road, and a number of other truly beautiful images that capture the sorrow of the Holocaust extraordinarily well. The acting is also truly excellent, highlighted by Ralph Feinnes in a tragically under-noticed turn as Amon Goerth. Finally, John Williams's score is hauntingly beautiful and has an understatement the film would have done well to mimic. These are cosmetic elements, perhaps, and they certainly don't make up for the film's major flaws, but they certainly improve the film from the train wreck it might otherwise have been.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Schindler's List"" is an overrated, average film. The performances and score are top-notch, but its message is not sent as vividly as it is by some other films about the same subject (most notably the aforementioned ""Night and Fog"") and its characterization of its protagonist leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a waste of time, but films such as ""Night and Fog,"" Sidney Lumet's ""The Pawnbroker,"" Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist,"" and Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" explore the Holocaust much more poignantly with far less fanfare."

","The critically acclaimed epic story of a Nazi (Neeson) who witnesses the atrocities bestowed upon Polish Jews during the brutal Nazi Reign. Ooh, Spielberg is so genius with his use of coloring and his pulls-no-punches portrayal of WWII! Just the type of film Hollywood loves to pat themselves on the back for and tell themselves that they're edgy and honest. However, the reality is, the use of symbolism in this film is so shallow, even a sixth grader can interpret its meaning. What's the point of symbolism if there's nothing to search for? It seems a bit redundant, because any meaning behind this film, aside from the ugliness the Jewish people endured during WWII and the sacrifices Schindler made, is there on the screen. There's nothing to search for. There's no ambiguity for each individual to take something personal away from it. The symbolism serves no purpose. Not to mention other Spielberg flaws; he underestimates his audienceÂ as usual, and continues the story when its finishedÂ as usual. Keep in mind when watching that not everything in this ""masterpiece"" is historically accurate. Ralph Fiennes chooses to play Amon GÃ¶th as a theatrical villain, rather than a three dimensional evil and twisted man. Christopher Waltz makes Fiennes look like an amateur as Hans Landa in ""Inglourious Basterds"". That's another thing, why is this in English?

"SuperCritic","6","3","9","26 July 2005"," What I didn't like about it
","Well I just saw this movie in 2005, 12 years after it came out, for the first time. I had expected much, much better. Things I didn't like.<br/><br/>1. The long sequence depicting the Jews getting hauled out of the Ghetto, as Schindler watches from a hill-top on horse-back for seemingly at least a half hour (in movie running-time). Totally took the movie off course, and steered it away from the story of Schindler and his factory, and turned it into a historical account of the Holocaust (with nothing to do with Schindler). This tries to do too much at once, and is one of the reasons the movie is too long. The movie should stick to being a movie about Schindler's Jews.<br/><br/>2. The Germans shooting bullets upwards through the ceiling in to the rooms above, shortly after their fellow Nazi soldiers had run upstairs to root out the Jews. Made no sense. Classic Spielberg goof up.<br/><br/>3. Schindler kissing Helen. This came out of nowhere. Why did he walk downstairs in Goeth's ""villa""? Oh, right, to get the wine. Then he just randomly decides to have a long conversation with her? The conversation was long, as is implied to be actually longer than was shown, as we see a cut in the scene at one point, and when we return, Helen is in the middle of a story she is telling to Schindler. This whole scene made no sense, and it is supposed to be some kind of turning point for Schindler (now he's sympathetic to the Jews). Just after talking to Helen? 4. Goeth's instant ""transformation"" into Mr. Nice Guy after Schindler talks to him, and tells him that ""real power"" is forgiving people or whatever. Totally unrealistic and too fast a transformation. It makes you think that either Goeth is an idiot or Spielberg is an idiot. I think it's a bit of both.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why it has such a high rating. Perhaps because of the emotional feelings it can induce, and because it tells a story about a horrific historical event. It is a great story, Spielberg just didn't do a great job telling it. Roberto Benigni's, la Vita e Bella is just superb. Focuses very squarely on one story, and doesn't deviate.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 6/10"
"imcarl","10","3","9","14 April 2005"," Good - but a bit overrated
","In the past couple years, I have been taught about the Holocaust and the Rwanda genocide. And so out of curiosity, I have seen both movies made about the tragedies. Schindler's List was and is given a lot of praise, but I didn't find the movie as compelling as ""Hotel Rwanda"" or many other stories. This movie sorely lacks characterization. In order for the audience to truly grasp the tragedy of genocide, we first need to establish a connection with the characters that undergo such torture. But the truth is, other than the main characters, those surrounding Oskar Schindler, we mostly never get to see the other characters through the methods of characterization. The almost never talk, a background story is rarely given, we never get an idea of other character's opinions about them and like I said they never talk. All we know about them is what we see. About the only the writer's and Spielberg lets us see the tragedy is watching total strangers go through h***, but we get no idea of their personality, hopes and dreams with the exception of some small addititions. This movie suffers the same fate as ""The Passion of the Christ."" It spends it's hours showing us blood, gore and misfortune and expects us to feel sorry for the characters. But without really understanding that the characters truly don't deserve the torture they go through, we can never really understand the tragedy. The film is good, but the lack of a rich cast of characters, I really cannot give this film a 9 or a 10."

Well, do a little research, and you'll find that most of Speilberg's ""facts"" turn out to be either fiction, or grossly exaggerated. Take the ""Girl in the Red Coat"" for example - she has just published a book about her experiences !!!! So much for the truth !<br/><br/>Spielberg's portrayal of the story is simplistic in the extreme. He deals in generalities rather than the truth. The acting is poor, especially Neeson and Kingsley, who appear to believe that putting on a bad foreign accent will absolve them from future woes. Shooting the movie in Black and White does not provide any extra artistic merit, and the blurring of facts detracts from it all anyway.<br/><br/>The fact is that this is a very mediocre movie, and in my humble opinion, received its Oscar nominations because ANY movie with a Holocaust theme is guaranteed a boatload of those. ""The Pianist"" will receive the same plaudits, but is just as poor.<br/><br/>It is time that the movie-going public woke up the type of amoral blackmail being foisted upon it and started to vote NO with its feet !!!!!"

","""Schinder's List"" is a remarkable movie about Oskar Schindler,a German war profiteer and industrialist, that surprisingly turned into a humanitarian when he turned against the Nazi Party goal of having Europe free of Jews. The film directed by Steven Spielberg stars Liam Neeson in the title role as Schindler together with Ralph Fiennes,who portrayed the evil and trigger-happy Commandant Amon Goeth,Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall and Embeth Davidzt.<br/><br/>This 3-hour film tells the story of how Schindler started an enamelware factory at Poland after Germany annexed it and hired Jews as production workers to make a lot of profit. In it,we witness the transformation of Schindler from first making money to becoming the savior of the 1,200 Jews as the war is about to end. We also see the gross violence especially when Jews are being killed at will and how they are being sent to concentration camps such as Auschwitz and Plaszow to be killed. In addition to that,we get to see Schindler's negative traits such as being an unfaithful husband and a prodigious womanizer that turned into a surprising saint by giving the Jews a helping hand.<br/><br/>The film was definitely a great film as it was moving.

","Let me start off by saying that Schindler's List is a very heavy film to watch. It is not meant for everyone and not every member of the audience will able to appreciate it. The gut-wrenching, horrifying scenes that represent the real events happening during the Second World War in Krakow, Poland, are hard to watch. The film being three hours long, tests your patience and ability to put up with the inhumane events on screen.
The film is about a businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who arrives in Krakow in 1930, ready to make his fortune from the new World War. After joining the Nazi party for political immunity, he re-opens an old factory, using Jewish workers, as they are cheaper than any other person at the time. When the SS begins exterminating Jewish people in the ghetto, Schindler tries to save his workers, in order to protect the operation of his factory and what starts as a selfish reason becomes a noble cause to save innocent lives.
The film is in black and white, however the opening sequence for some reason is in colour. The film's events are very realistically shown, up to the point where it becomes infuriating and sickening to watch the tragedy unfold. The human emotion portrayed by the actors is too believable, it physically brings you to the place of the events and shows us the horror that the Jewish people experienced during the horrific events. This is the sole focus of the film."
"Otoboke","Null","2","5","13 October 2007"," Underdeveloped
","Schindler's List is a movie whose technical aspects on the whole cannot be faulted, but at the same time this perfection inevitably becomes a weakness in the film's heart. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and certainly regard it as the most brutal and realistic depictions of the holocaust that I've seen. Whether or not it works as a movie however, is a whole different question. After watching for the first time I don't regard Schindler's List as perfect, but still regard it as an important piece of film because of the history it depicts so powerfully, regardless of its few faults as a movie.<br/><br/>On an aesthetic side, the film is perfect. The soundtrack fits the themes and action on screen perfectly and memorably, creating an atmosphere suiting to the film's focus. The performances from the cast are all very well done also, with only a few problems every now and again. The photography also is flawless, using black and white with mixes of colour effectively and with astonishing results often not thought possible with the limitations of the style.<br/><br/>The writing itself is sharp and well done, managing to recreate a dark period in human history as though it was outside our windows, ready to be filmed. My problem however lies in the writing of the tragedy and the obvious unbalanced focus on characters. You see the film does manage to convey a completely disgusting, repelling and shocking world ruled by oppressors following orders with little compassion for an entire race of people. It does this by repeatedly showing unjustified and casual killings of innocent civilians, carried out by the Nazis. I'm not saying these scenes were not well done, in fact when viewing them I was firmly on the film's side, taken in by its honesty and gruesome realism. However as the film dragged on I began to notice that these people who were dying were people I didn't know of nor really cared about (Please note at this point that I am reviewing a movie, not history). This occurs because I felt Schindler's List devoted far too much screen time developing its oppressors rather than showing more of the oppressed. So when it comes to yet another execution, I am predictably enraged and disgusted with the executioner, but am I sad or guided to feel anything for the poor person who's now lying dead? Not really. I mean, yes I find it horrifying and tragic, but show any killing on screen and you're probably going to react in this way. Here in lies where Schindler's List is brought down from superior cinema to a sentimentally bankrupt historical movie: The film is extremely powerful and emotional throughout, but unfortunately it is always in a negative manner.<br/><br/>I also found the ending to the film completely unconvincing and detracting to the events that take place beforehand. I refer here to both Schindler breaking down and fretting over how many more prisoners he could have saved, and the modern day footage of the survivors visiting Schindler's grave. Both ordeals come off as extremely misplaced, emotionally contrived and absurdly mawkish. They left me with an unfortunate sour taste after a solid couple of hours of well intentioned film.<br/><br/>Please recognise however that despite these problems, I did find the film a good watch albeit quite a taxing one. If there is one thing I can give the film absolute praise for it is that it has opened my eyes a great deal to the suffering and injustice that the Jewish people went under whilst under the control of the Nazis during World War II. It is a film that will stay with me forever no doubt, leaving images that probably should never be forgotten."

The sheer horror, brutality and inhumane treatment of Jewish people is a scar that Germany must bear for all eternity. So why, in God's name did the USA just sit by and do nothing. America has always had a large jewish population and reports of the holocaust must have filtered through to the authorities. In 2003 the USA goes to war on Iraq and the Saddam Hussein regime. Nothing can ever compare Saddam's reign with that of Adolf Hitler. And yet, the Americans did nothing.

","One of my deepest wishes in life is that Stanley Kubrick had made Schindlers List instead of Spielberg. Spielberg however hard he tried could not capture the right feel of the story. Now don't get me wrong Schindlers list is one of the true classics of modern cinema but one can only start to appreciate what it could have been. Spielberg is known to be overly sentimental and this film is no exception. The cinematography of this film is very well done but i do not believe it serves it's purpose. The black and white format was chosen to give of the feel of a documentary but the shots are too slick, it feels to artificial, giving the feel of more a 50's noir film. The acting is superb but the script i felt lacked something, being too comercial maybe. The decision to put it into english was a controversial decision but simplifies it no end. The violent and very graphic images of the film work well in some parts, not others, the ghetto cleansing scene works brilliantly so does the excercise scene, it truly feels like your watching what happened but the parts were Fiennes takes pot shots at the workers, well seemed to have no point other than too shock you, but there were so many more attrocities the Nazi's perpetrated that could have taken it's place that would have added so much to the film. Too sum up this was a good film with excellent acting, especially by Ben Kingsley who was robbed of an oscar, superb editing and set design, good but misleaded cinematography and average direction. If only Kubrick had made the film Aryan Pages instead of Spielberg it undoubtedly would have been the greatest film of all time in my eyes."

The acting is fine.<br/><br/>But, seeing how this film stays near the top of the ""top 250"", I feel compelled to rain on the parade a bit.  Forgive me if I use this forum to focus on what I *didn't* like about the movie:<br/><br/>The scene at the train station--remember?  Where people were scrawling their names on their luggage, and loading it onto boxcars on another line, then the audience is let in on the fact that the system had no intention of reuniting them with their belongings?--set the tone for the representation of evil that was the holocaust.  It appeared that the immensity of the tragedy would be conveyed in this movie by equally grand and hauntingly indirect scenarios like this.  But then the movie settles into what I call the ""clean death"" of countless shots to the head.  I'm not saying that they should have shown the knee deep typhus-dead in abandoned barracks, an actual gassing, etc., etc.  But the power of that train station scene subsequently wasn't matched by what came after.<br/><br/>I also felt that the ""little girl in the pink coat"" was a victim ""for the rest of us""; a furtive hedging-of-the-bets which I have a funny, funny feeling might have been more-or-less foisted upon Spielburg by his producers.  When we got tired of seeing Jews getting herded up and killed, the pink coat girl (who appeared to be a kind of goyim ""innocent bystander"") sort of ""freshened our palates.""

Two things ""troubled"" me about the movie. Firstly I felt the character of Goldberg (the Jewish Policeman) was under-developed and secondly, the scene where the little boy (Adam) blows a whistle repeatedly to betray fellow jews-in-hiding. My elderly neighbour comes from Poland and grew up in kracow where Schindlers List was (mainly) set and filmed. He's not jewish, but was well acquainted with the subject of the movie. He himself has one glaring criticism of this film, which explains my own reservations and - if true - I think it's a hell of a shame. The crimes of the SS and Gestapo have been raked over for 60 years and there's nothing anyone can really add, is there? it's all been said. However, my neighbour told me that many of the crimes committed against the kracow jews were carried out by the Jewish Police themselves; fellow jews!! Spielberg presents them as rather comical figures who merely read out names and check lists. I'm told (by someone who was there) that in reality they were a gang of rapists and murderers who had unrestrained power over their fellow jews, carried out the orders of their SS masters with ruthless efficiency and frequently exercised initiative in devising tortures, against their own people. As Spielgerg is probably the most talented film-maker in the world, I can only assume his false portrayal of the Jewish Police is deliberate. What I've learned recently has spoiled the film for me, but I'm still glad I know the whole picture now. Perhaps that explains why the real ""Goldberg"" wasn't invited to drop a stone onto Oscar Schindler's grave. Schindlers List is a beautiful, harrowing, moving film and of course the monsterous crimes of the nazis must never be forgotten. I'm just disappointed that Mr Spielberg didn't tell the whole story."

","This is a great movie. It is a story that had to be told. As unbelievable as it is, even a Nazi was capable of showing compassion, of pausing to stop and explore his own conscience and make decisions that saved people from death. This Nazi had every incentive to dispose of his charges yet decides not to it and instead takes the high road with dramatic results. Counterposed to him was another Nazi who wantonly murdered people and in the paid for that with his life. Yes, two Nazis, one guided by the highest principles, the other who was devoid of even the slightest spark of kindness, both Germans, yet both different. Why? Who knows?<br/><br/>I know that everyone raved about this movie and how it was Spielberg's greatest and most important movie. Well, guess what: I don't need Hollywood giving me a history lesson on the Holocaust or trying to capitalize on the suffering the victims of that event had to endure. I don't need a Hollywood producer or director trying to manipulate into thinking that some Nazi really had second-thoughts about the plight of the Jews ... many of whom happened to be German too. If you want to watch a really good movie about where the German people were at when it came to Nazism, watch the ""Mortal Storm"" made in 1940, or watch any of Leni Reifenstahl's documentaries glorifying the Nazi system. These movies were made when the Nazis were actually in power. But don't tell me decades after the war that there were Nazis with a conscience because if that had been the case, Adolf Hitler would not have lasted one day in office. Hitler could not have done what he did if he did not have the unanimous approval of EVERY Nazi who followed his lead. A Nazi who cared? Yeah ... right. The next thing Hollywood will be telling us is the Genghis Khan wasn't such a bad guy or that Isaac the Terrible wasn't all that terrible, just misunderstood and blah, blah blah. If Hollywood thinks the story ... any story ... will make money, they'll try to exploit it for all its worth. Now, what I really want to know, however, is why was the movie filmed in black-and-white? Were concentration camps painted in black-and-white paint? Were the inmates black-and-white? Or the guards? I don't think so. And that concentration-camp commandant who's taking pot-shots at the inmates? Was that supposed to tell us that the Nazis were depraved wanton murderers? Once again, I don't need this movie to tell me that. I know that. Plus that subject was fully covered in ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" which did a much better job of it, minus all the gratuitous violence. So if you want to watch a black-and-white movie about a Nazi, who, for reasons never explained, decides to protect Jews and also shows Jews being subjected to all forms of mistreatment and violence and terror, then this is the movie for you. But for goodness sake, don't construe this movie as being a history lesson because if you do, you'll come away believing that some Nazis were actually nice, and there's no way I'll ever believe that."

We walk out of the theater feeling satisfied and breathing a sigh of relief that ""everything turned out OK in the end.""  ""Schindler's List"" is a story that is untypical of the horrible reality of the Holocaust, and it gives us the false sense that there were more Oskar Schindler's that rescued Jews.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Jews are saved from catastrophe in typical Hollywood fashion:  Stern is pulled off a train bound for deportation just in time, a train full of women are rescued from Auschwitz when it is discovered they are ""Schindler Jews,"" an old man is not killed when the Germans' guns all fail to fire, the women are not gassed in the showers.  It is not that these things did not happen - but they are the exception.  These rescues strewn throughout the movie allow the viewer to feel relief that detracts from the reality of the Holocaust.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is sentimental and, with its happy Hollywood ending, allows us to feel good about the Holocaust.

It was just Spielberg making something that he knew people wouldn't degrade because of fear.  Fear of standing outside the crowd and speaking what is on their mind.  Fear of being attacked for their beliefs, which is ironic considering what the movie is about.<br/><br/>I have had to hear about the Holocaust almost every year I was in school, watching the same documentaries and reading the same books.

But, in general, the movie contains far too many scenes meant to tug at our hearts that end up demeaning one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind. The sole use of color for the little girl in the pink jacket wandering through the streets is meant to be poignant.  Instead, it is cloying and heavy-handed at best.  The scene of Kingsley and Neeson typing up the list of people to be saved is classic Spielberg garbage.  Neeson emotes to his best to keep exhorting Kingsley that they can save ""more.""

Little or no time is wasted pointing out that the Jews had greatly aggravated their German hosts by taking over the banks and media (as they have more recently done in the United States), or that they were in the process of taking over entire districts and transforming the nation's Christian culture into a Yiddish one. <br/><br/>The film neglects to mention that they were given ample time to leave the country and were warned there would be trouble if they didn't.

","Shindler's List is supposedly Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement, however I cannot say that I agree. Of course there are a lot of good points about the film, it goes without saying that the documentary style and use of black and white gives it a very authentic edge, but it still has its fair share of faults.<br/><br/>The main problem with Shindler's List is the length. I'm of the opinion that when watching a film less is more and if you are going to do a film that is over 3 hours long every scene should be as relevant and important as the next one. In Shindler's List, in my opinion, there are many scenes that repeat each other, giving us no new revelation or insight into the character's emotions or actions.<br/><br/>It was probably Spielberg's intention to show us so many scenes of torture and abuse of the Jews to help show the horrific scale of the events that took place, to show us how many were killed without emotion or reason, but I feel he got too emotionally involved and went over the top, getting to a point where with each random killing he lessened the impact to the audience because you've seen the same thing happen earlier.<br/><br/>Another major problem I have with the film is that some parts come off as strangely comedic, which in my opinion completely goes against the idea of the documentary style. Scenes like when Schindler threatens the guards so they help him find his accountant and when Amon Goeth ""pardons"" himself in the mirror were extremely ill judged as in my opinion you should not be made to laugh in a film that covers such serious subject matter.<br/><br/>The film is also very biased in a sense that it gives all the Jews a personality and character development whereas every single Nazi in the film is shown to be pure evil and mechanical, enjoying every last little thing they did. Obviously I am not saying anyone committing these atrocious acts should be absolved from our condemnation and scorn, however it would have been interesting to see how the bosses of the labour camps would have dealt with guards who actually had a moral compass and refused to act upon these orders of such brutality. Not doing this, unfortunately, takes a bit of credibility away from the film as it makes it seem only those who are wealthy, only Schindler, had any respect for the Jews or were against the war.<br/><br/>However, despite its faults there is indeed a great deal of tragic beauty to the film. Apart from the scene at the end where Schindler breaks down and cries, which seemed extremely over-acted and quite awkward to watch, the film really does manage to evoke very real emotions. It opens your eyes to the pain and suffering of the Holocaust and gives you a fly-on-the-wall style view into what happened. When you watch from such a close up perspective it really makes you feel that you are there in the film, someone who is standing by and doing nothing to stop the dreadful events that are happening so close to you. This style really helps amplify every emotion you feel to great effect.<br/><br/>A lot of credit must also go to the actors. It is key that in a film like this that you believe what is happening on screen and all the actors do a very good job, especially Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern who really manages to capture the emotions of skepticism and hopeless inevitability flawlessly. Liam Neeson does a really good job as Schindler himself, but lets himself down in the final scene where he is just makes you cringe and think ""this is acting"".<br/><br/>Overall I found the film very entertaining, but there were a lot of minor quibbles with it that lessened my enjoyment somewhat along with a few major problems that I feel cheapened the overwhelming emotional experience that I received. The film is 100% essential viewing and will definitely stand the test of time, but in my honest opinion is not the masterpiece or the demonstration of perfection that many people laud it to be."

","I'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. This was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. Like 'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary. It's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. And can't.<br/><br/>Many have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. Subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.<br/><br/>As a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.<br/><br/>A film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling.

This was one of those rare instances where a film moved me on such a profound emotional level. In telling one man's story of selflessness during possibly the greatest human caused atrocity ever done to our own species, the Holocaust, Spielberg is able to tell a story that is not intended to entertain, but move audiences. In every sense of the word, Schindler's List is an experience, it is more than just another movie you sit on the couch and watch. If you didn't ball out your eyes watching this then do you even possess a soul? At it's core, it is an example of the little glimmer of hope that is surrounded by hopelessness, it is the showing of the value of life. the real Schindler's List was and is much more than a list, it meant living when others died. I have seen horror films that are fake but are able to hold up my suspension of disbelief, but with this piece of cinema I was shown maybe the scariest thing ever filmed - what happens when prejudice and discrimination lead to violence.

"davidmvining","10","1","2","13 January 2020"," A film of contrasts that hits the gut
","This movie is built on contrasts, and it includes one of the most devastating single cuts in movies. It's a dual narrative that almost feels separated for a while before the two become completely intertwined in the final hour. It's impeccably made, acted, scored, and assembled. It is one of, if not the, greatest single film by Steven Spielberg, and it's the best example of an ""important"" film.<br/><br/>The first sustained sequence to the film is our introduction to the main character of Oskar Schindler. It's largely wordless, showing him putting on his finest clothes, pocketing a large stack of cash, and zeroing in on some Nazi officials in a Polish nightclub. He means them no harm, he only wants to schmooze with them and gain the contact necessary to get a manufacturing contract with the Nazi military early in the Second World War. It's an intoxicating scene as Schindler works his magic, going from an empty table to hosting a dozen officers and their dates, all to get in with the high ranking officer who reserved the best table in the place.<br/><br/>And then there's a hard cut to Nazis marching through Krakow.<br/><br/>The music is gone, the levity is gone. We went from being seduced by the fun of hanging with Nazi officers to the cold hard reality of a Nazi occupation in a major Jewish population with one edit. It's hard, and it's very effective.<br/><br/>That contrast is at the heart of everything in the film, including Schindler's character. Visually, we see things like Schindler in his office above the factory floor while the slave laborers remain separated from him below in much the same way that Goeth sits on the porch of his house above the labor camp. Schindler wants to use slave labors to make a fortune, which he does. Schindler and Goeth contrast really well as well. They both sit in positions of power, Schindler in the private sector and Goeth military, but they end up going in different directions. Schindler watches the liquidation of Krakow, focusing on that famous little girl in her red coat, and something clicks within him. He's never seen the Jewish people as anything more than tools for his own personal wealth, but there's something about that innocent little girl, weaving her way through the mass murder going on around her, that makes him reconsider his assumptions. Goeth, on the other hand, is a monster through and through (apparently toned a good bit down from reality), and, once he's given the opportunity to exercise what Schindler calls ""real power"" (letting the guilty man go free), Goeth realizes it's simply not who he is and he snipes the boy who couldn't get the stain out of his bathtub.<br/><br/>Through the events of the film is the quiet figure of Itzhak Stern. When Spielberg and Ben Kingsley were discussing the character, they both boiled the man down to a single word. Spielberg chose ""conscience"" and Kingsley chose ""witness"". Both words perfectly capture, especially together, who Stern is in this story. He's largely our eyes into the world, playing a placid man in the face of constant threat, who does what he can to help his employer. On the other hand, he provides little nudges to Schindler to move him in the right direction, like getting Schindler to meet the one handed worker who credited him with saving his life. He's the one Schindler ends up confiding in and plotting with to create the list of 1100 Jews to save from the Nazi ovens.<br/><br/>The parallel story is the story of the Holocaust as a whole. We watch the story unfold from persecution on the streets of Krakow to the ghetto to the labor camp and finally to the death camp. There are criticisms of the film that it doesn't go far enough on this end. I think, regarding the actual story at play, the creation of the list by Oskar Schindler, it doesn't necessarily fit, though I get the idea. We see the crackdown, liquidation, and oppression of the Jews in exact detail throughout the movie, but once we get to Auschwitz, the movie turns away. We don't see the piles of bodies or them being cooked in the ovens, though we do see the smokestacks belching out the ashes from it. It feels like the movie could have taken another step to really embrace the truth of the horror, but Spielberg was unwilling. I don't know...I think we might have seen enough and just the implication of the final solution was enough.<br/><br/>It's a harrowing look that, perhaps, flinches in the final moments, but the central story of Schindler's exposure and reaction to the horrors of the Holocaust are magnificently capture and presented. Liam Neeson is great as Schindler. Kingsley is quiet and great as Stern. Ralph Fiennes is pure evil as the (toned-down) Goeth. John Williams' music is somber, touching, and distinctly Jewish by design, fitting the film perfectly. Spielberg made it because he felt like a Holocaust movie needed to be made, and he used every bit of his talent to pull it off. This is a great, great film."

","1. If you first heard that a movie going to be shown for World War II , Holocaust , genocide of Jews in Europe, you may not give it a highest priority list for you popular films and that may not attract many of the audience specially the younger generation but Schindler's List and the name Steven Speilberg , who himself , have a great brand value surely will attract a lot of them and the way the film is being made , the way of story telling , will get you into the story and grow an interest within yourself to know more about it , the Holocaust, the Nazi, the German tortures , occupation of Poland, tremendous harsh reality faced by Polish Jews. A 3 hour plus film , but we may not able to get yourself out of the story. Story of an unsuccessful Businessman , Schindler , who moved to Poland for using the War as an opportunity to do business with Nazi Govt. but somehow it turns into a situation where , he used this as a tool to save Jews, who was working for his factory ,was not in the massacre list due to their capability of producing products for German Army. And when Schindler realizes that it can save a Jews life , he start recruiting as much jews as possible to save them from Nazi atrocity. For that he even bribed German Generals and put his life and reputation also in risk on the eye of Nazi Govt. Those 1100 Jews were the survivors at the end of the war. WE can see in the film , when a Soviet Army soilder , met them , the survivors, then the Chief Accountant of Schindler , who was an integral part of his business asked that soldier that if there still any Jews alive in Poland ? That also depicts how important was the work of Schindler was to save those 1100 jews , who can be easily another direct war victim of the Holocaust.
2. A strong German character who was the chief of a military team , also helped us to understand the psychological state of that time German Soldiers and the Jews who worked under them. A maid was working under that general but she was always afraid about what to say, as there is also no set of rules for a Jew to know what to do best them, as the level of their hatred was so deep that a Jew maid also have no answer to any question, no answer was enough to answer the Germans. Their thought blocked , they become victim of immense hatred produced by Nazi Govt. and racism that made them blind. The conversation between the Schindler and that maid depicted clearly that thought differences almost accurately."

"philwhite-411-828978","10","1","2","12 August 2019"," Entertainment? No. Informative and heartfelt?.Yes
","Well, what an incredible piece of work from Spielberg. The subject, of course, is a matter of posterity. Probably the darkest moment of recent human history, the film is presented in a flat, matter of fact way. This isn't a criticism. The usual flair for storytelling that Spielberg shows, wouldn't have been appropriate here.<br/><br/>The one moment that the director indulged himself a little too much, was the much talked about shower scene. In this sequence, it felt as though the emotions of the audience where being wrenched in an artificial way. I have heard a story of something similar happening to some escapees, but not at Auschwitz. Anyway, it's a small criticism.<br/><br/>The character of Schindler is masterfully played by Liam Neeson, someone who I have always felt is a capable, but not remarkable actor. He displays an earnestness and dignity here which I have never seen him replicate in his career since.<br/><br/>Ditto for Ralph Fiennes as Goth, who far from being a typical film villain, is both heinous and banal. A vile, hideous creature, but a well rounded, three dimensional one to boot.<br/><br/>I would like to have seen one or two of the Jewish character's, more at the forefront. It seems a little trite to portray a major event in the Holocaust/Shoah and have the Jewish characters be almost fodder in the backdrop. The girl in the red, the little boy who hides in the toilet and the mother and daughter are all memorable, but more due to circumstance, rather than resolve. And screen time.<br/><br/>The violence and tention on screen is masterfully achieved. For me though, the most harrowing scene features no violence at all. It's the moment when the parents at the camp see the jeeps taking the children away, and the blissful unawareness as they wave at their adults, (who react with understanding horror and rush the jeeps) that punched me straight in the heart.<br/><br/>Overall it's a work of art, that is seminal, and will rightly stand the test of time. I can highly recommend the BBC mini-series, Auschwitz, as a companion piece to this, for those who wish to dive deeper into this horrendous time period.<br/><br/>Let us hope we never see the likes of it again.."

"ventery","10","1","2","5 October 2018"," A True Depiction of an Unspeakable Horror
","So I watched Schindlers' List on Saturday and must admit while I found it rather disturbing, I could not look away for the whole duration of the film. It is no secret that I have always been drawn to movies with a powerful message and find myself searching for existential meaning in almost everything I am exposed to, however, the Holocaust did not only mark a pivotal point in our human history but symbolised the most disturbing and darkest side of our human nature; our insatiable appetite for power and control, and the hateful disregard for human life.<br/><br/>Consequently, we are repeatedly reminded of the extent to which our human indecency can go which often leaves us wondering when it will happen again. By now you would have guessed that the movie is about Oskar Schindler; a German businessman and member of the Nazi Party, who, after witnessing the deplorable way his Jewish factory workers were being treated by the Nazi soldiers, set out to help them. Liam Neeson was flawless in his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and gave the character the angelic finesse he deserved. I am almost certain that Oskar Schindler would have been pleased with Spielberg's choice of acting talent. I found myself drawn to the character in a very intimate, yet spiritual way, something I am still unable to explain. <br/><br/>And Ralph Fiennes who played the role of Amon Goeth; the model SS soldier who became commandant at Plaszow and was responsible for the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto; was outstanding. As I watched his character transform from a devoted SS soldier to a sadistic commandant, I felt Spielberg's choice was quite fitting and became somewhat captivated by Fiennes's performance. I could almost feel the immense hatred he had for the Jews and found myself hating him back.<br/><br/>Whilst the content of the movie was very heavy, the cinematography was, in a word, flawless. The decision to shoot the film in black and white gave it a vintage feel and added an extra layer of frightening truthfulness. The iconic soundtrack triggered many emotions which led to many uncontrollable crying moments. Fair warning though, the genuine portrayal of violence in the film might scar some sensitive viewers and should not be taken lightly. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I found myself questioning whether or not any of the SS soldiers went through existential moments where they questioned the ethical nature of their orders and by extension their actions. There must have been times when they were emotionally distraught and unable to complete the orders that were given to them. I cannot imagine that none of them struggled to sleep at night knowing that they were murdering, no, slaughtering innocent people on a daily basis. It is unfathomable that so many people were brainwashed into believing the ridiculous antics of one monstrous man.<br/><br/>And finally, there were three scenes which stood out throughout the movie. The first was the scene with the little girl in the red dress. It is believed that she represented the innocence of the Jewish people, which I feel is correct, however, I also think that she represented the horrifying truth of what was to come. <br/><br/>The second was the scene where the Jewish prisoners were ordered to exhume the bodies of their fallen comrades and told to push them into a bonfire in order to dispose of them. Oskar is present at the cremation and notices a wheelbarrow containing the bodies of children, amongst them, the little girl in the red dress who he had spotted running into a building in the Ghetto when he watched the SS soldiers liquidating the Ghetto. I believe this may represent the loss of innocence and symbolised the complete lack of regard for human life. <br/><br/>The final scene was the scene where Oskar breaks down after he is handed a gold ring that the Jews he saved had made for him to say thank you for saving them. This is probably one of the most iconic scenes in the movie because it speaks volumes as to the horrors that Oskar had witnessed and the empathetic human nature during times of hardship."
"singinggirl-62613","10","1","2","2 October 2018"," A review from 2018 - moving all the way through
","This is actually my first review on IMDB, and I would be the last to expect it being written about a black and white movie from 1993. This probably says a little about my prejudice on ""old"" movies in black and white. That said. <br/><br/>Some here believe Schindlers List is way too long a movie and dull. Over rated. I beg to differ. The fact that the movie is black and white does not bother me. You notice it in the beginning, but you quickly get used to it. As Ben Kingsley in the role of Itzhak Stern says; the movie is filmed in a way that seems to capture it as if it were filmed right there in 1940. <br/><br/>Another remark I would like to make in the beginning, is that my class, a bunch of 13-year olds, watched this film at school. I thought it was way too long, boring, and ugh, in black and white. I got the impression most of my classmates thought the same. Based on this experience, and that I just yesterday, at the age of 25, watched the movie again, I would say most teenagers (12-15) won't enjoy the movie as it should be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Since this is my first review it's probably too long and incoherent. I apologise. 
Steven Spielberg's story telling is capturing. Not for one moment did I expect or wish that the movie would come to an end. I am especially impressed by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley - although that is evident, and predictable, should you watch the movie and enjoy it.<br/><br/>As a true movie fan and lover, I would say it in this simple way - the movie kept me watching to the end with a mix of horror an awe - and although most of this was sad and gruesome - the ending made me cry. <br/><br/>I have, admittedly, had a fascination for the holocaust and WW2 the last week, something that maybe makes me biased. Going into watching this, I thought; this is a movie from 1993, in black and white. Also a very delicate subject is being presented here, which maybe makes the movie ""good"" in a sense because the story and reality of the events is so realistic. I can only conlude that this is a very good film."
"oden-62149","10","1","2","25 September 2018"," Powerful

This movie is amazing purely because of the emotional impact. I never really cry during movies, but god damn this one got to me. This was the first movie that ever made me cry. The scene where the Jews present Schindler with the pin was the first scene that ever got me.

","Calling Schindler's List a ""film"" seems to bring it into reality.  A film is something you may experience a few times a month.  This movie is not something you may experience very often in many months.  To watch it is not like watching a film at all, it is like living through something in your life that consumes you, makes you want to no longer exist, and live forever at the same time.  It is more like an event in your months, then a movie you watched last night.  <br/><br/>When people talk about how they liked this movie, some may try to articulate the deep horror, hope and heroism purveyed, many will shake their heads and say that it was beautifully filmed.  All will stop short, and just tell you to see it.  It is impossible, perhaps, to sum this story up.  A movie is to be reviewed and criticized, this, though, is something besides a movie. <br/><br/>
I will not critic it, I won't even tell you to watch it.  But if you do decide to watch it, do so when you are alone, and when you have time afterwards to be alone.  There are many stories with far greater personal impact than this story, but none else have been made into something you can rent at your corner store."

It's weird to call such a classic movie ""forgettable"", but I'm having a hard time remembering most of the scenes of this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, it does have a great subject, showing how much good can be done by someone with means. The scene near the end when Schindler is lamenting that he didn't save more Jews got me choked up, but that was about it. I don't think there were more than five scenes in the movie that actually made sense to me. Maybe it's actually really well done I just need to see it again, but the first time around it went over my head which is a problem in my eyes. I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this right now, but I am."
"scottmwade-1","7","2","7","15 September 2007"," Overrated but still worth watching
","Spielberg tends to get a bit overly cheesy in his films and this one is a prime example. Obviously the subject matter is intense and there are a lot of good qualities to the film but the ending was the part that really wrecked it for me and made me roll my eyes back in my head. Another example of an overly cheesed out ending that wrecked an otherwise great film was in Spielberg's 2001 film AI. I thought that was an excellent movie all the way up to the end when it just kept dragging on and on and got totally ridiculous. I don't think the ending on Schindler's List as bad as AI but it was still too much icing and not enough cake."

","This movie treats one of the most important subjects of our century, i.e. the national socialist movement in europe which could have ended up in a disaster. <br/><br/>The acting and the cinematography are as good as it gets! However, since the purpose of the film is to be some kind of document on what happened in the camps in Germany and Poland during the nazi-period, I find the fact that Spielberg is making up things in the movie, such as the shooting of innocent jews from the balcony of a residence, somehow takes away much of its value as a document over history. My opinion is that there is no need for making up things and making them worse than they actually were in order to make a good movie about this era. Things were bas enough as they were; there is no need for making things up, especially things that couldn't even have happened (the location of the villa makes it impossible to shoot jews from the balcony). <br/><br/>To conclude: I find this to be a movie, well worth seing! However, it is not to be seen as a documentation of what really happened, which in my opinion is very unfortunate since that would have given this movie yet another dimension.

","Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is a reflection on how great this director is. His 3-hour painting of Oskar Schindler and his forever changing view on the Nazi rampage against the innocent Jews is simply the greatest film achievement since the simple secret of Citizen Kane is finally revealed in a magnificent, grand and intelligent way. The final scene in which a marching group of 11,000 or so saved Jews morph into real survivors (an in color vision) and the ceremonial funeral of Oskar Schindler showing the several survivors of the Schindler factory is a real marvel and a sign that box office king Steven Spielberg doesn't work just for money. Spielberg should be knighted or something for this movie, just like Schindler saved the Jews Spielberg let the Jews' pain and suffering be recognised and World War II be looked at beyond the view of the British and American army."
"plutokennedy","3","3","13","23 December 2001"," Well intended, but extremely flawed
","By making this movie, Spielberg reportedly wanted to increase awareness of the holocaust. In this regard, he probably succeeded. But that should not cloud the fact that this is a very mediocre to bad movie. The acting is, save for Kingsley, stale and in some instances, such as the train to Auschwitz scene, almost aching to an Ed Wood movie (I assume these women were not professional actors). The story is clumsily told, the symbolism (red dress) heavy handed and the psychology of some characters (such as Goetz's scene in front of the mirror) very simple minded. A few scenes did work for me. I thought that the shower scene was well done and intense, and I do not feel that it was too exploitative in the context of the movie. Also, the shot of the smoking chimney was eerie, but this has been lifted from other movies. What really did bring the film to its knees was the speech at the end. My god! This was even worse than Steven Seagal's at the end of 'Fire Down Below'.<br/><br/>If you want to learn about the holocaust, pick up a history book or watch some of the many documentaries on the subject. It will not be pleasant, but you'll learn so much more than from this movie."

This doesn't excuse him from taking all of the colour out of the film. It's just not exciting and it's not engaging.<br/><br/>I'll tell you what's a good film, Psycho.

"tieman_64","Null","2","8","13 August 2011"," Superficial, goofy exploitation film
","""Schindler's List is an exploitation film."" - David Mamet   ""Schindler's List? Kitsch as fat as a dinosaur."" - Imre Kertesz  Steven Spielberg directs ""Schindler's List"", a sentimental,  sensationalist film which has virtually nothing to do with the  Holocaust. But of course audiences never went to ""List"" to think or  learn. This is a black and white horror film, providing shocks and  jolts and artfully constructed little moments of ""realistic"" terror.  Audiences went for the same reason they went to see ""Jaws"". They wanted  to be shocked.   Spielberg takes the visual touchstones of the Holocaust,  (trains/showers/fences/chimneys etc) which audiences automatically  recognize, and then uses them to create little action set pieces. Will  the gas chambers work? Will the Nazi's find the girl? Will the sniper  let the woman live? Will the train stop? Will the little boy find a  hiding spot? Will the gun misfire? Will the hose be long enough? It's  like a silly game of pee-a-boo or whack-a-jew. The mindset also turns  up on a larger scale near the film's end, in a tasteless suspense scene  that mines thrills over whether the list will arrive in time to save  the Jews from getting gassed. And so on and so on.  People criticize the film for being morally black and white, for being  thoughtless, for its pantomime characters, for being Zionist propaganda  (the final scene is shocking in that it uses Nazism to suggest that  Israel is the only alternative to Jewish persecution), for presenting  ""good"" and ""evil"" as being inexplicable (none of the characters  thoughts or motivations are explored) and ignoring all nuance, history  and politics. These criticisms are valid, but really, these people are  criticizing a film that ""List"" never tried to be. It's a thriller. An  exploitative horror film disguised as art. That is the real immorality  of ""List"".  Unsurprisingly, Spielberg ignores all truths and instead opts to  propagate Western Holocaust myths. The fact that Goeth, who was  arrested by the SS Judiciary and imprisoned on charges of ""brutality  and sadism"", was an anomaly and precisely the kind of figure of excess  that undermines and makes events like the Holocaust impracticable,  isn't brought up. Instead, with the exception of Schindler, all Germans  are portrayed as brutes. Schindler (whom modern historians - Jitka  Gruntova, David Crowe - don't regard as having altruistically saved  anyone) is himself Spielberg's typical father figure who slowly learns  to love his flock of children. Meanwhile, the film's Jews are reduced  to a slightly gentrified version of Der Sturmer caricatures: the  childish, initialized mass of holy innocents, the bespectacled  accountant, the dangerous Jewish seductress, the money men in the  church etc. Or, as Yosefa Loshitzky put it, they're strikingly ""similar  to their images in Nazi propaganda"".  Gone are all messy complexities. ""List"" ignores the fact that the kapos  routinely conspired against fellow Jews, and that often only the  wealthiest could get on Schindler's list in the first place.  Schindler's history is wiped clean too (he used slave labor for most of  the war), as the fact that he worked for the Abwehr and procured the  Polish uniforms and information to be used in the Gleiwitz Incident,  the ""false flag"" operation which was used as a pretext to start the  invasion of Poland, and therefore World War 2, is far too traumatic for  audiences who want neat cartoon demarcations. Western Anti-Semitism is  likewise shunted aside, Hitler's brand of Imperialism is never mirrored  to the equally insidious behavior of the other world Empires and the  fact that Hitler's war was the ""logical"" outcome of early techno  capitalism and that all world powers were equally complicit in the  Holocuast, is ignored. Likewise, the way the West effectively  blackmailed (and abandoned) Poland and used them for a proxy war is  neglected as well as all manners of socio/political/historical  complexities. Schindler saved 1200 Jews you see. That's all that  matters. Turn off your brain. Shed a tear. Remember. Everything is  okay.  End result: WW2 and the Holocaust reduced to a kind of historical  brainwashing: ""evil Nazis kill cute Jews, good Nazi save some Jews,  debt paid if Jews allowed to keep Israel"". The film turns the Holocaust  solely into a Jewish experience. No one else suffers, nothing else  matters. Like ""Private Ryan"", the film exploits the context of war and  deliberately lies in order to tell a fantasy of  rescue/survival/redemption. The real narrative subtext here is the  restoration of family and the recuperation of a nation and its history.  The boosting of comfortable myths and the avoidance of truthful  confrontation in order to provide superficial closure. In ignoring all  issues, it bolsters that which allow these problems to continually  repeat themselves.   Spielberg's optimism is correct, but he is wrong in placing the blame  on a failure of individuals and individual ethics/responsibility,  rather than the system itself. At their core, these are systemic,  ideological problems which continue to this day, and yet the film  condescendingly lets its audience pat itself on the back for believing  that it, like Schindler, would give up its riches to save lives. The  double-binds and compartmentalization which made and continues to make  such ""morality"" impossible (as well as futile) are not shown. It's only  easy to say ""yes"" to the film's ethical dilemmas when you're a wealthy  and powerful factory owning Nazi.   Unsurprisingly, the film takes the shape of a ""monster vs kids"" ride,  the Nazi's becoming a surrogate for Spielberg's tripods/pirates/sharks/  dinosaurs/trucks. They zap Jews and you jump. Because ""List"" has a  higher cum-shot-jew-kill ratio, all other Holocaust movies are obsolete  to salacious, contemporary taste buds. Other movies don't kill enough  people for them, don't give them that Hitchcockian buzz. Notice no one  went to see ""Amistad"". Spielberg didn't kill enough slaves. He learnt  his lesson with ""Ryan"", though, and dispatched a couple thousand Nazis  for your amusement. Self-congratulation sells best with blood.  7/10"
"marklv","6","2","8","5 February 2006"," Wonderfully made film, but very flawed.............
","The problem with 'Schindler's List' is that, although superbly made by one of the most talented directors who ever lived, it has an agenda: to convince people of the Holocaust. I mean, why add all those dramatic scenes of children being led to their deaths, the gassings, bodies burning etc? What did all that add to the film story apart from try to shock the viewers? Schindler himself was, in reality, far removed from the nice man portrayed by Liam Neeson. Most of what he did was not because he particularly cared about the Jews, but because they made him lots of money. He was also a serial womaniser and adulterer. Basically, the film is a sentimental Hollywood melodrama which happens to be set at a time of great cruelty, motivated by blind fanaticism. An opportunity was lost to analyse WHY the Nazis hated Jews so much, what were the fundamental roots of the German-Jewish conflict? Instead Spielberg went for the safe option of creating brutal German robots and innocent, perplexed Jewish victims. And the final scene when Schindler gave his speech was frankly ridiculous. Final verdict: magnificent film, subject matter not properly presented."

","Oh my, this movie is so full of stereotypes and cliches that I won't even start listing them here.<br/><br/>How dare Spielberg making a movie for easy mass-consumption on such a delicate subject? Being from Germany I feel particularly offended by the way Jews and Germans are portrayed: Everything is like a person that never had dealt with any of these cultures in depth would imagine it from watching just another US movie on the Holocaust. That might be fine for a TV-series or soap opera, but is pretty poor for a movie of that caliber.<br/><br/>Not that I really expected anything but a streamlined feel-good movie by that director, but I find it very offensive to use such a subject just to finally get the Oscar.

Here we have nazi exploitation and the travesty of war on our brothers and sisters of humanity in one of the most foulest and harshest carafes in our adulterated history of sadism and chaos. World War 2 or, WWII was iconic and all around terrifying. We had Japan, Germany, Italy and a few others I forgot. But not only did the Japanese commit horrifying sadistic means of killing but the Germans were far worse. This movie is about a non anti-Semite named Oskar Schindler and his concern for his environment, welfare and the persecution of the Jews in Nazi ridden Europa. The acting is amazing, qui gon jinn is such an underrated actor, he is amazing in every film, from Excalibur to a monster calls. The cinematography is delectably tasteful and the score is the epitome of a melancholic yet traditional sense of Hebrew music that flows and crafts it's way into this movie to make it perfect, and every single shot is a piece of mastery. in conclusion, this film is extraordinarily well done, and you will not be disappointed.

The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg.

","This is no doubt one of the most important movies of the last 30 years. It was an intense passion project of director steven spielberg. Based on true, horrible, horrible events in poland from WWII, we are taken through one man's journey from being a wartime profiteer to that of a compassionate saviour, rescuing many Jews from peril. Shot in glorious black and white film by dop janusz kaminski, the film tonality acts as a truthful portal into the brutal times of German nazi occupation and the goings on in the horrific work and death camps this is a film that proved that spielberg was and is a true masterful artist and auteur. The arthouse editing tells the story on a thread that also contains small bits of humor. ( One of the best scenes in the film and in perhaps modern cinema is the intro to character amon goethe). The violence is so brutal that you can subconsciously see red in the almost black blood. The 4k transfer, supervised by spielberg, is crisp, modern yet retains a theatrical film screening look and feel."

","""Those who save one life, saves the entire world.""<br/><br/>I made my film professor laugh when I told him that I would be celebrating the end of Finals Week with the fifteenth anniversary of Schindler's List. I had never seen the film before, so I didn't understand the laughter. After three hours and fifteen minutes, a face dripping with tears, and my body shaken, I now understand what my professor was talking about. I thought finals were depressing already!<br/><br/>Regardless, Schindler's List is the definitive film that people should look to for a true story about the Jewish persecution throughout Europe during World War 2. The Holocaust was perfectly emulated here, perhaps a little too perfect. As you get uncomfortably transported to the 1940s, you follow the workings of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi officer who decides to start a pot-making factory during the war. Because he is a cheapskate, he decides to use the Jews as cheap labor to run his factory, only to slowly gain a heart throughout the course of the film, as he discovers the real persecution his workers are going through.<br/><br/>The film's narrative is, without a doubt, my favorite thing about it. I love the redemption of Oskar Schindler. Whether it is our history books, other films, or through stories, the Nazis are always labeled as heartless soldiers who killed anybody they didn't like on sight. Those labels are 99% correct, I am sure, but the story of Schindler made me realize that even the most evil people, can find a heart. Liam Neeson nailed the performance of Schindler, and he is currently my favorite character in a film right now. I will never forget his performance, especially at the end of the film. He is such a well-written character and is wonderfully acted.<br/><br/>I also must give credit Ralph Fiennes, who gave an incredibly realistic portrayal of the stereotypical evil SS officer. And if the Nazi stereotype is a thing, I think it all derives from Fiennes' acting in this film, because he is definitely the grandaddy of all Nazis. He does a terrific, yet terrifying, job here. Fiennes' character is so interesting because he is so neurotic and insane, yet he is very eloquent and well-composed at times. His hatred for Jews is insane, but you still love him for some reason, because deep down, he is still Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley, who I didn't realize was in this film until I got past the accent, does a fantastic job here as well. This dude can legitimately play any race if he wanted to. He is so fantastic.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, the score by John Williams is extremely depressing. I cannot stop listening to the Main Theme, It breaks my heart. The black and white cinematography is so gorgeous. And just when you think you are used to it, the little girl in red comes out, and it makes your jaw drop. The acting was so solid, even with all of the background characters. I will never forget the scenes where the Jews had to be stripped naked, run around all across the yard, all to see if they were healthy. Every person looked really unhealthy, malnourished, extremely skinny, and honestly kind of dead, which added to the realism of the film. It was so hard to watch.<br/><br/>Also, a film finally got gunshots to the head right. Watching the Jews get executed was incredibly difficult to sit through, but with the added realism of the blood gushing out, it really makes the audience feel for what happened to all of these Jewish people.<br/><br/>I especially loved how the ending of the film played homage to the real-life survivors of the Holocaust, and it is said realizing that since this is the fifteenth anniversary of the film, none of those survivors are still alive. But it all still broke my heart.<br/><br/>Anyways, despite my absolutely love for the film, I have two nitpicks: First, despite how great the characters and narrative was, I almost wish the film was completely in Polish and German. However, the film was almost entirely in English, which took away from the realism just a tad. Spielberg said that ""I wanted people to watch the images, not read the subtitles."" I completely disagree with that statement entirely, because I watch subtitles with every film, including English ones, and it makes me appreciate the story even more. So boo! And secondly, some characters were introduced in the beginning that were never really brought up again, like the one guy at the church.<br/><br/>But who really cares? Schindler's List is ultimately a masterpiece.<br/><br/>PS: Three hours and fifteen minutes has never flown by so fast."

","The most moving parts of the film are at the very start, when the candle is snuffed out in an Orthodox Jewish family, and the very end, when real life 'Schindler Jews' place stones on Schindler's grave in Israel. I found the last scene In the actual movie, of workers solemnly presenting Schindler with the ring they made for him, comes across as terribly schmaltzy and fake. Just the way it's lit, set-up, scripted and the music. It almost ruined the movie for me. Spielberg can't help himself when it comes to schmaltz. He needs someone to stop him!! I also am not a fan of the way Ben Kingsley's character, Itzhak Stern, is written. The humour of him scheming and pestering Schindler is laid on with a trowel -- I guess the writers felt they needed some light relief, but I found it annoying and contrived. The film does have some outstanding scenes. Such as when Schindler and his mistress witness the liquidation of the ghetto; the depictions of camp commandant Amon Goeth's normal family home compared to the squalor of the concentration camp; the Jewish architect arguing with the German guards over poor construction of the barracks; Schindler concocting a story about kids' tiny hands needed for armament manufacture; and the rabbi who isn't shot after several of the Nazi guard's guns don't work. The movie is paced very well, and the locations and cinematography are excellent. Perhaps most importantly, Schindler's List could be a source for education about the Holocaust, and also, to its credit, it doesn't depict Oskar Schindler as a saint. He profited from cheap labour and cheated on his wife. But he did save over 1000 Jewish lives, at risk of his own life."

Don't get me wrong it disgusts me what happened and upon seeing other movies on the subject matter and visiting concentration camps personally nothing disgusts me more but I just couldn't relate to the victims in Schindler's List. Maybe it was because there was no individual character to feel for but instead these crimes were being committed against nameless faces.<br/><br/>Also some of the scenes came off as slightly comical (whether they mean't to do that or not) but it made it hard to take this movie seriously.

","First off, this is not a bad film. I think it starts and ends quite well, but there are are too many scenes that seem to be there mostly to document atrocities done by the Nazis in WWII. I understand the motivation to put them all in there, but rather than convey some sense of horror and outrage that events like these should elicit, I found myself both numb and bored. These pseudo-documentary parts took me out of the story and made it really hard to pay attention at all. And this is coming from a huge documentary fan, as well as someone who is not at all turned off by a long run-time if the film warrants it.<br/><br/>Maybe Spielberg felt it was dishonouring the memory of the dead to leave those scenes on the cutting room floor, but for a film over three hours long, I can't help but feel that there's considerably less than two hours of narrative trying to hold it all together.<br/><br/>I was sixteen when this film came out, and I really didn't understand why it didn't work for me then.

"long-ford","Null","1","3","22 January 2009"," A notable achievement despite some unnecessary melodrama towards the end
","Schindler's List is a notable achievement for Spielberg. Here he presents a harrowing account of the horrors suffered by the Jews in World War II, along with a generally uplifting story of hope. All three major performances (Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes) are solid, specially Fiennes, who is impressive as an evil Nazi. The film is careful to present him as a fully formed character rather than a caricature. The clearance of the Jews from the Warsaw ghetto is shown in unsparing detail and without a trace of sentiment. Alas, Spielberg slips up in the end with a fake-sounding speech from Oskar Schindler melodramatically lamenting his inability to do more. Still strongly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"
"ianlouisiana","7","1","3","18 March 2006"," Is The Holocaust really a suitable subject for a Hollywood movie?
","Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold ""Surgical Rubberware"".Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies of ""The History of Torture"", ""The Kiss of the Whip"",""L'Erotisme au Cinema"" ""Health and Efficiency"" and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown handwritten sign promising ""Trusses fitted here"",""The Scourge of the Swastika"". As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of 1962,Mosley's rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off Colin Jordan,the British Nazis' new Messiah in a bloody battle near Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their grandparents' lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase for virtuoso acting. It's a horrific reminder of a period in recent history when all the vilest parts of man's nature were allowed and even encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours'flying time from London and don't let anybody kid you it couldn't happen again. However sober it might be I have a problem with ""Schindler's List"" inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific an event to be reduced to a ""Hollywood Movie"" status no matter how well intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie with star names and marketing it as ""Entertainment"" risks rousing the interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants."

","This is one of the most successful attempts of Spielberg to create his masterpiece and it's just off the mark..It suffers from what appears to haunt most Spielberg's efforts that is the 2/3 syndrome.For almost two hours the movie is appropriately realistic raw even and its plot is clever and absorbing .The acting is mostly top class especially from Neeson who balances superbly between shroudness and kindness and Ralph Fieness who incarnates the brutality and insanity of the third Reich and considers Jews subhumans. The cinematography is wonderful as usual and the camera work exemplary.The anti war message is conveyed in a strong shocking manner as is the message for human compassion in the middle of the holocaust.Similar qualities graced ""The empire of the sun"" .But as it happened in that movie as well , the balance gradually gets lost.Not due to miscalculation but due to a conscious submission to the melodramatic ...The public gets what the public wants? Maybe from a commercial point of view Spielberg's approach is more appealing to the patriotic or peace loving audience that loves the melodramatic. Not so if you belong to the group of people that don't like art to be reduced to a preaching to the converted.Not if you consider realism a virtue in this type of films.Not if you don't like mellow approaches. You can't fault the first two thirds of the movie.The movie is as it is exceptional, but not a masterpiece, by choice..I admire Spielberg for what he can create and has partly created but not what he chose to do to the end of potentially one of the best movies of all times for definitely non artistic reasons.. 7.5 out of 10 (10/10 for the first two thirds and 3/10 for the rest)"

The simple fact of being a Spielberg film warned me not to take it too seriously, after all he's always that dream embodier we all knew in his classics... touching little aliens, dire tough sharks, smart dinosaurs brought back to life and so on. Even here we have a stunning portrait of the evil (R.Fiennes really deserved the oscar he didn't get) but the real Amon Goeth had not a home on a hill as we can see, and he was arrested in September 44 by SS, then captured by americans and executed on Sept 46. All in this movie is clearly intended to make you feel dizzy and touched, this is of course not shifty, everyone knows this is a tear-jerker but what everyone seems to ignore is that you need some subterfuges when you aim to involve deeply someone in a story, and Spielberg knows how to do it, he knows it well, he is a master. So, here are the expected germans, shown as either monsters or homicidal robots; a bunch of events of which only the grotesque aspect is fully portrayed and most of all a movie that openly focalize only on jews, giving the impression (the same we get at school) that they are the greatest (or more important) victims of that period, think about people of the former USSR before answering ""well...isn't it?"". I said it makes you think, personally i had to think when i saw all the comments here in the IMDb about this film, seems people simply accept it without any reservation and with tears in their eyes... the power of being Steven Spielberg! And, most of all, the power of talking about Holocaust! I'm not a negationist, even though i don't accept blindly the classic version of history, and i'm definitely not a nazi-sympathizing, but i don't like hypocrisy and all forms of mass-conditioning, ""books say..."" ""Spielberg says..."" and everytime an hysterical and irrational commotion. That was a complicate period, you can't understand it reading a single book or watching a movie, anyway, everyone plays the wiseacre and gives his sentence. After all, i give a good 9/10 for film making, good acting, good directing, good soundtrack, good all; and 5/10 for pretentious politically correct intentions, a nice arithmetical 7/10 and life goes on."

","For anyone to adapt the novel as well as Spielberg has, that person would have to be a genius. The story is long, involved, and makes no bones about the ambivalence and inconsistence of Oskar Schindler. The tale is not nearly as simple as that of rescue. The adaptation and direction are perfect ... with one exception. The ending is rushed, the melodramatic speech by Schindler is terribly out of tone with the movie, and the playing of ""Jerusalem of Gold"" over the placing of stones on the Schindler grave is ludicrous to anyone who is Jewish and over forty. The last ten minutes of ""Schindler's List"" are pure and unfortunate Hollywood, plain and simple.<br/><br/>But the film has so much power and masterful storytelling in it that these flaws are tiny by comparison. The performances are heartbreaking, the tension tight and often less predictable than anyone could think, and the touches of color in the black & white film are symbolically exact. What happens in this movie is such a powerful illustration of anti-Semitism and the backdrop of Nazism that it is unquestionably required viewing for anyone who needs to see how insidious and destructive prejudice is, and how the Holocaust changed the world of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>My father and I saw this in the theater. He survived Auschwitz-Bierkinau and Matthausen. When he walked out of the movie, he clucked his tongue and stated flatly, ""It was worse than that."" I was in tears for hours. The disparity in that moment said much more to me than the movie itself about the story Spielberg had taken upon himself to tell. So be warned that this film is not for the faint of heart. Oddly, the cynics will probably view this movie with inexplicable dispassion. After all, how could anything this horrible have ever taken place within our lifetime?"

A tragedy that touches us on such a great, and personal level, that making a film about it and having it be critically acclaimed couldn't possibly be easier. The point is, that this is such an emotional topic, that anyone could make a film about it, and people would automatically swoon.<br/><br/>I think Steven Spielberg knew this. And by adding the oh-so-dramatic affect of black and white, and selective coloring that no one could resist. I found nothing incredible about this film. It was alright, yes. But nothing special.

I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic.

","Schindler's List is long, depressing, horrific and is in no means an easy film to watch but I personally believe all humans need to watch it to have a greater insight on the atrocity that was the Holocaust. The film has incredible acting with Liam Neeson giving the best performance of his career as Oskar Schindler the first flawed then latter redeemed protagonist of the film, not to mention Ben Kinglsley as Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the horrific, evil and vile yet also human Amon Goeth the ruthless Nazi commandant of the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp. The use of black and white is extremely well used by Spielberg giving the visuals a blunt almost nonchalant feeling of honesty about the events unfolding. But what is truly special is how he uses a small amount of color at certain moments in the film, like for instance the little girl in the red coat, that adds to the emotions being felt onscreen. Schindler's List is also incredibly tense at times. The threat of the Jewish characters being killed is constantly lingering with some scenes like the showers in Auschwitz and a worker being taken out back of the factory being unbearable to watch at times. But with all the horrible inhuman actions happening, the film also is quiet beautiful and hopeful and heartwarming towards the end that is sure to leave most audience members weeping. Schindler's List is a haunting film that will leave you emotionally broken by the end of it but will give you a greater insight and understanding of the truly inhuman acts committed during the holocaust that is important for all people to recognize and come to terms with."

"matouk-40766","9","1","4","9 December 2018"," Good, Evil and redemption
","Within the atrocity of the holocaust during the 40's, more than 6 million Jews were slaughtered; in very bloody war and tragic events, there was Schindler, a German Nazi businessman who, even in the middle of conflict of interest, has succeed to create a different connection with the victims. Schindler saw the victim as human, felt their pain and tried to do his best to save as many Jews as possible.
Schindler was a greedy war businessman who want to take advantage of the cheap Jewish labor to make fortune; he wasn't role model or hero for anyone; he was drinker and womanizer who wanted to hire Jewish labor at starvation wages; however, some events marked him during the war. Maybe among the most important elements of the story is how the filmmaker wanted to personalize each character, even victims. Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler) in the film developed a sort of friendship with his chief worker Ben Kingsley (Itzhak Stern). The ultimate turning point that got him involved and discovers his humanity is when he saw the dead body of girl with red coat among other kids slaughtered by Nazis; the image invaded his mind and awakens his emotions to turn into a savior. The girl with red coat was the center of attention even before she died as Spielberg wanted the audience to focus on her as an innocent scary kid full of life, the only colored character in the film; her death was felt by Schindler as the end of hope. Schindler then started to recruit as much worker as possible to save them from death, his mission wasn't to make profit anymore as it was started at the beginning, he established solid relationships with some Jewish workers and becomes a hope for many victims. The greedy guy who was capable to do everything to make money started to his workers as humans, feeling their pain, Oskar Schindler ended up broken, the only thing he kept was a list of people he saved, and he could have saved; full of regrets and sadness that he could have saved more but he didn't.
Schindler's List exhibits the good and the evil as theme, it also exhibits hope and redemption. The leader of the camp Ralph Fiennes (Amon Goethe) had another plot point elaborated in parallel with Schindler's story to portrait the atrocity and the cruelty of the Nazi regime, he is cold blooded killer who believes strongly in the Nazi ideology; but conflicted at the end by developing feelings towards Helen (Eberth Davidtz); she was his housekeeper, he beats her, slams her every time as his emotions were confronted between love of his mission as a Nazi and loving a Jewish girl; both were amazing and completed the roles, well played characters in all dimensions.
As mentioned before, the theme also touches redemption, another film with appropriateness of the theme is probably Valkyrie by Tom Cruise, another movie about soldier who collaborated with some of his superiors to kill Adolph Hitler, the character felt redemption after what happened at the war; the only solution to end the chaos is turn against his regime.
There are many techniques that made the movie personable, touchable and interesting to the viewers, but maybe the most important ones in my opinion are lighting, color and editing; the movie was black and white except for the beginning before the Nazis invade the town; the movie was grey to reflect the atrocity and loss of hope during the era, grey also was needed to exhibit explore the theme of evil which is represented by the misery and cruelty of life conditions of the Jewish people. The girl with red coat was the only colored character, a bullet to the audience heart who can't miss the scene, she was the turning point of Schindler; thus, the whole story. Editing was also a relevant technique to expose the contrast of two parallel world, the cruelty the Jews endure everyday with bullets in the head, starving to death and died in the cold contrasted with the luxury of Nazis' houses dancing with women around drinks. The were two scenes that contradict each other many times in the film.
What's amazing in this film is that, in many war movies, audience barely relates to the victims at the individual level, audience mainly feel the horror from the mass killing; this film however is different, Steven Spielberg exposed the victims and related them to the audience to feel them individually; he made a short story of each one differently, characters that we cannot ignore and forced to understand throughout the film, it made the movie so personalized to the audience."

For the 25th Anniversary of this Spielberg masterpiece, the film has been re-released in theaters for a short time remastered for Dolby Cinema and should not be missed. Based on a true story, shot more like a documentary than a feature film, it gives one of the most realistic & heart wrenching portrayals of the Holocaust put on film. It explores the depths of what makes someone good or evil, using its black & white color palette to further illustrate the grey middle ground that our protagonist walks. It is mind blowing that neither Liam Neeson nor Ralph Fiennes won an Oscar for their portrayals of Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth, respectively. Nor Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern for that matter. John Williams' score is beautiful & haunting, exactly as it should be, adding to what is probably Spielberg's greatest film. It is too fitting a time for this release with today's political climate & the amount of hate being spewed by people in power toward ""those"" that are different than ""us"". Reminding us that if we do not stand up to this hate, it won't be long until we're back in this kind of situation again."

"SteveyMac70","10","1","4","12 August 2018"," A powerful, evocative, must see movie
","I have just finished watching this movie for the first time and OMG how on earth did I let this one slip by! It has to me one of the most powerful, moving and thought evoking movies ever produced, made even more so by the fact that it is a true story and these atrocities actually happened. This is not my usual genre but I was engrossed for the full 3 hours 15 minutes that the movie ran for. Spielberg really brings this one home! This is arguably his best movie to date and he has some great movies to compare against. I have also seen Liam Neeson in a completely different light and this performance really highlights what a truly great actor he is.<br/><br/>I know there are some views on here stating that we don't need these atrocities spelled out to us in such a brutal fashion but actually I think we do. Yes we all know that atrocities happened during WWII but watching Schindler's List brings home the reality of it and really lets you empathize with the plight of not just the Jews but every other persecuted people in nearly every other war throughout history and the genocide that is still happens today. We should never forget that this and other atrocities actually happened, which some quarters seem to want us to do in today's politically correct society. It also shows us that even in the darkest hour there will always be a light of hope and humanity and that there are still good people in the world.<br/><br/>Everybody should see this movie once and even if you think it is too much and score a 1, you can't be human if you are not moved just a little."
"NikkoFranco","8","1","4","7 June 2018"," The Accidental Hero Playboy
","No one argues about the ingenuity of Steven Spielberg , if you first saw this film in the 90s, it is guaranteed you probably left the cinema in tears. It is brilliantly dramatized and shot , the actors shine , no doubt. However , some months later I read a lengthy article from Schindler's widow contradicting the veracity of Spielberg's film version of the events and then Spielberg even being interviewed admitting that he felt ashamed not having done more research hence my changed perspective about the film. As to what extent can we stretch the viewer's imagination to elicit empathy considering that this is a reboot of a film released ten years earlier. Ben Kingsley can take any role with his versatility so his underacting as the accountant deserves more accolade. Ralph Fiennes as the brutal officer is theatrical and Liam Neeson pulls off a surprise as Schindler."
"istvan-j-balazs","10","1","4","5 June 2018"," Masterpiece Movie in depicting the two different poles of the human behavior: cruelty & compassion
","SpielbergÂ´s masterpiece has become an etalon on how important are the good/positive human values such as: compassion, true desire to save others life, high social sensibility. The heart-touching, intensely moving film music couldnÂ´t be written by any other composer than John Williams. I highly recommend watching this movie for anybody who has doubts about the truth about the cruelness, the devastation, and dehuminzation factor of the Holocaust, and how can a single person turn the history of hundreds and hundreds of peopleÂ´s life being saved."

"gedachtniskirche","5","1","4","8 July 2013"," The doubtful masterpiece
","Very difficult to make a generic and objectively assess to this movie, which there are some righteous doubts in the authenticity of the historical background in. But Steven Spielberg, preferring to take on faith a history of the German businessman Oskar Schindler, with his characteristic royal scope, built his own Â«spielberg'sÂ» version of the story, that impressed him, editing the storyline, characters and types of the main actors in accordance with his personal and commercial considerations.<br/><br/>Only abstracting away from the doubts in plausibility filmed story, I can appreciate enjoy a film with unbiased perception. It is possible even to seek assistance with a particular extent of delight under such stipulations. A beautiful and moving story of selfless and honest German businessman, member of the Nazi party, Oskar Schindler, a brave, daring, going against the system. <br/><br/>But importunate and suspicious taste of something unnatural and inedible prevents obediently to chew and swallow the product prepared by Spielberg,having never choked. <br/><br/>What was guided by Steven Spielberg, forcing him to stop his choice on a candidature of Ralph Fiennes for the Amon Goeth's role? Maybe his diabolical sexuality? But, pardon me, the real Amon Goeth evoked a completely different impressions! He inspired fear and trembling! Make-up artists vainly tried to abundantly dye in a dark the reddish color of the face's Â«vegetationÂ» of the actor; the actor vainly rehearsed in front of the mirror the most disgusting and frightening cruelty's Â«symptomsÂ» on the his face; he vainly stuck out his unnaturally drooped, due to excessive Â«GuinnesÂ» consumption, belly, - Ralph Fiennes was hopelessly far from a real Amon Goeth. The Spielberg's idea was realized! The Director's idea to draw the increased attention to historical-biographical drama of the female audience with the help of the charming Â«bad boyÂ», who gracefully shoots, as morning exercises, the Jews, frightened to death, from his villa's balcony, - is failed to cheer him. It was successful so well, that we don't feel fair disgust and loathing for Fiennes's character. On the contrary, sometimes we laugh over his comic remarks and ridiculous pomposity. So where disgust will undertake from, if the adventurous Director turned cruel, mentally unbalanced alcoholic into polished glamorous SS-dummy!? Women are thrilled and fall into a hypnotic trance from his painted bottomless black eyes, men delightedly appreciate elegant SS-uniform, perfectly tailored fit, and negligent, but so graceful possession of firearms. That's a truly excellent and win-win move! It's hard to call the real Goeth even a little attractive and charismatic. Especially in the years when he became a commandant of Plaszow. Overweight, with a huge shivering belly, with a bloated of regular alcoholic libation, lop-eared, balding guy with the loathsome appearance, he doesn't distantly even remind the noble thoroughbred appearance of the British actor. The question is, why Tim Roth's candidate, originally proposed for the role of Plaszow's commandant didn't please Spielberg? That's really who would fully embody this odious image, having forced the audience to feel hate and contempt for his character. Having conveyed the impeccability and truthfulness of the story, the Director wouldn't receive delights and falls of thankful sobs. His ennobled and presumptuous Oscar Schindler had to be pleasant to the audience by all means, having excluded any suspicions in decency and unselfishness of his true outbursts. His glossy and dandified Amon Goeth, also should not have caused the unanimous disgust among spectators, but finely contribute to the commercial success of the film. And these characters were undoubtedly successful! With the only one amendment: they are hopelessly far from their real prototypes.<br/><br/>Why the eminent director so responsibly and meticulously approached to selection of the skinny and too exhausted men and women, participating in the crowd of prisoners of concentration camp, but so ridiculously missed with the main embodiment of the evil in the movie? Just only one Steven Spielberg knows, why the main characters and story lines of the screened story are so mercilessly deformed, while the secondary moments are scrupulously and meticulously closed to the realityÂ But as a result, everybody remained happy: the Director didn't manage to count the box office and receive enthusiastic praises of film critics choking with impressions, actors ""coin boxes"" were replenished with new characteristic roles, and the audience that believed in a fairy tale of good and unselfish German businessman, didn't manage to change handkerchiefs, become impregnated through with their fluids of snot and drool.<br/><br/>What in general to create the caricatures on tragical, historical and biographic dramas for? The talented Spielberg has many excellent movies in different genres, from the same military And to science fiction, so it is possible to turn around in the full extent of his inexhaustible and rich imagination within the screenplay. But no, he prepared his project for years, diligently and concentrated studied biographies of heroes, met with eyewitnesses of events, carried out an actor's castings, so the audience saw the upside down turned story in the end. The story, where we with equal degree of sympathy treat both charming Oscar Schindler, and deliberately comical and not less charming Amon Goeth, with manicured fingers and porcelain face from the excess of make-up. And, by the way, Â«Schindler's ListÂ» - is one of the movies-the Champions of the number of absurd and rude goofs. Alas, it often happens, that the grandiose plan is realized in the same grandiose project, it interferes the deep perception with it's coverage and the grandiloquent announcement, programming the Â«consumersÂ» for quite expected unanimous, just weak-sighted admiration.<br/><br/>By the way, Roman Polanski ignored the search of weedy and bony actors for his crowd scene in his Â«The PianistÂ» , but he is fully focused on the main thing, creating almost identical to the real cinematic images. The Director honestly conveyed the authenticity of the story, without romantic embellishment and alternative finals. <br/><br/>But Steven Spielberg believes that he has all the reasons to rewrite the history."
"ureshinamida","7","1","4","26 May 2005"," Interesting characters but slow-paced
","I rented this movie after hearing that it was a classic. I like that every character in this movie is interesting. You connect with them and recognize so many faces that you wouldn't in another film.<br/><br/>However, I would not call the film perfect. Moving, heartbreaking, yes. However, I feel that it should have focused more on Schindler's factory. We all know the historical facts about the holocaust, but Schindler's heroism is a unique story, one that has not been told.<br/><br/>Some scenes, like when Schindler witnesses a raid while horseback riding, were necessary and I would not have cut them out. However, scenes like when the Nazi officer searches for a maid or when a Jewish engineer insists that a foundation be re-poured were repetitive and stretched out the movie.<br/><br/>However, it is still worth seeing for the gorgeous cinematography and Schindler's final words in the film."
"RJ-21","10","1","4","8 June 1999"," Excellent film, but flawed.
","I found Schindler's List a wonderful movie.  It is one of very few movies which are watchable over three hours.  Moreover, one of even fewer which are moving, fascinating and entertaining over its three hours.  It comes second to La Vita E Bella in terms of presenting the real holocaust, though - not in terms of realism but because in LVeB, we care more about the victims. In SL, we care about Helen and Stern, but not too many others.  In LVeB, we care about the family, and so it is even sadder when the holocaust takes its toll on them.  The most powerful parts of SL are either the scenes without dialogue where we see mass suffering, or where Liam Neeson places his demands for Schindler's Jews.  The balance of sentimentality just wasn't right.  In most of Spielberg's work, there is too much (I did fear it and when we got shots of the children, I almost felt like walking away) but in SL there was not enough.  However, I gave it a 9, because the film as a whole was more than these flaws."

Its rating will fall quite rapidly over the next ten years."

"catblanket","1","3","25","7 June 2018"," Schindler's List's biggest issue is that it's a Holocaust movie with a happy ending.
","The biggest issue with the film is that it uses a historical event that doesn't work as a movie. The movie about the holocaust is turned into a hero story about a Nazi
instead of a movie about dehumanization, death and murder of millions of Jews. The Holocaust is about millions of Jews that died, Schindler's List is about a few hundred that don't."
"Rabster22","6","2","14","18 April 2003"," A one watch wonder
","This film is truly riveting...if you have never seen it before. One can even forgive the excessive time it takes to tease out some sort of story. However, on subsequent viewings it quickly becomes tedious, unlike other films it retains no shock value, in fact it seems positively pedestrian. Watch it once, you will be captivated, beyond that it has nothing."
"Wade_Kingston","9","1","5","26 March 2019"," Excellent and Important, But Not Perfect
","Schindler's List is one of Spielberg's finest films in most respects. The story, cinematography and attention to detail are arresting. Spielberg's use of light is never less than extraordinary, with many superb examples of it in this black and white film. It won a deserved Oscar for Best Picture, and the subject matter--one man's attempt to save Jews from the horrors of the Holocaust (vividly depicted)--makes it required viewing, especially to deniers of that entire part of history.<br/><br/>But I did find it a bit of a slog to get through. It's a film I haven't watched more than once. This doesn't make it a bad film, just one I appreciated once and let go. For one thing I felt it could have been more severely edited and still have kept its impact. In short, I felt its length. For another, I felt a curious detachment from the character of Schindler himself, as well as other characters. It seemed as if I were on the outside looking in, as opposed to being there in the action. Perhaps that was deliberate, but it kept me at arm's length. The result was that it often felt more like a documentary than a drama. Perhaps some of that is unavoidable. In order to depict the grim reality of man's inhumanity to man, maybe we do need to be kept at arm's length. I also felt the music (sad and beautiful violins) became heavy-handed after an hour or so. Again, probably Spielberg's exact intention, but I did not care for it.<br/><br/>To me, the highest-rated films are those I will gladly watch over and over. So, I give Schindler's List 10 stars on its merits. It is excellent, it is important, it should be seen. I give it 8 stars for repeat watch-ability, or 9 overall."

"oOoBarracuda","5","1","5","9 May 2016"," Schindler's List
","Oskar Schindler was a German member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. In 1993, Steven Spielberg believed Oskar Schindler's was a story that needed to be told, directing that year's Best Picture Academy Award winning film. Casting Liam Neeson in the titular role with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes in strong supporting roles, Oskar Schindler's courageous story was brought to life. The story of an unlikely hero proves the point that even the most individual of lives can be turned to a life lived for the masses. <br/><br/>Oskar Schindler was not who you would typically think of as a hero. He was a drinker, a womanizer, and a frequent gambler who had one goal in mind of becoming a millionaire. Liam Neeson illustrates the many flaws of Oskar wonderfully through his many scenes drinking, gambling, and philandering against his wife in the first half of the film. The Holocaust gives Schindler a golden opportunity to realize his dreams of riches. Schindler begins to employ vulnerable Jews as laborers in his factories, saving them from certain exile and saving him immense amounts in labor costs. Gradually over time, he becomes deeply affected by the treatment of the Jews, especially that of his accountant and partner of sorts, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Schindler then starts going to great lengths to protect as many Jews as he can, even convincing the German high command to allow him to build another factory and employ more Jews. Schindler even puts himself at risk by going head to head with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) S.S. Officer in command of KrakÃ³w-PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp. Even when one camp is closed, Schindler arranges for ""his"" Jews to be transplanted in another factory. When the train carrying truckloads of Jewish women is deferred to Auschwitz, Schindler races the train down to have them freed using funds from the massive riches he has amassed. By the war's, and the film's conclusion, we see that Schindler has lost all of his wealth in the attempt to save as many Jews as he could from persecution; being responsible for saving the lives of 1,200 people. <br/><br/>Many film devices were used exceptionally well throughout this film which is no doubt due to Steven Spielberg's skill as a director. The film starts out in color, then fades to black and white only to be illuminated in color at its conclusion (and who could forget that red coat scene). This was a marvelous way to illustrate the lives of the millions of Jews affected by the Holocaust to the grim reality they faced once it started (black and white) to the realities they could experience after the persecution ended (return to color). The film could not have told the grim tale it told in color and the fade to black and white was one of the brilliant decisions Spielberg made in this film. The title cards used throughout the first quarter of the movie was a wonderful use to keep the audience engaged and learn further details about the characters involved. The most powerful aspect of this movie has to be its use of sound. I have never watched a movie that used sound so well in a film, especially diegetic sound. The sound is the easiest way to pull an audience into a film and to set the mood of the story, Spielberg, however, uses sound in inventive ways to produce realism by really immersing the film into the 1940's. The film closes with a powerful scene in which we see, in present-day the many descendants of the people saved by Schindler's list, reiterating the powerful reminder of the origins of dangerous political power, especially needed in today's election cycle."
"imhotep3","6","1","5","19 January 2014"," Very touching, unfortunately not realistic
","I like this movie. But I wouldn't say, this movie is much better than others from same genre, which show this dark part of human history. That emotional strength is based on real events, not on skills of film makers. And when they tired to add something to boost impression, they turned off from course too much. I am from former Czechoslovakia, where Schindler was born, he was betrayer, who worked for German secret service, who entered NSDAP and some historians said, he wasn't so unselfish and gracious. Basically, he was probably very self-seeking, so I recommend you to search somewhere else, before you will draw conclusions.<br/><br/>But as I said, in other respects this would be good movie, just like many others - Pianist,.."
"redrawn","6","1","5","17 January 2013"," Schindler's List
","My problem with Schindler's List is its portrayal of the Holocaust. As Stanley Kubrick said: ""The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't."" Schindler's List hankers for success, not only its story, but in its artistic and commercial success too. It is a wonderfully produced, beautifully shot, honestly acted drama about success in the greatest human tragedy in recent times. Despite its good intentions, it loses its honesty, its integrity, in its bid as an entertainment venture and commercial interest. A film warning us about the Holocaust ought to serve as a painful warning, to be educational and true in its facts, not have someone you artistic license to curb a story and make for a better film experience. If honesty is at stake, dramatised events can be ineffectual."
"Forever_James_Dean","5","1","5","3 February 2006"," A Sobering Reality Check...
","Mr. Spielberg did a great movie about the holocaust and how a non-Jew was in the forefront of saving Jews from certain death by the SS squads. I hope that Mr. Spielberg will one day go full circle and include all the pain, misery, and sufferings brought upon by the SS during WWII upon the Gypsies, The Christians, The 20,000 Polish officers killed by Stalin's men in Katyn, Poland in 1941, and tell the tales of all God's Children of The Human Race, instead of just one. All The Forgotten, All The Weak and Oppressed during the nightmares of The Holocaust, mot only always about ""The Chosen"". I think the movie was very inspiring and spoke of the horrors that befall mankind when mankind ""forgets"" the past. We need to look at this movie with not only reverence but a deep seated understanding that it ""could"" happen again if ""good people remain silent."""
"mbuchwal","Null","1","5","10 February 2005"," See ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" instead.
","In one of the final scenes of ""Schindler's List,"" which may serve as a microcosm of this terribly flawed movie, a camp inmate is depicted as being so grateful to his kindly and charitable Nazi liberator that with his own hand he removes a gold tooth from his own mouth and gratefully hands it to the Nazi as a gift. Allowing that such a thing may actually have taken place, still I believe one is entitled to question the artistic judgment the director exercised in showing it. Surely Mr. Spielberg has seen the film ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" and knows that among the damning evidence presented by the United States Army War Tribunal against Nazi war criminals were gold teeth that were forcibly removed from the mouths of inmates and kept as booty by the thugs who ran the camps. In the wake of the war crimes trials, the extracted gold tooth became one of the main icons or symbols of the horrible wrongs perpetrated against the Jews by the Nazis. What kind of a sick joke is it to show a camp inmate voluntarily extracting his own gold tooth, when it is very well known that it was usually either Nazi camp guards or ""sonderkommandos"" (camp inmates who turned traitor) who forcibly performed the extractions, sometimes before the victim was even put to death? <br/><br/>The entire movie is defective in my opinion, because it conveys the idea that there was significant Nazi sympathy for concentration camp inmates. For a generation of film-goer who did not live through World War II and who were born decades later, this film may be the only one they'll see on the subject of concentration camps and the Nazis. Many of the audience probably left the theaters after seeing this film with the false impression that it wasn't so bad in the forced labor camps because the guys running them were sympathetic, charitably minded human beings. In fact, most Nazis who had anything to do with the camps or forced labor were the worst sort of subhuman vermin (they were called the ""scum of Europe"" at the time). What purpose does it serve to depict any Nazi with control over concentration camp inmates as a philanthropist, with a charming romantic passion for his imprisoned slaves? <br/><br/>As a rule, any so-called historical truth is open to question and doubt, never more so in a movie than here. Although the facts in ""Schindler's List"" are generally accepted by film-goers and critics alike (according to the press), can we be absolutely sure they are true, when everything else we know about the subject runs 180 degrees in the opposite direction? Just because a work has been published or produced doesn't make it true. Many historical accounts have been proved wrong in spirit and in fact.<br/><br/>The danger of any movie that treats controversial and ethically difficult historical subject matter is that it is likely to be regarded as a universal truth about the period instead of as a particular story. So I don't regard this movie as true history, because it is misleading as a generalization. And possibly some or all of the relevant ""facts"" presented are false or distorted. I recommend to anyone who does not want to be misled about the holocaust that they see ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" instead!"

I did not realise it was black and white until I started watching it, got 20 mins in, and after an hour I turned it off. its completely awful.<br/><br/>The film's set during the second world war and is about Jewish people trying to survive, I don't know the full details because the film is in black and white which makes it hard to see. Set in the olden days this film really lacks any action, a lot of the scenes are unrealistic, and the blood is fake because its black and white. nothing really happens in this film to entertain the viewer, you would think that being black and white it would have some action to make it more entertaining. but no, none of that. just a painfully slow, boring mess of a film that's shot in black and white.<br/><br/>Stay away from this, for a much better, modern film about the Jews, watch Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds.

It is heartening to see that during that time where were few people who could bet their everything on saving lives of others. No wonder the world survived so long to all those brave men like Schindler."

","Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is almost a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.""<br/><br/>
The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve (but still it is just a plaque of documentary as it shows only Schindler's life and describes a little bit about war), and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.<br/><br/>John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. <br/><br/>Maybe it is not the best movie in the world, you will definitely find flows, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Some movies are easily forgotten..And and there are some like ""Schindler's List"" that are timeless masterpiece in every sense. 
The movie is based on Oskar Schindler, a businessman and a Nazi-supporter, who initially makes huge wealth as a military supplier by employing homeless Jewish labour. But as he experiences and witness the horror of war crimes against Jews during the World war, he risks everything for those he initially had no special heart for. 
The direction by Spielberg is beyond good, with an apt choice of black and white cinematography depicting both the actual period of the story and the darkness of the crimes. Music score by John Williams blends perfectly with the scenes. A role of a lifetime for Liam Neeson and others.
The movie, with running time of almost 3 hours and not a loose moment in the script, is a must watch on every movie-buff's list. One may or may not agree with the historical accuracy, but the movie is undeniably a legend in its own right."

It was such a long movie, i nearly fell asleep. The bright spot in this movie was Liam Neeson, who played Oscar Schindler. He was flawless. I really like his emotion towards the end of the movie. Thats my favorite part. I know this isn't supposed to be a movie that people are supposed to really enjoy, so maybe that is a reason for my lower rating. I would suggest this movie only if you haven't seen any movies about the Holocaust before. Personally, i thought the Pianist was a better film than this one."

","A movie has to have offer the viewer something.  It can be a much needed laugh, thrill, fright, or even historical information.  What does Schindler's List offer us other than yet another look at this tired old topic that media has labeled ""the holocaust""?  Nothing.  There are scores and scores of movies about the holocaust.  Why are there so many movies about the holocaust?  To help make sure that sympathy and support for the Jews where it counts (i.e. the U.S.A.) remains high.  Do you know of anyone who likes watching material over and over and over and over about the death of a few million Jews......3000 miles away......that took place more than 50 years ago?  I can understand people's affinity to movies related to a certain topic, such as war movies; some war movies are historically educational, others are entertaining cinematic renditions of certain battles (such as ""Saving Private Ryan"").  But who the hell is entertained by ""the holocaust"".  After the first or second movie about the holocaust (in conjunction with the endless time devoted to it in high school history class), the historical aspects had been amply covered.  Now we have Schindler's List.  There's minimal history associated with it (except for a handful of survivor's walking across a graveyard at the end).  Look at it this way: had the people working in Schindler's factory been ethnic Albanians or Martians, the movie would have remained the same.  To me, that makes for a very bad movie.<br/><br/>""Life is Beautiful"", a movie taking place during the holocaust, was a spectacular movie because, rather than being a blatant attempt at propaganda, it was actually a movie that was meant to give the viewer something.  Laughter."

","""Schindler's List"" is terrific filmmaking, with Spielberg at his peak as a director and wonderful cinematography.

For a better portrayal of life inside concentration camps, try reading ""Maus."""
"iamsethh","5","1","6","29 January 2000"," Not nearly as good as it could have been
","This movie took a subject which was extremely complicated and difficult, and dumbed it down to the level that everyone except Representative Tom Coburn (OK) could understand it (he complained about the networks ""polluting the minds of our children"" when it was shown on tv, because it had nudity and violence). Oscar Schindler was an anti-semite, a real anti-semite. Someone once asked him why he had done what he did, and he said something along the lines of ""if you see a dog hit by a car dying in the street, you know you're better then the dog, but you still want to help it"" (he was equating Jews with dogs, placing them on the same moral level). He was also a womanizer and alcoholic. The golden ring he was given at the end of the film, in real life was later traded for a drink. This was not the same Schindler portrayed in the movie. The film attempted to show some of his ""seedy"" side, I think that's what the secretary hiring scene was supposed to be, but it didn't really work, and I didn't end up thinking Oscar Schindler was that bad of a guy. This could have been a much richer film if it was about a bad person who did a good thing, which was what the historical event actually was.<br/><br/>The film, I think, was meant to be an educational project. It was meant to teach people about the holocaust when they really didn't know much about it. As that, it succeeds. This is a movie that should be shown to middle school students when the holocaust is being studied. It brings knowledge to the masses which they otherwise would not have known about. but as art, as a movie, it just dressed itself up as a ""serious art film"", while actually really dumbing down the subject. If you're already familiar with the subject matter, if you already knew genocide was bad, that Nazis were crazy, and that the holocaust was an enraging and sad event, then there's really nothing in the movie to think about. I would put this film in the same class as Man On The Moon - mediocre films that have nothing to offer beyond introducing the audience to events they may be unfamiliar with."
"action-6","2","2","19","17 June 2000"," Frighteningly realistic
","Schindler`s List is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white. This in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching this film.  The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination. The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from Steven Spielberg.  This means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood.  The movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people.  Being able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not English. The scenes from the concentration-camps(KZ-LAGER)are really scary and nasty, but very realistic. Prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the Nazis in a way that you won`t see in other feature-films, only in documentaries. 10/10"

","Schindler's List is an extremely detailed movie about the Holocaust, showing what life was really like for not only the Jews but the Nazi's as well. During the beginning of the war, Oskar Schindler is a businessman who wants to take advantage of the Jewish/Polish workers. He has an enamelware company which he makes a large profit from thanks to the workers he not only employed, but saved. He then realizes that by employing Jews, he is rescuing them. He changes throughout the movie from a greedy businessman to a humanitarian. This is a great example of how on can transition from being selfish to a selfless leader, which in the end, is what Schindler became."

","An epic true statement about probably the only member of the Nazi party that saved the victims behind one of the most atrocious massacre in history...and surprisingly, despite the heart-wrenching details and the inhumane deeds being presented on-screen, it gave off quite an overall positive impact too.<br/><br/>However, It failed to be included into my top list. Considering the weight of the subject matter, i expected a lot more from this movie. I believe the movie could have investigated things deeper and further given the amount of time allocated to this movie.<br/><br/>But it didn't, and some of the scenes behave in a way that I think it was kind of sugarcoated, or over-dramatized, that sometimes I wonder whether the scenes meant to emulate the harsh truth of war did serve their purpose. I am not saying the atrocities should have been made more gory - it doesn't need to - all I am asking and expecting is to do more justice to viewers who are relying on this movie to understand what has happened in a the full extent of this historical chapter."

","This film trivialises the holocaust. Unlike most of your reviewers, and like most normal people, I did know a bit about the subject before Schindler's List came out. I didn't need to be told that this was a shameful episode in history, and that it should not be repeated. The existence of this film won't make a toss of difference when the next crackpot decides to kill whichever race he has a grudge against, and it won't activate his acquiescing public. Spielberg obviously set out to enlighten us on the holocaust, but for me it made it more distant. We barely got to know any Jewish character that was immediately under threat, and the only character that was explored with any depth was Schindler, the hero - the most audience-friendly element. To film in black and white was a ridiculous decision - tantamount to Spielberg just saying, 'Yes, I know that this is a serious subject, but I'm going to deflect your attention and make the whole experience less real.'. Such is the way of cinema."

","To say that you don't like Speilberg is almost unamerican, certain to get you dismissed as an arty naysayer.  How could you not love Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Schindler's List?<br/><br/>Indeed, how could you not.  They are all honed and perfected in every possible way.  Anything that you might not enjoy, that might not contribute to your complete and utter passive entertainment, has been sandpapered away, leaving a smooth, coated lozenge of American moviemaking.  They are perfection personified.<br/><br/>And while that makes these films impossible to hate, it also makes them impossible to love, at least in the way that I love movies.  I want my favorite films to push back, to argue with me, and with themselves.  What has been lost in the process of perfection is personality, the willingness to fail, to be boring, or slow, or stupid, or half-baked.  To write a line of bad dialogue, to cut a scene too short or too long.  To risk an ugly shot in search of a mind blowing one, or to move the camera and risk a shaky scene.  Godard, the anti Speilberg if there ever was one, did all of these things over and over.  To watch a Godard film, even a truly awful one (and there were quite a few), is thrilling.  To watch a bad Speilberg film (say, 1941) is numbing and unbearable, as the lack of personality simply shines through.<br/><br/>And then there is Schindler's List, Speilberg's 'art' film.  Visually, it makes all manner of stylistic references to everyone from Kurosawa to Bergman (two decidely risk taking filmmakers), but spiritually it's closer in spirit to Lean's Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago, 'quality' films where even the beauty is stifling.  It seems designed, much like his action blockbusters, so that there is nothing bad you can say about it.  Great photography abounds, but never in a way that makes you want to sit up and notice.  It's like a series of postcards from the holocaust.   It's emotionally wrenching, at times, but never in a way that demands that you become uncomfortable.  And it builds up to a treacly ending that rings so false that it's almost embarrassing.<br/><br/>So there you go.  I'm sure I've made some people hate me, but so be it."
"cordelialeite","Null","1","9","11 February 2020"," Dull and too long
","Movies and documentaries about Holocaust are necessary to show people how hate and fear can turn human beings into monstrous beings but I rarely see those movies speaking about gypsies, homosexuals, disabled, mentally ill and other minorities who were also treated in a very inhumane way.
In general, those stories lack something showing people how every human being must be treated with respect and dignity because, as another user said, people seem to be interested only in their cause, even if their neighbor's pain is similar to their own (in this case discrimination).
Disliking such a movie apparently makes one automatically a bad person, but portraying arabians as terrorists seems to be fine for many, and implying gypsies and bad and dishonest as well.
The same people who will reprimand you for disliking Schindler's List are the ones who think it's ok to hate on fats, homosexuals, the disabled. They are the same ones who think the mentally ill are just weak minded, the victims or rape brought it to themselves or the poor are lazy or undeserving of a better life.
Society needs movies telling all types of stories about discriminated communities, individuals and ethnicities. The fact that the same person capable of great gratuitous dislike towards one person and great empathy towards another tells that we are missing a link that shows how every person should be treated with respect and not only one group."

But, in time, I became disappointed: the film is good, compared with the trash we're accustomed 2 watch these days (& almost all last decade), but it doesn't deserve the consideration of an ""All-Time Classic"", because it isn't. It's a subjective story told from a personal & subjective point of view (Steven Spielberg is Jew), & it tries 2 emphasize the violent side of it, but payin' few attention 2 anything else. Some scenes R disconnected from the rest of the plot, it contains nudity & sex scenes that don't fit 2 the tale (sexual relationships among Mr. & Ms. Schindler, between Amon GÃÂ¶th & her lover) & make the movie become rather vulgar instead of true classic. It's got sometimes the taste of a documentary, but the connection between the general scenes & the fictional (particular) ones is not very well made. The violent scenes (especially shootin') R too explicit (there's no need 2 place a camera & stop it above a dead body bleedin' 4 showin' us the crimes that were committed). The idea of shootin' the film in B&W, I think it's actually because that was very ""in"" those years & it only took a good excuse 2 do it. If Spielberg really wanted 2 make a rigor approach 2 the matter the same way it was told by those media, he would have also made the film with analog Mono sound, & with less explicit violence.

The good half part of this movie is good actor Liam Neeson, good effort to make it real (so many people and so much effort to make it look real). My advice is to watch this only if you like Liam Neeson (because of Taken) or if you like this genre. You won't be disappointed, even when much younger, Liam still looks like in Taken.

","Schindler's List is absolutely flawless, from the cinematography to the score, to the absolutely realistic performances, this film is the true MASTERPIECE of the 90's. It's a three hour movie about the holocaust, which if I'm being 100% honest with you, feels more like 1 hour and 50 minutes, it's almost too short, this film could never have a remake, it is one of those golden films you should never try to approach again. Oskar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson) is basically a rich Nazi, who has Jew workers because they make more money than the Germans, let me start off by saying this easily the most realistic and greatest performance ever put on screen! When I talk about this film, I cannot help but smile, because films that are this perfectly made and top tier always make me feel proud that Spielberg exists. E.T. was the movie that made me love movies, Jurassic Park was a movie that made me want to make movies and Schindler's List is a movie that made me care much more about cinema. I want to talk about this movie for as long as I can, so buckle up for a long review.<br/><br/>Schindler's List is about the holocaust, Stanley Kubrick was originally going to take the project, but his extensive research made him depressed and it was also a movie with a happy ending, which with most of Kubrick's work is not the usual way he likes to go with it, so he gave the project to his good friend, Steven Spielberg! Kubrick was so fascinated by Jurassic Park and said he had been looking to capture someone a film that's not real as realistically as Spielberg did, so you could tell they had a friendship. He also loved E.T and more of Spielberg's work, so he trusted him with the project and it ended up being the greatest film ever. Every thing is on point, it feels more like a documentary from the 1940's holocaust than it does a film, and the performances don't even feel like performances, they feel like the real thing. Schindler basically saved 1,100 Jews, so if that's not enough to say that he's a hero, then I don't know what is!<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, but to be honest with you, it feels more like Amon Goeth is playing Amon Goeth because of how realistic the performances really feel, every scene is perfectly shot, but the one thing I cannot understand is that it has an M rating in Australia, this film literally has around 500 naked people, around three sex scenes, 100 f-bombs, strong violence and little kids being killed by the Nazis and that is not deserving of an R rating?

","Strong and persuasive without being visceral. Schindler's List touches on the lives of many without feeling too sentimental to its subjects. It wants to be objective and given what we have seen throughout the history of cinema, propaganda and jingoism. One needs an honest look at the tragedies of humanity.
BE: It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and like Coppola, he spent the first little while trying to emulate it and then decided to just shoot whatever he wanted. The film is pure vision and drive. Everyone on set put in their best performance, and as always Spielberg's sequencing is outstanding, and most should be jealous with how easily he pulls it off. The editing is high class. With only a few issues here or there. It is incredible to think in a 195-minute movie that there are not huge chunks that you could remove, but somehow the editing has kept this behemoth of a film moving along at a steady pace.
W: The dialogue is quite good, but one cannot help but feel that there is a touch of the Hollywood pen in the script, and it is Zaillian writing, so that goes without saying. Other than the faux tension ratching, it is very decent.
C: Arguably Kaminski's best film, though the argument against that is Saving Private Ryan. So you can decide for yourself. That said, other than a few stutters with the camera. Like in the shot where they are bringing the lens down from the bridge to the boat. The film is shot perfectly for how you want this story to be portrayed, and that is what cinematography is supposed to do, it is supposed to accentuate the story. And the girl in red scene shall remain one of my favourites of all time. The shower scene aside, the visual effects excellent.
A: Liam Neeson's best role, before he showed the world that much like Harrison Ford, he plays the same character in almost every film. Thankfully at this point, he is still fresh. Ralph Fiennes built a career from this role, and he would remain a constant in parts in need of snivelling yet powerful monsters for years after, but no character has matched his performance in Schindler's List and rightly so it is a convincing portrayal of a man lost in his convictions yet still has a shred of the humanity that existed in him before the war. Kingsley is excellent with a subdued performance, which is usually the best Kingsley, Sexy Beast aside. It gives Neeson's performance something to bounce off and allow for a better emotional understanding of the character.
S: The sound is excellent, and the score is terrific. So much so it does make me ponder whether Spielberg's film would be the same without it? Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.
PD: Is excellent save for the few touches in the concentration camps and only the most anal filmgoers are going to pick up on that.
BA: Authentic and eye-catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes and the black-white filming does prevent it from being a little higher as it could be hiding a plethora of errors, but as is seen, it is well done.
EVO: This is not a relaxing Tuesday flick, but it is a flick anyone with a love of films or humanity should see. I have not seen many people who have disliked it, Rita Kempley aside. It is a tough watch for some, but it is rewarding in its own way.
Notes: This film is one of the ones that made me realise there needs to be a standard with critics they do not need to follow mine, but they need to explain what they are ranking. The reality is their review is 90% EVO and with no thought put in. Take Rita Kempley who wrote for The Washington Post. She gave Schindler's List a 60, Pulp Fiction a 70, Supergirl the 1984 movie was given an 80, Mary Reilly was a 70, Splash a 100, so Splash is a perfect movie whereas Schindler's List is barely passable under what metric? She also ranks the Wedding Singer at 70 and Das Boot as a 60. All I learned from her reviews is that she likes crappy romantic comedies and does not appreciate long drawn out films, and if she was some person on IMDB filling out a review that would be fine. But when you are the film critic for supposedly one of the best newspapers in the USA. It looks foolish, with no sense of purpose. When you are ranking Summer School (1987) as an arguably better film than Schindler's List than maybe you should not be a film critic. Which raises the question of what are film critics judging? And do they even understand cinema?"

"k-08062","9","0","1","30 March 2020"," Why do we shed tears?
","Why do we shed tears? A person we have never heard of is very far away from us to die, will you shed tears, CCTV News often reported that the death of leaders I am mostly senseless, not I am not patriotic, after all do not know. People are sentimental animals don't know how to talk about sadness, so to make the audience cry for the character you must let the audience have a deep impression on the character. Schindler's List has more than 120 characters, although the audience may not remember all, but remember 20 to 30 is still not a problem, to give a few supporting examples: female servant Helen; the Jewish female engineer; the little girl wearing glasses and her mother; clever little boy; one-armed grandfather; little girl in red and so on each makes the audience impressed like an acquaintance, then when they are in danger killed the audience will be absolutely sad.<br/><br/>
The first person the nazis killed in the film was his one-armed grandfather, and spielberg's death of the one-armed old man who would not ""kill innocent people"" opened the prologue of the holocaust. Let's look at how the choreographer creates a simple and foolish image of the old man with one arm, and let the audience have feelings or even tears for it. It was Spielberg's first show of his cruelty in this film. What kind of character is most touching? Is it the kind of person who's almost perfect without flaws? Not necessarily, sometimes the existence of small shortcomings but strengthen the role of our domestic film is different, we must distinguish between good and evil bad people must be bad to the bone, good people must be tall and powerful, this is not interesting, now the main theme of the main theme of the anti-Japanese drama are so positive not convinced. The jews in this film are honest and honest, ignorant and servile, but they are sympathetic, such as the one-armed old man, who feels very real because he is approachable.<br/><br/>
The hero Schindler was eating, and the secretary told him that someone wanted to see him as a token of gratitude. Schindler was already very unhappy to see the other person was disabled, but had not yet appeared in the face, the one-armed old man was very uninteresting verbose, talking and halting, so finally Schindler sat in his chair to twist his face to the side of the old man, the atmosphere is very funny and awkward. Although Schindler did not say a dissatisfied line but composition and performance betrayed his heart, the composition of this scene is very wonderful subtext is expressed through composition, because the film is black and white film lost color contrast emphasis, so the composition and lighting requirements are higher.<br/><br/>
After the old man left the camera to Schindler again, it was a quiet scene is very awkward atmosphere, Schindler's dissatisfaction jumped on the screen. Schindler felt that such a disabled person should not enter his own factory, and his angry face was black and blue and he did not even want to talk to his secretary. This is a further addition to the old and Schindler's image more plump for the next turning point. It was precisely because of this meeting that the audience and Schindler remembered the simple and honest old man, and both felt sorry for his death. It was the death of the Jews who let Schindler love and hate that inspired the conscience and made him determined to save these ""lowly"" Jews. Besides, the choreographer took a lot of effort to shape"

","This is a story about World War II. Schindler, a German Nazi businessman, used World War II for his own gain. At first, in order to obtain more profits, a large number of Jewish laborers were employed to create wealth for themselves. Then, as the war progressed, the Nazi massacre of Jews aroused his inner conscience. He spent all his money to protect the lives of 1.1 thousand Jews on his own.I think the whole idea of the work, the idea that Spielberg is trying to convey to us, is condensed in this sentence. Schindler saved thousands of Jews and kept them alive. For us, he not only saved these people, but also saved the light in our hearts, just as he kept a little faint light in the dark war era."

","In the end, Schindler took off his brooch, crying bitterly and saying that he could still save another person, and I was crying to a deafness.

The classics are so touching."

","Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death."

"krational66","8","0","1","22 March 2020"," The weight of life! To save one person is to save the world!
","There was so much in this three-hour movie that really stuck in my head, in my bones.<br/><br/>We've all seen a lot of movies about world war ii, but if we had to pick the most memorable, schindler's list would be on the list. This is a magnificent movie, in this movie, I can strongly feel the weight of life! To save one person is to save the world!<br/><br/>In the whole film, the most striking thing for me is not the tragic scene of burning bodies, nor the panic and despair in the gas chamber, but a relatively ordinary morning. This morning, a group of poor jews were working like cattle and horses on the electricity grid in a German district. And the governor of the precinct, goff?<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was standing bare-chested on the balcony outside his bedroom, hunched over the jews he commanded. In the bedroom behind him, his girl was fast asleep. After stretching his muscles, goff strolled back to the house and picked up a sniper rifle, aimed it at the slightly slower jews in the distance, and killed them all. He cocked his head, a cigarette in his mouth, and his expression was calm.<br/><br/>Each shot disturbed goff's sleep. She tried all she could to keep her ears out of the noise, but it failed, and she was miserable -- miserable because the noise disturbed her sleep. It was not an emergency, but part of their daily lives. The killing no longer had any excitement in their minds, and this unusual event was considered the norm. This, I feel, is a hundred times more evil than the killing itself.<br/><br/>Where there is war, there are heroes. Life in the camp was as cheap as cattle, trampled on at will. The plight of the jews is deplorable, and the bitter cost of the war unbearable. Human nature is confused in the war. As schindler said, war always highlights the ugly side of human nature. We also see the Nazi soldiers' disregard for life and wanton killing of innocent polish jews.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we also see that the merciless nature of the war brings out the best in schindler. He was the representative of the cold - blooded capitalist who made a huge amount of money in the war with his clever brain and cheap labor. But he was a man of conscience, who saved the jews again and again and brought them to his refuge.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, when I received the gold ring of surviving jews sent to him, on the Hebrew: save a person, is to save a world, the collapse of Mr Schindler mood, since always thought I have done good justice success also lost to weak and frustration, he said, pointing to their own cars, said it can and Goethe officers in 10 people, pointing to his own brooch, said that in 2 people, even more.<br/><br/>He was in tears, complaining that he had not worked hard enough to make more money, and that he had been able to save just over 1,100 jews. That scene really moved me. Before losing his fortune and going on the road to exile, Mr. Schindler finally fully showed his greatness and, I am sure, his great love for all innocent human beings.<br/><br/>At that moment, I really want to cry. The truly great are never proud of their merits, but still review their shortcomings as a sin. In fact, Mr. Schindler was, as the ring aptly said, the brightest light of the darkest days. Each name on schindler's list is the weight of life!"
"krational66","8","0","1","22 March 2020"," A list of the best
","At first, I learned about the movie from the director's teacher, and at that time, I thought it was called 'Hitler' list. Strong curiosity drove me to download the movie. I was originally not interested in such overly profound films, but I couldn't help but watch the director spielberg's great fame. It has to be said that such art-house films about human nature in the context of war abroad, although they often take nearly three hours, are not boring at all.
The film's black-and-white images give a sense of historical vicissitudes, creating a documentary-like atmosphere. The main theme of the film is peace and redemption, which clearly shows the transformation of a German arms dealer named schindler from his greed for personal gain at the beginning to his sincere desire to save every Jew persecuted by the German nazis.
The war has brought death and fear to every corner of the world. Those ruling parties are willing to wage war in order to safeguard their own interests, totally regardless of the lives of the people. War distorts human nature, but it also shows the good side of human nature. Under Hitler's leadership, the nazis developed a hubristic sense of racial superiority in which they saw the jews as animals with no human rights.
They raised their butcher's knife to kill innocent jewish people, they used a ruthless face to the fascist brutality of take in everything in a glance, I can't forget those who hid in the floor to avoid the nazis came for the wardrobe and under the bed, trembling of women and children forget German soldiers in found that after surviving jews rushing a leave their guns, a gentleman's officers sitting in the elegant piano of fiddling with the keys of the jews, like Mozart's music is accompanied by the way, like punctured beans gunfire as dance music is a god of death. The director satirizes the Nazi's cruelty and perversion in a seemingly absurd way.
When schindler and his wife rode up the hill and witnessed the beastly behavior of the German soldiers who were massacring innocent jews in the city, and when he saw the little girl in red running in a panic in the chaos of the crowd, he was enlightened by his inner goodness. He understood that, in this troubled world, even if earn more money can not buy the living human life, no human nature, even if there is no amount of wealth is just a walking corpse. There are plenty of details about schindler's transformation, such as the way he began to use his connections to get a lifeline for the jewish workers at the factory, and the way he treated the jewish women at his birthday party with full respect by passionately kissing them regardless of the eyes of others. The contrast with schindler is that of the Nazi lieutenant, whose air of militarism and fascism cannot be concealed. Even though he is elegant in front of outsiders, his loneliness is revealed when he meets Helen, a jewish woman. He didn't kill Helen. Maybe he needed someone to comfort him. He may not really like Helen, just want to have someone to express his feelings, but his inner racism is already in his
There is a deep and indelible imprint on the soul. When schindler exhorted him to try to forgive others, I seemed to see a silver lining in him, and he seemed to shake a little at that moment in his own soul about what he believed in. When he caresses Helen in the basement as a maid, he is infatuated with her beauty, but can not express his love for her, because he is a German Nazi officer, his identity and beliefs make him helpless. His inner contradictions make him irate, fascist thoughts take over his soul again, he madly beats poor Helen, and the director USES a parallel montage to contrast schindler's kindness to jews at the party with his perversion. This is perhaps the director of war warped human another way of saying.
When wrapping film, schindler met German soldiers dug up the bodies of those in the concentration camps were slaughtered, the audience was surprised that the figure of a wearing a red dress sitting in a pile of dead bodies for cremation, the little girl's body already decay, schindler did not think of a child can't escape from fate, due to the particularity of color film, director of the little girl's figure used alone and local color, which have a certain impact on the vision. In the black and white of the body, the red is very dazzling, in this dark age, the child is buried by the ruthless killing, hope is destroyed in an instant.
Schindler understood the meaning of the list and what he was supposed to do. He didn't want to eat or sleep, he just wanted to save one more person. This reminds us of the businessman schindler at the beginning of the film, who only wanted to make money from the war but didn't care about the lives of the jewish people. It turns out that a person can change, and the jews let schindler complete a self-redemption. Let him understand save a life, is to save the truth of the world.
The film can be described as a memoir by spielberg himself, who is a Jew. He deeply criticizes the distortion of human nature caused by the war, and at the same time praises the humanity that has not been lost in the war.

","In 1993, audiences around the world received two of director Steven Spielberg's most influential and critically acclaimed films. One, an enthralling dinosaur adventure with ground-breaking visual effects that captured the imagination of an entire generation; the other, a harrowing recreation of true-life events centring around the most vile and evil moments in human history and the true heroes that rose from the ashes of destruction and genocide.<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is a meticulously constructed, horrifying and disturbing film that, if you are human, will definitely make you cry at least twice during its mammoth 3 hour 15 minute run time!<br/><br/>The decision to film the majority of the picture in black and white was an ingenious move; it adds a stark and bleak reality to the events of the film, the lack of colours and soul-crushing score reinforces the powerful message that is being told.<br/><br/>The most outstanding technical features of ""Schindler's List"" all won an Academy Award, giving the film a total of seven Oscars. From the film itself (Best Picture), to the direction (Best Director), the script, the sets, cinematography, editing and music; all of the talented people behind this masterpiece deserved the recognition and respect that they received.<br/><br/>The talented cast all deliver some of the best and most moving performances of their careers.
The ever brilliant Liam Neeson plays every element of his complex and multi-layered character perfectly. Sir Ben Kingsley brings a warmth and likeability to an otherwise stone-cold story; the usually charming Ralph Fiennes plays quite possibly one of the most disgusting and malicious characters in modern cinema.<br/><br/>This film sticks out like a velociraptor in a kitchen when compared to Spielberg's earlier projects. His most popular works were entertaining adventures which occasionally played with dark themes. ""Jaws"", the ""Indiana Jones"" Trilogy and ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" had cemented Spielberg as a master of thrills (Indy), chills (""Jaws"") and spills (the emotional ""E.T."" scenes.) However, ""The Colour Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" presented a director that could also craft excellent historical films, thus leading to ""Schindler's List.""<br/><br/>The new-found maturity in his career is one of the many reasons why Spielberg is my favourite director. Whilst I personally prefer his more accessible romps such as ""Duel"", ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" over his gritty dramas, I admire a filmmaker who has the range and talent to create such vastly different works. The fact that the man who directed ""Hook"" also made ""Saving Private Ryan"" is astounding; in which other director's filmography can you find such a stylistic divide?!<br/><br/>""Schindler's List"" is about a nation turning a blind eye to the horrors that were being inflicted upon good, ordinary people. It is a movie that is still relevant today (which makes all the more tragic), which is why ""Schindler's List"" must be seen and talked about to prevent anything on the level of the Holocaust ever happening again!
I saw this film three years ago yet every traumatic scene still feels raw in my mind. I never EVER want to see ""Schindler's List"" again, not because it's bad, but because it is so unsettling and disheartening.<br/><br/>""No one can do anything to fix the past - that's already happened, but a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must never happen again.""

It tells the story of the holocaust and one man's efforts to help the victims of a terrible atrocity. It is a story about the darkest of humanity and the ugliness of humankind, but it is also an uplifting story about the lengths people will go to to help each other and the power of one man.

There is a real photographic record of some of the people and places depicted in ""Schindler's List,"" and it has a haunting history. Raimund Titsch, an Austrian Catholic who managed a uniform factory within the Plaszow labor camp in Poland, surreptitiously took pictures of what he saw. Fearful of having the pictures developed, he hid his film in a steel box, which he buried in a park outside Vienna and then did not disturb for nearly 20 years. Although it was sold secretly by Titsch when he was terminally ill, the film remained undeveloped until after his death."

The story is convincing and well put together. It isn't overly dramatic and over-the-top, but there is a certain level of gravitas. The performances were stellar. Personally it was hard to choose the best performance, but I think that Ralph Fiennes gave the best performance as Amon Goeth. He felt very human and had a character. He wasn't a good man at all, but he wasn't just a bad guy. He was an antagonist with feelings. He wasn't just a Nazi that killed people because he felt emotions that I could see in this amazing performance. Definetly watch."

But still, praise I will for when you see something as beautiful as this, the urge to scream and acknowledge, is great.<br/><br/>From apathy to empathy in the most dystopic of times(The Second World War) ; a tale of survival when death is everyday's bread and butter ; 1100 priceless lives when bodies are lost without a tear ; the manifestation of life's beauty amidst cold and bloody tyranny ; enactment of the most humane of gestures in the most inhumane circumstances.<br/><br/>""What makes good art"", you ask?
Finding light in the deepest caverns of darkness, finding hope when hopelessness seems eternal and above all, finding yourself when everything else falls apart. Schindler's List is a tale of discovery, of transformation and above all, of that great victory of Good over evil. It gives you hope, it gives you strength and it gives you humanity.<br/><br/>""To turn the most dismal setting that history ever provided, into something bold, brilliant and beautiful. THAT is good art!"""

It's painful because it's real, show us how low our society can be and proves us that all monstrosity is possible, not because we actively do it to be so, but when we do nothing to stop it.

""Kapos"" are parole prisoners cooperating with the SS to run the camps. Also in one seen there were kids hiding in the cesspool to escape from being shipped out by the SS. The fumes in the cesspool are atrocious & the kids would die, so in real life hopefully of this sort of thing never happened & it shouldn't be part of the movie."

There is list of all children and somone need to use the oportunity (they are very old now) to make a story with survivors.

"adamoctranspo","10","0","4","4 May 2019"," The only war movie needed
","In 2019 this film is more relevant and needed than in 1993. Steven Spielberg puts on an amazing display of history that is often ignored or forgotten. When this film came out only 40% of Americans knew the history of the Holocaust. Spielberg chose a perfect period in time to create an everlasting story. The Pianist is impressive as well but Schindler's List manages to tell alot of overlapping stories. This gives us all a clearer view of what happened. Each character has a small story and you are invested in. Spielberg also manages to insert comedy to horrible situation. There are some weird scenes like when the gun won't fire multiple times, sparing a man's life. The cinematography and use of color is impressive. Since the film is in greyscale it feels historical, the violence is more digestible. When Spielberg brings in his one spot of color (the girl in red jacket), you can't help but realize the way it was filmed was all a choice. The color jumps at you and your eyes can't help but follow. The violence and gore is hard to watch at times, this film has endless senseless deaths and humiliations as well. The actors are amazing, Liam Neeson blew up after his performance as Oskar Schindler. His final speach shows true emotion and care. The ending of the film cements the reality of the story. All the actors join their real-life figures and place a stone at Oskar Schindler's grave. Schindler's List belongs on the AFI top 100. It may be Spielberg's best film."

"jacobhunt6","8","0","4","26 April 2019"," Spielberg proves he has more than one trick up his sleeve
","Schindler's List is a unique work in the catalogue of Steven Spielberg that shows his flair and eye for the visual and artistic, while he may have been more renowned for his large-scale blockbuster story-telling. It is a profound and impactful true story that is captured with raw emotion and striking visual appeal.
Spielberg masterfully utilises the tools of his medium, and even the medium itself as a symbol, creating a graphic and atmospheric piece that is harrowing in the calm moments and horrifying to watch when it escalates. The gravity of the source material is certainly not lost on Spielberg, and the sincerity with which it is handled only adds to its power, as the power of the tragically true events are felt through this film.
Liam Neeson does a superb job, but credit should also be given to the supporting cast. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley had particularly difficult roles to handle and did so with the mastery that we would expect of them. Further down the list, Embeth Davidtz was another particular standout.
Spielberg's use of black and white film is as impactful as it is famous, particularly when it comes to the rare use of colour as motif. While the colours in the candle flames and the young Jewish girl's coat are particularly muted, they are a stark contrast to the world around them, and powerful moments in film.
However, to go against the grain of history and provide one tiny grain of criticism, I felt that Spielberg was far too committed to visually depicting the crimes of Nazi Germany in a powerful and harrowing manner, and there are times during this film's lengthy runtime that the story itself is lost to the ""documentary depiction"" of World War II. It felt at times that certain scenes were added purely for dramatic effect on the audience, and not for any real practical use to the story.
That being said, Schindler's List is amongst the most harrowing and powerful war films of all time, and its emotional impact is certainly lasting. It is a testament to Spielberg's mastery and love of his artform and his metacinematic style, which contrasts his earlier works of the likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws."

This is an example of how a society who has been influenced by an individual who exploits their resentment of their treatment following the first world war. He was able to turn the German society's resentment into criminal action of revenge to a people who were looking for answers to better their society. We should take from this film that history can repeat itself if we are not careful in controlling our inner demons when in situations the society is looking to rebuild.

","This is a GOOD film but it's * not * the GREAT people like to think.<br/><br/>First, it's over long. It could easily have been cut by an hour and been improved for it. The colour ending, in particular, should not have been included. Particularly, as it gives credence to the lie many wrongly believe this story is all historical fact when it's absolutely not.<br/><br/>Second, it's very schmaltzy with cookie cutter characters, either all saints or sinners, cartoon Nazi villains, where the only people who seem to suffer from the war are the Jews. This film could have been utterly brilliant if it had been more honest and looked at the complexities and contradictions of Schindler and Goeth's characters and even within the Jews themselves. Schindler's change of heart is never adequately explored.<br/><br/>Third, it being shot in black and white doesn't work well. Though some of the masses may be impressed and think it's arty, it misses the style and lighting of Film Noir. It likes to think of itself as German Expressionist and Italian Neorealist but that it is not. The colorisation of the little girl in the red coat and the candles etc is heavy handed and a patronising distraction that doesn't achieve what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>There's some solid performances particularly by Fiennes but this is one that could have been great but missed it's chance."

","Just watched Schindler's List.

The credits at the end of the film lists the facts at the end.<br/><br/>It is utterly horrific in its contents, yet it is a story that must be retold lest anyone forget.<br/><br/>Not having watched it for many years, the tears and full sobs flooded as I saw the panicked, lost little girl in her red coat, and the atrocities, like the piles of shoes, clothes, personal effects and dead bodies growing.<br/><br/>It's difficult to even begin to try and comprehend what the feeling must have been like during this tragic era, yet the film manages to depict this with a stark clarity and, somehow, a sense of dignity.<br/><br/>The credits show that Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 lives. He was a remarkable man, awarded the the title of a Righteous person on 1958, and this is a truly remarkable film.<br/><br/>In my view, not only is Schindler's List a stand out Oscar winning film, brilliantly acted by its entire cast, especially Liam Neeson as Schindler himself, it's one of the best, most important and meaningful films ever to have been made."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","3","27 January 2019"," The mother of all Holocaust movies
","""Schindler's List"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1993 that won Best Picture that year and took home another six Oscars including one for director Steven Spielberg, for whom it is probably still his career-defining work and with everything that he has under his belt like Jaws, Indiana Jones and much more, this means quite something. This film we have here runs for over 3 hours and I was lucky enough today to catch it on the big theater screen on the occasion of a very special day here in Germany. And what can I say. It was a feast. If that is an appropriate term given the heavy subject. I already wrote in the title of my review that this is of course a movie about the Holocaust. And it does not even try to hide the horrible deeds done by the perpetrators back then. Which means you have several occasions where you see people being shot in the head from the nearest distance and killed in cold blood for what their religion is. But it is also an uplifting movie as the man in the middle of it is Oskar Schindler, a manufacturer who saved more than a thousand Jewish lives during these perhaps darkest days in German (global) history. He is played by Liam Neeson and this is also his career-defining performance today without a doubt. Ralph Fiennes was around the age of 30 when he played the main antagonist here, Amon GÃ¶th, and Ben Kingsley, already an Oscar winner back then, is also on board and he looks so different compared to how he looks today, almost older you could say. By the way I did not know this film was based on a book in fact. It's really been a long long time since first time I saw it. But it is as good 25 years after its release as it was back then when I watched it for the first time. I must say I was not too touched throughout the movie as I hoped I could be and as I know many others were, but the last 20 minutes or so are heart-breaking stuff. I am talking about the moment when Schindler starts talking to his ""employees"", the guards I mean with that, as well as the Jews when he says he will be the hunted from now on. And then there is this powerful march with the haunting music at the very end before the film switches into the now, well into the early 1990s you must say, and we see the survivors, the Schindler Jews, and their offspring too and this idea of how Schindler did not only save these men, but saved entire generations and future children is so incredibly touching that there is no way your eyes won't get wet. I think my entire cinema could have finished drought in Africa when the closing credits rolled in. And lets not forget John Williams' beautiful beautiful soundtrack / main theme that is among the saddest tunes you will ever hear during a film and I know now already it is one that will never leave my head and ears. It was probably before watching this film the one thing that I have come across many times over the last years/decade and which I remembered better than anything else from this film.<br/><br/>I was also glad to see parents with their children in the audience today, kids that were not even close to being born in 1993, so the film's message is carried on to the next generation. Well, what can I say. The Holocaust subject here in Germany is one that is very dominant today also in modern culture and there are constantly new exhibitions about this topic and also many new films still being made. And not just in Germany obviously. But I am pretty sure that none of these will ever reach the icon status of Schindler's List. Other really touching moments for me included the moment Kingsley calls the list something like ""ultimate goodness"", when we see earlier on the shoes and jewellery taken from Jews before their journey into destruction, the dead girl in the red dress etc. The latter is one you could talk about for ages and write an entire review about in my opinion. What is her significance? Well.. I would say this only use of color before the jump forward in time near the end is intended to emphasize that there is an individual human being behind every face and even if they don't stand out thanks to shining garments, we still should not forget that. Be it the one-armed men, the woman who knew so much about construction or everybody resting down there below GÃ¶th's balcony. They all have their stories and their loved ones and they all should not have died. It is very difficult in the presence of these sheer numbers of Jews being killed back then, but we shall not forget every one of them deserved to live. And every one of them has their own story. If we lose our empathy and become numb to what happened, then all is lost. And it is merely numbers that mean nothing to us. Okay, I mentioned GÃ¶th already. Fiennes was nominated for an Oscar for that portrayal and many today say he should have won instead of Tommy Lee Jones, but not having seen the latter's movie, I will not discuss that in detail. But I think it is a surprising loss, even with TLJ having the momentum given how much they loved Schindler's List. Like with the scene I mentioned some lines above, I also think that GÃ¶th could have deserved his own review. It is so difficult to say what this character is and what he is not. There is no 100% description, it is all about the shades. Very fitting the house keeper's description that you never knew what would happen next with him and how you could calm him down. Is he an opportunist? A sadist? A psychopath? A racist? Probably yes to all that, but then there are these moments when deep down inside him he has affections for the Jewish housekeeper before reality bites and he starts attacking her violently. The scene when he tells Schindler that he wants to take her with him is telling enough, only to say he should shoot her in the head in the nearest forest. Maybe this is the closest he can get to love? Tough to say. The relationship between GÃ¶th and Schindler is also interesting. I do think he looks up to Schindler for his success with women, his whole aura, his talent to entertain and he wants to be like him instead of being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Not many would have gotten away with the hose scene really, but Schindler does with the high-profile Nazis trying desperately to convince themselves that he is just torturing the Jews in the wagons. Of course he is not and they know. But they do not have the will and charisma to oppose him. The very first scene at the table when Schindler invites the Nazis over is already very telling, who is the man in charge. But he needs them too. Without being an NSDAP member, there is no chance for him to thrive and save a single life.<br/><br/>And finally, lets look at the character transformations. Some brief words on GÃ¶th first who believes he is some high-appointed ruler about who lives and who dies thanks to Schindler's influence. There is no real goodness in the former. It is all make-believe and when he realizes he shoots the boy in cold blood. But about Schindler, there is a lot more to say, also when it comes to his wife and of course his heartfelt final speech about how he could have saved more. At some point, it was never about prestige, about reputation or about business anymore. Let alone about money. He gives it all away for his fake factory. This is when he turns into the good human being, which also has a lot to do with Stern's influence for sure. So yeah, this is a really long movie, but oh so rewarding and also for me a definite contender for best film of 1993. Don't give up on it if greatness is not achieved on all occasions early on. What is waiting for you is absolutely worth it. Of course, due to the cruel imagery, this is not a film for the very young ones, but even if it is extremely serious and will break your heart on more than one occasion, there are also really many moments, surprisingly more than I expected where this film will make you smile. These include basically all Schindler's exchanges and interactions with women, be it the ones sitting on his desk typing or the ones who want to see him or all the other ones attracted to him and the other way around. Or one other scene that stays in the mind very much for me is when he is looking for Stern at the train station and how these resilient Nazi guards help him quickly after being worried about their own future and having fear of being sent to Russia. So yeah, there is probably at least a dozen scenes more that stay in the mind and that I could write a whole chapter about and you will recognize these scenes when you watch them or maybe you will think of completely different scenes than the ones I mean, but that is perfectly fine though. I will spare you all that. But I will not spare you the words that this is an absolute must-see from the historic and emotional perspective and unless you really really hate Holocaust movies for whatever reason, you should watch this one. Actually, even if you do, you should watch it because this is the one film that can change your mind. Go for it if you really haven't seen it so far and with that I am of course speaking in particular to the younger readers. There's a reason this is so high on the imdb top250. And rightfully so. If you are lucky enough like myself to get into a big screen showing, then do not miss out under any circumstances. A gigantic thumbs-up from me for Schindler's List."

"vikisepyan","9","0","1","27 October 2018"," great cinematography!
","Take aside all controversies, I would like to review the cinematography aspect that was brought by this Schindler's List movie.<br/><br/>First thing first, as you know that Kaminski did other great jobs as well on such a lot great movies (The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, Ready Player One, etc). But those experience he had might start from this one documentary-like movie.<br/><br/>I do really like all unsteady shots this movie has. Those bring war-time atmosphere well. I could feel the fast movements, the soldiers rush, people frightened, and so on. Take an example from the shoot from behind the neck of Mr. Schindler at the beginning when he tried to explore the whole room. Or the shoot from the Mr. Amon's point of view when his first time come to Krakow. Those are great!<br/><br/>I want to point out the scene while Mr. Schindler chose his secretary for the DEF too. Kaminski tried to show how the time goes by shooting the exact same set but the actors changing positions.<br/><br/>And the greatest of them all is how Spielberg managed with idea to send a girl in red coat to give the audience some red line of the story. We could see at the middle of the movie this girl went back an forth amidst chaotic operation by Germany soldier. After that, we see her back when the situation a little bit under control while she was walking calmly and holding hand with her parents. Then later we see the scene while she was dead and about to be burned. And after that, Mr. Schindler's was motivated to save as many jews as he could put on his saving list.<br/><br/>Last but not at least, some music during the chaotic operation, from the slow violin, then silent, then fast piano played by the soldier on the set. Accompanied by some firing light that fit to the beat of the music tempo. Brilliant in short.<br/><br/>That's all. I could just give 10 stars for the movie. But I gave out one star for the controversies."

"KidWithOpinions","10","0","3","10 August 2018"," A cinematic masterpiece. Spielberg's best film.
","Schindler's List is a cinematic masterpiece and Steven Spielberg's best film. This is a perfect movie, so I am giving it an A+, for its amazing story, flawless performances, cinematography, and its great score.
This movie is the best 90s Best Picture by a lot. Now the 90s was the worst year for Best Picture choices, think about all the movies that should have won the award. Saving Private Ryan ( Spielberg's second best film) should have beaten Shakespeare in Love, L.A. Confidential should have beat Titanic, really anything could have beaten Titanic. Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Quiz Show should have beaten Forrest Gump, and finally, the one the pissed me off the most was how Goodfellas should have beaten Dances with Wolves, one of the worst movies ever made. But I do agree with American Beauty, Unforgiven, The Silence of the Lambs, and this movie winning Best Picture. 
I would like to talk about the acting Schindler's List because let me tell you, it was flawless, it hurts me to know that Tommy Lee Jones beat Ralph Fiennes in the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Now Tommy Lee Jones did a great job, but comparing the type of role that Jones and Fiennes did, Fiennes did a better job acting. I think that Ralph did the best job acting in Schindler's List. Now I can see why Liam Neeson did not win Best Actor because he was up against Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, also Neeson did a good job in the role but he could have done better. Ben Kingsley delivers another amazing performance as Itzhak Stern, he is Oskar's assistant, he almost dies about three times, I was sad that Kingsley did not get a nomination because again he gives the audience an amazing performance. 
What I found interesting about Schindler's List was that Spielberg had originally pitched the idea to Martin Scorsese and Roman Polanski because how tough the subject was. Spielberg did not think that he was up to make a movie about the Holocaust. But to be honest I think that only Spielberg could have made Schindler's List and that is saying something because I am a big Scorsese fan. The way Schindler's List was made is flawless, it is a mostly black and white film, but the way Allan Starski and Ewa Braun ( the art directors) incorporated the use of color and black and white is excellent.
Schindler's List is a long movie, so if you plan on watching it you should take three hours out of your day. It starts out with a Jewish family singing a song before dinner, they light a candle and you see the flame but everything else then turns black and white. You then watch Oskar ( Schindler) get ready for a party hosted by the Nazi party, and that is where you find out who Oskar is. The next twenty minutes is watching Oskar make connections with Nazis' and jews'. Fast forward 20ish minutes, and you get to watch the liquidation of the ghettos, now this scene is pretty intense and it is the most violent scene in the movie. Schindler's List is an essential movie to watch, and you will probably watch it in school. I will say that you can probably show this movie to your kids when they are going into freshman year of high school, because watching movies for the first time in school gives the movie a certain reputation, and people end up not liking it. Now that does not go for all movies, but most.
If you plan on showing Schindler's List to your kids, just remember to wait until they are going into high school, that they know about the Holocaust, and that they can sit through it respectively. Keep in mind that Schindler's List is still rated R for a reason, the big reason it is rated R is that of the ongoing violence and intense scenes. But there is still sexuality and nudity spread out through the movie. The nudity in Schindler's List is both sexual at some points but also non-sexual, in fact, most of the nudity is nonsexual. Just keep that in mind before showing this to your kids. Also if you don't like your kids hear vulgar language, there are twelve F word uses in the movie along with other bad words.
Schindler's List reminds me of Roman Polanski's 2002 holocaust drama The Pianist because it tells a story about the struggle for survival during the Holocaust. But that is the only movie it reminds me of. Now when I told people that, they were surprised that I did not think it was like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, and it does not, the only thing Schindler's List and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas have in common is that they are both about the Holocaust, and to be completely honest I really did not like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.
To end the review, I would like to say that I think Schindler's List is a cinematic masterpiece and the best 90s Best Picture, and how it is one of the best movies ever made. My final grade for Schindler's List is an A+, for its amazing story, flawless performances, cinematography, and its great score."
"amitjodha99","10","0","4","5 August 2018"," Not perfect, but then it's not a documentary.
","The movie looks honest, whether it is or not is not for me to decide. 6,000,000 deaths and 1200 lives provide a decent contrast and real situation, though the movie may not satisfy people belonging to believes involved in the movie. <br/><br/>It is clear that it's a story of a small island lost somewhere in a gigantic ocean, the characters shown in the film are those who live and hence it doesn't really hit that hard emotionally, but in the climax where Schindler realizes the value of human life really hits that chord rather strongly. <br/><br/>Things are modified to suit the flow of the story but the overall conclusion is not far from the reality, this is somewhere in the realm of fantasy fabricated into a real story.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a must watch for someone who would like to get an idea about the hardships the life can throw at us and the level where a human can go either in absolute presence or absence of power. <br/><br/>Also, I would like to appreciate that in spite of involving sentiments of different parts of society, this movie has hold it's position so high on IMDb, if this would be a tad shorter and a little less cliche, this would have been above The Godfather."

","Time changes, names change, roles change, but persecution does not change. This indulgence is indifferent as well as joining him at least. I did not see propaganda on this ta-bl because I was so frozen that the political dimension was very funny. Wars are a fact of human nature, wars have been and will continue to happen throughout history. But whatever happens, there are things that a person should never do, so there are movements in your eyes that you can see something human and immoral. Life is hard, life is unfair, but everyone is responsible for themselves, trying to live in some way, fighting comes out, sometimes killing to live, sometimes killing for politics. It 's a fact, though we do not want it to be. I never saw a Jewish soldier, a soldier killed a soldier, dead women, children, old people ... I saw neither Jew nor Gem, on this ta blade, only people who suffered, I saw people who felt numb and even zombie. I saw people out of humanity because of 3-5 crazy faces. It is not the identity of the table, it criticizes the oppressors, it explains the slightest effort to counter it. This table is ""what can I do?"" He tells you to ask yourself the question. When I look at this painting, no matter what the race, religion, language; In any age I see the wickedness and ineffectiveness of the cruelty. There is no Jews and Jews in this tab lord I look at; There is an affliction that the Israelis made to Palestine, the Americans made to the Indians, the serpent's banners made to the bosoms, the french folk song Afghan Vietnam's kÃ¼rdÃ¼ English Armenian Indians, not the Greek people. Every man is responsible for himself, every single human being. You do not know your national politics, there is power in your hands, everything can not be done, if you do it is not the criminal's race, says tabloid. This tabled tells one of the two human beings of the same race to be guilty of human crime, and this struggle of struggle with the other. Finally, I think it is very relevant: Whoever is an oppressor, an old oppressor has been given authority; Whoever is an oppressor, an old tyrant has been taken authority."

","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember"

","This was a very good movie. In fact, I would certainly include this somewhere on a Top 100 of all time list. <br/><br/>I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan and one thing I notice about his films is that he always seems to use very careful direction to pull some sort of involuntary emotion out of me, whether it be fear or sadness. For some reason Spielberg just missed the mark here. It is as if he believed that the horror of these people's circumstances would be dramatic enough and so there is no need to take it any further. While it was very horrific to watch, and pretty sad, it could have been done a little bit better. If I had to take a guess as to why Spielberg missed his mark, I would say that maybe too much focus was put on Schindler who had it VERY easy (relatively speaking) which gave me a break on my focus on the Jews plight.<br/><br/>While I definitely recommend Schindler's List, if you are interested in seeing a similar movie that is directed MUCH better I would recommend ""The Pianist."" The Pianist was able to get me more emotionally involved with the fear of the Jewish situation in WWII Europe than Schindler's List ever did."

However, it is the supporting cast which makes the film work. I would have rated it higher if the film could have stayed within my 2 hour bottom limit. Although a memorable film and a film which deals with such a politically charged subject, I feel that I was not so entertained as I was educated, even though it is a work of fiction.

Amazing in its historic scenes of violence and awkward love that seemed to be deemed inappropriate at this point in history, portrayed well. <br/><br/>Only problem for me was the setting the scene of the main story took far to long and by the middle you felt there should have been at least some plot development where there had been little. My second criticism was of Schindler to have him break down in tears at the end was completely against his character, yes you could see he had learnt to love the jews along the way but it was too much to have him break down, only to one shot later be completely fine, it just seemed odd. <br/><br/>A well portrayed story with too much extra context of the time put in to provoke audience feelings, the story itself would have been portrayed much better in half the time!

","Hello, I am a student in high school and I would like to comment on the movie, Schindler's List. In one scene when a man is done raping a child, you see him zippering up his pants. In the 4 and a half years of the holocaust's existence there was no such thing as a zipper on men's pants... there were only buttons. Other than that, the movie was perfect. The little girl's red coat was an amazing way to show symbolism and i think the movie was made beautifully. My favorite part of the way the movie was executed was when the Nazi's spoke German. At the most hectic and chaotic times in the movie (ex. the liquidation of the Jews in Krakow) the Nazi's spoke German! I think that was a perfect touch because I felt like I was one of the Jews, I felt as if I was a part of the frenzy!<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

","Is it to remind one of the holocaust, and if so, who among us need a reminder?  Why was this film made anyway?<br/><br/>(Possible spoilers below)<br/><br/>I made it to 40+ minutes of this b/w movie that reminded me of the likes of Casablanca.  The movie's lack of color didn't take me back to the era of pre-war Nazi occupation so much as it took me back to when movies didn't come in color.<br/><br/>Then there was opportunistic Schindler.  He never could succeed at anything before until this factory of his in occupied Poland.  When asked by his girlfriend why he had made it this time, (""luck?"") he said, ""No, war.""  Some entrepreneur.  The only way he could succeed was with virtual slave labor whom he didn't have to pay with real money.<br/><br/>Then there was this worker who had been asking to see him for days on end so he could thank him for being able to work in his factory and finally he was granted an audience by Schindler who was lavishly thanked and god blessed by the poor worker. What does Schindler do?  Focuses on the fact that the man had one arm.  He is overcome with the desire to know how this man got a job there and how he justifies his presence in his factory.  Obviously the man wasn't in it for the good he could do for the workers.  At least not then.  I was looking at a whole other tape after this one, and I wasn't too keen on sitting through all that to see if he ever develops a humanitarian streak. Then after reading some of the other reviews saying that the powerful aspect of the movie is the brutality with which the Poles were treated by the Nazis, I had to ask myself why watch this????<br/><br/>Do I need to remind myself of the holocaust?  Is that why I should watch this movie? The Jewish people say we need to always remember the holocaust so it won't be repeated.  Then what do they do?   They vote in large percentage for the liberal leftists in this country, and what do these people stand for?  They want to disarm the law abiding and give criminals as much free rein as society will stomach in order to manufacture a need for more of a police state and the erosion of our liberties.  They vote for those who believe in confiscation of our property when we work and when we die.  They vote for those who would lie down like Chamberlain and let us be overrun by our enemies. No, I don't need to be reminded of the holocaust.  I already know that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  It's the Jewish people themselves who seem to keep missing the lessons of their own history."

","There are many things I admire about this film. Spielberg is certainly one of the few Hollywood directors with European sensibilities; on some occasions during the film one is reminded of the works of black and white greats Ingmar Bergman (The Seventh Seal) and Andrzej Wajda (Ashes and Diamonds). However, I think that the problem with both of Spielberg's WWII movies is that the boy from Cincinnati never actually lived through the war (he was born a year after its completion) so while he may be able capture its goriness to last splattered fragment of human skull he never captures its horror. As it is, many of the supposedly dreadful sequences of Nazi brutality play more like smut than anything else. Also, the silly and rather racist Anglo-German, Anglo-Polish and Anglo-Russian accents were distracting and completely ruined the film's authenticity. Spielberg should have hired an international cast and used subtitles but, then again, he probably wouldn't have made as much money. Which brings me to this say that the only thing that prevents Spielberg from making ""The Great American Movie"" is that he is a crowd-pleasing blatant sentimentalist. Notice the simplistic ending that scores easy points for Schindler. Finally, it would have been courteous to the other 7 million non-Jewish victims who perished in the Concentration camps if Spielberg had at least acknowledged their existence."

I knew going in that the holocaust was one of the most horrific and disgusting chapters in the history of the world.  The movie only served to reinforce what I already knew.  None of the characters were developed.  We saw Jews suffering, but we didn't know them as characters.  Their plight seemed just as distant as reading about it in a history book.  The stories weren't personal.  The drama was just melodrama. The choice to colorize one extra that never speaks was ham handed at best. A real director could have brought focus to her without colorizing and taking the audience out of the movie.  The movie amounts to little more than just endless scene after endless scene of atrocities connected by the thinnest shred of actual plotline.  Did it change my attitude about anything?  No.  Did it reveal anything about the holocaust that I didn't already know?  No.  It's a lot of money to spend and a lot of awards to receive for a film whose ultimate message seems to be ""The holocaust was really bad.""  Well no kidding.  Even TV movies like ""Haven"" do a better job of making the holocaust real in an emotional way than ""Schindler's List."" In ""Haven"" you know the characters.  You laugh with them.

Maybe the real-life events are so fresh in our memories. There is no shortage of extant newsreel footage. We`ve all seen the real archive shots of the concentration camps and been moved to tears by them. SCHINDLER`S LIST, beautifully shot in glossy monochrome, is a million miles away from the coarse-grained newsreels. It looks like an expensive Hollywood movie, and that`s part of the problem. If Spielberg chose monochrome for its realism, why then did he resort to the trickery of pinpointing the girl in red? Either you want realism or not. Most people I have spoken to thought the treatment of the little girl in red was wonderful.But it annoyed me intensely for its manipulation of the audience. I also felt that some of the performances where not as they should be. Liam Neeson failed to convince, especially in his final breakdown scene.Ralph Fiennes just about got away with a one-dimensional ""nast nazi"". Only Ben Kingsley gave a totally believable and absorbing performance. If all the other performances had been of this high level we may have had a truer and therefore better movie. The only time I felt any real emotion was in the final section, when we saw the real survivors and relatives.Who needs glossy Hollywood biopics when reality is so available. The staged fictions of SCHINDLER`S LIST will always be insignificant when measured against the newsreels Can anyone ever make a convincing Holocaust movie? Probably not."

","While I admire much of what Spielberg accomplished with this film, I can't escape the feeling that the material would have been better served by a completely documentary-style approach. No matter how sensitively Spielberg displays the sequences of mass murder, accusations of voyeurism are unavoidable. Indeed, there have been isolated reports of neo-nazis openly admitting to repeatedly viewing parts of the film in order to revel in the violence so explicitly depicted.<br/><br/>On a personal note I, myself, found Claude Lanzmann's film ""Shoah"" to be incalculably more affecting than anything in ""Schindler's List."" It's the only film that I can think of which should be made compulsory viewing. The fact that it's nowhere to be seen on the IMDb top 250 is a complete travesty. Then again I shouldn't be too surprised; I doubt that many 9-hour subtitled documentaries get to reach Kansas City."
