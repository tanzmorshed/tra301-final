","Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, ""I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing"". That says it all <br/><br/>Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.<br/><br/>The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.<br/><br/>The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.<br/><br/>The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.<br/><br/>Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.<br/><br/>Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow"
"moviebuff_77","10","134","165","26 January 2006"," A must see for young India
","The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. <br/><br/>I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed."

","It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.<br/><br/>Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.<br/><br/>This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.<br/><br/>The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.<br/><br/>AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these ""leisure"" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. <br/><br/>What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.<br/><br/>I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference."

","If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.<br/><br/>Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.<br/><br/>The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year."

","Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.<br/><br/>The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.<br/><br/>The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.<br/><br/>The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace"

"kathuria_nidhi","10","78","106","30 January 2006"," Film Review- Rang De Basanti- India Awakens
","Film Review<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti<br/><br/>India Awakens<br/><br/>By Nidhi Kathuria<br/><br/>Rating *****<br/><br/>'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.<br/><br/>The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. <br/><br/>Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding"

","I have watched this movie today on the Republic Day of India, and I was really left speechless with the movie. It ranks among the very best movies. The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country."
"confused_eminem","9","85","119","27 January 2006"," Simply amazing performance by all, especially Aamir
","Aamir strikes back guys. Its the movie of the year. Simply amazing performances by all. Though i felt that the movie dragged just a little bit in the beginning, the second half was amazing. The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The performance of Soha Ali Khan was better than I had expected. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it."
"prakasharul","8","69","104","26 January 2006"," Screenplay, cinematography and Music - 10/10
","The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye opener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits."
"krish278","10","19","29","27 January 2006"," Mohe Tu Rang De Basanti....(Colour Me Yellow)
","Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.<br/><br/>But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br/><br/>One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. <br/><br/>The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).<br/><br/>Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. <br/><br/>When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.<br/><br/>Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. <br/><br/>The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.<br/><br/>Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:<br/><br/>1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.<br/><br/>However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. <br/><br/>One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens."
"wohlamhey_13","10","8","11","8 April 2007"," Authentic, astounding, amusing, astonishing, amazing, awesome.....
","Movies we view come and go, releasing from our minds; however, this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.<br/><br/>What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. <br/><br/>EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. <br/><br/>The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. <br/><br/>Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just ""wow"", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D."

","The tag line of the film says it all, A generation awakens. This is an attempt to awaken the generation X to the reality, to encourage them to make a difference without giving lengthy lectures and preaches on patriotism and nationalism. So, does the film succeed in doing so..?? Well to a large extent it does. The film manages to invoke the feeling for the nation without any heavy dose of loud hardcore patriotic dialogues. The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography, direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 10/10 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved."
"the_mantra_man","10","8","15","30 June 2006"," Rang De Basanti - Reality Does Bite! ***Sheer Brilliance***
","RDB is the rise of a new genre of films for today's youth that will be hailed as one of the all time classics. If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.<br/><br/>A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the pre-independence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word 'Go' in this over critical world is stunning.<br/><br/>I've watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding ""doing"" rather than ""gossipping"" and ""being a spectator or passenger in the so called 'system'"". We have all been there, we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.<br/><br/>A virtual tag line ""Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota, Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai"" is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals, at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India, myself included.<br/><br/>R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB, one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rub-in with the government regarding MIG's. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldn't be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIG's.<br/><br/>Aamir Khan as DJ (short for Diljeet) has essayed a role that is funny yet focused, comic yet concerned, silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombay-ite to transform into this ever so likable Dilli-ite with that awesome Punjabi ""oye pehen de takke.."" transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.<br/><br/>Siddharth as Karan Singhania & Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just ""Loathes India"" and becomes the voice of the 5 man ""Rebels with a cause"" is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.<br/><br/>Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman, not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.<br/><br/>Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.<br/><br/>Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJ's jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a ""fighting for a cause"" saga from a light one.<br/><br/>Now, the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next ""Angry, Sensitive and Sensible"" young man.<br/><br/>I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 10/10 for sure."

","The movie is one of the marvels of the Indian Theatre ,beautifully blending historical flashes with modern settings .All aspects of the movie including acting,music,cinematography are excellent and it is a must see for ones who are looking for an ""out of the box"" movie.<br/><br/>At the same time I would like to say that I personally am not in favor of the ending.I feel that is a very wrong message that the Indian youth is getting.The idea of trying to wake up the society with extreme measures is inappropriate.Killing people is never a solution for any malice that is ingrained in the population.The same idea during the independence revolution was totally different and i respect that totally being a strong patriot myself but the movie is a bad example for the young people who already have fire in their blood and cannot think rationally.The movies have a great impact especially on young people and many try to imitate them.If a system has to be changed it has to be done by intellectual stimulation and general awareness not killing ""the bad guy""!.We have to teach our youth the same thing. Having said that I would like to say that the director definitely has the right to project his thoughts but I differ about the message the movie gives and thought its worth sharing my ideas with everyone."

","this movie released 4 days back and from the second day till this evening i have watched the movie 3 times.'RANG DE BASANTI' doesn't leave any scope for excuses to not to watch the movie.<br/><br/>to tell the story in a few sentences it is a story about a group of urban friends from Delhi who are urged by an independent documentary filmmaker to act in a movie about the Indian revolutionaries fighting against the British empire in the 1920s. initially as they act they do not believe in the ideal-isms of freedom ,patriotism and revolution as incorporated in the film but as the story moves on they begin to come face to face with the sacrifices made in the past in the revolution.<br/><br/>as the story moves on the line between past and present becomes more and more blurred until it vanishes.here the friends become themselves the very characters they were playing in the documentary movie.the rest u have to see for yourselves.<br/><br/>the movie is actually 2 movies in one.we see about the revolutionaries BHAGAT SINGH ,RAJGURU,chandrasekhar AZAD,BISMIL etc in flashbacks.we get to see the KAKORI train robbery,the SAUNDERS murder,the SIMON demonstrations,the hunger strike by BHAGAT SINGH and others while in jail,the JALIANWALAH BAGH massacre and many other things. then we keep coming back to the present story of the group of friends.<br/><br/>the music by AR Rehman is""FANTABULOUS"". it is one with the film.it lifts the film to a different level altogether.unlike other typical Hindi movies in here you never realize when the songs come and go.they are simply a part of the story.in fact sometimes you would even wish that they were a bit long.i don't know why it is ,may because of the songs themselves or simply the way they have been shot.<br/><br/>the photography is excellent.BINOD PRADHAN like his earlier movies has shown what a good cinematographer he is.<br/><br/>the acting was fantastic.not only did the seasoned actors like AAMIR KHAN,ATUL KULKARNI and R.MADHAVAN but the younger ones like SHARMAN,SOHA,KUNAL and SIDDHARTH have done a perfect job.even you have to take the hats off for the support actors ANUPAM KHAR,KIRON KHER,WAHEEDA REHMAN.a special mention has to be there for ALICE PATTEN .she has done a great job.<br/><br/>RAKEYSH OMPRAKASH MEHRA this is a movie of a lifetime.thank you for making it."

","Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends, their bonding, the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past, when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first, but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti has a story to tell, is not a ripoff of some exotic film, but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.<br/><br/>A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical, and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.<br/><br/>Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end, but the film has more gems when it comes to performances: Siddharth is excellent, Atul Kulkarni is fantastic, Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation, Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance, her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe, Steven Mckintosh, K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.<br/><br/>But ultimately, despite sharing the screen space with others, this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor, playing a character 15 years younger, lives the role, conveying the right amount of mischief (as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language), carefree flippancy, earnestness, insecurity, even breaking down on screen, and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.<br/><br/>Well, in the movie its said "" I always thought that there are two kinds of men; those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind"" Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too, There are movies made with some moral(some underlying message), some are pure entertainers, not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought, a thought..................."

","A year and a half ago I commented on ""Lakshya"": Don't expect a rabid anti war or anti establishment film. The time has not yet come for this in Bollywood. With ""Rang de Basanti"" Bollywood has made a film that clearly does not shy away from pointing a finger at the holy cows 'army' and 'government' and dares to suggest that corruption and infamy extend up to the highest ranks and most respected institutions of Indian society. While the opening offers the usual disclaimer (fictional story bla bla) the end draws clear parallels to reality. And what the characters in the film think and say reflects what young Indians actually do think and say. This is not Bollywood fantasy land, running around trees and you know the drill. It's nonetheless a genuine Bollywood film. Just a far better one than the usual kind. Good performance from an ensemble cast all around, no superstar shenanigans, catchy music, an inventive visual style, technically sound execution and a quite realistic script make this one a winner not to be missed. Go see it on the big screen."

","Now all of us should commend RdB for the bold initiative in putting forth the idea of what the common citizen of India would like to do to every..cough...democratically elected...cough...politician. The movie was quite influential to the point that the political scum really need to worry about their safety. Having said all that, there is really nothing in this movie itself besides that which is worth mentioning. Its the standard Bollywood fare of singing, dancing, religion related fighting and a look at the past freedom struggle from the British. All that changes when one of the friends gets killed in an air crash, attributed to low quality spares approved by corrupt politicians. The heroes thus go and kill a politician in broad daylight. The obvious happens and they are hunted down and killed by counter terrorist squads. The end."

","Rang DE.. turned out to be as colorful as its name with shades of reckless youth to the maturity of the subject it wishes to project. The comparisons drawn between past and present and the way the characters really emerge out has been the high point of the movie.Aamir khan looks more mature than a college pass out but then he makes up with his fine performance and instinctive manipulation. It is a patriotic movie and relates well to the younger generation.I would definitely rate Alice's performance among one of the best and how she's so much comfortable with Hindi is amazing.It is an irony in the film that it took a foreign girl to make the youth realize of their patriotic heritage. Music of the movie is awesome and suits the mood with romantic numbers like' Tu bin bat-aye',to the hip op 'pathshala' and finally to the highly emotive""Lukka Ch.."".The picturisation of songs is great. The director has used the characters very intelligently working on their strengths and also the depiction of political characters is commendable .The best aspect of the movie is the editing and screenplay, although I feel a better job could have been done with the dialogs.

","In continuation of Indian Cinema's new found interest in dishing out sensible stuff, Rang De Basanti is a runaway winner in terms of acting, direction, screenplay..you name it, and of course MESSAGE. The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth, but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption, and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost taken-for-granted independence. Also, the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camera-work is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabi-style wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi, however, is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all, a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10!"
"prathyaksha","1","29","87","1 December 2010"," All that is wrong with urban youth!
","This film's absurdly high rating insinuates all that is wrong with today's urban Indian youth. Before I get into all the bashing, I have to give credit where it is due. I have to agree that the movie is technically strong; the cinematography is charming, Rahman's music is one of his best, editing is crisp, and the acting is mostly above par and a few outstanding. Where the movie fails, is in its core theme and the message it tries to convey. A group of college students who are indifferent to the problems of the country, as most of us are, suddenly one day gear up to kill the Defence Minister of the country because they 'think' he is responsible for their friend's(an airforce pilot) death. They are utterly convinced that their friend died because of the mediocre parts that went into the manufacturing of the crashed MiG plane, despite having no evidence to establish this whatsoever. They never for once bother to think that the minister could be innocent. What is sickening is the way their act is hailed at the end as if it was the most heroic thing ever done on the face of the earth. The movie constantly compares these half-boiled-attitude youth with the revolutionaries of the Indian freedom struggle which I think is an insult to those real heroes. <br/><br/>The plot holes are many. The attack on the people peacefully protesting by the police in the presence of media is simply ridiculous to be real. Now, icing on the cake was the climax,when these 'nationalists' break into a radio station to confess and justify their action. I am not sure of what did these guys think would happen after they confess and allege the minister of corruption on AIR? The country would rise against the government?? when clearly it didn't happen when the innocent people were beaten black and blue in the presence of media! We Indian youth are susceptible to the mob-mentality. The director has exploited it thoroughly. Now, this movie has gained the cult status among the urban dudes because, as a quote in the movie goes, it is easy to grumble about all the ills in the country (and kill its minister) than changing the society for the good, say by becoming an IAS/IPS officer- which requires quite a struggle than stupidly throwing up your life that serves nothing.<br/><br/>PS: I would have given this movie a 6/10. But, 1 is just a feeble attempt to bring it to its deserving position."
"kanishkaRCML","2","19","53","13 February 2006"," Outrageous
","This movie condones the use of violence as a means to bring about change in society. This in general is an interesting viewpoint that deserves cinematic analysis, since according to many, it is justifiable when society is subjected to tyrannical rule, usually by an external aggressor. But the society depicted in this film is modern India - yes corrupt India, but also India of the free press, universal adult franchise, world's largest democracy etc. Most important, it is an India that is ruled by *democratically elected people*! Assassinating an elected leader is as good as executing a portion of the electorate. So does the film suggest that we should condone mass murder? The parallels between the British Raj and modern day corruption, and those between hot-headed brainless youngsters and the thoughtful revolutionaries of the freedom movement were shameful - the British were not elected by us - they were an imperialistic power from a different country. Violence may well have been the only resort (though therein lies a healthy debate - there were many thousands who believed that there were other ways to bring about change).<br/><br/>If we do not like the politicians we elect, the rational course of action should be ""don't vote for them"", not ""let's kill them"". It is amazing that such a movie can be made in the same country that produced Mahatma Gandhi. It is also sad that it took a British filmmaker to make that film and an Indian film maker to make this one.<br/><br/>Having said that, the movie was interesting because it raised questions that have not been raised in mainstream Hindi movies. Unfortunately it answered them as well, and incorrectly, and simplistically, IMO. The positive reaction that RDB has received so far is far from funny - it is downright worrisome. Modern Indian youth seems to think in unison that boys in the story are to be glorified and congratulated for what they did. Even the supposedly sophisticated Manhattan audience with whom I shared the screening started clapping at the end of the movie. I was quite nauseated, and dismayed.<br/><br/>I came out of the movie quite angry, and raved and ranted at my wife for a while re. the moral center of the movie. By the time I reached home I had calmed down, and realized that if a movie was able to create a evoke such strong emotion (even if a negative one) then something must be said of the film and the filmmaker.<br/><br/>Morality apart, the movie has huge holes in the plot, which has been written about in these pages."
"E_D_N","5","13","35","12 February 2006"," RANG DE BASANTI  misguided AND a bad movie IMO.
","**** SPOILERS ***** Had read my share of decidedly mixed reviews, but nothing had prepared me for this.<br/><br/>I was shocked, staring back at the screen in disbelief last night at my local multiplex.<br/><br/>My quibbles: 1. THE SCRIPT - Too much going on, too many layers. Voice-over, one strand of the narrative set in the past, another set in the present. Somehow, all the different elements don't gel together all that well. Something that was obvious when Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekar Azad et al end up moving along to Khalbali blaring on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Events happen rather randomly in a disjointed kind of way and my jaw hit the floor when the following happened  for me, big WTF moments: - Aamir suddenly deciding that ""drastic measures have to be taken"" and that to kill the politico would be the best thing to do, that, even though they had established that sensibilities had changed and that people -- young people esp. -- are no longer as politically engaged in as they were say 80-odd years ago.<br/><br/><ul><li>Even though it had been foreshadowed by having Karan's father coincidentally (and very conveniently) be involved with the Russian armament companies, Madhavan's death came off as a cheap plot device.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The killing actually takes place. WTF? - They hijack the radio station. The DJ makes the dramatic announcement about the killing and concludes with "" and now ROOBAROO!""  and the actual upbeat song plays on the soundtrack, clashing with all the dramatics that came before I was dying.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Karan killing his father  because ""it's the only way out""  again, WTF? - Ajay's mother slipping into a coma (!!!) and symbolically giving signs of life once the ""deed"" is done  again, creaky plot mechanics IMO.</li></ul><br/><br/>Now, mind you, I'm not decrying the fact that they were yearning for change. I empathize, nay, I sympathize with and fully subscribe to revolutionary movements across the globe and their ideals, but here, I just felt that in the context of the film, the actions that follow Ajay's (Madhavan) death, were unwarranted and unnecessary, and that, surely, there could have been other ways, peaceful ways, to bring about change. As it is, it came off as the kind of empty-headed liberal ideology that gives conservative elements in governments around the world ammunition to dismiss such movements as ""hotheaded"".<br/><br/>Maybe my above comments show how little I know about Indian politics and as one character says in the film, ""the corruption"" rooted in it.<br/><br/>Still, I had no sympathy for any of the characters, who quite frankly, came off as idiots IMHO. All they did was dance around and do nothing significant, with Aamir's character the most reprehensible of the lot, for he was the eldest and should have known better. Not holding down a job, living off his mother, and hanging out with his friends on campus. Was his character a ""model"" to follow? I have my doubts about that. ""BE A REBEL"" the soundtrack intones hhmmmm.<br/><br/>The second half feels rushed, as if the screenwriter was going through the motions and trying to hit as many plot points as possible in the most mechanical fashion.<br/><br/>2. ALICE'S CHARACTER Someone please explain what kind of documentary that was she was making? A reenactment of these revolutionaries' lives shot on the cheap with a DV camera? Sure looked sleek on screen what with the sepia cast, thousands of extras, etc LOL. Guess that budget of hers inflated as it went along And what kind of documentary was that anyway? Another problem is that when the film starts, SHE is the central figure in the plot. Midway through, her and the whole documentary storyline are discarded. Talk about consistency. Also, that AAMIR love interest subplot goes nowhere.<br/><br/>My biggest problem though is WHY IS SHE  ANOTHER GORA  THE AGENT OF CHANGE? Why is it, that SHE, a white woman, is the one who rouses the Indians to consciousness about their life and their lack of engagement? That's what made me most angry actually. She, a foreigner, comes to India, and EDUCATES the local youths about their OWN history. How can people not be outraged by that? I found the idea insidious.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is okay.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, everyone from ALICE PAYTON, to AAMIR, to SIDDARTH, to SOHA ALI KHAN (surprise!), etc are very good though I feel OM PURI was wasted in his small role.<br/><br/>They should have done away with the songs. They just get in the way most of the time. Exception is the LUKA CHUPPI used to rousing effects during Ajay's funeral.<br/><br/>The movie fails as an ode to youth, friendship, etc and at times I felt the filmmakers were trying to emulate some of the scenes and feelings one found in DIL CHAHTA HAI with the characters reveling in the lush fields and making the most of a time they know will never happen again misses the mark though and that second half almost erases all the good things in the first Very disappointing and off the mark!"

"ssvikas","9","4","8","2 March 2006"," Rocking film for the Youth! Delivers the message far without the usual stereotypes!
","Plot Outline: Sue (Alice Patten) is inspired by the legendary characters of Bhagat Singh, Azad et al from her grandfather's diaries during his days in the British Raj. She lands in Delhi to make a film on them and finds those characters in Sonia's (Soha) friends DJ (Aamir), Karan (Siddharth), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) & Sukhi (Sharman Joshi). The friends belong to Gen Next who care not about values like Patriotism & Sacrifice. The accidental death of their friend Flt Lt Ajay Rathod (Madhavan) in a MIG Crash and the wrongful blame on the pilot makes them take up cudgels against the corrupt establishment.<br/><br/>Comment: Very rarely are movies that talk of relevant values for the Youth. Most of the Patriotic movies are full of either anti-angrez or anti-Pak sentiments with heaps of Melodrama thrown in. With RDB, Rakeysh Mehra has made a significant movie from stereotypes. Unlike others, RDB does not have the typical 'hero' & 'heroine'. Aamir and his friends are people the youth can easily identify with. They are simple minded students who live care free lives and they plainly react 'normally'. Those who have disliked this movie are the ones who prefer stereotyped abnormalities.<br/><br/>Most notable performance in RDB is that of Siddharth whose character grows as the movie progresses. Aamir, of course has been brilliant but looks too old to play a College Student. Some of the movie's best moments are Madhavan's proposal to Soha, breaking down of Aamir in Sue's apartment, Atul Kulkarni's recital of Bismil's poetry and of course the last scenes of Siddharth and Aamir. Don't miss AR Rahman's youthful and soulful music too! Quotes thrown in RDB include: ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". Inspiring, isn't it? Watch the movie to get charged. This one is highly recommended for those who're young and those who still think themselves to be young!"
"venkat2cool","8","6","14","27 January 2006"," A modern patriotic film
","This movie is one of the ""original"" and unique movies that India has ever produced. It has a very fresh concept and a very different look to patriotism. Although it may seem that this movie is a Pav-Bhaji of Dil Chahta Hai, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, and Nayak, yet it stands out with a class of its own.<br/><br/>The movie has many surprises, and Madhavan could have been the biggest surprise if the production team could have managed to keep it a secret. But that didn't happen. Another big surprise in the movie is the latter half. The movie undergoes a complete transformation after the interval. I felt that the pre-interval section could have been edited to make it short and sweet. Now, its like so sweet that the viewer would get diabetes :) The star cast is good. It would have been better if they would have picked up more ""known"" faces. Although acting-wise, there were no shortcomings, but still, it would have been better. The most primary reason why this was not done, I think, is because all the 5 characters have a dominant role in the film. So, even if there was one good/famous star, Aamir Khan may not be able to gather the attention that he has managed to do now. Soha Ali Khan looks pretty and she knows acting as well! She has done her role very well.<br/><br/>The climax is something that I personally didn't like much. I was not very much happy with the current climax, but I'm afraid that I wouldn't have been happy either even if the climax would have been the other way round. So... to know the climax, go watch the film. Its certainly a good one to watch in the theatre! Rating: 8 out of 10"

","(Note - may contain spoilers! )<br/><br/>RDB is a different movie, contemporary in it's screenplay, music and theme. Patriotic movies more often ignite the spirits within you, some question the System, some question the people. But none has suggested a solution, a realistic solution, not a hypothetical projection of a historic depiction.<br/><br/>This movie attempts to recreate the aura, psyche of Bhagath Singh and Azad's troupe in modern day era. It simply is a rendering of the past in the present context. It doesn't try to tell you whether Bhagat Singh is right or wrong or whether what the 4 college guys did is right or wrong. It just says - ""This is what happens, when some people stand up and believe in what they fight. This is whats gonna happen to any youth in this country if the Government continues to BS around and no you don't need no Al Qaida to do, just normal people can"".<br/><br/>Whats the result?<br/><br/>Instead of a History Channel on Bhagath Singh, you get a contemporary rendering of the characters in present day India with a seemingly interleaving screenplay of past/present. Most biopics on Bhagat Singh tried to portray as him as an extra ordinary person and simply repaint history without telling the psyche and the circumstances. I think thats why this movie deserves a great applause by rendering a difficult subject wrt the present people, people like you and me who never thought of execution of the thought.<br/><br/>The cast is first rate. After a long time, you will feel that a popular Hindi cinema has no stars, just characters.(I can only remember Lagaan, Swades, DCH close to this in terms of characterisation in the recent past). AR Rahman, brilliant.Its sad to see so many good movies with his good music do not get the attention that he truly deserves.<br/><br/>Well, here comes the down part. The first half makes you completely fall in love with this movie and just when you start building expectations ... the movie fails. Starting with the protest of Ajay's flight accident, assassination of Defense Minister (quite cool eh? Didn't know that you could just shoot a minister point blank and still nobody can figure out who the killer is. Quite stupid), to the insanely gruesome mass shooting towards the end, this is where you start to feel that the director is using too much of liberty and insisting you not to use your brains.<br/><br/>Watch out for some of the best moments - 1) When Amir cries for Madhavan at the dinner table, telling how useless, helpless he is. Brilliant acting. I always consider a tragic scene as extremely difficult coz you just don't cry seeing the actor cry, but if it gives u a millisecond of gasp- he deserves an applause. 2) when the 4 buddies remove their shirts and wave across a fighter plane just grazing on their above. Wonderful poetry! Also shows that you don't have to have great bods to remove the shirt. It could still look great. 3) last scene with Siddharth / Amir when they're smiling to glory ...<br/><br/>Acting is great ... no one has screwed up in any dept. However the last 1 hour is a bit amateurish and could have been avoided with more sophistication. Like all those movies which try to say something about patriotism, this one brags about it too, yet in a different subtler ""warning"" tone. But my point is<br/><br/>""what do we do now. Do you have a solution?""<br/><br/>When will we see a movie which could bring us hope, which addresses the Issues and brings out the execution in reality? Opinions like these will come and go but the Problem still remains<br/><br/>the bottom line 8/10 - Brave attempt on cinematography, music, screenplay, casting and storytelling of 6th class history. Ironically, the premise of the movie should have been told in writing by the director towards the end, saying its just a ironic depiction of the past and not the moral of the story. Unfortunately for some viewers the message could be deceptive as its very very subtle.<br/><br/>Swades on the other hand could be realistic, it hits you hard, very deeply with a message"

Saying anything beyond that, e.g. movie for the youth, movie for our future, best movie of our generation (avg. mortality has increased well beyond 30 yrs. even in poorest of African countries), etc., is plain kidding ourselves.<br/><br/>the big problem is that the movie heightens expectations in the first half and like most of the promising movies in the recent past, lets down in 2nd half. 2nd half is just too hurried, half baked, and flawed. well, bollywood wallas don't like to give us too much of a good thing and always seem to come short.<br/><br/>It will be great to watch a Hindi movie in which complex issues facing our society are addressed in an intelligent/clever manner rather than taking a short cut and shooting the politicians. ""Go, kill a guy you think is a root of all evils"" is a non-message. it is high time the scripts matured and showed something of substance that meant something to us. till then I will continue to ""dingi-danga-dingi-danga-dingi-danga-ding"" :)"

","Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's attempt at making a feel good movie for the pseudo seculars. The script appears almost surrealistic at times, because of the biased and critical nature of the movie. First of lets just think this through shall we? Who would just up and decide to assassinate the defense minister of a country without even conducting a basic investigation to see if he was guilty? And to compare these nimrods with the likes of Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad? I am sensing they didn't know much about our freedom fighters other than the part about they getting hanged. Nothing of the kind that is showed in the movie happened during the right wing rule. As if their blatant crap throwing at the ideals of the conservatives weren't enough, they had to end the movie with a purely impossible logic. Who would send commandos to massacre college students? I cant believe people bought into this propaganda crap. The Migs were bought before that government came to power. So if you re going to blame someone, blame our royal family and their Italian arms dealer/friend.<br/><br/>I do have to congratulate these people though. In showing how easily the average person can be manipulated with the help of good acting and great music(credit where it is due). This is a great way of campaigning for the ones in power. Make malicious movies about the opposition and throw dirt at them, while ban the filming of movies that show them in a bad light like the one about Jawaharlal Nehru, because it was going to portray his love affair with Lady Mountbatten."
"pojha","1","19","61","13 April 2006"," A masala movie glorifying mindless jingoism
","The first half of the movie was promising out to be a 5 on 10, but then they started the second half which brings it down to the bottom floor :( There's attempt at good movie-making , but obviously they have succeeded in making good money. <br/><br/>I admire the business acumen of the movie makers to put in a little this and a little that to pull in most importantly the rich crowds - the Punjabis in India and abroad. Secondly, it uses some cutting-edge techniques to make the movie LOOK good to critics in India who are mainly exposed to trash after mindless song-dance trash for review. This is the only reason I can think for this movie to get rave reviews. And then , there are ALSO those BIG HIT dance numbers which the yuppy crowd goes into see picturized on the big screen. But does a soundtrack make a movie good ?!! Once the audience are in , the movie preaches and preaches and preaches. Then it preaches AGAIN !<br/><br/>I don't mind the above mentioned tricks 'coz the movie makers want to make money firstly , and hats off to them for succeeding . However , strickly speaking about the movie's quality , it has problems.<br/><br/>Today's India is building itself on its IT and economic policies and capitalism , but this movie preaches about how the youth today should adopt violence against the establishment to make the country move ahead. This movie ( and others coming out of India ) glorifies Bhagat Singh etc. a bit too much. There have been some classics about him in the distant past , but the movie industry seems to inclined to portray these guys as the ones who actually brought freedom to India. Well ... like Mahatma Gandhiji did not exist , Or the World War did not create problems for British enough for them to start pulling out of most countries . A biographic movie about Bhagat Singh etc. would've been tolerable, but this movie PREACHES that the techniques of Singh and Azad are SO EFFECTIVE that they can be successful in today's world. I have doubts about that.<br/><br/>Well , Youth of India ,thankfully you don't have the guts to practice the lessons from this movie. However if you DO , please don't! India is progressing fine, thank you. In fact, India can do with a little lesser crime.<br/><br/>Other irritants abound in this movie. One I can think of right now was the evil corrupt and mean politician with an IQ of bird-droppings. Now ... politicians anywhere might be mean , evil and corrupt , but they're generally among the smartest people on earth. But this one was so dumb that he actually criticizes a dead pilot! Not surprisingly , people were not pleased with him.<br/><br/>The list of unbelievable irritants can go on , so I'll end with one last thing about this movie which which is WRONG - it leads u to think Punjab is the only place in India !<br/><br/>But hey ,the movie has the regular masalas for a block-buster - Romance , loud music and violence. Add to that a lot of patriotic hoohaa. Then there's Hindu-Muslim solidarity. So , keep your intellect aside and you might enjoy the movie."

","A disturbingly bad film, and a rare example of one that utterly misses its own point: initially it's a call for unity among different religions, and a story of patriotic resistance to the evil repression of authority. At the end the message is: forget legitimate protest, just kill those in power whom you don't like. <br/><br/>Starting off as a pleasant enough Bollywood entertainment about disaffected youth and the western blond girl who engages them in life and reminds them of the heroism of their ancestors against the evil British Colonial rulers (let's not even go there) the second half completely changes track and ends up as a political manifesto advocating violent terrorism as a way for social change.<br/><br/>It's dispiriting that the film's (initial) message of unity, democratic change and resistance to the evils of power could have been done much MORE powerfully without violating the internal logic of the story. The last quarter of the film comes out of the blueit's like you're watching a different movie. There are about 10 different ways the script could have gone differently and held together conceptually, while keeping the message which is (or initially seemed to be) about coming together and resisting oppression: SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/><ul><li>the youths could have been awakened to their problems, made a stand, and taken over the radio station, (even been killed and martyred for their beliefs) without killing someone in vigilante fashion</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the youths could have discussed their understandable vengeful feelings before acting on them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the women, originally portrayed as agents of change, could have been included in the decisions, or continued as characters to encourage critical discussion and thinking (instead of being pushed aside and become the clichéd tragic, mourning, passive, victims). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the potentially interesting parallels between the present-day corrupt Indian government with the colonial British one could have been explored, and taken to the logical conclusion, which is that terrorism and violence only continue the cycle, cause more divisiveness and don't work.

","""Saare politicians KO line mein khade kar ke goli se udaa dena chahiye"".<br/><br/>That line said by the first caller makes the climax of Rang De Basanti work. It throws back at us the hollowness of our words. You only have to hear the audience laugh. We are laughing at ourselves. It is so outrageous and yet so.. so.. believable. I feel a sense of pride in the fact that I belong to a society where a film like Rang De Basanti is made and then shown openly. The film gets away with murder. It is surprising that it didn't create more controversy than it actually did. Perhaps, because the film is making a point here, an argument which is not easy to refute.<br/><br/>Films have been made before on similar anti-establishment themes. One has always enjoyed watching Hu Tu Tu every time it's shown on TV. Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisi was, I thought, one of the best movies of last year. But after Rang De Basanti, these films now smack of intellectual elitism. You really don't need to be a student of political science or a kurta-wearing socialist to think and talk about revolutions and changing societies. The characters here are you and me and your friends in the neighbourhood. One of them, in fact, is a self-confessed loser.<br/><br/>The film asks a lot of questions at various levels, some very subtle. For instance, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru can court arrest in British occupied India and expect a fair trial so as to be able to put forth their point. But our characters from 21st century India can't even dream of doing the same. They have to instead..<br/><br/>Perhaps too much is being read into it. It is only a film after all. A commercial venture out there to make a profit. But then what is it that makes people think and debate issues? Books? Lectures? Newspaper articles? Then why not films? Why not films with songs? Why not films with songs and a superstar? One had always believed that words are more effective than visuals. Rang De Basanti shows you the power of imagery. The effect created would have been impossible with the written or the spoken word.<br/><br/>Dean Jones was recently saying to Sivaramakrishnan that we tend to use words like 'great' and 'genius' too liberally. So I will restrain myself. But, Rang De Basanti is my all time favourite movie. Even in terms of pure cinematic experience.

"rdig1-1","9","5","12","25 January 2006"," Rang De Basanti...
","Every Aamir Khan movie is special. I was lucky enough to catch the premier show on 25th, the atmosphere was perfect and the buzz of anticipation could be felt in the theatre. As there are no reviews for the movie at that time, we had no idea how the movie would be. <br/><br/>I always thought Aamir Khan was a heavy risk taker. He proves me right again with RDB. He needs to be applauded for not over shadowing his co-stars. Also his enthusiasm to make movies that pack a message to the society needs special mention.<br/><br/>After all the hassles of RDB had from the defense ministry of India, IAF and Maneka Gandhi. RDB finally makes it without losing out on any impactful parts.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Sue (Alice Patton) reading her fathers diary. Her father being an office during the Independence struggle of India writes a dairy glorifying the Indian freedom fighters. Sue rekindled by the diary travels to Delhi to make a documentary. This is where the story starts to form a crux. The whole group comes together. The first 80mins of the movie are really hilarious with DJ (Aamir) one-liners as well as his passes at Sue. Sunil as Sarman Joshi needs special mention as he makes us laugh a lot.<br/><br/>The first half cruises as the documentary develops, so do the group of start thinking more about what they are and what their destinies are. The main part of the movie starts when Madhavan who plays a MIG pilot dies due to technical complications because cheap Russian parts were used in the flights by the defense ministry.<br/><br/>The story that follows after the death of Madhavan is a high-pitched drama. It absorbs us in RDB, the direction of Omprakash Mehra come to the fore. The whole movie runs on comparison to the freedom struggle where few bits of similar situation are shown in Sepia toning.<br/><br/>The movie ends quite dramatically and will be quite a surprise to everyone. <br/><br/>Few points that even the perfectionist Aamir missed are.<br/><br/>? The murder of the defense ministry had to be a bit more complicated than shooting some one on the road side ? The Pilots at Madhavans funeral looked like school kids. This really took the intensity of that scene away.<br/><br/>But saying the above are negative points would be wrong as it would be too critical in an otherwise good movie.<br/><br/>A R Rahman's background score keeps the movie at a fast pace; the songs are all well woven onto the movie.<br/><br/>Some outstanding phases of the movie<br/><br/>? Auditioning after Sue arrives in Delhi ? Auditioning the DJ gang ? DJ speaking in Hindi thinking Sue doesn't understand it ? Scenes between Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor ? Aamirs funny lines with Sarman Joshi ? Siddartha is ultra cool in the movie<br/><br/>Siddartha quoted in one of his interviews that without Aamir Khan there would be no Rang De Basanti. I would like to applaud Aamir, UTV and Omprakash for making such a wonderful movie. It might not be a complete entertainer but it definitely is undoubtedly one of the better movies. Go for it"

","A brilliant movie with fantastic performances and great music. It sure made my day !!!!!!!!........and the days to come !!!<br/><br/>Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's movie 'Rang De Basanti' is a must-watch for reasons that the length of this review may not suffice to express. More than just a technically brilliant flick, 'Rang De Basanti' has a story that entertains you, makes you think and stirs you deep inside in the end.<br/><br/>The most remarkable part of the movie is the parallel that Mehra draws between the freedom fighters and DJ and his group of friends. The movie keeps transposing the same actors into characters from the past. And then, as the story draws to its conclusion, even these differences in the characters disappear. The modern, city-bread 'young guns' of the twenty first century become one in spirit with the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves for the country's freedom."
"nomanali77","9","5","12","26 January 2006"," Aamir Khan redeems himself completely.
","There is no doubt about it. Aamir Khan is totally forgiven for the Mangal Pandey disaster. Ketan Mehta did everything possible to mess up Aamir's record, but with Rang De Basanti, Khan's ""Rising"" mistakes will be forgotten.<br/><br/>The director (only a film old with Aks), is also one of the screenwriters, and has written a compelling, emotional, informational and entertaining storyline.<br/><br/>The story starts of with a British TV producer, Sue, who comes to India to make a film on freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his compatriots. Her story is based on the diary entries of her grandfather, who was a soldier in the empire during the 1920s. With the help of an Indian friend in Delhi called Sonia (Soha Ali Khan Pataudi), she starts auditions for the cast of her film, at Sonia's college. Here she also meets Sonia's friends: DJ (Aamir Khan), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor), Sukhi (Sherman Joshi) and Karan (Siddharth Narayan), as well as Sonia's boyfriend Ajay (Madhavan in a guest appearance). This group is soon joined by Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) who is a pro Shiv Sena activist. What follows on from here is an unbelievable ride of fun and emotions. A story that starts out in the middle of a college day with friends playing jokes and having fun (a la Dil Chahta Hai) breaks into an adventure of self discovery.Even at the interval, you will not be able to imagine what the end is like. I wouldn't like to say more about the storyline, you just have t watch it yourself.<br/><br/>Why is is movie a winner? I heard the album before watching the movie and found it to be very average fare from A.R. Rahman. My opinion changed completely after watching the movie. The music is so apt, and plays such an integral role in the film that you can't imagine anyone else having done it. In fact, the scenes there are scenes that are actually memorable BECAUSE of the effect of the music. People tell me that Rahman is losing his touch, since a lot of new music directors have popped up. I disagree. AR Rahman is a person who makes music completely from his soul. His soul needs to understand the feel of the movie. The director needs to tell him what the storyline is, what the scenes are. And I'm sure this director did. He had a crisp story, and a very serious vision of what the feel of every scene is. Once he passes that info on to Rahman, the music director transforms that into a musical piece. Basically, give AR Rahman a clear-cut theme of the movie, and he will create magic. Examples aplenty in Roja, Rangeela, Bombay, Dil Se, 1947 Earth, Lagaan, Saathiya and Yuva.<br/><br/>The casting is a real treat. Its rare to come across an Indian movie where there are no casting mistakes, but this is a unique gem. Not a single character was miscast and every single person gave their best to the role. You can't imagine other actors in these roles. Kunal Kapoor as Aslam is superb, Aamir Khan is brilliant, Soha Al Khan surprised me with her poise and confidence, Sherman Joshi is great, Atul Kulkarni has proved time and again that he is a serious character artist and Siddharth as Karan is another role that comes alive very well. In addition to that, the savior is that they have cast a British woman who actually has some command over the Hindi language, so instead of struggling with her accent, you see her emoting her role really well. The supporting cast, made up of Kiron Kher (as DJ's mom), Anupam Kher (Karan's dad), Madhavan and Waheeda Rahman are finely suited for their roles.<br/><br/>The director has made a brilliant venture into the movie world. I would like to see what else comes out in 2006 because I am having a hard time believing that there will be anything much this year that will beat this film. I rarely rate things this high, and I would have given it a ten if it wasn't for the scene where a certain woman hears bad news about her man on TV, while she is purchasing green chudis. Bit lame."

","""Rang De Basanti"" directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is about a woman who wants to depict the freedom fighters from 1920's India in a documentary. As a film, it tries to cover important ground from Indian history, but as with the rest of Bollywood productions, it fails miserably in the attempt.<br/><br/>Strange pacing from beginning to end, and what could be told in less than 90 minutes took almost 180. Awkward rushed editing in spite, an atrociously cheap score, together with several mediocre performances.<br/><br/>To name its few qualities, I thought it did have a slightly interesting developing storyline, as well as decent cinematography and production design with a couple of excellent locations. Aamir Khan brought life to the film with his intuitive wit and impeccable energy as an actor.<br/><br/>Other than that, and as usual from the fiercely overrated Bollywood films in this site, it was a big, long, cheasy mess."

Bottomline: Kudos to Mr Mehra for shooting the longest ever commercial till date. The movie sells it to you. And, hard sells!<br/><br/>A. R. Rahman got the nerve of the movie and composed his usual best, but still nothing compared to Roja yet. Mehra got lucky and I would have prayed him if only I were to decide not to watch his other movies.

"mariotofu","10","3","6","26 December 2011"," Why this movie was incredible.
","Now I won't really go into detail about the plot because the idea is great, honestly it alone could have made the movie pretty good. The cinema style and the realism of the movie is what got to me. <br/><br/>Stuff like this has happened before throughout history where people take the law into their own hands for the sake of justice. For the sake of clearing corruption. <br/><br/>Rang De Basanti makes you think. No matter what your viewpoint is on government, politics and corruption because even the characters themselves are split. This was the first movie (Not just Bollywood) that actually made me put myself into the situation of a revolutionary and in the position of a politic leader. The passion some people have for their country and the freedom of others is remarkable. Before this movie I thought about the topic only when necessary because as an American, we don't directly witness the corruption. Many don't until it's pointed out towards them. Every person in the world needs to watch this movie. Because no government is perfect, we must make it perfect. As I said before this movie will make you think and leave an after-effect for days. You might be the type to criticize the government but never do anything to actually help, there's a character for that. Even he see's what he must do and what is right, only the situation can show who can be a true revolutionary.<br/><br/>How did it do all that? Well like I said before the plot is pretty good, it's original and it has good direction. What make this movie spectacular? <br/><br/>The great cast and their performances is the first thing that needs to be pointed out. Alice Patten does a great job and really blends into her role more than any character. Not saying the others don't but she just does it so brilliantly. She was ideal for the role because she has the mild beauty and spark. Amir Khan obviously outshines the rest of the cast again. Can you believe this man is 46? I couldn't during the movie. I didn't once think ""Hey look at the 46 year old who has a teenage daughter my age."" because he completely melted into his character. Spectacular performance. He pretty much blended into the rest of the gang but obviously. He blended into his character who was the hardest to portray. The rest of the cast was about the same but Siddhartha did stand out. His character was the rich youth who only shows negativeness. Without these characters exactly where they needed to be...this movie might have not been so great.<br/><br/>The second thing that made this movie stand out was the utilization of the Past-Present shift technique through colored flashbacks. It kept me entertained and both astonished at how bad the revolution was in India. <br/><br/>The Music was excellent, I wouldn't say the movie couldn't have gotten better music but it did set a realistic mood. Thank god this wasn't a musical or all respect for the movie would have gone down. <br/><br/>This movie shouldn't be compared to Swades. Although that is a great movie, that's what it was...just a movie. Rang De Basanti is a call for change and an eye-opener. Every Desi should watch this movie because the condition in Pakistan and Bangladesh are exactly the same as India."
"rainybullet","10","3","6","5 January 2007"," very absorbing
","It is an excellent movie which truly reflects the growing revolutionary-youth-movement in India at present (post 2000). The problem with the MIG flight planes is long, but government has never taken any serious resolution. This movie rightly depicts the situation of a family suffering from this governmental negligence. An Indian army plot dies in a MIG accident. It brings his group of friends start thinking about the social & political problems in India which they always avoided and thought the governmental policies will never going to affect their life directly anyway. This common people's idea fired back and they even determined to give a repartee to the Indian Government. They assassinated the defense Minister and went public by Radio to announce the cause of their inhuman deed. Though the Government took it as a serious offense but their way of protests worked as an eye-opening for common people.<br/><br/>In real life, this movie has already influenced serious public-protests against many governmental policy and some have forced the governmental to go by the public opinion. I would say it a true triumph of democracy and ""Rang De Basanti"" just plays that right tune."

I'm a sucker for Aamir movies, right from Andaz Apna Apna to Sarfarosh to Lagaan to DCH.<br/><br/>plus 4. The style of storytelling, with the camera zooming from the historical hero to the protagonist playing the role was quite new, and gets the audience in the thick of action.

"natarajanganesan","7","6","16","20 November 2006"," Botched up second half = Lost a great opportunity
","A brilliant plot has been utterly wasted in the second half that culminates in a series of f***ed up events. As one comes away from the movie, one is led to ask 'what did the kids die for'? What was the take home message (kill the minister and give a half baked justification)? Clearly the purpose of Sue's visit is lost and so is the message that could have been given. The pre-independence Bhagat singh & Co had a clearly defined enemy (Brits) and a solution to that (freedom). What parallels could be justifiably drawn in the modern day 'Bhagat singh & Co'? <br/><br/>To me the movie can be conveniently divided into two parts? The 'Pre-Madhavan' half and the 'Post-Madhavan' half. While the build-up of the storyline in the first half was nothing short of fantastic (until the death of Madhavan's character), the plot fails miserably after the news break of his death. The storyline breaks down completely after the TV episode and what happens thereafter is a bunch of disgruntled youth showing their ire on a bumbling 'defence minister'(who becomes a hero anyway). The movie also takes convenient potshots the saffron-brigade as if the vast majority in that gang were a bunch of trouble seeking goons.<br/><br/>The story had an excellent chance showing a new breed of revolutionaries who could have made the faulty system PAY for its actions and bring the government down to its heels. Instead of literally assassinating the minister (who conveniently reflects the faulty system), they could have systematically gone about assassinating the character of the bad minister and senior officials whose shady deals often cost the lives of invaluable fighter pilots. The movie 'Tango Charlie' and 'Lakshya' perform admirably in this regard where the climax is smooth and makes an even landing. <br/><br/>In the end the movie looks nothing more than piece of good documentary. The first half is really natural and thought provoking. The second half degenerates into a hurried climax, thus insulting the great performances by the entire cast (not one excluded).<br/><br/>Rating - Frankly anything above 7 is over-rating."

The story about the revolutionaries was great, but you get twenty seconds of it in between five minutes of garbage. Save yourself some time and watch something else OR skip the first hour, that way you will only waste 72 minutes of your life. Its an Indian movie, believe me you'll figure out the story line even if you skip an hour. It upset me to see this movie at #3 on the top 100 list of Bollywood films. The entire story line is ridiculous, and the connection they tried making between revolutionaries fighting for freedom in a colonized India and five stupid college kids and a white girls fighting a corrupt government in 2006 was an epic fail."
"nara-5","3","8","24","14 September 2006"," ""A generation awakens"": the road from partying to murder
","Amazing movie. A story about a bunch of rich youth killing a petty minister distantly involved in a rather petty injustice and then getting killed for it - labeled as ""awakening of a generation""....wow! <br/><br/>Youth of India, awaken, drop your beer bottles and pick up your guns! It seems that according to the makers of this movie there is not enough violence already going on in India, there is dire need for more, hence let's make a movie glorifying it.<br/><br/>And it's not only the violence. I can very well agree that violence can serve a purpose in extreme situations (fighting for freedom, for example). But counter-posing India's fight for freedom with the pathetic scenario of fighting a system that uses cheap military equipment and thus endangers the lives of a handful of military officers flying their MIGs.....simply pathetic comparison. One one had you have the fate of a nation....and on the other, all they could come up with, from all the myriad of problems of contemporary India, is the issue of 1-2 persons dying because of flying old military planes? Is this something that affects the society at large? Is this REALLY something worth killing for.....or, for that matter, making a movie about? Is this the awakening of the spirit of old freedom fighters in today's partying youth? I mean..common....there sure must be more worthwhile and extensive problems for which to fight against the system..and kill a minister too!<br/><br/>I found the movie to be absolutely pathetic. The visuals were good, the acting was also OK...but the story is simply outrageously petty, and that too depicted in such a grandiose manner that it can only invite scorn. Moreover, I found it to have very little to do with real India, though it claims to be a patriotic movie. None of the real problems or reactions of the people of this country have been as little as brushed by this movie. <br/><br/>What is this ""awakening of a generation"" thing? As far as I am concerned, and I'm sure most people would agree, drinking and partying is far less dangerous than engaging in mindless revenge-killing. Is this what the youth of India is supposed to do to tackle the problems of this society? Revenge killing? (it's not even like the murder had any other purpose except pure revenge). <br/><br/>There's no awakening of any youth in this movie: It's just a bunch of restless rich college-goers rather naturally drifting from mindless boozing to mindless killing, that's all. And that too while imagining that they are doing some great service to their country. Apparently most of the movie-goers also fell for it. But just step outside the cinema-hall and look around at the REAL problems of this country, and you'll realize that old military planes are most probably very low on the list of priorities, if at all there."

At first, they don't understand the commitment and the drive of the characters. Eventually the film influences them all. However the death of someone special ignites a dangerous fire in them all.<br/><br/>I'm not much into Bollywood, but I figure I check out this highly rated movie. I do like the first half very much. I could do without the song and dance. However I love all the characters and their struggle to find purpose in their superficial lives. I could even gloss over the song and dance breaks.<br/><br/>Then there is a big turn midway. While I understand the reason for the turn, it's highly overdone and too big.

","I bought this movie in Little India in Penang, Malaysia for about 2 dollars. This was money poorly spent (that could have bought me several delicious fish curries). I tried to watch it with some friends; I'm actually pretty surprised that we made it to the end. For some reason, Indian cinema seems to always fail at the strong characterization and evocative dialogue that render Iranian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and other Asian films such good alternatives to Hollywood. Every single character in this film is incredibly annoying... from the idealistic, brainless, self-hating British wannabe filmmaker (whom we're apparently supposed to admire) right down to the painfully clichéd, and indistinguishable, 'handsome party dude who only needs to be inspired to fight for freedom' types. Bogart in Casablanca these guys ain't. The constant and unnecessary 'cool' montages of partying, motorcycle riding, dances and so on are actually much more annoying than your standard Bollywood musical set-piece. Finally--and most importantly--what exactly is it that these morons are fighting for? Capitalist modern India, which the wealthy leftist filmmakers naturally s**t all over, is massively superior to the socialist basket case that came before, as demonstrated by the untold millions lining these actors' and directors' pockets. So there's corruption, obviously, but this isn't quite a reason for a bunch of indolent college students to attempt to take over the country through murdering ministers (as well as one guy's evil capitalist caricature father? why?). Anyway, at this point I'm rambling. This award-winning film (very perplexing) is right up there with ""You Got Served.. Again"" and ""The Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" in my book. Cheers, big ears."

It was complete nonsense first a white girl appeared in India and met Aamir Khan who was drinking with his friends on top of a bridge and placed a bet that who ever falls of first into the water is a loser, then he started dancing stupidly with the girl by shaking his waist then his head. After that I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my dad that ""can I eject the DVD now?"" and he replied ""I'm glad you asked"". My dad is really keen in films like Lagaan & Swades and he couldn't even watch it and I wanted to save myself rather than my money.

","Of late, Bollywood movies are awakening to shed its chocolate-movies image. Passionate and patriotic movies such as Indian, Fiza, Sarfarosh, Swades, and etc have intermittently showed the glitters of Bollywood - propagating that Bollywood too can produce inspiring and refreshing movies. But Rang De Basanti (RDB) cannot be called a movie. It is something more, has transcended the realm of a movie-zone (to be precise, Bollywood movie-zone). After watching the RDB (I don't want to categorize it as a movie) no one can or should say that Bollywood movies are just laden with huge costumes, dances, unrealistic and dramatized characters.<br/><br/>RDB is so refreshing in all its facets that it makes you think differently. SMS generation deems any message with more than four-lines as a lecture. So the generation needs to be admonished differently, and the way the parallels drawn from the Freedom struggle from aliens with the current Freedom struggle from your own bureaucracy stands out tall among other all-beautiful-tenets of this RDB.<br/><br/>Amir Khan is a delight to watch in RDB. Amir Khan's crying because of his helplessness in just being a spectator to the Rapid Action Force's lathi-charge on the silent revolutionaries sums out the veritable young Indian citizen's anguish. The frolic and fun-filled youth belie the very serious resolution they possess. Sidharth's role is controlled and yet most powerful. He conveys a youth's ideals and executes their wish to the hilt.<br/><br/>Hats off to the director, Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, for making such a wonderful bigger-than-a-movie called RDB. RDB would surely lift the Bollywood to new heights. Rahman's music and taut screenplay gels perfectly with the movie. Special mention has to be made about Soha Ali Khan and Alice Payton (played as Sue). They both are stunning. They are far better than the aspiring (obviously Miss World/Universe beauty queens) and most of the current female actresses."

","Beyond doubt, we all acknowledge the power of art to wake up inert souls. However it is a very thin line for one to cross from the desired goal of inspiring and overwhelming into soul less preaching So to that end, Rang de basanti, does cause a lump in your throat, a resonating call in your heart and certain empathy for the five likable, very different characters of this story, without ever lapsing into either maudlin sentiments or moralizing to bring to the fore the plague called corruption sweeping India. <br/><br/>The revolutionaries of Indian freedom struggle (Bhagat Singh and Co) represent the righteousness and courage of the past and they seep into the five modern day characters who are jolted from their lackadaisical and somnolent day to day existence. Fate brings few college friends into contact with Sue a young penniless documentary film maker who cannot afford professional actors. The sacrifices and tribulations of the freedom fighters does leave a mark some where deep within the consciousness of the five friends. All it takes is a horrendous tragedy which then makes them take steps never contemplated before. <br/><br/>The focus is on the moral awakening, the call for justice and not on the consequences of the drastic actions of the youth while attempting to make corrupt politicians and businessmen pay for their deeds. Aamir is magnetic and powerful in his role as events transform him from a college vagabond fearing reality of life and seeking solace in the four walls of a university to someone gripped by painful awakening of conscience. <br/><br/>Each and every character (Siddharth, Soha, Madhavan, Atul, Sharman) essay their roles with consummate ease. The background score and cinematography is indicative of the new breed of technicians in Bollywood, slick and effective. The end is not pleasing to the mind or eye and is disproportionately brief but then one suspects that the director never wanted the end to be the fulcrum or highlight. It is in the narrative of the lives of the youth from pre to post a tragedy that remains as the food for thought. A very nice movie, well intentioned, and truly aimed at what the byline says "" A generation awakens"". Much needed for a nation which is showing clear signs of awakening. <br/><br/>To pick faults would be to talk about script losing its tautness somewhere in between halfway and end, one song too many, a shallow probe into the malaise called corruption in Indian social and political setting. But then we all know the tumour exists, what is genuinely needed is a courage to pluck it out each and every time to prevent it from raising its head. <br/><br/>The film I believe is in that respect will for sure strike a chord in the youth across the nation."

","What can one expect when artists of high caliber work together and try to make something unconventional? It has been seen in the past that they usually falter (according to the box-office)! Take for instance movies ahead of their times such AKS! The movie was brilliantly made ... technically sound and with a well said story. Yet it seemed indigestible most of the viewers! Going into the theater to watch Rang De Basanti (RDB), did not create doubts in my mind that it would be unconventional, yet for some reason I had this urge to measure it against Dil Chahta Hai (being a very commercial film -- But 6.5/10); perhaps due to the campus life stressed on by the promotions. Once the ride began, I was in splits by the time the movie had an interval. Sharman Joshi (Godmother, Style) being the naturally comic maestro, was the source of this and well supported by Aamir Khan (Lagaan) in the department. Serious sentiments were stimulated by Atul Kulkarni (Page 3) and Kunal Kapoor (Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities) once in a while (Hindu Kulkarni disliking the Muslim Kapoor). Alice Patton should be proud of her excellent dialog delivery in Hindi (fine acting too) ... Soha Ali Khan (Antar Mahal) was apt till the interval but quite an actress in the later parts. Siddharth (Boys) was the perfect actor cast as the carefree and aimless son of an official military dealer, Anupam Kher(Saraansh, Maine Gandhi ko Nahin Maara) who just wants to leave the country because of the going-ons in this day and age (read ""the system"").<br/><br/>Post-interval the movie deflects into a totally different direction due to R. Madhavan's (Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein) death and the subsequent events that unfold! Aamir Khan touches the audience with the sentiments and with the brilliant mix of humor thrown in here and there. In fact since all the actors were so good I would like to elaborate, but it would be a waste of space ;) Overall, RDB is very well made. Youngsters can identify themselves here and so can those who have delved deep into corruption. In fact the movie has the power to make people have second thoughts to induce/accept illegality. Finally, the movie has a very unconventional ending; the sort I was hoping for. I was not sure how the campus culture could be shown gelling in with the 'Indian struggle for Independence story', but to my surprise, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra (AKS) pulls it off, in a grand style!! Hats off mate! Easily one of my top ten favorite Hindi movies. I give it an 8/10."

To show Bhagat Singh, and Chandrashekhar Azad, and Sukhdeo again was not required at all! What was the director thinking? Was he planning to make this movie for kids? Well, even kids could've understood without this display. And the dialogs were, to put it bluntly, poorly written. Nowhere could I relate to the movie in any way, and it seemed as if the group was 'acting', as opposed to movies like Dil Chahta Hai, where the conversations seemed more 'real'.<br/><br/>Very nice songs, and decent cinematography.

Each and everyone did well with their roles. Those who stand out are Alice Patton, Atul Kulkarni, Siddharth, Sharman Joshi, Aamir Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman (in spite of having a tiny part). Even though Aamir Khan is a superstar in India, his role was just as important as the other's (unlike his previous movie, Fanaa).

"Sophocles","6","5","15","3 February 2006"," A passionate film that ends up being merely noise and racket
","Given the kind of response Rang De Basanti has got, one dissenting review is probably going to make no dent on the mass of celebratory reviews here and all over the internet. But then the itself movie is about rebellion, so here goes..<br/><br/>With an amazing amount of hype surrounding it, the best mainstream actor in the country at its helm and an immensely evocative tag line - ""a generation awakens"", Rang De Basanti had to be one of the best Hindi movies in recent times. However, I came out of the cinema hall disappointed. First off, the movie's politics is way too simplistic and is marked by Bollywood's characteristic lack of interest in the complexities of how the State functions. If you believe the movie, each politician is a devil whose evil deeds permeate every nook and corner of the country. The government has never done anything good and it'll always remain the same (unless you assassinate one of the big devils). So, while the movie deserves credit for criticizing fundamentalists and hate mongers, it seems to be going on a chauvinistic trip of its own. The problem with Rang De Basanti is not that it points out that things are going wrong with our country. The same story with all its action and melodrama could have been used to effectively portray the urgency of change. The problem is with impression it creates - simplistic and over the top, reminiscent of the mind of a lynch mob.<br/><br/>Then, the movie lacks what one can best call ""personal moments"". This is a movie about a group of people and finally about the whole country. Individuals don't have much of a place in it. The few moments where they do take a precedence add soul to the movie, such as Laxman's recitation of Ram Prasad Bismil's ""sarfaroshi ki tamanna"" or Waheeda Rahman's mourning over her son's death. Even if one is disenchanted by the course of action the protagonists adopt, one could have been made to identify with and care about what happens to them. But unlike the thoughtful and mature characterisations of Dil Chahta Hai, here the writers show a propensity towards the outer world rather than the inner.<br/><br/>On the bright side, A R Rahman has composed a dazzling soundtrack with some unique and earthy lyrics by Prasoon Joshi (though all the songs heavily edited in the movie). The director and cinematographer seem to be having a lot of fun with the robust and trance-like portrayal of the gang's antics in and around Delhi. The movie exudes a young and restless aura. As one reviewer puts it, this is Rakeysh Mehra's ode to Delhi. The actors mostly do a fair job, with Aamir Khan and Atul Kulkarni coming up with the best performances. Kulkarni surely has a knack to play the passionate Hindutva fundamentalist rather well, this performance reminding one of his chilling portrayal of Savarkar in Hey Ram.<br/><br/>With some subtlety, Rang De Basanti could have been path-breaking and transformative. But it fails. Even among those who loved the movie (and that surely includes a lot of people), how many will care to add their bit to the nation and how many have returned to their private dreams where the only reaction to the country's affairs is one of cynicism? How many of them will even care to vote? Oh no, I forgot that voting won't do and what we need is an assassination followed by a radio confession, just before the devil's henchmen arrive to snuff your life out.<br/><br/>So for those who prefer their idealism without the naiveté and the theatrics, steer clear of Rang De Basanti. There are always movies such as Dhoop and Saransh..."

","Amir khan is a fine actor but not only him, every actor in the movie has done justice to their character. Even after it being an awesome movie I think that there were a few drawbacks. There was absolutely no need to kill them in the end. Just because Bhagat Singh and his friends died for this country, you don't have to necessarily die. You can live and still do a lot of things for your country. If you give a message to the youngsters in your country, that you have to die and sacrifice your life to open other peoples eyes, it will be a wrong message. Then they will never think about bringing any changes, cause no one wants to die. I would have liked the movie better if they would have altered the end.

And mainly the whole overjoy dominating the first half.<br/><br/>It is understandable that the contrast makes the suggestion stronger.<br/><br/>May be this is the only way an Indian can suggest an idea?! :)) Or may be this is just how life happens in India - with constant contrasts...<br/><br/>What am I saying?!

","Aamir Khan is my all time favourite actor.His movies are kind of festive seasons for me.He was returning to silver screen after a hiatus of almost 4 years.And obviously my excitement and expectations were both sky high.I,like always wait for his movies with bated breath.The movie released on republic day.I saw it.Superb,Immaculate,Exemplary and what not...Well movies kind of RDB are once in a lifetime experience and missing it is not less then a sin.The more i see it the more i love it.It really is a thinking viewer's movie. It will touch you to the core.It has now become my all time favourite movie.Well,i have too many things to say but then too less too, about this heart wiggling masterpiece.The transformation of fun loving college guys to the rebellious freaks avenging for their friend's sacrificed death against the administration has been fantabulous. Aamir Khan as DJ played his role with perfection.It has only enhanced my love and respect for him.Other actors should not be deprived of their credit especially siddharth and sharman were terrific.Now,director did full justice to the the movie by not over-or-under doing anything.The contrast screenplay maintained throughout the movie was the main highlight.He has taken really best out of each actor.Ending was quite throat lumping but then ""Good"" movies have to have such things .Music has also complimented screenplay very well.Background score is extra ordinary and the song Luka Chuppi touches the soul.All in all best movie to come out of bollywood till now.The movie will take bollywood to next level....hopefully....bestest,super extra ordinary,brilliant,........and......"

","Aamir- A perfectionist again with perfection.. It is a movie which one will never feel bore to see no matter how many times he/she has seen it . Simply amazing performances by all. The whole movie is a mixture of comedy, love, friendship, thrill, and patriotism.The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It made a genuine structure of our system and its corruption. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it. The mapping of 1940's freedom fighters with the youth of 20th century will be a treat to your eyes.<br/><br/>
The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever.<br/><br/>Here are few unforgettable quotes from the film -<br/><br/>**** Koi bhi Desh perfect nahi hota.. use perfect banana padta hai
**** Ab bhi jiska khoon na khaula khoon nahi woh paani hai.. Jo Desh ke kaam na aaye woh bekar jawani hai
**** Zindagi jeene ke bas do hi tarike hai.. Ek, jo ho raha hai hone do, bardasht karte jao ya fir zimmedari uthao use badalne ki<br/><br/>

","The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye o pener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits."

","A British documentary filmmaker gets denied her funding at the last minute. But she has already sacrificed so much for the film, believing strongly in it. It is after all based on a story left to her by her grandfather. So she packs her bags and travels to India to film the documentary even without the help of her studio. There she recruits a bunch of college students to play the key parts and slowly introduces them to the history of their own country, which they have so far dismissed as corrupted and beyond salvation.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film the most is how it juggles its storytelling. We see the young rebels fighting for India's freedom, so in essence the film jumps between two timelines. But it's all channeled through the documentary. The college students play the characters and we're every now and then reminded that this is indeed a film. Which ties it all together very nicely.<br/><br/>The acting is also topnotch. Aamir Khan is as great as always, but all the rest of the main actors are also superb, and varied in the characters they're portraying. This film speaks strongly for an inclusive and all-encompassing India, and it does it well.<br/><br/>I was also surprised by the direction the plot takes. I cannot really speak about it without spoiling it, but suffice to say that the film takes a rather dramatic and even dark turn near the end of the second act. And it's a better film for it. Sure, there will be people that won't like it, believing that the film glorifies this kind of action, but I don't think the film makers intended it that way.<br/><br/>Strong film and one of the better Hindi movies I've seen so far."

","I rode down to Innovative at Marthahalli to watch 'Rang de basanti' along with Ashwanth. There have been an overwhelming shouts and cheers for this movie. Every critic has rated the movie very high, scoring high points. Adding to my interest, I came to know that movie is by producers of 'Lock stock and 2 smoking barrels'. But movie appears fractured on various ends, first script and other balancing the masala. In fact movie is so so crappy at its climax which has been highly praised in the media.<br/><br/>Story of the movie swings around a bunch of University goers, picked by a British film producer, Su, who wants to make a movie on India's Independence struggle. Apparently, Su's grandpa, John Mackinley, was Jailer of the same jail where Bhagat Singh and crew were held captive. So, the itch in her cooze, provoked by her Grandpa's diary, brings her down to India. First half of the movie is quite funny, filled with funny one-liners from Amir and the gang. Story takes turn when these guys get serious about the country during the film-making, soon followed by demise of Madhvan in a MIG crash. Finally guys decide to take law in their hands and assassinate the corrupt defense minister. But things turn out bad as the killing provokes sympathy for defense minister. So guys take over the All India Radio and announce it, saying that the defense minister was corrupt and whatever we've done is right and bla bla blah...<br/><br/>That's how the movie ends. No Deja vu's just the same repeated formula with a new flavor. I am happy that I saved 400 bucks which I could have spent over additionally, if I had gone to watch it in PVR-Gold Class :). During the movie, I got SMS from Hiru, after I told him that I am watching this movie, asking that 'You are watching a Hindi movie. Is everything aiight?'. Perhaps something wasn't."
"kammaz","3","6","20","11 February 2006"," Disappointing... doesn't achieve the desired purpose
","There's been a bit too much hype about this movie. After all the publicity that the movie received, one would have expected it to be at least worth sitting through. Sadly, that's something that this film is definitely not worthy of. I admit that it attempts to raise some very crucial issues. The issues regarding the mindless frivolity that the college-going generation is apparently immersed in, the virtual ignorance of India's history (at least a superficial knowledge of the martyrdom of heroes who sought to win freedom for the country), questions of corruption at the highest levels ... The movie could and indeed should have explored these issues in a more effective way. Instead of appealing to innate sensitivity and intellect of the public, it sinks to the level of utter inanity! The scenes of choosing a cast for the documentary could have been edited a lot more drastically. All that it achieves is to lengthen the duration of the film. AND it's not even remotely funny!! As a matter of fact, the film could just as well have started off at the point where it does, after the intermission! I had read somewhere that the film takes a critical look at the corruption in the Defence Services, that lead to the MIG disasters. But that issue seems to have been overshadowed by a lot of other trivial matters... matters that apparently lead up to the ultimate climax, but are nonetheless merely pathetic exercises in trying to drag the film to a full feature length of a certain number of hours. The problem is not explored in a way that would have made it really hard-hitting. As a matter of fact, the film fails to bring the point across effectively. Rather a damp squib, if ever there was one!! What was surprising was that I didn't see too many people even discussing what they'd just seen, as they emerged from the cinema hall. Instead of this apathy, which is the best that the film has managed to achieve, what it could have done was to really shake up the dormant masses and set them thinking about what they'd just seen. The film isn't thought-provoking or in the least bit convincing in the way that it should have been. The musical score is also disappointing. None of the songs have any lasting appeal or recall quality. The denouement is meant to shock the public but the effort falls flat. All in all, I think that the movie could have done with a lot more vigorous editing and could have done away with most of the utterly pointless baggage that it has been burdened with. In conclusion, I'd like to say ... if you haven't seen the film ... DON'T!!! You'll be wasting your hard-earned money if you do!!"

","(Contains traces of the climax. Read only if you have watched the movie)<br/><br/>When I saw the trailers of Rang de Basanti on TV, a particular scene appealed to me. Four men exuding so much freedom, running about like they give a damn to anybody else in the world. They looked free, they looked happy, they looked like they were filled with all the exuberance of youth . They looked true. And I decided to watch the movie. I wasn't disappointed. The four friends were just what I thought they'd be  friends who lived for each other. Friends who died for each other. Friends who thought the world about each other. Friends who remained true not just to each other but to their dear pal who died fighting a lonely battle. I should actually be saying five friends as the four are joined by the person who probably ridiculed their friendship the most. But remained with them till the end. Rang de Basanti is a beautiful movie. Beautiful from the start to the finish. The characters are convincing. Each one has celebrated life and patriotism in his own true way. Alice Patten as Sue touches your heart with her sincere desire to live her grandfather's dream. Soha (Sonia) looks very endearing and innocent and is loved by all. Her friends dote on her. Kunal Kapoor as Aslam is more serious than the rest but believes in his share of fun despite protests from home. Athul Kulkarni is irreplaceable as Lakshman Pandey. Aamir Khan's Dijje (as pronounced by mum Mitro) stands tall and true specially when he starts realising Sue's dream and slowly falls in love with her. But the people who I found most endearing were Siddhart (Karan) and Sharmaan (Sukhi). Sukhi is adorable. He's like this joker of the group. He tries his best to make his friends laugh when they feel low. His famous last words that he's still a virgin will surely make u smile despite yr moistened eyes. Siddharth was fabulous. He looks like your boy next door and smiles at every joke with that coy boyish smile. But chances are, you will fall in love with Karan and adore him till the end.<br/><br/>Rang de Basanti has fun and seriousness beautifully superimposing each other. The boys are boys in their mirthful world- drinking, dancing and generally making merry- but mature convincingly into fuming, outraged patriots. And when they die, they are smiling, holding on to each other and being proud of what they did for their friend, their country. They become one in spirit with their martyrs who had gone to the grave not in silence, not screaming but with a proud and triumphant smile on their faces."

","All of my life, i have heard people accusing Bollywood of not experimenting. They say Indian movies are very much dreamy. Well, the time has come for those people to sit up and take notice. The story of this movie is not normal and at least it is not mushy mushy. It deals with the hard facts of lives of normal Indians. Unemployment, corrupted politicians and rusted system, frustrated youth in the state of indecision and their aspiration to make it big (and they do not know what is that they want), everything has been taken up and dealt with honesty. The movie inspires and speaks loudly of the fact that is does not help to complain. Stand up, take your stand in what you believe is right and then do it the way you want it. It does not matter if people do not agree with you. The movie takes help of a story from India's freedom struggle and makes it center theme and actually draws a striking similarity between the two periods. Although, you may want to say that the violent way adapted by the characters in the movie is not right, but as i have always believed the question of being right or wrong is always subjective. Aamir Khan again stands out but does not steal limelight from others. Every one does his/her bit in the movie. The movie rocks. Do watch it. The most impressive line from Movie: ""I have always believed there were two kinds of men. Those who go to their death screaming and those who go in silence. And then i met the third kind""."

","I was blown away by how well the film blends India's past with its present. It seamlessly portrayed this transition while highlighting stark similarities between the two eras.<br/><br/>Much like the protagonists of the film, I have more than once lamented about the condition of my country, been cynical towards issues like poverty, corruption and a population that's bursting at it's seams, to name a few. But what have I done to bring about positive change? Unfortunately, next to nothing.<br/><br/>Anyhow, my point is, this film conveyed its message loud and clear. It showcased an encouraging story that could very well veer today's youth to get into politics, administrative services, the government and facilitate India's development. As one of the dialogues in the film went, ""no country is perfect, it needs to be made perfect."" It made me want to do something constructive and not just sit there and be a silent spectator to its decay. It showed me that I could make a difference if I wanted to and that it is only a matter of accepting responsibility and acting upon my plans.<br/><br/>An intelligent storyline, superb performances by everyone, brilliant cinematography, outstanding dialogues and splendid music to boot, make this one of the best Indian (Bollywood) movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Brilliant, once-in-a-decade, inspiring movie.

","'Rang De Basanti' is an absolutely brilliant flick. Kudos to Prakash Mehra on his sensational directorial debut. With brilliant performances by the entire cast, scintillating cinematography, a brilliant musical score by A. R. Rahman, this inspiring movie about a bunch of carefree university students is a complete winner from the word go. The film deals with some quintessential issues that affect India. It's heart-warming to see on screen a portrayal of those issues that as Indians, we feel strongly about. <br/><br/>There are two or three moments in the movie where you can't help but get emotional and you feel the tears well up. That is the mark of a well-made movie. There's zilch melodrama - an affliction for most Bollywood films. <br/><br/>'Rang De Basanti' may not go down well with the 'masses' of India for the same reasons that 'Swades' was a flop - it's a film with a message. But for those who think, here's a movie that is entertaining as well as inspirational. <br/><br/>A must-watch. I am going to watch it again in fact!"

","Welcome to 21 century Indian Cinema.. aka Bollywood,<br/><br/>Rakesh mehra's 'rang de basanti' is different. Its 'patriotic' and 'cool' at the same time. Something very hard to see nowadays since most bollywood directors don't experiment enough. Rang de basanti makes you feel patriotic in a way you have never felt before...<br/><br/>The story starts off with Sue (Alice Patten) quitting her job and coming to India to make a documentary on the Indian Freedom Struggle during the 1920's. To find the perfect cast for her documentary helping her is Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). <br/><br/>After a lot of bad auditions Sue finally finds her perfect cast. A group of young Delhi University students who have no aim in life.. Leading this group is 'DJ'(Aamir Khan) who turns in an excellent performance yet again. The first half of the movie shows us how the cast comes about,their lives and their stories. It follows these group of young students visiting different parts of north India for filming the documentary. The picturisation is BRILLIANT 10/10.. From the Gold Temple in Amritsar to the Punjabi Bhangra Group, it all makes you want to be there.. (Very good way to promote Indian Tourism). The first half tells you about Indian History in a way you have never been told before. The movie (first half especially) has this funny 'Delhi' college student comedy feel to it which is excellent because its 'unexplored territory'. Although there are parts where Aamir Khan brings the same brand of humour (ala Dil Chahta Hai), But it still makes you love every bit of the movie. R.Madhavan is a pleasant surprise.He plays Ajay, the patriotic Indian AirForce Pilot who is in love with Sonia(Soha Ali Khan).<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is completely different. It tells us about the well documented 'MiG' Indian airplanes controversy and shows us how an incident in the lives of these young men changes the way they think and feel about their country. The second half is more serious and conveys a very strong message. The reason this movie is so different and so much better than most other patriotic movies is because you don't know what hits you. The subject of the movie is so serious ,that it had to be told in a way so that the audience don't get bored. And you certainly wont get bored watching RANG DE BASANTI. <br/><br/>The ending was surprising and yet necessary. Surprising because it was so different from the first half and Necessary because it makes the story so much more Believable. Aamir Khan is perfect as Dj and the rest of the cast Kunal Kapoor as Aslam ,Sharman Joshi as Sukhi and Atul Kulkarni as Laxman Pandey have all done very good jobs. The surprise packages are Soha Ali Khan and Siddarth who have done a very formidable job considering the talent surrounding them. <br/><br/>All and all this one's definitely worth a watch.. 9/10"

","""The movie Rang De Basanthi is an awesome cult movie. Very moving, beautifully portrayed, a must watch for all, especially the younger generation."" Saying this I could have finished this blog and no one would have opposed my opinion. Then why don't I feel contented about it. What is that inside me, that wants me to go that extra mile and write this blog? Why do I have this inner voice that's screaming that the real adulation and appreciation one can give to this masterpiece, is not just by watching it umpteen times or telling all your friends and relatives to watch it, but by actually implementing the underlying message of the movie, the very essence of national spirit and patriotism that our forefathers once showed in great abundance.. the essence which WE, the present generation seem to have shelved it as something for the history books.. It is more of an introspection. It makes us think, as to how we should actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, ""I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing"". That says it all RDB is a masterpiece.. and I say that not for the classy camera shots, great editing and cinematography, breath-taking music and background score, awe-inspiring performance from all the characters, but for the way Director Rakeysh Mehra had come up with a piece of art which blends moments of Dil Chahta Hai and Mangal Pandey!! The transition from the pre-independence India to the modern multi cultured, cosmopolitan India is a testament to the fact that nothing has changed in both the scenarios except the enemies British in the former while the corrupt 'US' in the latter. The RDB is a journey.. a journey towards truth.. a journey towards justice and self awakening, which the 5 boys and one girl from a Delhi University go through while filming for a documentary. The same guys who were once the merry-makers, the don't-give-a-damn-about-this-bloody-India sort and the ones who consider 'having one leg in their past and another on the future.. but are just pissing at the ""present""!!!; connect to their true identity which are of Indians who are struggling to make a mark because of the wrecked bureaucratic system. It is about how they relive the scenarios they played in the documentary, and the relevance of 'Inkilab Zindabad' even to this day! This movie not just shows the deep self excavated well that we have dug up for ourselves, but also provides the ray of hope.. the silver lining amongst the dark clouds.. the attitudinal change needed by each and every one of us to bring about the true Indian in us. The Indian with a sense of freedom and national pride.<br/><br/>The fact that amazed me the most was that such a hard hitting, in-your-gut movie is such an enjoyable experience. The sublime humor and playfulness among friends makes you feel one amongst them. The relevance of the subject.. the fact that it makes to think once. As the saying goes.. 'There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to give food for thought folks and take some responsibility."

","Pluses: The movie is well directed. I was really hoping that it doesn't turn out to be a disaster like ""Aks"". But Raykesh Omprakash Mehra didn't disappoint me. It has a fresh storyline, good screenplay, fantastic cinematography and efficient editing. The film is technically very good.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast and the fact that most of them are relatively new helps. All performances are commendable. Aamir Khan is good, as expected. Kunal Kapoor and Sharman Joshi are impressive. Soha Ali Khan is surprisingly good. Atul Kulkarni is always efficient so that's no surprise. Alice acts well and speaks great Hindi. The best performance, however, belongs to Siddharth. It is his character that is ""awakened"" by the happenings the most and he is remarkable in his role. Thats good casting at work.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the group has been well-developed. Even the relationships within the group, like the Aamir - Sharman duo and the closeness between Siddharth and Soha have been developed effectively.<br/><br/>The dialogues are different from the normal fare and all the songs are of course superb. The placement of most songs is good too. In fact, ""Rubaroo"" gets the best place a song can ask for in a movie.<br/><br/>The film tries to present the freedom fighters in a new light. Sepia tone, special effects and bike chases make them look very cool.<br/><br/>The film touches a very contemporary issue of MIG accidents.<br/><br/>The movie never gets too dull or boring. Its entertaining throughout. It also has a certain freshness about it.<br/><br/>The message of the movie has been put across well.<br/><br/>Minuses: Aamir Khan looks old. I know he is a great actor (though overrated) but if the director could find so many young actors for other roles, he could have very well found someone to play Aamir's role. Bollywood really needs younger actors.<br/><br/>The mixing of scenes from the freedom struggle with the present scenario works most of the time but not always. Some people in the audi even laughed when the five heroes were shown as freedom fighters just before they enter the AIR.<br/><br/>The Jalianwala Bagh sequence is not effective. Its a little shoddy. Though the satirical replacement of General Dwyer with the Defence Minister as part of a dream is funny.<br/><br/>Even though the songs are good, the film could have done with lesser number of songs."

","Sue, an English film-maker, inspired by the views contained in her grandfather's diary, on the great revolutionaries of the Indian Freedom Movement, decides to make a documentary on the subject. Due to lack of funds, she enlists a carefree bunch of College students to do the parts of the revolutionaries. These young people represent this generation of young Indians, who are disillusioned, pessimistic and hence indifferent to their country's future. But during the course of the shooting of the documentary, they transform, taking inspiration from the characters of the revolutionaries they play in the documentary. Imbibing the spirit of Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and the likes, they slowly awaken from the cynical slumber they'd been in so far. Then when one of them, an Air Force pilot dies in a MiG crash, the consequence of a shady defence deal, they decide it's their time to be revolutionaries. But I will say no more! Go watch it! Great film! *** The acting performances are all great. Aamir is his usual best. Alice Patten speaks good Hindi, and acts even better. The rest of the crew all do their part to convince us of how they're just youth like the rest of us, taking all things lightly, not giving serious thought to their realities and being quite sure that they couldn't do anything to change things. But I'd make special mention of Sidharth in his role as Karan Singhania, who is the most tortured soul among the group, because of his unscrupulous father, and his extreme cynicism in his view of India. He really steals the show. He outshines even Aamir. It seems he's the hero, if you need me to pinpoint one. He's done a convincing portrayal of a troubled young man, who doesn't have much hope for anything, until the last moment when he realises the revolutinary in him.<br/><br/>This movie is a must watch. It's a film with a message though. Where Mani Ratnam with his Yuva failed, Rakesh Mehra, has come trumps with this truly landmark film. The direction is superb and the story truly unique. The screenplay is great, in that it effectively weaves together different themes including, today's indifferent youth who do not care if their nation goes to the dogs, the revolutionaries of the Independence movement, the corruption in politics and how the youth can change things if they did their bit.<br/><br/>One remembers the Bhagat Singh overkill of movies a few years back. All those movies told the stories of the revolutionaries. But they were fairy tales which had no relation to the contemporary youth or India. Their stories were unique to their time, so we thought after seeing those movies. I even used to fancy how it would have been nice if we could be in that generation and have fought like Bhagat Singh did. But I never imagined that a revolution was possible in this era, when we were being ruled by our own elected representatives. But this film shows how the situation is no different.<br/><br/>Of special mention is an exceptional sequence where, the Jallianwala Masacre is shown, and suddenly General Dwyer, the infamous villain, is replaced by the guilty Defence Minister, who orders the police force to fire. Then the Ajay, the fighter pilot is shown walking towards the firing policemen, smiling, and when he gets hit, says something about his jacket getting torn. That's a satirical look at how things haven't changed. A classic sequence indeed.<br/><br/>Having watched the film one realises, that the revolutionary spirit, that is the legacy of our Independece movement, still lives in the youth, and that it only needs to be awakened for the face of India to be changed."

","Just came out of a preview show of Rang De Basanti and have to say, it is one of the best movies I have seen in some time. A fairly predictable storyline treated so beautifully on the editing table, perfect casting, fabulous performances - the whole package was unreal.<br/><br/>The first half started off as a laugh riot with some unexpectedly cool performances from Joshi and Kunal. Siddharth was also amazing, as was the perfectionist Aamir. The best part of the movie is that it doesn't let up in the second half. In fact the twist takes it to another level altogether - leaving me inspired. So tempted to discuss the plot, but won't cos this movie MUST be seen. As for me, I'm watching it again, for sure!"

","Hearing all the praise and glory generated by this movie, I went in hoping to see a quality movie. What i found though was a very ordinary bollywood movie with a naive, almost childish plot development. The concept was promising and it could have been handled in a mature thought provoking way - instead it was reduced to the farce of a bunch of good-for-nothing college students pretending to the legacy of Bhagat Singh and his comrades. Nothing about this movie makes it deserve to have anything to do with the memory of these legendary freedom fighters. To its credit, most people who liked the movie likely came away with do-good, improve-the-situation type of sentiments, but that does not make up for the mediocrity of the whole experience. A more apt title for this movie - 'thodi bhang de basanti'<br/><br/>sanjay."

","I did not any great hopes for Rang De Basani after watching Aamir Khan's recent Mangal Pandey but still i hoped that he would pull a DCH in this movie and pleasantly surprise me. But I think he is too old for these miracles now. He is miscast in his role as DJ a ""young"" guy who has been 5 years out of college and still does not think about what he will do in his life(leave alone assist his mother in the running of the ""Dhaba""). his age shows far too many times in close up shots.. A movie which started on a very good subject but with a very flawed storyline.. There is no struggle for justice through the Legal Means... there is no build up to the final decision they take to justify it (the killing of the defense minister)... I had read a few previews of the movie so i had a fair idea of what was going to happen in the movie and the main story line started in the 2nd half of the 2nd half... the rest of the film is just DJ and his friends goofing around with his friends... Overall this is a highly overrated movie that should only be seen if you have extra money and are up for watching a movie without thinking about it later on."

","The movie starts rather very promisingly, with a very different plot, and brilliant acting - but fails to impress in the later half, especially because of the acts done by the friends'. Though it captivates the confusion of Indian youth properly, it fails to deliver the message. The band is shown to resort to violent means as an act of revenge, which, definitely is in-appropriate in today's context. The director tries to re-tract on this act by a clarification from the actors' towards the end, but who listens? Since the medium is the message, and a movie delivers' a message very strongly, I sincerely hope that the Indian youth don't get the wrong message from the movie! Excellent acting, a different plot (in the first half), but overall a weak storyline. This could definitely have been done better!"

"sandhirflora","6","4","13","4 February 2006"," Strong Colors but not enough to complete picture
","Aamir fans had great expectations (not measuring to Charles dickens level) when Mangal Pandey released and they ultimately got disappointment. Therefore one reason for this film being a runaway hit in its opening days is because of the fact that it matches their expectations though not surpassed them. But so much of unwanted hype and one sided, highly appreciative reviews only gives a distorted view and in the final run will do more harm than good to this otherwise reasonably good but not a great film. A Balanced review and proper analysis is more the need of the hour for this film. Yes, this is definitely best film released so far this year 2006 and might become one of the best for this year but that is not good enough. Since the film overall has more merits than demerits therefore I like to discuss the DEMERITS first. It starts with a dose of pop patriotism. First and foremost, why we always need a Firang for awaking us? Can't we Indians just don't have it in us? Then I would say it is better to be slaves again. A saffron brigade activist Atul Kulkarni whose purpose is to launch a movement against western influence got suddenly bitten by this acting bug, is quite surprising. The subject chosen is right but it gets lost somewhere in the development post interval, and the final product comes across more as a confused product therefore screenplay of post-interval is main culprit here. The result, well, Post interval film goes into heavy jingoism and slogan ism, as if it lost its track, due to weak premise and you get to see an altogether different film. Nowhere and at no point it appears that the reel life of close friends starts affecting them, and they are now an enlightened souls. Therefore, the cause for murder looks more like a revenge for their dead friend and not an act of patriotism. Concept wise this film is closer to Gulzar's ""Maachis"" than to ""Dil Chahta Hai"", and ""The Legend of Bhagat Singh"".as if killing wrong politicians the only solution left then it is shown more effectively in films like Maachis and Hu Tu Tu. Film do have great potential only if it talked about finding a solution and getting youth organized rather than giving them a message of resorting to violence. Why? Let me explain. Killing of a top politician, that too so easily reminds of a bollywood potboiler. As if it is telling that in such big scams just one person is involved? How strange? I am not saying that such killing is entirely wrong but someone should also take the path of judiciary. What a heavy price to pay when we have to loose six, bright, young countrymen for the cost of one corrupt? Sorry I am not agreed. Much worse, after killing Minister, it appears as if our boys wanted to become heroes in the eyes of media and therefore capture a radio station to give a jingoistic speech to the public. That whole act looks absurd and illogical as if they have gone there to commit suicide. Why is there so much Graphic depiction of violence when it is actually not needed? Moreover, sending black cat commandos straightway to kill some amateur terrorists, looks slightly out of place. Come on sir, this film has a class and it is not just for illiterate masses please. Question remains, is killing corrupt people the only way left for the justice to prevail? The issue is not handled with responsibility.<br/><br/>Now the MERITS, and yes they are many. Finally we have a film that did not talk about a boy from privileged class meeting an NRI girl or vice versa and sings songs in Swiss Alps. But we have something else. What a relief! On being called his friend a 'Pakistani"", a non-Muslim stood up to bash the caller, debate between Muslim father-son, the realization by a religious fundamentalist about his party's real intentions and his apologizing to the friend from opposite caste are all such praiseworthy scenes which clearly tells that literates of this generation are definitely not going to carry the baggage of the past religious hatred. Good and perfect casting, great characterization, well-proportionate screen time for all lead actors and everybody acting so well and natural especially this new actor from southern films called Siddharth Narayan, boosted the film's appeal.. . See Aamir's (Daljeet alias DJ) performance from marvelous in the scene when he says-""Achchhe Achchhe DJ pis Gaye"" to mediocre in the scene where he breaks down in front of heroine saying lines such as ""wo bachchi Sonya.."" God.!. We don't need such sad melodrama. Also thankfully and finally a film that has a ""Clean shaved"" Sikh as a protagonist otherwise in our films/media it is assumed that this breed does not exists. After Kisna and Dil Jo Bhi Kahey, if we continue getting talented foreigner actresses as leading ladies then this will surely give our item- hungry, heavy buxom ed , mumbaiya bimbette Heroines a run for their money. Slick and stylish shot taking, without loosing substance, with unconventional camera-work is another winning feature that gives this film a raw, refreshing look and one can make out that this is one film which is straight from Adfilm maker turned Film Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's heart and not just mind. Music- for background and for songs is first rate. The film is packed with style, drama, necessary ingredients and the entertainment value, which is justified in keeping with box office success. The pace is fast with no dull moments. The technical finesse is ample as the picturisation especially of songs reminds you of Film Yuwa. I still considers films like Khamosh Paani (2003, I call it an Indian film), Maqbool(2004) or Iqbal (2005) as the classics of modern times and not this one. But yes, film has its share of merits and therefore it deserves to be a hit, finally."
"shi120","2","5","18","7 July 2006"," Juvenile NRI Punjabi fantasy
","If the average Bollywood movie gets a 1/10 from me this gets a 2/10 because technically the movie is above average (Indian) and they're trying a theme which is relevant in today's India. However the movie like most other Indian movies is filled with fantasy, poor acting and idiosyncrasies. If you can fast forward the first 60 minutes of the movie it would be a good idea. Nothing really happens. There's the amateur film producer from Uk coming to India with 0 cash and making Mega documentary with settings of pre-independence India. Then as with Lagaan, the white woman falls for the brown Indian guy (a 40+ yr old trying to act like a 21 yr old). Unrealistic sections guys just shouting for the heck of it, a defense minister blaming a soldier who died in action, the take of All India Radio which happens to have just one guard, and many more. The end was really funny, thy just go an kill the defense minister, then get shot themselves while they are live on the radio. As always Amir Khan is the last to die. Amir Khan's forced effort to speak Hindi like a Punjanbi was really cheesy. Half the movie is in English like most of the new Hindi movie, very targeted to the NRI audiences and the Hinglish speaking upper and upper middle class. Another thing that I learnt was that Delhi University has really nice modern suites where the white girl stays. In someways the movie reflects the sad reality of the Indian youth, who have lost touch with reality and am sure will love this movie and will be all pumped up with anger against the Indian system and will do nothing about it!"

Secondly, although it is targeted towards youths no unnecessary themes have been used to sell the movie. Thirdly,It inspires you to do something.

"das-simi","10","3","9","30 January 2006"," great movie!!
","When i go to see an Aamir Khan movie i know i wont come back dejected but this movie exceeded all my expectations. The movie is about a British girl who comes to India to make a movie on Bhagat Singh and his counterparts and she meets a group of youngsters who come across as a bunch of fun loving and irresponsible guys. How the making of the movie changes their lives is the story of the movie. The very honest portrayal of the mindset of the present generation-its dilemmas, apprehensions,ambitions,lifestyle and every other aspect of their lives has been beautifully and sensibly carried out...kudos to the director Rakesh Omprakash Mehra(of Aks fame). The ending of the movie is mind blowing. Aamir Khan as DJ is awesome but it is the supporting cast which is surprisingly refreshing. Kunal Kapoor(as Aslam)is good looking and has a very sensitive character to portray. Sharman Joshi(as Sukhi)has lots of gray areas in his character. Soha Ali Khan (as Sonia)and Madhavan (as Ajay) are convincing and have done ample justice to their roles but the real surprise packets are Sidharth(as Karan) and Alice Patten(as Sue) who carry the movie forward with different shades of emotions in their roles. All in all a must see for everybody irrespective of the generation they belong to.......its not a generation but a nation which awakens."
"umamahankali","10","3","9","30 January 2006"," A must see movie
","I went in to watch the movie with zero expectations and came out totally 'entertained'. Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni were good as expected. Soha Ali Khan , Siddarth and Alice Patten were impressive. The narrative was good. I am a little wary of Kiran Kher being a little too loud at times but she really underplayed it in this movie. I felt Aamir Khan should probably cut down on his college-goer roles although I can't think of many actors who could have pulled off his role that well. Songs are good. 'Roobaroo' is my favorite. And now for the 'take-home message'.The movie makes one sit back and think rather than get carried away with the emotions churned out by the movie. The latter don't last long {usually never longer than the time one spends discussing the movie with friends}. It is definitely a must see movie."
"anthony-371","9","3","9","30 January 2006"," Excellent!
","I went to see this film last night outside New York City. I LOVED IT! The only part of the evening I didn't enjoy was the racial profiling of the ticket collector. A line was forming and I was about 20 minutes early for the movie and asked the ticket collector what movie this line was for, all he said was ""the American movies are over there"" and directed me to the other side of the building. Then I showed him my Rang De Basanti ticket and he said ""it's right here."" And that was it. But I digress.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent. The pace was great, the acting was great, and it was exactly the sort of Bollywood fun I expect every time I see a movie. They were pretty scarce on the song and dance routines though. I was sort of disappointed I took my friend to see this as his first Bollywood movie, it ruined the surprise because it was REALLY good and wasn't cheesy (don't get me wrong, I love the cheese)."
"soniclives","10","3","9","28 January 2006"," The future of India is in the hands of the youth
","To say that I was impressed by ""Rang de.."" would be a gross understatement. It is the kind of movie which makes you sit back, and forces you to do some deep soul searching. And that is the mark of a successful movie.....the kind which makes you think. Themes like corruption, the criminal nexus between nethas and businessmen have been dealt umpteen number of times in Indian cinema. But almost all of them failed to show a realistic solution to the problem. That is where ""Rang de..."" scores. And it was like a hard slap across the face for the political establishment. <br/><br/>The underlying message within the movie is that if today's youth remain cynical and resign themselves to doing nothing about the evils plaguing the society, then no one can save India from falling apart. It is truly a wake-up call. I deeply applaud the courage and conviction of the director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for not shying away from depicting the truth as is, and also for not succumbing to pressures from different quarters in the establishment to modify certain portions of the movie. <br/><br/>The film clearly belongs to the youngsters. Of all the lot, Aamir Khan, Siddarth, Alice Patton and Soha Ali Khan stand out. Aamir Khan is a seasoned actor who played a role some 10-15 years younger to him. But nobody can question the sincerity nor fail to appreciate the sheer brilliance of his performance. South Indian actor Siddarth is a true revelation. With his sober nature completely masking his controlled intensity, this guy has done a fantastic job. Alice Patton is first-rate and her Hindi diction is near flawless. Soha Ali Khan makes you want to believe that great acting skills are inherited with her riveting performance. Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni's characters seem stereotyped, but nevertheless, fit seamlessly into the large scheme of things. <br/><br/>The climax is hard-hitting and in my opinion, the highlight of this movie. Any more talk from my side, I fear would be a spoiler. On the technical front, ARRahman redeems himself for the fiasco of Mangal Pandey, with a stirring score. Cinematography is brilliant; and camera-work is classy, especially the use of tint to show flash-backs. The movie has it's share of flaws. However, it's the mark of a great entertainer that it overcomes it's flaws and etches itself in the memory of the viewer. ""Rang De Basanti"" is a great entertainer. To rephrase a quote from the movie, ""There are movies which make you cry, and there are movies which make you laugh..... and then there is a third kind....movies which make you think"". I fervently appeal to the youth of India to think !"

","Rang de Basanti- A Generation awakens, marks Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's return to direction after a hiatus of nearly five years. As with his earlier venture Aks, Rang de Basanti stands out for its technical brilliance. Yet, this time Mehra also proves that he is an excellent story-teller and brings out magnificent performances from all his actors.<br/><br/>The title Rang de Basanti is inspired from the legendary song of the same name that the Indian Freedom Fighter Bhagat Singh sang, while he and his comrades were being taken to the gallows, way back in 1931. That is essentially what the movie is about, the awakening of the ""MTv"" generation to the problems faced by modern India, just like a generation of young Indians awakened in the 1920s to take proactive measures against a tyrannical imperial rule.<br/><br/>When a young British filmmaker comes to New Delhi to make a documentary about the lives of the Indian Revolutinaries, she is shocked at the apathetic and indifferent attitude of the young India. This generation is consumed by materialism, is cynical to the core, and the sacrifices of their forefathers for the country's freedom seem to matter little to them. Yet deep inside, lies a sense of frustration and helplessness against a system so wrong that little hope exists of correcting it. As she ropes in a bunch of college going youngsters to star in her documentary she realizes how hard her job is going to be. Slowly however, she notices a change in the attitudes of these young students. And one event changes everything.......<br/><br/>Rang de Basanti is filled with poignant moments that truly force the viewer to think. Rang de Basanti is filled with excellent performances, especially that of Aamir Khan. The man is in excellent form and the viewer is awed watching his realistic and convincing performance as the effervescent DJ. The support cast does exceedingly well with stellar performances from Kunal Kapoor, Siddharth and Sharman Joshi. This is a movies that one doesn't come across everyday, and kudos to the makers for attempting a different and refreshing film. Rakeysh Mehra, take a bow, you have made a gem! This movie works all right!!"

So when RDB came out, I was eager to watch it and I must say - I was glad I did (especially on the big screen).<br/><br/>Pros - Well executed, great background score & music, great acting by everyone, excellent camera-work and cinematography (No need for swiss alps or any foreign locales here. India looks amazing. The 'Golden Temple' in Amritsar looks dazzling). The songs are perfectly and seamlessly integrated into the movie and never seem out of place. Others should learn from this. Also, the transition of the five friends from careless beings to serious ones is done brilliantly.<br/><br/>Cons - Seemed a LITTLE bit over the top but even then - its handled neatly. (But thats me, I am a big sucker for happy endings). No other weak points from my side.<br/><br/>All in all - a great future lies ahead for Rakeysh.

Only a belief can make man rise above the ordinary, just as a very good direction and tight editing can make a film rise above and become extraordinary. <br/><br/>To start with the movie is about 5 friends who find the corruption so commonplace and find themselves nothing but pawns into the hands of an overtly corrupted system.It is only by viewing the present through the eyes of the past that they come up with a Solution which lays bare for every one to see the values and power of friendship, courage and love for ones people and country.<br/><br/>The movie no doubt has been one that everyone could identify with and crosses the barriers of language, country or religion.Atlast a movie with heart."

","I watched this movie yesterday night and still cannot get it out of my head. How Rakeysh Mehra takes the viewers on an emotional roller coaster is just amazing. This is one of the most powerful films i have seen in really a long long time. It makes the viewers think and think again. Coming out of the theater i saw mixed reactions from people and i personally feel that the people who really donot feel much for their country may not like the film, but if you are attached even a little bit, this will hit hard.<br/><br/>The ending may not have been liked by many but i feel it was the most powerful climax to the story possible. Only this ending would make the viewer stand up and think about the whole issue.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone was top notch, its rare to come across such movies everyday and feel so proud of a Bollywood movie. Absolutely brilliant effort from Rakeysh and all the actors."

","i am not a movie critic. i am not a professional reviewer. i am not those ""mai ka laal"" types. i am also not the India is my mother types. i have my mother and father and i just watch movies for time pass.<br/><br/>this week's time pass was Rang De Basanti (RDB), Rakesh Mehra's second movie after the over-intelligent Aks.<br/><br/>RDB is a path-breaking movie as far as the concept is concerned. The problem lies in the build-up portions of the movie. You feel you are watching one of those Bhagat Singh movies during the first half, but it is the second half which completely shocks and hits you like a hammer. It makes the film a must watch! Pre-interval portions are realistic, believable, and well shot, though only partly. The campus scenes are genuinely funny, and identifiable. The characters are straight out of life, representing all strata of society, ranging from filthy rich brat to poor Muslim. But it is the script in the first half that just doesn't move. the first half just looks like a documentary about a group of friends and Bhagat Singh. Even the interval point doesn't give rise to any expectations. But you are pleasantly surprised after the interval.<br/><br/>The real story starts 10 minutes into the interval. The last 45 minutes save the film almost entirely. I wont spoil the fun by discussing the story. You have to watch it.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Amir Khan looks a bit old to play a 25-30 year old, but manages to bring smiles and tears with his performances. His lingo and dialogues have been obviously penned keeping him in mind. He shines, but does not overshadows others, which is to the credit of Rakesh. He should keep away from Managal Pandey type roles and stick to such characters. Alice Patten is a revelation. Her Hindi is amazing and her expressions with Hindi dialogues are just perfect. She should be nominated for some award for sure. Obviously she looks very good, yet real. Soha Ali Khan surprises. She is a complete natural in front of the camera, and looks like a typical girl next door with dreams and love in her eyes.<br/><br/>The best performances come from unexpected ones. Sharman Joshi is just awesome and fits his character to T. Kunal Kapoor's rough and brooding looks with his great physique give him a great screen presence and he delivers too. Atul Kulkarni is as expected, good, even though he does not get too many lines to speak. The real scene stealer and best performer is Siddharth from Tamil movies. You just have to see the movie to understand what I mean. He just dominates every sequence hes in. Madhavan has an itsy bitsy role, during which he endears himself to us. His character though, is integral to the movie. Kiron Kher, Waheeda Rehman, Mohan Agashe lend adequate support.<br/><br/>The music rocks, so does the background music. The title song has been imaginatively shot, and stands out. The songs blend quite well with the movie. Roobaroo song at the end is just perfect. Cinematography is top notch, matching any Hollywood movie. Editing is innovative, and enhances the overall impact of the important scenes. The movie is colorful, and carefully differentiates between the current and flashback portions through different hues.<br/><br/>Rakesh Mehra has done a great job, especially in the concept and style department. Screenplay wise, he should have realized the obvious similarities to the Bhagat Singh movies. But the second half proves he is an international caliber director. Give him a complete screenplay, and i bet he can win international acclaim. Though the concept may not be identifiable universally, he should be lauded to present something refreshingly different and completely original. He tackles Hindu-Muslim unity, dirty politics, college life, and creates a great collage of all. The way the central characters develop is very realistic and identifiable. Three cheers Mr. Rakesh Mehra, you rank right up there, and add me to your fan list! When Soha Ali Khan says ""Maar Dalo"" in the second half, your heart echoes her sentiments. Thats where the movie succeeds. It connects with me, and hopefully will connect with everyone. There are some cinematic liberties, but when you leave the theater, you have tears in your eyes, and a mellow heart, with a remembrance of all characters. You have been painted yellow at the end. That sums up Rang De Basanti (Paint It Yellow) Devesh Rampuria, UAE"

","Worth watching!!! Movie just released here in UAE yesterday. When i first heard the name of this particular movie (in production), i thought it was the final installment of the Aamir Khan period film trilogy ;)<br/><br/>But when the news came out about the movie, i thought it was another college/romance/friends/comedy movie.<br/><br/>But surprisingly when i saw it, i had a treat of all the above mentioned elements, college/romance/friends/comedy as well as a feel of watching a period/patriotic movie.<br/><br/>They have blended the old story with the modern Indian situation, it makes us think about the movie, the things our freedom fighters did for our freedom.<br/><br/>The movie has so much youth in it, which the bollywood film fans will definitely like.<br/><br/>Aamir khan does good job in the movie.<br/><br/>Alice Patten is also good, does her part pretty well.<br/><br/>Madhavan has got a special appearance.<br/><br/>Soha Ali khan is okay (i personally don't like her ;) )<br/><br/>The music is great, and it blends well with the storyline, towards the end there are 3 songs (i guess) back to back)..but u don't get bored, coz it moves along with the story.<br/><br/>Nothing much happen other than the friendship/comedy/romance in the first half, but the movie takes a quick phase after the death of Madhavan.<br/><br/>Over all its a nice movie, with some new locations and a good message.<br/><br/>No country is perfect, we should make it perfect!!!<br/><br/>Worth watching."
"Catakiosk","10","3","9","27 January 2006"," A masterstroke!
","This is one of the most powerful commercial movies I have seen in recent memory. It is extremely well made, has an intelligent script that reflects the transition of its characters and comes full circle with an emotionally charged finale. One of the selling points of this film is its ensemble acting effort. It is by no means an Aamir Khan film. Every actor stands out with finely etched out performances and characters. I will not go into the plot, because if you don't have much of an idea about it, the more powerful the impact of the film is. Suffice it to say it is an entertainer with a strong message and top notch production qualities. Enjoy!"
"ranjani-2","9","3","9","27 January 2006"," messages it conveys...
","Change the system!<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti.. is to awaken the youth and steer them into action.<br/><br/>The messages that this film expresses are very clear:<br/><br/>1. It is not about film making, it is a juxtaposition of India 60 years back and today. Are things any different? Any better? Any worse? These are contemplations the film poses to its viewers. 2. Youth is where issues always bank on, only youth can creep in changes, be it good or bad 3. Politicians and political party ideologies are all just for media, campaigning and newspapers. The film indicates a party that campaigns using religion as the ideology is extremely hollow from inside. And how there is no ethics or values in politics. Basically that it is a as good as gambling in Las Vegas! 4. it is a soother for those parents who lost their beloved sons and daughters in MiG crashes, petrol scams, land scams and such manipulations in the administration. 5. Reminds people that life here for us Indians is values at very cheap rates and that the govt doesn't care. 6. For the youth, the message is clear  if we make want a 'free' India, we have to dig out the filth, give our lives, end corruption brutally and form our own transparent govt. 7. ""don't make comments standing in the peripheral"" - is another noteworthy message<br/><br/>I agree with all the above. <br/><br/>As for Lyrics..Prasoon Joshi has done a wonderful job, the actors are fabulous, except for a pitiful act of crying by Soha Ali. Aamir looks good, Sid looks very good, all the rest look wonderful. Its a must watch!"
"niaz_islam","3","2","5","8 August 2018"," Overrated
","This film does not deserve this high rating.<br/><br/>The story was a complete of cliche, as well as it was quite pointless. Main characters took some brash decisions out of nowhere just to make the story complicated. Then the story went crazy from there. If the story was not forced to match with the past story line then it could have been a enjoyable film but abrupt illogical turns of events actually wasted the real potential of the film.<br/><br/>And the camera crew was trying to make the important scenes more interesting by shaking the frames but they over did that. As a result for those vital scenes camerawork was kind of sloppy and unappealing to the eye.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that, It was an average movie. But watching this film will not be a waste of time."
"Seraphion","8","2","5","18 September 2014"," None of the 2-hour-45minute is wasted in this strong movie
","The story opens up very strongly with those kinds of scenes. It continues on to build up its story in a softer tone and quite literally from scratch. It's a surprise for me this movie actually presents two separate conflicts altogether. What's great about this is that the movie has all its significant characters developed deep enough to mean something in the eyes of the viewers. This is very much true that when the second conflict arrives, it doesn't really need much more duration in building up its content's suspense. What I appreciate even more is that unlike other Indian movies this movie sure uses its duration to the maximum point, reducing the duration of the songs up to minimum. Most of the songs even contain some heavy detail scenes, forcing the viewers, especially those on digital media, not to skip the songs. It's also nice that this movie contains a little bit of assorting genres such as a little bit of action, thriller, and of course romance beside all the heavy drama. The acting side is quite a standard Indian piece, but it can hold as it has a great execution of a great story."

","""I always believed there were two kinds of men in this world, men who go to their deaths screaming and men who went to their deaths in silence. Then I met the third kind..."" Those were the first few lines of Rang De Basanti, which is more than just a movie to me. It's a wake up call for anyone who witnesses injustice and just watches. For anyone who wants a change. Ultimately, Rang De Basanti scores due to its innovation. The film does not shy away from being unconventional. Rang De Basanto is a treat to all who love great cinema and to everyone who loves their country.<br/><br/>Sue, a documentary filmmaker from England wants to tell the story of Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionaries. Despite opposing views by her bosses, she goes to India to make the movie. The story of these men is important to Sue because she read it thru her grandfather's words from his diary. Her grandfather, who was a jailer during that era, had very strong opinions of these boys. Sue reaches India and sees her characters through a young group, and then begins a journey, an awakening.<br/><br/>Rakesh Mehra grips you just from the first reel where you see Bhagat Singh's execution about to take place. From beginning to end, one thoroughly enjoys the flick.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti's plot is not really what makes it work. It's the characters the viewer understands, loves and in the end leaves the theater with. It may be an ambitious Sue, the lovable D.J., the intense Karan, the crazy Sukhi or even a character like Pandey who one starts out hating and ends up loving.<br/><br/>The moments are also another thing one leaves with them. The talk about corruption etc is excellent and so real. We all talk about this in our everyday lives and can't help but agree with the talk. The characters are straight out of reality.<br/><br/>There are flaws here, like every movie. The second half does lose steam at times. The biggest problem people had with this movie was the climax, which I thought was also a drawback. I did not hate it but the film could have ended in a different way.<br/><br/>A.R. Rahman's music is first rate and comes at the right time. Thankfully, the songs do not interfere with the narrative here. And they're all brilliant here. Cinematography is international standards here.<br/><br/>The writing is good for the most part. The way the stories of the revolutionaries of the past and the present day group collide is brilliantly written. Dialogues are superb.<br/><br/>Rakesh Mehra's direction is flawless. It kills me to say this, but I don't think he'll make another film like this again.<br/><br/>Now to the performances...but before that, let me say that there is not a hero in this movie...besides the director. What I mean is that everyone's a character here and performed with amazing amount of competence.<br/><br/>Aamir khan lives his role here. Everything is perfect in his performance and one really doesn't expect anything less than that from this fab actor. He's terrific.<br/><br/>Sidhart is a revelation. Kunal Kapoor is first rate. Sharman is lovable. Soha plays her part right. The actress who plays the British filmmaker is outstanding. Kirron Kher is great. Waheeda Rahman is as always. The rest of the cast supports well.<br/><br/>One more performance I'd like to mention is that of Atul Kulkarni. He's just brilliant. The way his character changes, you see it but he does it so subtly and wonderfully. He's one underrated talent.<br/><br/>Overall - Rang De Basanti is not perfect, but I don't think there is a perfect film out there. However, it does force you to think and at the same times gives you a great time."
"rangdetumpy","Null","2","5","14 January 2011"," probably one of the most powerful cinemas of India which created a revolution)
","One of the rare scenario where a film had started a movement. a lot has been said about the film so i will concentrate more on the after effects. India - a country where corruption is sky high and power can even buy you a mother and a whore at the same time it was really commendable to see Indian people getting influenced by the movie to start a movement to give justice to Jessica Lal (who was was shot dead in front of almost 300 stalwarts in the heart land of Delhi by a minister's son). In the RDB way people lit a candle near India Gate and there were thousands of people in the march.The pressure from common man was so strong that government were forced to look into the case which was earlier manipulated by those in the powers..finally justice was given...Now that the power of cinema to start a revolution..that is Rang DE Basanti for you.. Well some friends may not agree with me but i feel we the young India should do the same as done by the character of Siddharth in the movie..Shoot at your father's dick from a point blank range if you find him to be a corrupt politician,businessman,bureaucrat or any stalwart. In this way a new movement can begin.. and coming to the cinema hats off to Rakeysh OmPrakash Mehra for making such a strong comments through his cinema.In a land where staying coward is camouflage with flavors of Non Violence he dared to write a script that shows the spirit of true freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh..and oh boy! in a superb way he interwove the narrative with present youth thus moving the screenplay in a non linear pattern with reflections of past and present. Kudos to whole team of Rang DE Basanti again (a movie which i saw 6 times in the theater only)"

"phoenixarises17","5","4","14","1 March 2006"," Five youths assume the role of their alter egos they are playing in a film on the freedom movement
","There is an unwritten line that every good director of patriotic movies tries hard not to cross, a line that divides cheap, jingoistic patriotism and the real thing. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is aware of this line, but nevertheless crosses it a few times over. The success of the movie is in hiding this cleverly from the viewer, opening him up for the message: Get up, get out and save the Nation. It's my job to point out the obvious: while you are out improving your country, Rakesh and his team are raking in the money. Had the message been subtle and the implications of the story left to the viewer, Rang De Basanti would have been much better. But that subtlety is lost upon Mehra. He has actually worked in the message into the script so much, that it becomes a part of it. He relies on two extraordinary men to carry the movie with him, Aamir Khan and A R Rehman. Apart from the brilliance of the editing, the production and sound design and the cinematography, these are two artists who hold the movie together. Aamir is confident enough to let the other actors steal the best lines and scenes from him and then, with all the mastery of a great showman, pushes the envelope to go one up. The other actors, particularly Atul Kulkarni and Siddharth, seem to have good roles written for them, while Aamir seems to pull his performance from pure ether. His mastery over the Punjabi accent; the scene in which he cries to Sue (Alice Payton) as struggles to eat the first bite of his roti; his snarled, angry, almost evil looking face as he performs an assassination, Aamir, in a just few key scenes that he has, infuses the movie with depth. Rehman is inspired and inspiring. The jingle that begins Sue's journey in India, is repeated in so many hues that by the end of the movie, it has moved from being a soundtrack to its emotional core. Most of the songs are packed in the first half, but with every song the movie seemed to have progressed a little further. But the cuts in between the songs to dialogue are meaningless and lay bare the director's insecurity in filming the songs as, well, just songs. Karan's (Siddharth's) first meeting with his industrialist Dad played by Anupam Kher is scored in such a way that it darkly foretells the fatal end the characters are going to meet with eventually. Mehra cuts back and forth between the two main threads of the story: Sue's attempts at making a film on five Indian revolutionaries, including Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekar Azad, and the second, the film that she creates. The technique of having a film within a film is difficult and Mehra seems to struggle to get it right. The drama of the revolution against Britain is so great that Mehra needlessly shows us too much detail of this. The cursory manner in which the Jallianwallah Bagh Massacre and the ''Simon Go Back'' protest is dealt with is bad enough, but even worse are the silly parallels to contemporary politics. The ensemble is so large, that actors like Om Puri seem to be wasted. Kiron Kher is typecast again. Alice Payton, who turns in an impressive performance as Sue, and Soha Ali Khan are entrusted with bringing a feminine touch to what is otherwise a movie on male bonding. The sound design is too rich and the editing too slick. The different strands have to come together at some point and they do so predictably in an emotion charged climax, beautifully written and enacted. But a little willful suspension of disbelief is needed to digest most of the second half. The scene, among the last few, in which Waheeda Rehman comes back from coma, is perhaps a metaphor for the slumber of corruption and murky politics that the Great Indian State is awakening from. Siddharth plays the archetypal Hindi film hero leaving the more refreshing role to Aamir, who seems to be again in a movie that doesn't on the whole deserve him."

","After the intermission half of the audience was gone. They were right. A story that could have been told in 15 minutes had already wasted approx. 1 and a half hour of their precious time. OK: Corruption is a serious issue, it has to be fought, and the good guys have to stick together regardless what their religious or social background is. Fine. I agree. Something has to happen in India. But how is this message transmitted? The actors are horrible. Permanently overacting. Sylvester Stallone's ugly little Indian cousin and his silly English drama queen make a depressing combination - you would not believe for just one second that girl could direct even a children's play in an east German amateur theater. The scenes are so ... static. The plots are so boring: Surprise, surprise! She speaks Hindi and so he did not know she understood everything he said. Wow. What an intelligent idea. Never heard or seen before.<br/><br/>Why am I so upset? I was amazed the movie had an 8.5 average rating at the IMDb, and I took some friends to watch the movie - They were either bored or they laughed about the silliness of this piece of crap. Being half Indian, I did not enjoy the situation very much. Sorry for my bad English."

The movie was not intriguing enough for me and it was definitely NOT thought provoking. It was like reading a boring editorial in a daily news paper. I have watched better movies.

","The only good part of the movie is the chemistry among the cast. Rest all seems complicated, boring and stretched. Music, direction, dialogs does not help. Confusion gets more while story suddenly keeps switching between 2 periods, pre-independence and current scenario. Though climax is unpredictable, it does not grip you for long. No humour in the film, except a few scenes that too fail to create any humour. People have tried to give it a patriotic fervour and name, but it is surely not a patriotic film. Screenplay is good. Aamir Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor have given a normal performance. Actors seems lost in a few situations. Kirron Kher did well and leaves a mark. Madhavan's episode has been unnecessarily added, and takes the story to a different tangent. Om Puri, Waheeda Rehman and Anupam Kher didn't have much to say. Veteran actor also did justice to her role. English actors have been taken in just to complete the story. The jazzy group is by force put into the shoes of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Rajguru and others. This seems apparent, as there was no other option for the lady-film-maker. Some camera angles and locations are good. But in Aamir Khan movie, one goes majorly for a story, which was surprisingly totally missing in this film. The movie seems too stretched in the end. All put together, added with mental complexity created for a normal viewer, does not make this movie qualify for >1 rating."
"prats_grg","10","3","10","23 March 2006"," It's not Amir..it is Siddharth who leave you stunned with his astounding performance.
","Yes Siddharth completely dominates the movie as we reach the end of the movie it is he who we think about and admire the most .How he evolves in the movie is so good. He is so natural and mind blowing. Sid plays silent speaker in this movie .There are so many things being told through his eyes .In the first half of the movie he leaves you stun on every words he speaks like ""nautanki sala"", ""welcome to India, sue "", ""depressing nonsense"", etc. And in the second half he is the one who turns out to be the true hero. This guy deserves to go sky high. When we speak about this movie I think he is the first thing that we should talk about because he is just simply superb. He is so convincing the dialogue that he gives in the movie are the same that we speak about politics with our friends. Though he speaks less it seems he is the one most concerned about his country .It is Karan's character which provokes us against country's state. He has shown the exact rage seen in the youth of country and obviously his style which kills the girls and makes the boys jealous. What can I say he is simply the best thing in rdb and to the person who's called this overacting I don't think that you know what acting is after watching to many unreal Hindi movies. Though not an Indian I liked the movie because it speaks against corruption and it is the disease that our country is also suffering from so this kind of movies should be watched by the citizen of every country where corruption has overshadowed the government of the country. I think this movie should be a superhit and should celebrate its jubilee. I specially liked the way the movie was made it is something very different then we see in usual Hindi movies and the ending though sad but it is very true that is the exact thing which happens to the people who speak the truth and tries to create a change .This is the only good movie to come out after ""black"". This movie should be remembered till many years to come .Believe it or not now me and my gals have started talking like the character Karan. I think his is the character which enters into the hearts and minds of every youth. Well Amir has also done very good he excels in comic role (as he always does) and even Sharmaan. Kunal is next best thing in rdb he is so natural and his smile which could melt the hearts of many. I don't understand where this guys were when things like Hirthik ,Vivik and Abhisek happened . Soha well is also very good well better then her other movies and she comes under those new actresses who can really act and doesn't care about their looks or their body. But at last it is Sid who completely steals the show. Atul, Alice and Madavan are also good and among the supporting cast it is Kirron who is so admirable in her every entrance in the movie. I hope to see Siddharth and even Kunal in better bollywood movies. I have already watched this movie 3 times (one of my other friend 4) in the hall now waiting for its DVD."

","I really went in this movie with great apprehensions, i expected another one of Aamir Khans egoistical and narcissist movies where the only thing he cares for is himself and everything else be damned. Also a lot of people really loved this movie and I'm not a big fan of others choice for movies, especially the way people are so obsessed with dramas (hell i had a guy tell me this is a film and not a movie whats the difference dumbass!!).<br/><br/>Well....this movie is a drama and it is another egoistical attempt by Aamir to make his version of bhagat singh and make it work where others failed. Yes he does play a 27 year(max) old when there are 1 billion people who know he is over 40, but despite that this movie is great in the first half.<br/><br/>One of the reasons i didn't give this movie a higher rating is that I'm one of those crazy patriotic Indians who believes that India was and is the best country in the world etc etc. and i know i liked this movie much more because of its high dose of patriotism. Also i know this movie may have been meant to target the urban Indian audience who all know English but i don't understand the obsession of using only English titles and credits ill always minus one rating for that only.<br/><br/>That brings us to the worst part of the movie. The end . It was highly stupid predictable and quite irritating and although it couldn't succeed in ruining a damn good movie it tried really hard.<br/><br/>Other than these things the movie is lovely the acting especially from the junior actors is great even the foreigner is not that bad. Special mention should go to The guy from style he is really turning out to be quite a lovable actor.<br/><br/>Go watch this film!!! Jai Hind."
"roysandeep","10","3","10","30 January 2006"," Its an event to remember!
","I will always remember the night of 1/27/2005 for I experienced one of the most wonderful movie to have come from Bollywood. After having listened to the soundtrack of the movie repeatedly over the last few weeks I developed an opinion that the movie would be another version of ""patriotism remixed"" for today's generation to gulp down with pop corn and soda, come out of the theater and continue to crib about what all is wrong with our country. What I experienced was a movie that for once was not ""middle of the path"" and took a stand of its own. Of course people can debate over whether the stand taken is right or wrong but still the fact remains that a point of view was expressed. This is what mainstream cinema is expected to do. To take an intelligent stand and kick start the public debate. It makes you think... to take one of the central themes of the movie - do something, join the army, IAS, police force - and extend it forward to - whatever you do, think that you are doing it to better the country, whether it is working in a large corporation on serving tea in a railway station stall, if we take pride in what we do and do our jobs honestly we can make a material difference. This is what the country needs. Of course I cannot stop raving about the music, the very intelligently funny edge of the movie, the sepia toned bike rides, the beautiful locales, amazing performances by everyone. This is Oscar material."

","Basanti is the latest and perhaps loudest, mouthpiece of 'Stop Whining, India Shining' campaign. When the producer, director, dialog writer, script supervisor, auntie, Bobby, Kakaji, Dikra, Prem, Snookums and the Dhobi (laundryman) all go on Telly to promote their movie, you can rest assured they're going to have their say. After all, they paid for it.<br/><br/>Director Rakesh Sharma, dialog writer Prasoon Joshi, script-man Renzil, and even Aamir all chose to speak about their Hindi film in English in the 'Making of...' show. Why? Even if the interview was in English, why not intersperse with some Hindi! Many bilingual people switch back and forth. The hypocrisy of Bollywood types really stinks. If they felt so strongly about Desh, they could choose to speak in Hindi (or some other language). But never mind, thats a mini Maha-Bhaarat by itself.<br/><br/>The big irony in the story is that the wasted youth depicted here need the help of a young British documentary filmmaker, not only to discover themselves but also the India they've completely forgotten. And in the process these chaps hope to clean up politics, overhaul the system, blah blah, other idealistic nonsense. Neither Aamir-Rakesh nor anyone else at RDB ever heard of Bihar, UP and MP, nor did they bat an eyelid over the purposeless deaths of Satyendra Dubey (age 30, IIT-Kanpur alum, gunned down in UP for whistle-blowing corruption on PM's highway project), or Manjunath Shanmugham (age 27, IIM Lucknow alum, IOC employee, shot dead by Bihar mafia for fighting adulterated petrol racket). Why not focus on such recent events that have shaken the country?<br/><br/>It's a silly plot clearly inspired by ""Swades"" which had a lot of fizz but bombed in theaters. Since then, Bollywood types have been jumping up and down 'Mera Bharat Mahaan' pseudo-nationalistic brigade in hopes of cashing in a fast buck or two. Apart from plot, casting is lousy - how can a 40-year old actor pretend to be college kid? None of the guys looks like youth! Doesn't Bollywood have any young actors? Why cast men past their prime in such roles? Even this director had a compulsion to pack it all in a 3-hour bore-job while devoting the *entire* first half to 'character development'. Please, 3 acts not 3 hours!!<br/><br/>The Defence Minister's assassination is a sheer cop-out and an escapist solution thats not only impractical but ludicrous. But is it the right thing to do, bumping off someone because they're corrupt?<br/><br/>Plus points: Different take on clichéd subject (corruption), masterful presentation, lots of feel-good moments (and scenes), good dialogs.<br/><br/>Minus points: Poor casting (no new faces), weak plot (loose ends), too many songs, average background score."

","I'm not really sure if Mr. Mehra has been successful. I think he almost does an 'Aks' here. In trying to explain that he wants a comparison with the past, he resorts to the most inane and obvious ways of actual super imposition. He did quite a similar thing in 'Aks' where in trying to explain his difficult concept he finally resorts to the obvious. Its time that Mr. Mehra trusts the audience intelligence. Saying that, I really appreciate the conviction and the concepts behind his stories and the acting he is able to extract from his actors. Aamir Khan's crying scene over the death of his friend was extremely natural . I just wish he could continue his first half magic to the second half in the next movie, which I'm sure will be even better. (30 January 2006)"
"braddugg","10","2","6","19 September 2014"," One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.
","One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.<br/><br/>We were 13-14 friends who went to see this in Shiva theatre (dilsukhnagar, hyderabad) on Jan 26th 2006. It was Kranthi, Rutwik, Venkat, Raghuveer, Manthan, Anirudh, Dinackar, Satish among those whom I can recollect. Now, the film began rolling, Kranthi who was next to me said, what movie have we come to, there is Bhagat Singh reading his diary and it was a sepia shot. Before, this I got the CD and was is love with the music of the film, I thought it would be youthful, dreamy and completely joyful. The title too seemed be inapt when I just heard the music. Then the film began on its course and as the watch fell and titles began to roll, we got a glimpse of what we were about to witness in the titles itself. I must say, till this date I have liked no other titles as this one and the background music by A R Rahman, he put al his genius into it. We were all happy then itself. <br/><br/>We got into characters, there was Aslam, DJ, Karan, Sukhi Ram, Laxman Pandey and Ajay and also Sue (Su Kar Mere Mann Ko) all the right chords were touched in casting and we also had the legendray Waheeda Rehman play Ajay's mother and other good actors in the roles of mothers and fathers. The story was about Su coming to India to make a film on our lost and forgotten freedom fighters. Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and others. It was paced as if we are told the whole revoultionary story in the most enaging way possible. Indeed, that is the only way we relate to this, there is a need for freedom in one way, at least the Gandhian way is not working now so let's try the Bhagat Singh way. We may die but yet we shall die happily. <br/><br/>If there is any film that has made me believe in myself more and to fight for what I believe is right, then this is the film. What DJ stood for what he believed in though he could not believe it in the first place. Laxman is a symbol of the uncorrupt youth who are being dragged into partisan politics and being corrupted. Karan is the cool dude who worries about rich gear and not about this country much. Aslam is the poet who has a big heart and a brave vision. I loved them all and thanks to the writer director Rakesh Mehra for bringing them on all alive, not just as friends but as the freedom fighters whom I wish not to forget. Revolution is what I strived for since I saw this, and most of it is exhibited in the office job where I am a warrior of nothing but honesty and truth. I love them both (truth and honesty) and this film did show that to me. <br/><br/>Getting back to the movie, so by the time we were at interval. None of us moved no one grabbed a drink or popcorn, we were in love with what we saying but were thinking and talking where this is going to lead. Raghu said ""Cinematography super"" Rutwik said ""I like Karan"" the film began post interval and all were glued again. When a tragedy struck and when Lukka Chuppi played, I was having tears and just could not imagine that such a beautiful song was written for such great tragedy. A mother has lost her son and Lukka Chuppi is what it is, hide and seek. I feel numbness in my fingers even as I type this now, then we got Khoon Chala, now the time has come to overpower all our politicians, and these guys just tried to do that at the end and what a tragedy has struck them. They became martyrs. The movie ended, we were struck to our seats, Venkat said, now let's leave. We started walking slowly and got onto our bikes and went to Raghuveer's home. From the time we left the theatre till we reached his home and sit in his room, there was silence, I don't' know why and we were all silent I am sure. Raghu said ""You need something"" and our silence broke. This is how vividly I can imagine the whole experience of Jan 26th 006. I just can't forget that. This movie did lot many things to us on that day at least I am sure and I believe most of us still have this feeling at the back of their mind. <br/><br/>I just am so thankful for the makers, the actors and very crew man of this wonderful movie. I can't even rate this, but a 5/5 for what it did. Even 6 years later all is very fresh and am still hopeful of doing something. This was the first DVD I bought for myself and am happy that I did. I just can't let go of this movie. It may not the best in cinematic terms maybe as I have heard a mixed opinion down the years, but the screenplay is just awesome and so the background score and cinematography. The songs, the emotion, the poetry. Go watch all of it and I am sure, most of you will love it again.<br/><br/>I am sorry if this became more of an autobiography than a movie review, but just wanted to share it."

Indian corruption has its own history, since the freedom corruption is ruling India from top to bottom. the unlucky part is we don't get any freedom fighter in this world. this movie, a new idea... awesome...excellent...go watch it...must see for any Indian generation, in India or away, but only for those who pronounce themselves as INDIANS."

","Absolutely original, thought provoking and good movie with the actors doing their job with a great flair. Plus for the movie: Siddharth and Kunal.. these two have shown their mettle. Aamir Khan as usual at his best. Surprise package is Alice Patton. She steals the show in every scene she appears. Special Credits to ARR for fusing the right tunes into the heart of the viewers. The numbers like Rang De Basanti, Paatshala, Roobaroo and Luka Chuppi are absolutely brilliant. ARR in Khalbali is too good. He has put a lot of his heart and soul in it. BGM is exceptionally good in the movie. Madhavan not much as expected.. too much hyped about his presence. Soha AK is a good choice as Sonali... though she could have done much better. Looks like she acted how the director taught her before the scenes. The movie is a bit too long.. ending has been dragged. Could have been better with a shorter and crisper ending. A movie to be viewed and enjoyed. Message is clear and loud: DARE TO SOAR HIGH.. DARE TO CHANGE THINGS."

It is definitely excellent movie but still it is not 10 of 10. Last part i.e. after MIG accident of Ajay and reaction of his friends is just too filmy. It does not happen that way. It is not that easy to do it that way. I know true story about Abhijit Gadgil who lost his life in similar accident, his mother fought single handedly against authority and proved that her son was innocent. So there would have been some reference of this story. By knowing Ran De Basanti is not based on true story it is OK. Best of luck for Amir for next movie.<br/><br/>Sachin Kale"

","I went to this movie with lots of expectations and came back fully satisfied. Laughed, cried and shared every emotion of this brilliant movie..We have been bored to death with extremities of expressing patriotism. But, this movie is the BEST way to express this feeling. <br/><br/>Every actor does justice to his role. Aamir is just stunning as DJ aka Daljit Singh. Siddhaarth ( South Indians would have seen him in a teen-movie BOYZ) just sweeps everyone off their feet with his awesome performance. Credit must go to a super-star like Aamir to permit another actor to hog the limelight so much. Atul Kulkarni, who we all remember for his powerful role as a hindu fanatic in HEY RAAM is equally good here conveying a range of emotions from sheer hatred to sincere realization of truth. Maddy aka Madhavan - There cannot be a better choice than him to play the role he was given.<br/><br/>The binding thread of the whole movie , a Saffie actress Alice. Very sweet-looking girl. Bubbly and energetic in the initial scenes, with emotions flowing with ease in the later part of the movie.<br/><br/>A.R.Rahman proves once again why he is the best in India..Every song takes the movie forward and every song oozed with class. Will not be a complete and fair review if we do not mention Soha Ali khan. Very un-conventional looks.. Some angles she looks like an innocent baby, some angles a hot looking girl..Man, she does an awesome job of subdued acting! If she chooses her roles proper, she is one to look forward..It is no surprise though coming from a family with acting-genes and a brother like Saif.<br/><br/>Do not miss this movie and i will get the DVD whenever it comes out."
"saba2115","9","2","6","15 February 2006"," The Renaissance of Indian Cinema
","I do believe that despite all the rubbish that we have been forced to accept as mainstream Indian cinema, there is a new dawn which will soon turn into a full blown Renaissance, one hopes, and sweep away all the Mallika Sherawats, Imran Hashmis and the entire Karan Johar camp in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, as we drove back from the cinema, my two normally garrullous teenagers were as silent as mice. I share this with you only to indicate that this is what a good movie like Rang De Basanti can do even to young people normally prone to sneering at the nonsensical stuff they see promoted night and day on Zee and Sony.<br/><br/>It is easy to relate to the movie because even though it is fashionable to be bitter and cynical about the state of affairs in one's country,India, there is still within us that little kernel of hope that we, as citizens, as individuals, as Indians, would be able to make a contribution to our nation. If not that then at least dent the pernicious corruption that threatens to demolish all notions of civil society and good governance.<br/><br/>The question is-- how many of us actually have the courage to step out of our comfort zones and take that life threatening step to challenge the all powerful bureaucracy and ageing satanic politicians who continue to rule over a nation that has long outgrown that antedeluvian style of politics?? <br/><br/>The story is set in New Delhi and has a wonderfully brisk screenplay (absolutely sag free)that tells of a motley group of young people, some of them quite easily classifiable as wastrels, (lounging around eating ""dhaba"" food, dancing at midnight on small hillocks of the adjoining Faridabad area, racing each other on motorcycles and cars)suddenly faced with the dilemma--to be or not to be? <br/><br/>So in essence this is what the movie is about :the classical angst of young people of any century, the love hate relationship that we have all had with our parents, the dislike of ageing and outmoded traditions and beliefs and above all to be able to stand out as individuals when it is so easy to get lost in the crowds of an over populated third world country, the slow and gradual identification with their alter egos (freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad)--- all this is what makes Rang De Basanti a great movie.<br/><br/>The superiority of the movie lies in the deftness with which the director proceeds to portray the anguish of the young, even the young idealistic party worker who believes he is so superior to the westernised group of college goers. The freshness of the new actors is like freshly brewed coffee, stirring and stimulating--totally unlike the nauseatingly stereotypical performances of a lot of young actors in films today. Every actor is unique and leaves an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of even the most jaded cinema buff.<br/><br/>The modern day tragic protagonists move through the story with adroitness and one gets a sense of their total immersion in their role. There is none of the artifice and adam's apple bobbing that describes all of Sharoukh Khan's recent portrayals of patriotism.<br/><br/>Even though the subject is noir the colors, the photography and the music are not. In fact, the music is upbeat and uplifting throughout and I do believe that is in keeping with the final message of the movie which is not to say the movie is didactic but that there is definitely a message and it is a positive one. In keeping with the spirit of the movie AR Rehman creates a score that is youthful and energetic and Daler Mehndi's rendition of a particularly popular song is great. It contains all the elements of the spirit of Punjabiat, of the energy and the vigour of that most beautiful part of our country.<br/><br/>What else? Loved it, loved it, loved it.<br/><br/>Amir Khan-- Shobha De should eat her words--the foolish woman called you an over rated actor on Karan Johar's tutti fruity show. You are GREAT-- I have always said this and I am happy to repeat myself. People, go watch the movie-- for God's sake don't miss it."
"skartik_79","8","2","6","9 February 2006"," Rang de- Powerful and disturbing!
","Rang de was bound to be the glory hog of this year at start. AAmir Khan has a niche in this industry and his roles are like a Yardstick. Add Rakyesh Mehra, a budding and energetic director, Rahman(well well hes as Aplus as you can get in bigger projects), and a host of talented people.<br/><br/>Great promos, zingy music, Aamir's new hairdo did create the awareness.<br/><br/>Well most of us have seen the movie by now, they know the story and even those who haven't know what its all about.<br/><br/>My critique, which a few more share too is though Rang de is commendable, it leaves you disturbed. Though it is powerful it is depressing towards the end.<br/><br/>well avoiding the spoilers, I feel that the novelty and characterisation is perfect and rabble rousing.<br/><br/>But for a movie of this genre, if we wish to take the message seriously, i start thinking whats the point??<br/><br/>Does the movie indicate that It is fruitless to be daring and take up arms against injustice iN India? What is the route to follow?<br/><br/>What is the point' to put it simply??<br/><br/>The questions do arise in your mind, it is radical and different, and I find it difficult to say whether i admired the movie or I liked or I accepted. Like/admire I do, But not acceptance wholeheartedly!<br/><br/>The pluses surely are that its mint fresh, A class music and cinematography, inspiring performances by everyone. Interestingly AAmir does not have a very dominating presence, his role is as important as others don.<br/><br/>That does not stop him from being endearing and effective. Ditto for Sidhaarth, Sharman, Atul, Soha, Maddy and Kunal.<br/><br/>The moral still is- Rang de is worth your money, it makes you think not like the silly laugh a thons which serve no purpose.!<br/><br/>_K"
"bindas","8","2","6","12 February 2006"," Absolutely awesome movie ..!!
","Rang De basanti ...!!! wot else can i say. Before i start to say anything about the movie, a little flash back into last year. Mangal Pandey was about to release and i was thrilled to see Aamir back after a long gap. I was damn sure, he can't do anything wrong. But once i came back out of the theatre after watching MP, i was frustrated,angry,upset and felt cheated totally. The movie was a trash and so was Aamir. Clock back today, i went to watch RDB with no expectations at all. I went for the movie just because my friend was a hard core fan of Aamir. Just as i arrived at the theatre i saw a huge crowd outside the theatre. I was telling myself, ""People have been fooled again by the media to come and watch an below average movie (the same hype and reviews that came after Mangal Pandey was released)"". I had not even listened to any of the songs of RDB before coming to the theatre (again it was post mangal pandey effect). So here i was in the theatre without any damn expectations from this movie. The movie started, and the start was not anything spell bounding to enthuse my interest. It started on a damp note, and i was pretty sure this is another Mangal Pandey repackaged and hyped up. Then the change started, from the moment ""Sue and Sonia"" (characters in the movie) are shortlisting actors in Delhi University for their documentary movie. That turned out to be funny and i was laughing. Then the came the generation (or shud i say the life of the movie ..!!) about which the whole movie was about. And by interval i had changed to the extent that to rate the movie as ""Average to above average product"", and by the time the movie finished, i was just awestruck at the funkiness in the music,characters and presentation, that i had never seen a movie like for a long time. In short this movie is just absolutely brilliant ,fantastic and funky (last seen in Dil Chahtha hai). I am giving it ""8"" because we need movies that can better this (which seems unlikely for sometime ..!!) and i want to leave room for that...:-)."
"SoldierOfTheDarkSide","9","2","6","12 February 2006"," Simplistic but strong.
","I've been trying to compose this review in my head ever since I left the movie theater. This is a hard review to write because the words and thoughts don't come, and those that do are disjointed and often at odds with each other.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is the sort of movie that does that though. In viewing and judging this film, we cannot help but take a good hard look at ourselves. Here are the emotions coursing through my system right now; guilt, shame, anger, elation, warmth, happiness. These emotions are conflicting and are at odds with each other.<br/><br/>But this is the sort of movie that will put you at odds with yourself. This is because there is a little bit of all of us in its characters. Thus, we sense that the things they do (or don't), we may well do (or not do). There is a moment, early in the film, where Aamir Khan's character DJ, explains to us that he should have finished college years ago, but he remains there because on campus people know him, he has a name, he has the warmth and affection of his peers. If I leave this place, he says, I'll disappear into the hordes that have gone before me, and I will be and feel as insignificant as them.<br/><br/>At that moment, I sank low into my seat because he reminded me of someone I know... me. If I were (god forbid) to be plucked from the face of this earth right now, I would have to leave with the knowledge that I have done nothing of note and have had no real effect on the lives of anyone around me. More importantly, in 48 hours, I will forget this soul searching and find myself sitting with my friends, laughing about something that makes no difference to anyone's life.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is about a group of characters, all in college, who want nothing out of life. They're adrift in a sea of hedonism and ennui. captured brilliantly by director Rakeysh Mehra. These kids aren't callous; they're only happy-go-lucky and cynical about the state of the nation because according to them ""nothing ever changes"". This cycle of theirs works just fine until they are presented with a situation whose tragedy is all too real, all too grave and all too personal. They find themselves in a position where ""nothing ever changes"" is not a good enough excuse anymore. At first, we sense that they do not understand the gravity of what is happening to them. ""Humme ki ho raha hai?"" says one of the characters in a moment of despair.<br/><br/>This isn't a perfect film. In fact, its far from it. There are some deep flaws but the film is strong enough to work around and in spite of them. The film's politics are simplistic and it paints in broad strokes, but it's still real enough to hit you where it hurts. There are moments of such intense melodrama that they threaten to undo the film, but it is to Mehra's credit that he manages to reel it all in and keep the motor running. This is in no small measure due to the cast, one of the best ensembles I've ever seen in a movie. Their chemistry is perfect. You can't help but feel that if you sat down with this group one evening, you'd hear stories of their experiences as a unit. Atul Kulkarni is brilliant as always, Kunal Kapoor is understated, Sharman Joshi is by turn hilarious and heart-breaking, Soha Ali Khan reminds us whose daughter she is, and Aamir Khan reminds us that yes he may grow his hair and yes he may have a new found media-hunger, but he is still one of the finest actors in the world today. But the film belongs to Siddharth Narayan, in a performance that is always on slow burn, always close to exploding, but never getting there.<br/><br/>Yes, I could easily accuse this film of being dramatic, and its third act of being almost outlandish, and yet I won't. I can forgive the drama because it is all a means to an end, to a strong point that the film-makers are trying to make. They're asking us to take a good, long, look at ourselves. And then they're asking us to do something about what we see when we do.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is that it isn't trying to teach us anything new. It merely reminds us of old things we should never have forgotten in the first place."
"shefali-1","10","2","6","10 February 2006"," For how long will the generation stay awake?
","Rang De Basanti is an awesome film.After a long time our Hindi cinema has come out with a complete entertainer. The film has all the elements of a commercial success and yet is thought provoking.Every aspect of RDB be it acting, direction, cinematography and editing is brilliantly handled. The humour in the film is so real,and situations and sequences are so close to reality as well. The shots of the pre independence era face to face with the present are brilliant. The movie doesn't seem to be stretched or over exaggerated at any point.RDB deals with serious issues like political corruption,religious issues,rich businessmen making money, the death of young air force pilots, the perception about India that todays youth carry in their minds,how politicians influence the youth of India into thinking the way they want them to and makes you question how many did really deserve the Bharat Ratna. What is amazing is that the film brings to light all these issues in a subtle and yet perfectly integrated screen play with a very powerful story line. RDB most certainly touched a chord and did awaken a generation. But fir how long would we youngsters ponder over the issues shown in the film? Would it just remain a brilliant film or would it really burn a fire within the new generation? Re we really ready to give up our life's for our countries problems? do we have it in us? How many of us can be the third kind of people who die for a purpose and do it happily? I want to acknowledge the courage of the entire team of RDB for giving film making its true meaning."

Also, Sue shoots the movie with just 1 small camera in her hand. She shot big scenes like the one on the train during the loot and amir khan (Chandrashekhar Azad) flying off the cliff on a motorbike with just a simple camera and also its difficult to digest that she shoots such big scenes with such ease with all sorts of constraints."

Very contemporaneous. A movie that really makes you think about India. The songs are brilliant and the fact they are not sung by characters but offered as a background at the most appropriate moment is amazing. The title song is superb with the kind of colorful depiction of Punjab.<br/><br/>I went in thinking that this is an Amir Khan movie. Apparently not, the director has developed each of the characters very well. Amir is as usual brilliant. If only he were in Hollywood, I am sure he would have got one Oscar by now. Siddharth was a nice surprise. Kunal Kapoor is handsome as the sensitive yet tough looking guy. Atul Kulkarni is awesome as the hurt nationalist. Sharman Joshi is very nice too. Good sense of timing. Soha is beautiful. She brings to the fore the old beautiful grace of her mother. Her acting is pretty nice too, considering the last I saw her was in a horrible movie, Shaadi No.1.<br/><br/>Mr. Mehra - Take a bow and thank goodness for not introducing Amitabh in a cameo role or whatever and spoil the movie ( as is custom nowadays in Hindi movies)"

It really churns your guts.....and literally forces you to search your ""Indian"" soul...which like Siddharth is eclipsed by the dismal environment where we live but is not yet lost forever!

Almost the entire cast puts its hands up when it comes to delivering the goods for this amazing movie...but for their sheer intensity I feel its Aamir, Siddharth(as Karan) and Alice Patton who stand out! For once Aamir doesn't overshadow the cast but chooses to shine among a galaxy, as one of them!<br/><br/>Hats off, Mr Mehra for making me....Us...realize what is the power of youth and reminding us that for whatever it is...it is still our country! <br/><br/>The only pity....it takes a ""death"" and a ""foreigner"" to awaken a generation in this country of ours!"

","When I got into the theater, I knew will be getting a ride into the beauty and uniqueness of the Mehra and that's what happened. Big applause to his direction. There are very few movies which touch these matters with so much of joy and passion. Finally you see in the movie is what you get! For me any movie is great, if some of the scenes remain in your heart after even coming out of theater. No doubt Aamir is the king of acting and impacting. Although his role was kind of lead in the movie, still he gets very little moments to show his brilliance. Every actor in that matter has shown that they all are hidden gold to be digged by a proper direction. Especially Siddhart, Kunal Kapoor, Soha, Sharman Joshi, Atul and Madahvan. Last but least I want to point out how sweetly Alice Patten had got into that role. Her Hindi is not much of a nautanki. She acted and spoke real zeal for the country. Her role was very inspiring. The cinematography is sublime and screenplay will make you laugh and cry at times. The song sung by Lata is touching and very meaningful. And finally it's great to see an amazingly inspiring, passionate and flawless piece of cinema from a great director. Bollywood should come out with these political and social issues with strong urge to change the mind of all young hearts who can aspire our country to become the way we want. Democracy is not just a concept that needs to dwell in the books and history. It's a forgotten and ignored way on which none want to travel. Movies like this should be made to enlighten the proper destination to the confusion of the world and all Indians! Certainly this movie painted my heart too like others in this reviews.

","I think the movie was done really well. The last one hour though could have been done differently. Until that point it was great, unlike any other Hindi movie. That's probably why I'm giving it an 8. Its still a great movie to watch and from the people i know, i've found just one other that feels the same way about the end.<br/><br/>I think another good thing about the movie is there aren't any song with the hero singing them, they're all background music. Also there are these glimpses into the past which is kinda cool, cause the director has tried to get two similar yet quite different story lines at once."

"karangupta-64712","8","1","2","2 December 2018"," Thought Provoking film.
","The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved. My rating 8/10"

","I'm not say this movie is not good but this movie have same problem with other Aamir Khan movie project such as: ""PK"", ""like stars on earth"" & ""3 idiots"" which is inconsistency of the story. Like this movie have two totally dfferent plot. One is simple plot about bunch of guys friends helping England journalist to create her own movie about young Indian movement during England occupation and other plot is that ruin this movie exactly that about this bunch of guys friend try to overthrow corrupt government and became their character in the movie by killing the minister. Why silly?. Because its totally different thing. If these two plot is breakdown into two movies maybe it will better."
"pushkar_prakash","5","1","2","18 April 2018"," Nice movie ... however its a copy of an amazing movie
","RDB is a good movie, full of what the multiplex going crowd wants. What is in bad taste is that its a copy of a fantastic movie Ankush (Nana Patekar). The performance of the Ankush cast is just mind blowing, you'll have to see it to believe it. The storyline of Ankush is solid and hard hitting. In comparison, RDB is full of formula drama of bollywood. People who have never seen Ankush (and some who have even see it) think RDB is a great movie and not at all a copy of Ankush. The problem with copy cat movies like RDB is that, it kills creativity. Thanks to movies like Newton & Titli , there is still hope in bollywood."
"vijayveshwaran","2","6","34","18 February 2006"," Surprisingly good movie from India
","Indian movies tend to be too pathetic, with unrealistic song and dance sequences; the lead actor killing hundreds of bad guys and politicians. This movie comes as a good escape from such stereotypes.<br/><br/>The current generation of people don't believe in traditional values which has been one of the reason for India's relative underdevelopment. This is very obvious from the nature of the lead characters. The first half motors along, with the lives of a bunch of happy friends, who roam around without any purpose in life. The second part is better where the director shows the confusion in their minds when they hear that one of their friend gets killed in an accident. This confusion leads to vulnerability as they try to find a reason in killing the person responsible for the accident.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie, when the British writer 'Sue' meets the lead characters and the next half hour of movie is poor. Also it seems a bit odd as to how a defense minister can be killed by assassins in bicycle. The ending needs some improvement, and it does not seem believable as to how you can go on air in a national radio station without any moderation.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is good, considering that the average movie coming our of India is of worst quality. But its not as good as the ratings suggests. Hence I have given a rating of just 2, to complement for the biased ratings."
"rushabhgandhi","9","2","7","5 April 2006"," Just the right amount of comedy, flair, wit and depth
","Rang De Basanti is about a group of college boys in a college in Delhi, who live life like everyday is their last. They are trapped in bubble where life could not get better, too afraid to face reality, until a British reporter who wants to make a documentary on Indian freedom fighters comes into their lives and asks them to act in it. A series of events occur that ultimately lead them to experience the rage and anger felt by the characters they act out in the documentary and ultimately become them. <br/><br/>Rakesh Omprakash Mehra does an excellent job at drawing the parallel between the youth of the earlier 20th century and the youth of today by showing the quality they both share; the passion to fight for what they believe in. The movie also criticizes the view that any attempt to improve India's government system is futile, which is shared by many today, and I think it is necessary to challenge this view if the country is to really make progress. Even though this theme is often overused to make any commercial film seem more meaningful, it is not the case with Rang De Basanti where there is a lot of meaningful symbolism used to convey this theme.<br/><br/>In addition, Amir Khan, just as in Dil Chahta Dai, does a great job at acting out a college kid, making the audience laugh at every moment. His accent although, not completely genuine, is nevertheless impressive. Excellent screenplay and A.R. Rahman never letting us down with a great soundtrack."
"slvs_oe","7","2","7","12 February 2006"," Old context presented in a new way
","The context which the director tried to project is same as that of Director Maniratnam's ""Yuva"". But, the director was successful in presenting it in a new context and won accolades for the same. On the whole the movie is good with small weaknesses, which can be neglected. The action by all the actors is good, with credits going to Aamir Khan, Siddharth R. Narayan, Soha Ali Khan and Atul Kulkarni. Other supporting actors did justice to their portions. The movie starts flaccidly and gains momentum to reach peaks with small discrepancies, and finally ends on a note. The movie gives more value to the patrons money and time. Worth watching once."
"alwaysthereforyou","9","2","7","4 February 2006"," .. thats how movies should be..
","A line in the musical ""Bombay Dreams"" reminds me of a frequent dilemma with us Bolly-Holly-woodians - ""Motivating, penetrating, That's how movies could be. Heroes flying, villains dying That's how movies could be"" Should we continue living with happy endings? But there are ""those who want to learn, those who like to think"" ..<br/><br/>I am a firm believer that the optimum lies somewhere in between. But mixtures often turn into worse recipes, as some popular ""khichdi"" mixes from both Bolly and Hollywood have shown. So, here is the first complement for Rang De Basanti, Mr. Director, you have succeeded in giving us just the right mix of the two and the taste is like never before. I will not argue as to whether the climax presented in the movie is stupid/idiotic/brave/fit or perfect. Nor will I say whether it left the audience stirred or nonchalant. All this for a simple reason.. the appreciation of the movie is simply beyond such subjective criterion. Here is how this medium of expression crossed terrestrial movie making -<br/><br/>1) The script. Very Original and fresh.. 2) A thoroughly unbiased view of the society, picking the good and the bad in each 3) Wonderful music.. Rehman vindicates himself after Lagaan .. among the best fits to the scenes I have ever seen in Hindi movies. 4) Lyrics - I had to bring it out separately.. try listening to Luka Chuppi, Roobaroo.. in fact all others again 5) Acting - Talk of a superstar and here is one who never forced himself on the audience(unlike others whose presence diverts your focus from the movie).. consistent acting/dialogs by everyone. 6) For not being afraid to break the ""happy ending"" legacy 7) Good use of the time line and the transitions.. could have kept it a little more subtle though 7) Sheer overall impact !!<br/><br/>In the end, everyone had his/her own share of heroes, villains, motivation, grudges, chance to learn and a chance to hum. More than anything, such movies give bollywood viewers an alternative to dumb superstar blockbusters or the penetrating art movies.. its a genre in its own.. and i would say.. thats how movies should be."

Everyone knows that problems are there, but to get set into a mentality where you just accept things is even bigger problem. In a democracy, people are equally responsible for the condition of the country. I had very less idea about the movie before it got released. When the movie was over, I was really awestruck. A bold, bold movie by the director and amazing performances by everyone. Aamir Khan redeemed himself after the Mangal Pandey - The Sinking (Rising)! Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi, Atul Kulkarni, Soha Ali Khan, and Alice Patten, all share the screen with amazing compatibility and ease. No character tried to overshadow the other, not even Aamir Khan's DJ. The director has done a great job. The comparison between Dyer ordering the firings at Jalian Wala Bagh and our Minister ordering firings against protesters is most well presented. It makes a mark instantly. Dyer did it as his duty to the British Empire. But our ministers do it for their own selfish benefits. There have been many movies based on patriotic pasts of India, but still RDB comes across as a fresh movie. The presentation matters after all. RDB is moving, inspiring, invigorating. After Yuva, Rang De Basanti is another must-see movie for our young generation. Things are not going to change by themselves. We have to make the government, the system more accountable for their actions. At the same time, we have to share the responsibility too. Nothing will come on a platter to us. But if we have to fight for it, then better fight rather than keep accepting things."

","Rang De Basanti ..Take a bow Rakesh Mehra, Aamir Khan, A.R. Rahman & Binod Pradhan (in that order!!!) I usually don't write reviews for many films nowadays yet my appetite for cinema is largely intact, especially for ones that doesn't want to stop only at entertaining, but makes you think and aspires to shape opinions, to alter attitudes. Which is why Maqbool will always get the prime spot on my large DVD collection. Which is why I can watch Swades n number of times and not tire. Now, RDB needs to be celebrated and discussed. No two ways about that. The film is a compelling view, superbly shot and conceptualized with outstanding performances from all lead actors, especially Aamir, Atul Kulkarni and Siddharth. You can't hold a candle to geniuses like Aamir Khan or A.R. Rahman. But more importantly, the film makes a genuine, honest attempt at bridging the ever-widening chasm between our glorious but poorly interpreted history and our dramatically altered present. Check out the line by DJ (one leg on the kal (past), one leg on kal (future) and pissing on aaj-today). The sudden cuts between Chandra Shekhar Azad plotting the Brits' ouster and a good for nothing cool guy 'DJ' (Aamir) balancing a bottle of beer over a cool 'amphitheatre' hangout in today's Delhi gave me goose-bumped hands. I don't think I have ever seen such a breathtakingly seamless transition between two eras, brilliant editing pattern that stays with you long after the movie is over. Music has never been used so powerfully for transition and communicating lead actors feelings to viewers (Khoon Chala at India Gate, Rubaroo in the climax.the list is endless). If we want today's Gen X to show some interest in our rich and proud heritage, clearly RDB is the most potent medium for it, and not dull textbooks and maha-yawn boring history teachers. And certainly not linear, unimaginative, irrelevant cinema like Mangal Pandey or Guddu Dhanoa' Bhagat Singh (Rajkumar Santoshi's was a sincere effort). The violent climax, while being provocative and hard-hitting, makes the viewers feel sad and yearn for the naive and innocent youth who lose control over their actions. As pure cinema, it undoubtedly is a remarkable movie, in genuinely original, one of the greatest films of this decade. Go see it dude, get inspired, get shaken, but please, please don't lose control.<br/><br/>P.S. This film would have been impossible without Aamir, his charisma, star status and exclusivity have ensured a sure shot hit both at the box office and for all awards!! Aamir has once raised his personal bar to new levels, way beyond DCH & Lagaan, despite a minor hiccup in Mangal Pandey. What a performer!"

The music was different and when you see the movie you ll understand why it was required. AR Rehman brings out another new voice from his repertoire.. The actors adapt well to a different accent.. The character of Sukhi is refreshing and Sharmaan Joshi is brilliant at it. But the surprise package of the movie is Alice Patten and her Hindi.. All actors have done justice to their characters as has the director to the script. Personally I think Aamir Khan could have been used a bit more but he is simply brilliant.. But all in all an excellent movie, very different, very enjoyable..

Aamir is simply awesome with its colorful role and an uncouth Punjabi accent and so as each and every character. No wonder this movie will also fail to awaken the unconscious minds of government on any issues but it is successful in making every individual to think at least once that things are certainly not right.

","Intro : Aamir Khan takes the viewer to yet another dimension in Indian films - a dimension where he allows many newcomers to take centre stage rather than an ego driven movie centred solely on him....<br/><br/>The Scenario : The movie is based on a group of close knit friends and some outsiders who eventually come together to work on a common project - a documentary on some of India's freedom fighters. <br/><br/>There is an introduction of these characters, some of their families, social standings, their philosophies etc. The director focuses on these little niggles which are affecting India as a whole today like inter-religious mistrust, corruption, death of idealism etc <br/><br/>Any similarities to Dil Chahta Hai or Ghulam will be quashed very quickly. This movie - as laid back as it may be seen as in the beginning gets serious very soon. Certain events eventually lead to a chain of tragic events and soul searching not only for the characters but also the audience.<br/><br/>Pros A good flashback pre 1947/present day scenarios where we see our characters becoming the embodiments of heroes like C Azaad, Bhagat S etc.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""intellectual stereotyping"" which actually shows the viewers what the mosaic of Indian ethnicities is - in a mature manner, rather than the typical cheap-style many outdated Indian directors use to gather a few laugh at the expense of hurting ethnic/religious sentiments.<br/><br/>One of the highlights which separates this film from mainstream Indian cinema is the absence of song sequences in the 'traditonal sense'. All songs are timed well and in the background. Music score is progressive and entertaining. The title song with its very well choreographed colours of Punjab is the highlight.<br/><br/>Performances by many of the actors are commendable - especially Atul Kulkarni and Sharman Joshi. The tough Hindi spoken by Alice Patton is very appreciative. Aamir in a punjabi first does much better from his coke ad and pulls off another good performance minus any melodrama or domination. <br/><br/>The unpredictability of this movie makes it very welcoming for Indian cinema as a whole.<br/><br/>Cons Perhaps certain events carried out by the members are a bit unrealistic.<br/><br/>Who should watch it? Ideally I'd say everyone but if anyone is looking for anything Aamir has done before with a feel good factor, then this is not for them."

"arjunjk","5","8","52","26 January 2006"," Disappointment.
","The movie drags in the first half without building up the plot. Through out the first half the director shows us the bonding between the five main characters. There's quite a lot of mistakes. Firstly Sue comes to India to make a documentary on Bhagat Singh. But through out the movie one gets the feeling she is making a 'movie', or was it a 'docu-drama'. She is making a movie without any lighting crews or even a single lighting equipment. All that they show is a DV camera. Also one of the flash-back mode ends with the projector being switched off which means they were watching the movie on the projector which they had shot. How come they can have Foley sounds without the movie getting completed or edited? The second half is about how the five characters react to Ajay's(Madhavan) death. Nowhere in the first half does the director tells about the real bonding between Ajay and the five guys except for him being the fiancé of Sonia(Soha Ali Khan) and him appearing in songs. This is quite an important aspect because unless one doesn't feel for Ajay's death how can one get the justification for the events to happen there on. One never knew killing an Indian Defence Minister was as easy as that. Can anyone just pass on the Hajmola. There isn't any clear message from the movie. The director might have intended to make a movie on the lines of Born of 4th of July where how a man takes up the fight against the state when he gets affected by a trauma. Over there the message was clear and precise. Maybe a crippled Madhavan's character would have evoked a more sympathetic feel. Though the film doesn't justifies killing but then it even doesn't give you an alternate solution."

If you think this movie has a lot of merit, you are unconsciously supporting your dependence on EXTERNAL influences AND PERSPECTIVES - (profoundly insecure, in terms of nationalism. WAKE UP.) Anyway, I hate nationalism and I hate India's caste system and that you have the worst distribution of wealth and income in the world. I am not a racist. THAT IS WHY, HOWEVER, THE (PREDOMINANTLY) ""ELITE"" INDIANS WHO WAVE THE FLAG HERE, well, only a minority of you have a decent command of the language and/or deeper aesthetic and/or political understanding. Once again, call me a racist if you will, but it is the (ignorant) elites that I hate, not Indians.<br/><br/>And all that politic diatribe was not at all the very worst thing about this film. It was a TERRIBLE, WAY TOO LONG, film clip. Of the thesis about how this film was wrong, bad, not much more needs to be said than it was an over-glorified, horribly drawn-out, badly made, film clip. And of course, many or most of you have been brainwashed by Bollywood's lack of talent. NOT because it is Indian, but because it is India's Elites, stupid (lazy, pathetic, too much money, little know how) way of keeping the mass of billions, well, stupid and ""happy"", (we all want some opium, huh? Nationalists, from India to the USA want a flag smothered in Opium that they can beat off while passing out to!). The best of Bollywood only reaches the level of the worst of Hollywood, in about 99% of cases, or thereabouts. Again, I am anti North American Imperialism also, but Hollywood does have some very refined, quality film making.

"sufeeguy","5","3","15","20 March 2006"," Good but seriously flawed movie
","OK. I was all excited before I went in to see this movie. I must say I was hugely disappointed. It WAS a good movie, but by no means great or even very good. I think most Indians (like me) liked it because of the relevance of the content and that some patriotic scenes were very well done.<br/><br/>As a movie, and a movie experience - I don't know. I think it was bad in some parts, really good in others, but VERY uneven in pace. Some scenes were tacked on just for the heck of it. E.G. the Golden temple scene had absolutely no context. It just came and went. It was there just because the director wanted to show the golden temple. DJs family lived nowhere near it - and there was no reason to visit it.<br/><br/>That might be nitpicking - but screenplay was awful, for me, because of the following reasons: 1. The parallel between the freedom-fighters and this bunch was flawed. Even as depicted, the freedom fighters acted on their own will, sacrificed their lives willingly to prove a point. This bunch of yuppies died because they were really shot in cold blood for no apparent reason. Which brings me to..<br/><br/>2. Why were they shot? Why were they killed? Who ordered the killings? The leader of the commando force? Why? Who was pulling the strings, since the defense minister and the dad were dead. There were no other characters shown who would do this.<br/><br/>3. What was the point of the modern Ram-Bismil character? Totally unneeded and detracted from the main plot. If anything, he should have been the one showing these guys the path to enlightenment, and not just be a tag-along.<br/><br/>4. Karan's character - I think he did well - but the character - Geez! Why was he on the edge all the time? What was simmering inside him? Why was he antagonistic to his dad in the first scene? None of this was shown or developed or explained. I think a big missed opportunity here. If it was shown that he was simmering because he KNEW his dad was involved - it might have mad it more compelling and heck even sympathize with him.<br/><br/>5. Aslam's character - what was he doing in the movie? Just to have a token Muslim? There were too many statements being made in the movie which ultimately ended up making none.<br/><br/>5. Om Puri was wasted - so was Anupam Kher and Kiron Kher. Chacters are there to move a story forward not just show their acting skills.<br/><br/>6. Most importantly the motivation to change over from third-rate yuppies to motivated killers was non-existent. Yes, their friend was killed - but the story does not even let us empathize with the dead friend in the first place. What was Sukhi's motivation to kill? Aslam's? How could Sonia be so nonchalant as to let her friends kill? All in all..very disappointing. In some ways not much different from some of the third-rate revenge flicks which Dharmender did during his times. Although some performances were brilliant - some scenes were really well done - but the movie didn't work for me. Sorry. :o("

","I'm not really sure if Mr. Mehra has been successful. I think he almost does an 'Aks' here. In trying to explain that he wants a comparison with the past, he resorts to the most inane and obvious ways of actual super imposition. He did quite a similar thing in 'Aks' where in trying to explain his difficult concept he finally resorts to the obvious. Its time that Mr. Mehra trusts the audience intelligence. Saying that, I really appreciate the conviction and the concepts behind his stories and the acting he is able to extract from his actors. Aamir Khan's crying scene over the death of his friend was extremely natural . I just wish he could continue his first half magic to the second half in the next movie, which I'm sure will be even better."
"mmajid-1","6","2","9","22 August 2006"," Well made movie, but loses credibility.
","The movie is well made. Acting is OK, but nothing to write home about. Amir Khan is considered by many to be the ultimate contemporary actor. Unfortunately I find that he tends to overact(I should have used the word ham). If you have seen ""Dil Chahta Hai"", ""Mela"", ""Mann"" and ""Rang De Basanti"" you will understand why I call his performance hackneyed. No variation at all. A bunch of happy-go-lucky youngsters(at 40 Amir is hardly that;middle-aged would be a better description)suddenly become ""terrorists"" because their friend who is an air-force pilot crashes to his death and is unfairly blamed for the crash. These guys don't even take their roles (in the movie being made) seriously. And yet all at once they start behaving like Bhagat Singh and co., shooting down a minister here,a corrupt businessman(for Pete's sake, show me an honest businessman)there.Incidentally the businessman is gunned down by his own son, who happens to be one of Amir's gang.(This is where you start clapping,I suppose,""de tali""). The transformation from carefree, easy-going men to the Grim Reaper is difficult to fathom. I think the film loses credibility here. Bhagat was fighting for his motherland. I don't think you can compare that to the honour lost by a friend through wrong accusation. I wish I had friends like Amir and his merry men."

","(I have not divulged any core information. But, lest I prejudice you with or against the film, I suggest you see the movie first and then read my review.)<br/><br/>This is a different movie. Different in presentation. The content however, is not new. THere have been several movies where the lead character(s) decide(s) not to sit quiet about lack of justice around him. The story writer, I feel, can gain from reading ""Game Theory"", to evolve as an individual himself/herself. Life does not work exactly like this movie. A movie with a similar concept, which I personally like better, is Trishul with Manoj Bajpai and Raveena Tandon.<br/><br/>Direction/Screenplay: Its a good ploy to compare pre-independence youth with the present day ones. However, after a certain point, I feel, the director has started drumming it into the audience that he is trying to compare. It would have been nice if he assumed his audience to be smarter. Subtle hints would have been good enough. Aamir's performance: He does not really stand out this time, though he is surely above mediocre actors of his class. The movie is realistic and all actors have produced the rt kind of emotions. I felt Kunal could have emoted better. Alice Patten clearly stands out in her performance."

Even a superstar like Aamir Khan is not given any special ""footage"". He, and his friends represents the youth of India - who is struggling to build a future for himself, is frustrated by the system, and the inability to do anything about it. The director's idea - though dramatic -is executed so well that you believe that this is easily possible in real life.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Indian culture - the visit to Punjab and the Golden Temple are simply done in a classy manner. The whole serenity, majesty and elegance of the culture is visible without being loud.<br/><br/>One of the things that really impressed me was that the movie depicted our great freedom fighters as figures of inspiration. And this is done without showing a slightest hint of jingoism or any slur or deprecating statement to any foreign country! The message is clear - the fault in the system is our joint responsibility - and we have enough super heroes in our history to look up to.<br/><br/>The direction is great and editing is of highest quality.

In American movies there is much more killing than in 'Rang de Basanti' but I believe the American 'killings' are construed as cool, which is a problem. But not so much a problem as the murders perpetrated in RDB. These murders are portrayed as just, and when we start condoning vigilante justice we are consenting to a degradation of democratic values.

","Not knowing anything about the history of India, I wouldn't know if the story within a story, that is, the sequences being filmed by Sue McKinley (Alice Patten), are historically accurate or not, but the device was an interesting one and served to contrast the difference between the youth of today and those of the 1920's. There comes a disturbing political message as well with the corruption of Indian politicians who line their pockets at the expense of military pilots who die in plane crashes as a result of defective parts. There's an awful lot of stuff being juggled around in the story, and that perhaps is the film's downside, as it takes nearly three hours to tell it's tale, and I found any number of scenes to be superfluous. As in so many Hindi films I've seen, Aamir Khan has a central role, but he didn't seem to stand out as much as in other starring vehicles, like the characters he portrayed in ""Lagaan"" and ""3 Idiots"". Funny, but the actor playing Sukhi (Sharman Joshi) reminded me an awful lot of the American actor Ron Palillo who had the role of Horshack in the Seventies sit-com 'Welcome Back, Kotter', so much so that it was a little distracting. The other thing that was distracting, and maybe because I've conditioned myself to look for it, was the ubiquitous product placement that accompanies most modern films you'll see today. In other words, do you think Coca-Cola had enough representation in the picture?"

Through the diary, she learns about the story of five freedom fighters who were active in the movement: Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru, Ashfaqulla Khan, and Ram Prasad Bismil. McKinley, in his diary, states that he had met two type of people in his life, those who died without uttering a sound and those who died with lots of anguish, crying over their deaths. McKinley reveals that it was then that he met with the third kind — those who die with a smile on their face.<br/><br/>Having decided to make a self-financed documentary film about these revolutionaries, Sue travels to India, with the help of her friend, Sonia (Soha Ali Khan), from the Institute for International Studies at the University of Delhi.

Anyone who think it as a poor or average movie can certainly be discarded from giving his reviews. He just don't have proper life. Those outside the Indian subcontinental region if praise this film, we can be sure that they certainly have the best kind of life.<br/><br/>This movie is a master piece, though may not be the greatest movie art, and is so nicely made that if you understand anything about corruption and sacrifice, if one has any feeling of love and life in his heart, i am sure Rang De Basanti will shiver and vibrate your every sense organ. Amazing cinematography, beautiful dialogues, relation development and music..yes the music is so great that it is just below the line of any best music that can be there from the only masters like Lata Mangeshkar and some few more. Films like this are not to be judged by fools or even by the great movie scholars, the geeks. This movie is the sentiment and suffering of a human in one or the other aspect of life. We suffer due to others often, due to corrupted systems, what goes on in our heart, how we tackle the problem or do we just try to escape from the situation. What efforts do we make to resolve the problem, how honestly we try for it or do we just keep blaming the system, while also pointing that in case our method is wrong, we are ready to accept it. We are the one who makes the system. Our one leg is lying in the future and other leg is lying in the past and thats why we are peeing on the present. Religion, politics, fun, friendship, project and emotions all are projected towards one single event, to rule out corruption or slavery and obtain complete freedom.<br/><br/>I am really shocked that it didn't got any recognition. Pan' Labyrinth won bafta...really?? and no nomination in academy awards...these are the clear indication of the failing of these prestigious awards in recognizing the BEST.

","This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.<br/><br/>The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera- work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience."

","I always feel bad having to admit my ignorance when it comes to Bollywood movies. Try as I might I just don't get most Indian films with the majority that I've seen being far too long, cheesy and badly acted. Yet I do admire the fact they don't try and blindly copy American cinema but still manage to be popular and enjoyed by millions. Rang De Basanti comes with lofty expectations: pick any review on IMDb and it will probably come with ten stars and claims of greatness, and perhaps for an Indian audience these hyperbole-filled comments are fully justified, but for an ignorant outsider such as myself I'm not quite so convinced.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti (translated as Colour it Saffron) is about an English documentary filmmaker attempting to make a film about the 1920s fight for Indian Independence. Utilising university students as actors she discovers they can become just as radicalised as the inspiration for her original story. Whilst it is undoubtedly a film with admirable intent I'm not completely sold on its execution, particularly in its heavy handed final hour. The way it draws parallels between present day and '20s freedom fighters is rather clumsy too although at least it isn't preachy, even if its early lightness of touch doesn't always suit the heavy subject matter that follows.<br/><br/>Given its budget the production values are reasonably high with competent cinematography to match. Performances are a mixed bag but I put that down more to my own struggles with the Bollywood style rather than actual bad acting. Although it is a film about youth and their relationship with corruption and the state it was a bit disappointing that the older and experienced cast members weren't given more to do. As usual the film is at least half an hour too long with intrusive dance numbers that add little. Even A. R. Rahman's score was pretty forgettable too.<br/><br/>I realise this review makes me sound like one of those people who don't watch foreign language films or is ignorant of other cultures and I apologise for that. My New Year's resolution for 2013 will be to try and watch more Bollywood movies."

","This movie was a rather good movie that portrayed the traditionalist/modernist divide among Indians and among the Indian Diaspora well. I liked the message of the movie and how it tried to portray that the deeds and heroism of Bhaghat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and others is not something best committed to the history books but rather a living spirit of rebellion that still has meaning today. It seems people take for granted the heroic deeds of the characters of the independence movement and see little relevance of these people to today's India. This movie shows the continuing relevance of these heroic characters in modern times. I think the assumption of the roles in reality of the 5 college students is a bit unbelievable. I mean just how quickly it happened and how quickly they decided to do what they did seemed to be a bit hasty and go beyond the willing suspension of disbelief a bit, but it was an entertaining movie just the same. Not a 10, or something of unbelievable insight and depth, but a valuable commentary and interesting movie."

","i liked the movie very much. It is very motivating for the youth of India. I think the movie is excellent. It is sending a message that the youth need to do something like what the freedom fighters did during their time to get freedom from the British rule. The youth need to take this message and free the country from corrupt politicians, poverty, illiteracy and third world status. i watched the movie twice and i think that the movie is very meaningful since it sends out some important messages not only to the youth but also to everybody that they need to do something for the country if they want to advance further in this era of intense competition."
"d500","9","1","4","30 April 2006"," a landmark accomplishment
","i am writing this review, some months and RDB's release. I have seen it 2 times and the reason i am writing this review so late is because it is an incredible film.<br/><br/>this landmark film features a story which is completely original. RDB is patriotic without being anti-Pakistan or jingoistic. from that you can discern the originality of the story.<br/><br/>although the execution of the plot is melodramatic, it is justifiable since the theme is one of melodrama. the transition of typical/good for nothing guys into responsible martyrs is incredible. nothing is silly or predictable. there are many scenes which have been executed perfectly, so i cant name one or two.<br/><br/>the performances are exemplary. AMIR KHAN gives a powerful performance but clearly does not overshadow the others. ATUL KULKARNI,KUNAL KAPOOR, SIDDARTH, SHARMAN etc are all very believable and impressive. i reckon one of the newcomers will definitely get the ""best newcomer award"".<br/><br/>in summary RDB is a film that should remain in the minds of Indian youth forever. it is a film that will change the way we know India. the only reason i haven't given it 10/10 is because you feel it is too long in the first half. i think the film could have been trimmed about 15 minutes. but kudos to the director and scriptwriter.<br/><br/>RDB will awaken a moral revolution in India. kudos to the scriptwriter and director. clearly, my favourite Indian movie. it will beat the forthcoming biggies like fanaa, don, kabhi alvida na kehna and get the best film award.<br/><br/>when was the last time you saw a film that touched your soul and made you think differently about something?when was the last time you saw a film which actually motivated you to do something? dB has definitely done that.<br/><br/>thank you all who were part in the making of this film."

","what a movie! way ahead of any I have seen till now. As a college student I could real feel the life in all the characters. Who said Aamir is too old for this role. Look at the energy in his acting. his enthusiasm He looks younger than me (I am 18). After Stephens (Mangal Pandey)its Patten's turn to come in a get a place in our hearts. As the film-maker and DJ's love interest Sue is one attention grabbing young lady. Siddharth, Sharman, Kunal and Soha are fantastic. The veteran group of supporting cast Kiron Kher, Anupam Kher, Waheeda Rehman and Om Puri add to the colors and depth of the movie After Gandhism, Marxism etc now its Bhagatism. LOOSE CONTROL!!!"
"radishbabe19","9","1","4","22 February 2006"," a generation has truly awakened
","The direction was amazing, camera angles were amazing, and of course, the acting was simply amazing. The best part of the movie was how originally, the flashbacks are basically Sue recalling the past and retelling it to the guys. Then, it transitions to where the flashbacks are scenes of the guys are merely acting. And then in the end, they are no longer acting, and this is when the past and present intermix and you no longer know where the past ends and present begins. Karan IS bhagat singh, dj IS chandrashekhar azad. I thought that part of integrating the history into the story was amazing.<br/><br/>Some parts that could have been better: the song right before the intermission, i felt it dragged the story a bit. In the end, i felt they needed to tie the story back to the documentary. they kind of left it hanging. and lastly and most importantly: it was a mistake to show the police just all of a sudden starting violence at the vigil. that would never happen. the police will never start violence like that themselves, especially when it deals with mourning..and innocent people just sitting there...the citizens aren't even like causing violence themselves. i dunno i found it extremely unrealistic and it misportrayed the police a little bit. sure they might be puppets i guess, but it kind of stretched it here.<br/><br/>the end I'm done. those were my two cents.<br/><br/>WATCH THE MOVIE OR U'll REGRET IT!!"

This movie made me realize that as the youth of India, it's our job to take the future of this country in our hands.The acting is superb.I really realized just how talented these actors are after watching this movie.The screenplay, direction and dialog were all excellent.

"keval_singh","10","1","4","17 February 2006"," a gem!
","once again, Aamir Khan shows that he doesn't need star publicity and awards to accentuate his popularity and appeal. it is in fact his versatility as an actor, his intelligent choices that set him apart from the majority of actors in Hindi cinema today. having said that, Rang De Basanti does not only belong to Mr Khan, but to the rest of the cast who excel in their performances (and to all who've shaped the film as we see it). even actors like Waheeda Rahman and Kirron Kher, though sharing a fraction of screen time, essay their roles convincingly and effectively. this begs the question: whoever said you need you need substantial screen time in a film to leave an impression of the character you play? watch this film and you'll know what i mean.<br/><br/>Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti is one of the best films i've seen in recent times. for those who expect a mainstream Hindi film experience, this one may not be for you. still, i recommend it strongly for such a film rarely comes by. the dialogs were ace--sarcastic and funny at times, yet hard-hitting. and judging from how film soundtracks are deemed to be an important part of a film, A R Rahman does not disappoint as he shines once again.<br/><br/>nevertheless, everyone has their opinion about this film and how it has affected them in one way or the other. all i can say is that it is not often a film leaves you feeling fired up; its songs, its scenes, and its message playing on in your head.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is an exception."

","A great movie with some excellent acting by all. Very thought provoking and a wonderful homage to the airmen who have perished due to the MIG disasters that could have been avoided by politicians, but for their callous attitude and lack of feeling for our brave young men who have died. Let's hope the youth will see this picture in great numbers. Besides Aamir Khan, who has once again proved that he is one of India's great actors of all time, the others, though new, have done an excellent job. Alice Patten has performed very professionally and remarkably well. The music is appropriate and does not overshadow events being depicted. Everyone who has been connected with this movie should feel proud to have been associated with it."
"Nama_mikenish","7","1","5","15 August 2009"," excellent movie!!!!!!
","lets see the good things about the film, direction:- top class, the style of speeches and the perfect way and rather different way to tell a story. that is definitely a conduct of a good director. acting::- the best person to act in the best way was Aamir khan of course. plus the hero was Sidharth as well. Sharman Joshi and Kunal Kapoor are also brilliant in the movie. <br/><br/>technically the background score and the original score are also notable by the maestro A.R Rahman. it just never fail to swing your mind with patriotism. <br/><br/>however there are bad things in technicality as well.<br/><br/>first and for most there were goofs in middle which were not much noticed by many. a particular soundtrack which the musician had made did not fit in the screenplay. in simpler words it lacked good sound editing, and for few seconds there was a patriotic theme playing and the other at immediate effect it changed into some painful theme.<br/><br/>there were few(one or two) defects in editing as well. also the screenplay was to be blamed to make short scenes which sometimes increased the pace of the movie making it faster than the rest.<br/><br/>but as a story and acting and direction the movie is one of the best movies Bollywood has made."
"abhatn","9","1","5","11 April 2006"," Brilliant production!
","This movie is at par with ""Les Miserables"" in the modern context. The story telling, performances, editing, music are just excellent. Especially commendable is the morphing between historical and modern theme. To really appreciate it all the viewer has has to think ""out of the box"" as this is not a movie for anyone looking for dance-song run of the mill themes. Overall brilliant. Movies of this stature are not made often, so do see and encourage such productions. The range of music score composed by AR Rahman enhances the emotion of the movie. He truly is a world class musician. Aamir Khan has come a long way from the ""butter faced"" actor in QSQT to RDB. Indian cinema should be proud of him."

Its the movie which strikes all age groups, all cadre of people and all regions of India for diverse reasons.<br/><br/>I am sure Rang De Basanti will be the highest selling movie of this decade. I expect its going to do a business of 5 Billion Indian RUPEES within this year 2006 only and it will win all the awards in all categories in the next film-fare awards ceremony.<br/><br/>The movie is best in all respects. Its patriotic, musical, spreads the idea of nationalism and secularism. A. R. Rahaman is at its best in the music. All the 10 songs of the movie are super hit songs. When the best song of the year nominations will be there the songs of Rang De Basanti will compete with each other only."

It has a whole variety of characters that one can easily relate to, thats what gives this movie a edge over similar movies done in the past. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, but most importantly it makes you think. It touches all the key elements that goes around in Indian youth today. All the actors have given their best performances ever. Aamir Khan's portrayal of DJ(one of the movie character) is the key to the whole movie. Alice Patten steals the heart with her rocking Hindi. The production team is just as amazing as the movie itself. Backgorund score is given by none other than A.R. Rahman. A must watch movies, you can't afford to miss it."
"Wasp007","8","1","5","2 March 2006"," No Catharsis
","For a movie that involves so many emotions,so much of emotional turmoil and so many ups and downs its biggest drawback is that there is no catharsis (emotional release). Plus the message is a lost along the way - take law into your own hands and then get killed brutally, not something I would want in an awake generation.... And it is silly comparing the atrocities committed by the British Govt. - an imperialist power with corrupt politicians who we have ourselves elected or we aspire to be. Another aspect that troubles me is that when film makers make movies, especially in India very little attention is paid to the legal aspects depicted or portrayed. To seriously think that a person broadcasting from a radio station that he/she has killed someone would be attacked by half of India's elite anti-terrorist squads? Enough said."
"itzmylife20","8","1","5","17 February 2006"," A very good attempt by the entire team of Rang De Basanti
","It was a good film! Theconcept was really good but a few scenes were commercialised i.e. they were not required, especially in the 1st half of the film. The direction, editing and the effects (IN short the technical aspects of the film) was great! the whole idea of going back to the pre independence era and coming back to the present situation indicated that history is repeating! (What you give comes back to you)! apart from what has been said, i don't want to repeat it again! However, i wasn't to satisfied with the ending! It was a women's idea (Su to make a documentary film and Soniya to help her) but than no acknowledgment was given to them. the film suddenly became male dominated, in addition to it those guys in the film were not even sure of themselves, of what they want, why they want, they were juz students not really interested in their career! anyways, i really appreciate the idea of thanking each and every person associated with the film by the credits shown in the end.<br/><br/>overall, good film and a very good attempt! great music and art direction all the best!"

I couldn't find any spoilers in the movie... But yeah... there has been a crib by few that the role of bhagat singh could have been played by a more mature actor. Oh!

","This is the movie which touched me. I am not a regular watcher of movie, but its like I have a good taste of it. The movie started with past and ended with future. The present was always related to past to make the audience feel that each moment is related to past. And the tried to communicate many things implicitly.The character played by Siddharth, that attracted me a lot especially confession part. This step taken was to communicate that if we all put up our hands together can really change the ways things done in the country. <br/><br/>The music is awesome with guitar chords shrilling and preaching the hearts of audience, but they missed out in lyrics anyways. But the beats r foot tapping.The dialogues r also in sync with the movie awesome. Everyone acted well upto the expectation, but Soha Ali missed out, couldn't act according to role alloted. It was a role with great weightage but she couldn't depict the same in her performance.<br/><br/>This make the audience realize they r also intelligent.

The plot begins with a British film maker trying to make a film on the lives on young Indian rebels like Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, etc. She comes to India and meets DJ and his friends. They set off on a great note. The first half it total time pass and comedy. Second half serious and some meaningful stuff. Siddharth, Sharman, KK and Atul did very well in their parts. Soha Ali always was good. Maddy looked handsome as ever. His small role was the movie changing part. The music rocks. Just like any other AR Rahman track, it takes time to listen to it and appreciate. It doesn't catch from the word go but when it does, u get addicted. Thumbs up!"
"nskanyal","10","1","5","3 February 2006"," Its a beauty - A must watch movie
","For those who are yet to watch this movie, beware of any pre-conceived notions: First, its not a patriotic movie, but the tagline could not have been better - ""A generation awakens"". Second, this movie is not just being pulled by Aamir Khan i.e. this is just not his movie. It is much more than that; each and every character's role has been justified - a bunch of friends, each with a completely different personality from others. The guys (and gal) who just believe in fun/frolic, most of them are afraid of getting out of their college life cocoon, don't have slightest inkling of the real world, are always the first to complain about the system, and at the same time won't take any responsibility.<br/><br/>Hats off to such a good direction by Rakesh Mehra. The way he has presented the idea of transition of wayward youths to something of today's young krantikari (similar that of 1920's pre-independence India) was simply amazing. Its a novel idea, presented brilliantly. A quite colorful movie with a real life touch. <br/><br/>Few people complained to me its not so realistic, its not so easy to kill defense minister; oh! now come on - give them a break. It could not have been more real for a movie. <br/><br/>Apart from that, ""spontaneous"" dialogues by Prasoon Joshi, presented by Aamir Khan/Sharmaan Joshi were too good. I am really pleased to be able watch such movies from bollywood in my youth, when uptil 5 years ago, it was just that mushy/melodramatic stories. Seriously!! some very good stuff is coming out from the Indian cinema nowadays."
"ashish_dutt","10","1","5","2 February 2006"," DCH continued
","Well there's so much hype around this movie that something was bound to happen. And so it is. Till the intermission what we have essentially is ""Dil Chahta Hai"" ported to Delhi. Acting by protagonists is great. Amir Khan, perfectionist he is, absolutely is like one of Sardar friends in Delhi.<br/><br/>But well, I think the climax is corny as it can get. Yes, the story and idea was OK, but the execution stinks. If the movie had continued the air of realism that it had built up till intermission, I'm sure audiences would have left the cinema halls with a better flavor.<br/><br/>However, overall a must watch for any fan of DCH. Amir Khan as mentioned is smashing. Music is great. And well, let's agree that there's nothing better either on TV of the high screen.<br/><br/>Eminently watchable."
"hippy2981","9","1","5","2 February 2006"," Really nice movie. Worth a watch. Don't miss.
","A really nice movie that mixes up the adolescence of the youth and the dark side of politics with a blend of real-life events (MIG's crashes). It's a movie that makes you laugh for the initial half, turns serious in the next and keeps you thinking for a while once you are out of it. A different bollywood movie that maintains its originality. For a change, this movie takes place in Delhi. All the people play nice parts and no one shadows the other (like's Nash's theory). The way the historical events are blended with real life events is quite wonderful. Nice use of flashback. Quite an inspirational one. Long time since bollywood came up with a good one. Do read the plot once if possible. Worth a watch at least once."
"kgravikiran","10","1","5","1 February 2006"," Encore Mr.Mehra encore!!!!!
","I came, I saw, I was conquered. This very much sums up my reaction to RDB. No recent movie has had the kind of impact that RDB's had on me. It first propels you to the heights of fun and camaraderie, and then plummets you down to the shocks of gut wrenching reality. <br/><br/>It also exemplifies the aft written cliché of how one incident can change the life/s of a person/s forever.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any movie in the recent past which has had a so original script and fresh approach to story telling. It simply amazes you with its narration and sets about to do what it aims for.<br/><br/>The sepia toned flashbacks, the colorful contemporariness blend seamlessly to an awe inspiring motion picture which justifies the phrase 'MOVIE MAGIC'. It's nothing short of magical to make a world wearied, hard boiled cynic like me to laugh, cry, get inspired and pretty much feel all the emotions which the characters undergo.<br/><br/>Though the actual movie doesn't take off until intermission, the pre-interval portions builds up a neat platform to launch the issues depicted in the latter half of the movie. Each character has been built in detail. Their beliefs and their understanding of the society have been portrayed in an easy manner without boring the audience. Post interval grabs you by the throat and delivers a punch to your stomach, which leaves you breathless and gasping.<br/><br/>I don't want to comment on the plot, the acting or any other technical aspects of the movie. But want to address some of the criticisms leveled on the way the movie has been handled.<br/><br/>It was a masterstroke to draw parallels to the saga of the revolutionaries and the deeds of the characters of the story. Many people have said to me that the likes of Azad and Bhagat Singh should not have been compared with the beer gurgling, bike racing protagonists of the movie. But I beg to differ here. The deeds of our revolutionaries cannot be and must not be compared to anyone as we are incapable to be a fraction of those people. Here the director has drawn parallel to the story of the revolutionaries and has created situations in present scenario which were similar to what Azad, Bahagat et al faced in pre-independence era i.e. the oppression, double handedness, and out right lawlessness of the British then and Politicians now (The director's intention is pretty much evident in the Jalianwala Bagh scene where he alternates the image of Dyer with that of the minister).<br/><br/>The director also presents the characters with a solution to their problems. Take the path trodden by their ancestors till the very end.This too has come under criticism by some of my friends. ""Does taking up arms is the solution?"" they ask. Again according to me the director doesn't convey that arms are the only solution. A character even tells at the climax that what they have done may be wrong, but it seemed to be the effective way to jolt the society which is sleeping under the burden of hopelessness, inactivity and general unconcern. I too do not support violence, but if you need to grab the attention of the whole nation, there has to happen incidents which will force you to take notice and act upon it. Also everyone knows that our independence is not the result of non-violence only. Revolutionaries also played a major role. <br/><br/>Other thing which drew criticism was the climax. My friends wanted the climax to be different than what it is. According to me it wold have diluted the impact of the movie. The climax is perfect.<br/><br/>Acting, cinematography, music, editing, dialogues are of top notch. And of course direction is truly wonderful. Thank you Mr. Mehra for the audacity to make such movie which makes one laugh, cry and get inspired. In short, thanks for the MOVIE MAGIC."
"zeya_bakhtyar","9","1","5","1 February 2006"," Color it yellow
","But this will color you in all colors.<br/><br/>Hmmm where do I start? This movie made me laugh, made me feel old, convinced me that I am not the only one who thinks this way and also put me to sleep in the second half. Though second half is long and slow due to too much poetic aspect injected into the movie, it is still bearable. If one can sit through some other movies, you will find this to be Matrix in comparison. First half made me young and the second half little restless (due to slowness)! With all the Delhi scenes it took me 10 years back. Locations and food were the same as where my friends and I used to hang out and the same ""lukha-ness"". I almost cried nostalgically.<br/><br/>It's a strongly recommended movie.<br/><br/>Now the movie This is a cocktail of Rangeela's taporiness Punjabi style, youthfulness of Dil Chahta Hai, message of Yuva, influenced music, excellent metaphorical narration and situation morphing between periods. First half of the movie is very energetic and full of life; the movie starts to drag as the movie approaches its end. Strength's no heavy-duty dialogs very colloquial, normal slang, acceptable amount of romance and truthful presentation of today's India. One thing that I was initially skeptical about was Aamir Khan playing a college guy. He is aging you can see it on his face. But, the makers took care of it well by making him the ""super senior"", he continues with college even after five years of graduation. He has one very powerful line, paraphrased here  while in college one makes the life dance to ones own tune and once outside the college life makes us dance to its tune. The movie has a lot of message that earlier movies lost to convey due to theatrics and this one did it well with its simplicity. But what I really enjoyed was the ""kickbackness"" of the movie with no unnecessary verbose dialogs or exaggerated philosophies. There also is a good portrayal of some very common stereotypes. Aamir, as always is phenomenal. Earlier, I was also skeptical about the Bhagat Singh factor in the movie. Lately, there have been too many patriotic/historic/period movies that lost its flow in its commercialization. But surprisingly despite the presence of Bhagat Singh factor this is not totally a historic movie. This movie has also been labeled as a period movie; yes it is, the period is TODAY.<br/><br/>Is this Oscar material like Lagaan. I don't think so. Is it a powerful movie? Yes.<br/><br/>Some observation, while some industry members are running to Hollywood; Aamir is continuously brining Hollywood to Bollywood. Instead of portraying Sikhs in stereotyped comic or warrior roles, it is really pleasing to see them in more diverse roles.<br/><br/>I did not see any controversy in the movie as it was made to sound.<br/><br/>I wish there are more movies such as this from Bollywood. Simple, beautiful, ethical and REAL.<br/><br/>Worries: Cinema influences the youth. I hope this does not do it in the wrong way. I hope people pick contributing to the nation by participating in its system rather than assassinations."
"Sherazade","10","1","6","18 March 2006"," Incredible!
","I started out not liking this film but by the end, I was in tears, I was inspired and most importantly, my life was different from they way it was before I saw the film, which I think was the director's ultimate goal. I learned two things from this movie and the first one is that things will always be the same if we all just sit down and do nothing about it, and the second thing is that we, the people who live in this day and age are a disgrace to our freedom fighters of the past. I don't just mean this for India, but for everywhere in the world where the fight for freedom has been a price selflessly paid by people just like you and I. Rang De Basanti is the story of seven friends, one of whom is a British national who comes to India to shoot a documentary based on the accounts of her grandfather who was a first hand witness to the Legend of Bhagat Singh and his friends. When she reaches India, she is shocked by the way the youth of today seems to have little or no understanding of their very recent past and how Westernised they had all become. She meets six friends, five boys and one girl of which she quickly becomes their 7th. She recruits them to star in her documentary and with this, she unites them all and makes them become aware of what is going on in their surroundings. But maybe her inspiration goes a little too far and by the end of the film, you just have to wonder if she blames herself for what happens and if so how she would live with herself. The element I liked the most about the film, was how in the end, this British girl's life is forever changed as she finds herself the 21st century updated version of the troubled person her grandfather was on those very pages she was inspired by, and those very pages that would haunt her forever."
"columbus-christopher","10","1","6","12 February 2006"," Beware! U will be a changed Man after watching it!
","RDB effectively shows how the Indian freedom fighters fought against the British imperialists defiantly (which is aptly shown when they take death punishment smiling and hoping that their sacrifice will bring freedom to India) and how the present day youngsters can still follow the same practice to fight social evils prevalent in India which are even worse than the British rule. The transformation of the youth, who simply blame the politicians for all the problems, to real-life heroes who do not even hesitate to sacrifice their lives to oppose wrongdoings of a minister, is really amazing and heartening. It jolts the audience wand wakes up the same Indian spirit which used to be dominant during the pre-independence period but dormant today."
"Sparrowmaniac","9","1","6","5 February 2006"," Freedom For a Cause
","Freedom for a Cause... That seems to be the theme for this movie. I have no interests in Hindi movies, anyone checking my review list can say that. But this one is different. Rang de Basanti, is a movie made for the teen generation. The generation which decides the future of the country. Many believe that its easy to criticize, but difficult to actually make a difference to the country. Well, to those people kudos to them, cause this is a movie about such guys. About people who actually make a difference to the country, following the examples of the revolutionaries, in a similar way as they did when they fought for India's independence. They try to make a difference, by causing an uproar among the genX people. They defy all odds, doing it, and they give their lives for it, to make the country a better place to live in for the other people, by ridding people who are corrupt.<br/><br/>The movie is based upon a young English lady, who wishes to make a movie on the lives of the Indian revolutionaries who gave their lives for the independence. She reads through her grandfather's journal, who was a officer during those tirade times. Seh comes to India, and meets the jolly group of five friends, who have nothing to worry, all the time making masti. She offers them roles in her documentary film. By the time shooting finishes, she has a crush on one of the actors, and also, tragedy strikes the group of friends. The fiancée of the girl in the group, who was a pilot in the Air force dies. They learn that the death was due to faulty parts in the airplane, and that the defense minister, has ordered those parts to be placed. They protest against the injustice, but they are rudely beaten up. Then they decide to follow the examples of the revolutionaries they were portraying. They kill the corrupt defense minister, and then they confess the truth in a radio station. But they pay with their lives. Special ops recover the radio station, with orders that ""Spare none"". So they die, with a smile on their lips, knowing that they made a difference with their lives.<br/><br/>It's a movie to arise the teenage generation from their slumber. And it certainly did affect me. Being a teen myself. The story is superb, dialogs awesome, camera work mind blowing, and A.R. Rahman does magic with the music as well. Overall RDB was a good see, rare one for Hindi movies nowadays. 9/10!!!"

","Very rarely does a movie come that hits you like a ton of bricks, which makes you think and introspect. ""Rang De Basanti"" is one such. Highly recommend for each and every Indian to watch. The movie is not about MiGs or the British, but about how we have forgotten the cost that our freedom fighters paid to get us this freedom of ours, how we have forgotten the innumerable soldiers who died and are dying safeguarding our freedom. Freedom which we squander away everyday by corruption; cheap, divisive & dirty politics. This movie is a wake-up call to all of us to tighten our belts and do something to change the system. The movie aptly points out that even though the British have left, the Raj is still there - only that the white faces have been replaced by our own. This movie is especially recommended for today's youngsters who seem to have no respect for India, who simply don't care what happens to India, who are busy with their fancy cell-phones and discos. The movie conveys its message that to change things, merely complaining is not enough. Something has to be done and we all have to be a part of the (political) process. The youth has to take up the job, dirty its hands to clean the muck created by our past generation. And the movie conveys this message clearly, forcefully, elegantly and in a manner that is entertaining, gripping and thought-provoking. Hats off to the makers of this movie. May they come up with more movies with similar themes - the purpose of movies - that of mass integration & motivation and social cause - is still not dead."

","Well the movie basically deals with todays youth, their responsibilities esp towards their country!<br/><br/>The movie has been excellently crafted. It switches quickly from history to the present which has been dealt with precisely.<br/><br/>The first half has some rib-tickling comedy and then the movie gets a bit serious dealing with major issues.<br/><br/>Initially the music seems disappointing but once you absorb the music it will surely delight you. Especially the relation of the tunes in the movie is perfect and we can definitely say that AR Rehman has done a great job with the music as well as the background score.<br/><br/>Overall a must watch movie. Especially for those who are craving for a good movie after Black!"
"pakatthetrack","6","1","8","24 June 2008"," Trying to Understand a Broken Masterpiece
","The Rang de Basanti experience basically went as follows: I was enjoying the first part of the story and the music and plot was decent. I liked the cast of characters (most of them) and there were little quips that kept me interested and amused. Up to the intermission, it was a good story.<br/><br/>Then....<br/><br/>After the intermission, everything fell apart: not in a good way. I literally had to go back and watch a good portion of the movie again (20 mins) because I didn't quite understand what happened. From the beginning of the story, the characters were making a movie about revolutionaries from the mid nineteenth century. Then, the engaged guy (Ajay) dies and a bunch of fun, easygoing college students become sadistic killers... the two plots didn't match up at all. A bunch of kids were making a movie about the revolution, and then, most conveniently, their best friend dies, which results in their protests, which results in their beatings, and their plot to assassinate the defense minister... Its like the makers had two storyboards and couldn't decide which one to use so they took the first half of the one and the second half of the other and combined them. The result was completely exasperating, everything went downhill too fast: the first part of the movie was too slow and the second half deteriorated far too fast. (the exposition was not very exhilarating vs. the climaxes and resolution which were far fetched and a little overdone.) Instead, the story should have been about either the first part or the second part: not both. In other words, the story should have elaborated on the movie that the characters were producing and perhaps should have given a back story of each of the characters as actors to show how they were each related to the revolution; or, the story should have started to finish accordingly with the second part: the characters would not be making a movie, there would be no acting or auditions: instead, the story would elaborate solely on the cultural lives of each character and emphasize their innocence and happiness and show how government tears them apart through death and destruction. Both of these would achieve the same theme that highlights the corruption of government and the fact that something needs to be done. <br/><br/>To elaborate more on the theme: the main message of the movie was very wrong. It pretty much advertised, ergo, advocated a bloody revolution on the grounds that it would shake the country into awakening. This is outrageous... the story literally preaches bloodshed... Yes, the government is corrupt and will readily cause bloodshed: but this is the main reason why the people have to act peaceably until they are able to change government through their own work within it: by protesting, they are only demanding change that the government has already refused to give: it is only through mass active participation in government that major change can occur. This was a hidden moral heard only as Karan stated it during the final radio broadcast urging citizens to participate in govt. This theme should have been highlighted much more. I think that the main message of this movie for its people should have been a peaceful revolution through intelligent means: this is a more appropriate idea that ties in with the characters identities as students and would have made the story more memorable and worthwhile. I read about the movie on the worldwide scale: I believe it didn't really attain abundant international acclaim because of the plot and story insufficiencies aforementioned. I think that the story had potential to overrun even Richard Attenborough's Ghandi, but didn't do so because it contained conflicting plot lines: it tripped over itself about halfway through the race and never regained momentum. <br/><br/>But it wasn't all that bad. As I said before, I enjoyed the character traits of the Desi people portrayed. It was good to give brown people some kind of personality besides engineers and doctors with funny accents. I think that the cultural aspects of the movie were outstanding. I also liked the jokes that occasionally denounced the overdone Bollywood tradition. (the only reason we plant trees in this country is so that we can dance around them) <br/><br/>All in all, the movie broke the standpoint of the traditional Indian movie: it was vibrant, pseudo-western, and contained some pleasantly funny jokes. The reason I wrote so much about this movie is that I had a lot of hope for it: before watching, I knew that it broke away from the typical Indian movie melodrama and actually contained substance. After watching however, I realized that it was hopelessly jumbled and contained conflicting and unrelated story lines and themes and even pointless melodrama of its own. In the end, the culture stands out as the most appealing aspect while the rest of the story crumbles around it. Its sad because the back story actually contained so much more than what the movie itself actually conveyed to the bewildered watcher: it was teeming with potential that, regrettably, was never really used."

"HiddenVoice","6","1","11","25 August 2006"," A coming-of-age story that should've been great.
","How many times has Bollywood made films about corruption,politics,patriotism and tried endlessly to wake India up and change its system?And here comes another one.<br/><br/>But what sets this one apart from those is that ,it approaches that theme in a different way and in a rather effective,long lasting way.The film had a good story,but to develop that story and its characters, is not possible in Bollywood.And instead, it wastes a lot of time showing how these really old looking college kids have fun.<br/><br/>Sue,a British Documentary filmmaker ,finishes reading her Grandfather diary about how intrepid Indians were during The British rule in India where her Grandfather served the English.So,Sue decides to make a documentary about those men who fought for their country's freedom and died at a very young age to spread their messages.So,she arrives in India.India ,as always,Corrupt, filthy and totally helpless.And Sue's friend ,who is also her guide,Sonia and tries hard to find the perfect actors to pull it off.Until Sonia takes Sue to her rebellious and free spirited friends,who are totally westernized.In these free spirited men,she sees her characters and those freedom fighters and decides to cast them in the roles.But these kids are the new generation of men,who defy culture,tradition and all patriotism and think that is a thing of the past.They take life for granted and all care about having fun with the time they've given rather than do something to improve a country that can't be perfect no matter what anyone does.They think they should leave it the way it is and move on,either get out of India or suffer in it.And they would pick the former.But somehow they agree and Sue also falls for one of them,and they start making the documentary .And during the process they start to realize that it is not just one's duty to change a country ,but it is everyone's responsibility to fix the country and most importantly themselves.Then the film takes a weak turn by the end ,and becomes unconvincing in its approach and rather implausible and ridiculous.But ,nevertheless, it leaves an impact that may awake a generation.<br/><br/>It's not inspirational,when it is suppose to be.It does however asks a lot of questions that maybe relevant to youth of India.It may wake them up and temp them to change this over-corrupt and terrible country.But it doesn't get to it and doesn't succeed completely.It spends too much time on the five friends wasting their time ,hanging out and having fun. Instead of being a coming-of-age film ,it relies on patriotism and it's third act is what hurts the film most.It was preposterous and far fetched.A bad move,the film was finishing off well,and it was about to be a good film until that twist in the climax comes up and ruins the film.It becomes hard to connect with the characters and unconvincing.<br/><br/>But having said that,I still think this is one of the first ever Bollywood film that I've seen that somehow manages to tackle the issues that Bollywood have been tackling, with perfection.This film may serve as a message to those youngsters and Politicians and let them know that it is time to wake up and change the system.And it succeeds in that attempt where many like this came and gone with no effect on people.<br/><br/>But it suffers from poor development of the story,and characters are not well written.The screenplay doesn't make appropriate moves and doesn't succeed to make a stronger impact.It's yet another Bollywood film that could've been great if it tried harder and it does.<br/><br/>One really smart technique is the intersection of the past and present. The events of the past,puts these youngsters to look at themselves and those men who gave up their lives for freedom and think of themselves as those men.They realize why they are doing this.<br/><br/>The films moves at a easy pace,and it's entertaining and it is true to its depiction of India as it is and what it is trying to do.However,the biggest problem with the film was its climax.It was a really bad move.The film was finishing off well and would've been a really memorable film ,but its third act was preposterous.I found the film thoroughly enjoyable,never preaching patriotic issues and always focusing somewhat on its message of change.But it's climax leading to its ending was the worst move made by the filmmakers.They were doing good and they could've ended it well.But they had to evoke violence in the film.Letting youth assume that violence solves everything.<br/><br/>It felt like as if the gang lost their minds and were poisoned with drugs or something and made a wrong move.Like most teenagers who don't yet understand the world do.It was a disastrous move.<br/><br/>Alice Paten is the highlight of the film.She is really convincing and gives the strongest performance in the film.Her fluent Hindi accent and emotional depth is well realized.It's a understated performance.While ,Aamir khan was fine in his role.He is actually a surprise ,playing a slacker.And the rest of the gang is just fine,nothing special.<br/><br/>The director presents something refreshing than something clichéd and old.He really brings the best parts of the script to the screen with generosity.His sincere effort is well established.<br/><br/>This film does need an international recognition.And one of the very few films that I came to like in Bollywood.But it never tops Dil Chahta Hai,or Lagaan or Being Cyrus.It is as good as Asoka or Dil se.But it seems that Bollywood is finally looking at their films and improving them.Making them logical and realistic.But as always,films like these don't come along every time.<br/><br/>In the end I started asking myself why didn't Sue just opted for making a Film about Gandhi,like her producers suggested, rather than provoking these idiots,who misinterpreted her message,and chose to be their predecessors and use their actions in todays world.Kids are always kids."

"JakeBrinkman","2","0","4","25 September 2019"," Three films poorly crammed into one
","This movie is a textbook example of a film spreading itself too thin. It cuts so much essential background information that I assume it would only make sense to Indian citizens. For someone like me with a very minimal understanding of Indian history and current politics, it would have been far better if it were split into three separate movies.<br/><br/>The first movie is a ragtag group of party animals who refuse to admit they're too old for the party life, and they eventually find and accept their roles their roles in society. Second is the political statement trying to raise awareness for a current issue. Third is the historical film about anti-British revolutionaries. The movie attempts to combine the three stories by having the group learn from history and take a stand against the current political injustice.<br/><br/>That last sentence makes combining them sound like a great idea, so I can understand why the producer thought it would work out well, but mashing three films down into an already tedious 2:45 runtime quickly turns into a screenwriter's nightmare. The ""college"" story has too many characters and not enough time for the viewer to relate to any of them. The political story has basically no background information, and it isn't even introduced until 2 hours into the film. As a Westerner, I think the government's reactions to several events are ridiculously unbelievable, and background explaining and establishing the government as corrupt should have been essential, but this movie simply doesn't have time for it. Finally, the historical film teaches the history, but it's so rushed and glossed over that it feels much closer to a history lecture rather than the inspiring story of bravery that was intended.<br/><br/>Aside from that huge mistake of overextending, this film has a lot of minor poor decisions that I've come to expect from Bollywood films. First is being behind the timed, this time reminiscient of a 1990's film (for a 2006 film), which is actually one of the most up to date Indian films I've seen so far. The acting has an awkwardly disingenuous feel that is familiar of 90's sitcoms. The music is evenly split between a very 90's sound and between songs that have lyrics so strong and loud that the song overpowers the scene. This movie also has the terrible Bollywood dance numbers, but I appreciated that they weren't full blown musicals.<br/><br/>On that note, I really don't understand India's obsession with the musical numbers. One of the characters in this movie actually says the music and dancing is the whole reason India makes movies, which is a horrible way of thinking about it. It's disturbingly immersion-breaking when a random music video is cut awkwardly into the middle of a movie and it has nothing at all to do with the plot. Again, this movie surprisingly doesn't have that problem (though there could have been a little less dancing), but the dialogue draws attention to it."

A personal tragedy brings revolutionary ideas and actions to this group of friends.<br/><br/>From 2002-6 many films were made about Bhagat Singh and friends who unlike Gandhi took up arms to fight the Britishers for freedom. Most of them were emotionally charged biopics. Rang de basanti looked at those revolutionaries from a modern perspective. The struggle in the present day is drawing parallels from yesteryear revolutionaries. Rajesh Mehra pulls off a near impossible feat of moving the present day youth to take responsibility for themselves and be a part of a change instead of criticizing the country they live in.<br/><br/>

The changes aren't the ones youngsters usually encounter - these are changes that are very concrete and change their lives completely. The central character of the film is Sue McKinley (British actress Alice Patten) who is a young documentary filmmaker who comes to India armed with her grandfather's diary to make a documentary film on the freedom fighters of India. Cinema is a reflection of society. Indian cinema narrates various aspects of Indian culture, tradition history and legacy. British Rule and Indian independence movements have left and everlasting imprints on Indian psychological. In 2016 when we look back and recall RDB 2006 movie narrates the socio-political landscape of India. RDB talks about the legendary martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, how they fought against injustice of British Rule and motivated Indian youth against injustice post independence. RDB compares the pre-independence Indian legends with post independence today's youth. This comparison is showcased visually. BG,R, S are used as simile and metaphor in the film. These simile and metaphors motivate and inspire today's youth to follow their footsteps.

Jan Cohen-Cruz (1998) defined theaters on the street as an expression of revolutionary political and nationalist movement that not only entertain its audiences, but has a deep-rooted role to play in social change.<br/><br/>Safdar Hashmi – the founder of Jana Natya Manch and theater activist – too viewed street theater as a tool to spread political ideology, especially to propagate communism and ""draw the masses of people into the anti-colonial struggle"" .<br/><br/>John D. H. Downing (2011), extensively wrote who it was flourished in India, the use of colloquial languages that are incorporated with songs, dance and folk arts.

Indian Street Theater has been inspired to a great extent by the works of Bertolt Brecht, Augusto Boal, Utpal Dutt and Badal Sircar.<br/><br/>Bollywood has made 6 films on Bhagat Singh since 1954. Bhagat Singh has become a metaphor of secular society. The List of Movies on Bhagat Singh is as follow. Film- Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh, a 1954 film made Bhagat Singh as the Pioneer Indian Youth Icon. This film was directed by Jagdish Gautam, Lachhiram gave music and Sahir Chandpuri wrote lyrics.<br/><br/>It is worth mentioning the part of history, Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners who were not members of his Satyagraha movement released under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931, and in a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, pleading fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would be too late.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is a film which has used documentary film maker Sue as a narrator. The metaphorical use of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev images enriched Indian cinematic grammar. This film handles the issue of corruption and shows strong legacy of secular society, social cohesion and national integrity. RDB has won many awards in India and across the globe.

The documentary revolves around the struggle faced by Indian Freedom fighters during the British rule which is later responsible for changing the attitude of these students towards the country. The movie also shows how different student unions in the college are in a regular face off with each other. A sudden change in movie happens when an honest pilot dies due to negligence of government who blame the pilot for his own death.

Shrewd at tweaking the clichés of social chaos, Rang De Basanti is ultimately an academic exercise, full of stand-ins and signifies a kind of Velvet Goldmine for the destructive impact of the Indian Political corruption and chaos, minus the sense of decadent fun. There is an undeniable appeal to a movie that's made to be picked apart and analyzed as much as this one is, where the props seem to be cross-referencing each other, every incident and character has a mirror image, and even the protagonist is played by two people. One just wishes it weren't doing all the work for the viewer.<br/><br/>But RDB does more than just correct the historical narrative. The argument that the nation's history cannot be thought apart from aurality entails a re-conceptualization of history itself. Rather than treating the past as a set of facts to be ""discovered"" and plotted onto a linear timeline, RDB urges us to think of it as a body of disparate, ephemeral fragments that can be narrativized in different ways. History is a narrative composed of (some of) those fragments, interpreted and remixed such that it speaks to the exigencies of the present. The re-configuring of traditional boundaries of time- space in the RDB soundtrack liberates us not only from the oppression of the (colonial and contemporary) state but also, and more importantly, from its narrative about history. Cinematic sound and music in RDB are the primary means of moving from colonialism's gift of ""World-history"" back to an older, more enchanted relationship between past and present"

","Let us start by quoting Movie itself, the Character DJ played by Amir Khan Speak in the movie: There are only two ways to live life: Tolerate things the way they are... Or, take responsibility to change them.""<br/><br/>This line portrays beautifully what this movie wants to convey to The Youth of India, that it's time for a wake up call, it's time to work against the injustice, the system, the corruption and the social and economic problems faced in our country.<br/><br/>Rang De Basanti is a story of an English woman who embarks on a journey to find talents in Delhi University to film a documentary on Indian Freedom Fighters, and she finds friendship through the six actors of her Film. The struggle for freedom is relived on screen and off screen simultaneously.<br/><br/>The movie portrays various problems faced in this Incredible Country India like: Social Injustice to various particular sections of society, the problems faced by a foreign woman in India, the Political system, need for introspection by the Indian youth. This movie led to Awakening of Indian youth which affected the Jessica Murder case investigation which was going on while the release of the movie, the movie actually led to candle marches and demonstrations for justice at India Gate. There is no limit for the lines to quote from this Movie but I would like to quote another dialogue: ""I think sometimes a person can be pushed so far that they reach a point beyond fear; a place where you find a strange peace, where you free yourself to do the right thing; because sometimes, that's the hardest thing to do.""<br/><br/>While the movie plays a part in awakening the youth of India, the movie itself is well made and very well acted with an ensemble cast, the movie pretty much Flows like Poetry and is an example of sheer brilliant film making.<br/><br/>The Direction of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is exceptional and the acting of every actor outshines the story line. The clever way of Storytelling is also used brilliantly by showing the scenes from documentary in the first act and how it changes the actors' character and in the second act the society is shown and the director has tried to show that we are still being oppressed like Colonizers used to.<br/><br/>With extraordinary Music by none other than A R Rahman, this movie scores high in every category. To finish it I would like to quote few lines from the song Rubaroo of this movie: ""Aandhiyon Se Jaghad Rahi Hai Lau Meri Ab Mashaalon Si Bhad Rahi Hai Lau Meri"""

","Sue is a pretty young British lady who wants to make a film about the Indian uprising of the 1920s. This is because she's read through her grandfather's diary and although he was a British officer, he had great respect for these Indian patriots. But her bosses have no interest in such a project (perhaps because she's in the UK), so she takes off for India to do the film herself...with no funding. But because there is no money, she decides to use some college students instead of professional actors. There is a huge problem, though, as the students are mostly very spoiled young people who are more interested in becoming like Westerners than doing a serious film about their forefathers. Can she get through to these jerks and get them to realize the great price that was paid to create modern day India....and thus get the film made?<br/><br/>Like most Indian films, this one is quite long--nearly three hours. And, like a typical Indian film is shows a lot of fun-loving young Indians singing and dancing. I liked the film but think they overdid this aspect a bit. The students should have been oblivious to their past but making them annoying jerks seemed a bit too much, as it was very hard to like any of them during the first portion of the picture. A bit more subtlety would have been nice. Fortunately, through the course of the film, the students did improve in this regard and began to take the project more seriously. This later portion was much better and poignant, as the students start to realize that even today in India there is corruption and repression that must be fought and it's a close parallel to the story about the Indian revolutionaries of the 1920s. I am pretty sure the Indian politicians did NOT appreciate this film and its condemnation of brutal police tactics to squelch protest! Overall, despite being uneven, the film is quite good and interesting as it seems to encourage what might be perceived as terrorism! A very compelling film despite the slow start.<br/><br/>By the way, the MiG-21 crashes which made up a significant part of the latter portion of film have apparently been a serious problem in India. And yet, the film says at the beginning that it's a work of fiction...interesting. Also, for Westerners not used to Bollywood films, you might be interested to hear that corruption (particularly police corruption) is a relatively common theme in Indian films."

","""One leg in the past, one leg in the future, this is why we're pissing on the present."" <br/><br/>So observes a character in Rang De Basanti. Of course, this is predicated on the assumption that it's men doing all the damage. In a Patriarchal country like the beautiful India, it's more than an implication. There's a cognitive dissonance, a man-made conflict of interests. It's a closed system with two interacting elements; the patriotic and the pecuniary.<br/><br/>The film tells its story, one of mistakably dimming relevance, in a very calculated and inviting fashion. The fight for independence from the British, as a historical documentary being made on a zero(denied)-budget by an ambitious British post-adolescent woman, that needs re-enactments, which shall be done by the boisterously youthful protagonists. (They jump drunkenly off bridges where the original young revolutionaries jumped on moving trains.) This dissonance spills out of the narrative and into the film making craft itself; about 75% of the cuts in the film are truly cinematic, impressively invisible, and serve emotion and storytelling, the rest are so hip-hoppy you think Honey Singh is going to burst into the frame. The Dance Numbers are derivatively progressive.<br/><br/>A subplot of external conflict, with a clique of militant dogmatists who are offended deeply (and paid heftily to take deep offence) by the 'Western-wannabeism' of the protagonists is inflated and paraded for us to notice, then buried for virtually the rest of the film.<br/><br/>A key character crosses over from their side (a big key too, considering he's the one getting the money), gets a role in the documentary, and then only serves as a pair of fists and knees in a plot-hinging fight scene. After that, he's just a diffident extra in the documentary. Anyone paying attention to the story at this point will tell you he has more conflict, both internal and external, than all the other characters aggregated.<br/><br/>That wouldn't leave running time for Aamir Khan's comic relief though, would it? But is this a story that needs relief, from what? The premise itself is a tricky compromise enough. I don't know whether it's the New Bollywood way of tickling the audience's ribs, but there's a whole lot of standing-up-and-stomping-around going on, it gets on your nerves, then bites down and gnaws on them.<br/><br/>Still, the film is very dramatically effective, and there are enough 'realistic' performances from the core cast to sour-down and hair-up the cutesy syrupy moments. Consider, how the director sets up an in-joke about a television that reacts better to a well-timed slap than a turn of the knob. Without repeating the joke too many times, he hurtles the movie forward swiftly and smartly, and right before the intermission, supplies a Soap Opera proposal we don't want to see. <br/><br/>The sly disconnect with which he uses the punchline of the T.V. joke to cut down silly romanticism with grim foreclosure is not only tragi-darkly-comic, it understates one of the movies running themes; ""Put your life on the line for your country in this new world, you're not a revolutionary, you're Nuts."" <br/><br/>Safer to make movies and documentaries about stuff. Apropos, did Tropic Thunder steal its premise from this, strip away idealism and purpose?<br/><br/>The message seems to be that, inherently oppressive, colonialism (ancestral to anti-nationalism in a way) is an indelible stain that only permeates wider and changes color with time. I heartily agree. However, wherever you stand on this contemplative time curve, you leave a puddle. Blood, tears, or likely, pxss.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is an efficiently constructed, cleverly told and expertly presented crucial bit of overarching history, worth the demand of its running time."
"WWF_Deadman_Undertaker","10","0","2","21 September 2015"," Shocking
","I haven't felt so compelled by a movie in a long time. I watched this just because I wanted to revisit Bollywood in 2006. I used to avoid this film because the title track played too often on TV commercials and in promotions. I didn't have high hopes for it. I thought it was just another movie where Aamir Khan played a revolutionary. I wanted to revisit that time period, and watched this when I saw this as the one Hindi movie on Netflix from then.<br/><br/>At first I was annoyed by the English girl directing her documentary. I had to mentally cringe through her bringing the basis of the actual movie together.<br/><br/>Once DJ and his crew were introduced, I knew there was potential for something interesting to come of the movie. I thought it was going to be as simple as they helped make her movie while being rowdy in between and learning to appreciate India's history.<br/><br/>Late into the movie I started making jokes to myself about how these are actors performing a script and that the intensity of the movie was silly to me. But by the conclusion I snapped out of that mentality. I was shocked by what the movie turned into and needed to let it sink in.<br/><br/>The movie definitely reminded me of 2006 where a lot of teens were looking for a crew of friends, and among them they felt a need to be rowdy because in general they felt lost. I think this movie was very definitive of that.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the movie, I would just say that how well this movie portrayed the way of the generation and youth really hit me. Back then it was a very concentrated feeling. Between online media and cell phones the youth wanted a real, tangible presence in the world, but felt it slipping away. That feeling of a lack of identity and meaning is still here today, but watching this movie really got me to pay attention to how striking it was back then.<br/><br/>I could relate to the movie really well, and imagine others in this age group can too. Just because it's one of those eye-opening movies that got me to start thinking about my life, I have to give this a 10. I would recommend it to anyone who is a young adult that wants something to connect with or relate to with regard to identity and being confronted with injustice in a movie."

Atul Kulkarni, Kunal Kapoor and Sharman Joshi all played their roles to their finest. Madhavan was good in his cameo, and Alice Patten was also surprisingly very good, and even though her Hindi was sometimes annoying, she did well. Aamir Khan stole the show; this was one of his best performances; he also really deserved all Best Actor awards that year. I can never be disappointed by Aamir. He does everything in this role; from comic timing to strong emotional ability. And he even maintained the Punjabi accent throughout the film.

It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system.Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R.

Another equally good interpretation made by Alice Patten who played as Sue.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""Rang De Basanti"" is a really good movie and is really worth seeing because it shows us how many things can change in the life of a person when he learns to think and see things different.

I won't say much about the movie because if you are really interested then go and watch the movie and I assure you that you won't be disappointed.

","Do you remember once there was a whole clump of movies made on the legend of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh? How many of them do you remember today? Perhaps the one that starred Ajay Devgan at max? Conversely, you will not be able to forget 'Rang De Basanti'. No, the movie is not again about the freedom fighter's life. It is about awakening of distrait direction-less youth taking inspiration from his life. If you thought 'Dil Chahta Hai' was perfect and you loved it, behold, we have Rang De Basanti (RDB). The movie is not only perfect with its script; it is the execution that takes it further to be ranked among all time greats.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a British girl Sue (Alice Patten), whose grandfather was warden in the jail where Bhagat Singh was hanged. Sue arrives in India to make a film on the life and deeds of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, with her only accomplice in India, Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After meeting the happy-go-lucky DJ (Amir Khan), she decides to sign him and his vagabond friends as the main characters of her film. DJ and his friends Karan (Sidharth), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Sukhi (Sharman Joshi) start working for her only for fun sake, not at all believing in the quintessence of the legend of Bhagat Singh. Laxman Panday (Atul Kulkarni), their once biggest adversary, also joins them in their film playing Bismal Ram from history after he impresses Sue with his knowledge and belief in the legend.<br/><br/>The more they progress with their film production and get to know more about the freedom fighter, their beliefs start changing. Just at that perfect time, calamity strikes when their fifth friend and Sonia's fiancé, Ajay (Madhavan) an air force pilot, dies in a plane crash. The government officials attempt to hide their corruption in purchasing aircraft spare parts and put the blame on 'incapability' of Ajay. DJ and his friends stand against the government to save the reputation of Ajay, only to be tortured by police and Ajay's mother (Waheeda Rehman) getting caught in stupor. The gang gets up to seek vengeance from the government and to tell the real story to the world in a Bhagat Singh style. They succeed, but only after paying a very high cost.<br/><br/>The script is the strongest one Indian Cinema has seen in recent times, but hats off to the director Rakeysh Mehra for the perfect execution and justice to the script. Certainly, Bollywood could not afford another Mangal Panday, which also had strong script but fell short in execution. Sequences, treatment and especially the connect between history and present is so neatly done that it keeps the viewers glued to the screen. If the humor element in the first half makes you laugh aloud, you find it impossible not to feel the pain our heroes go through in the second half. In addition, it will be unfair not to mention the editing and background score by A.R. Rehman. A word of praise for cinematographer Binod Pradhan for his innovative camera angles particularly in the sequence when Ajay proposes to Sonia.<br/><br/>Now the individual performances. Amir Khan does a wonderful job once again, as he always does. Although his tainted Punjabi accent leaves a bit of desire in the first half an hour; but later his expressions and spontaneity makes up for everything. Yet another award winning performance. Last few minutes of his act keep one wheezing. The best part is that despite being much older than other actors in the gang are, he looks as young as they do.<br/><br/>The surprise packages in the film are south actor Sidharth and the British actress Alice Patten as they both give remarkable performances. Arjun Rampal will regret not doing the role of Sidharth, which initially was offered to him. From a desensitized unyielding young man to a touching finale, Sidharth looks flawless. Alice Patten's Hindi sounds very cute and her unusual romance with DJ is highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>After a cameo in Lajja and two comic roles in Style and Excuse Me, Sharman Joshi comes out to be the funniest thing in RDB. Kunal Kapoor might have gone disregarded in Meenaxi but will definitely be noticed here. Atul Kulkarni is a serious filmmaker's darling, anyway. You hate him whenever he plays a negative character and you will love him in Rang De Basanti. Soha Ali Khan has improved considerably since Dil Maange More and promises a lot for future. One might give her credit for her improved dressing sense as well. Kirron Kher, Anupam Kher, Om Puri and Madhavan have very small roles but they fit perfectly into them.<br/><br/>The only negative I felt about the movie was not having a happy ending. Other than Devdas and Tere Naam, we might not have seen any blockbuster with a sad ending lately. However, the young and upbeat feel of the movie is going to make it a conspicuous success in the metros. How small towns respond to it, cannot be said yet. Nonetheless, one hopes for a positive response because of the patriotic and emotional touch. For me, by all means, RDB was love at first sight."

","You expect Aamir Khan to deliver yet another astounding performance in Rang de Basanti and he does. Of course, Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end. Every once in a while comes a film that makes you question your indifference towards everything that's going on around you. That makes you feel almost ashamed for being unconcerned about the state of affairs in your nation. A film that inspires you to wake up and react. To raise your voice, or to put your foot down. You don't see such films in India very often. To be honest, you don't see too many films that stay with you half an hour after you've left the movie hall. And that's why when a film like Rang De Basanti comes along, you stand up and cheer. Rang De Basanti is the story of a group of young friends in Delhi, who spend the most part of their lives laughing and joking, drinking beer and chilling out. When they're urged by a British documentary filmmaker to act in her film about the Indian revolutionaries, their lives change forever. What they may have until then regarded as outdated, stuffy, text-book values eventually begin to assume greater relevance in their lives. In the end, the line between past and present blurs as our protagonists become one in spirit with the revolutionaries that they set out portraying. Right away what appeals to you about director Rakeysh Mehra's new film is the fact that it so accurately captures the spirit and mood of the current generation. The jokes are not forced, the emotions aren't cheated. This is the real stuff. On a story level alone, Rang De Basanti is courageous and brave and dares to dream. Even if the screenplay goes horribly wrong in the film's second half, you cannot for a moment deny that it's a path-breaking concept that's imaginatively executed. In fact, it's fair to say that at most times it's a cleverly disguised history lesson that touches almost all the right notes. It is post intermission really that the film begins to spiral downwards. The director takes too many creative liberties and creates too many situations that seem far-fetched. It's highly unlikely that a Defence Minister would go on national television and blame a recently deceased fighter pilot of rash flying, just so that Mr Minister can get off the hook in the larger scam. It also seems a tad unbelievable that the police would resort to lathi charge on a perfectly peaceful gathering, and beat up everyone including the elderly mother of the late fighter pilot whose death the crowd is grieving. And the icing on the cake really is the climax where the police opens fire on a bunch of unarmed students who have made it more than clear that they will not resort to violence. Now this might seem like nitpicking on my part, but in a film that starts off as astonishingly well as Rang De Basanti, even tiny holes appear four times their size. It breaks your heart to see the film lose its grip in the second half, as Mehra resorts to melodrama, and gets too carried away with his special effects. Quite like his previous film Aks, this time too, Mehra shifts the focus from the story at hand to too much symbolism. But on the upside, A R Rahman's score complements the narrative perfectly, enthusing life and spirit into the scenes. In number, the songs may be many, but they're really an integral part of the screenplay structure. What really takes Rang De Basanti to another level completely, is the ensemble acting. Aamir Khan, spontaneity being his biggest strength, is so good that you're even willing to overlook the fact that he appears too old to be playing this character. Atul Kulkarni is a natural who conveys as much with his eyes and his expressions as he does with words. Even the younger actors - Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi, Sidharth and Soha Ali Khan inhabit their characters so effortlessly that your heart goes out to them. The actors play off each other remarkably, making their scenes together such a pleasure to watch. All said and considered, Rang De Basanti is a magnificent effort, and one that deserves to be applauded for its sheer vision. It's a clever film that credits its audience with some intelligence, and therefore it makes for an undoubtedly subtle but ultimately rewarding experience. It's compelling, moving and quite unlike anything else you're likely to see this year.

","A film which has everything a viewer would want. It is full of all elements of entertainment, yet is the most inspiring film I have ever seen. The best film I have ever seen. The best ending ever in the history of Hindi cinema. A true milestone film. A movie with which youth can connect with and then also inspire them. A true patriotic film. Indeed the best one.Words seem less describing the film, all aspects of the film are a true masterpiece from story-telling to screenplay.Also, a music with which youth can connect . Great music by A.R. Rahman and one of his best creations.Acting of Aamir Khan was splendid as usual but,the new comer for bollywood, Karan made a very strong impact.Sharman Joshi's film film in which he actually acted( and by acted I mean acted).Madhavan was at his best, but of all Kunal was the best.He has a great voice which suited his character best.Overall, the best Hindi film."

","I am not sure whether cinema medium have been used like this before. Man, there were many great movies taken before but i am sure never before movie like this,which conveys a great message to its society in a very interesting and effective way. Usually the director who sells the India's poverty were considered best (recently danny boyle). But here is the real talented director who not only shows the problem in our nation but also tried to find the solution hats off sir. Usually we men do not shed tears easily but this movie brought tears in my eyes more than ten occasions . Yeah there were some other movies which brought tears in me like ghost , anbe sivam , titanic but once or twice but this movie? Man i don really have words to explain. Excellent performances by every actors particularly athul kulkarni. The real hero of the movie is director and the second hero is none other than two time academy award winner a.r.rahman what a music can slumdog millionaire's music can stand 1% to this music. It is not the kind of movie that sells the patriotism but teaches it. Man i had wrote many reviews but never said a movie is a must see one but this is 100% must see movie particularly for indians."

","In one of my classes, I have to something out of my comfort zone, and one of the options was to watch a Bollywood movie. I talked to my Indian friends, and they suggested this movie. So, I got together a small group and we watched this movie last night. Having never seen a Bollywood film, before watching it, I read a summary of what would happen. However, I was still speechless at the end of the movie. It was such a powerful movie, and most of us were moved to tears at the end. It probably helped that one of my Indian friends was watching it with us and could give us a better understanding of what was going on, but even without him, the movie still hit home for all of us. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys films like this, although, for some people, it might be hard to handle emotionally... I know it was for us. This movie has now made me want to watch more Bollywood films. Absolutely magnificent."
"mamaramseys","9","0","3","29 January 2008"," The legend of ""Painting it yellow""
","Wow what a movie! And all thanks to the 1 and only Aamir Khan. From the type of project it was any filmie could decipher how difficult its execution may have been. Luckily the mightiest Khan of all signed on to this venture and converted it to pure brilliancy. This movie was more of a symbolic jolt telling the story of five modern Indian youth who have a sudden epiphany about Indian bureaucracy during a process of a play they're acting in. Moreover, it's seen in third person through the eyes of a young British woman who feels that a group of ancient Indians worked really hard in making India a free society and instead it's led to this: A society where freedom of the minds are negligable. I agree with the morale of this story where you should fight for your beliefs when the necessity arises but the true reality is what we see instead towards the end when such an act is committed. Of course this story spawns several opinions and theories in how the Indian government should and shouldn't change. Altogether I give it a 9, I'd give it a 9.5 it just isn't an option. Just finished watching Taare Zameen Par and I must tell ya that'll at least scavenge it's way to an Oscar nominee for Foreign Language films this year"

","Rang De Basanti is a very inspiring, moving, and interesting look on India today. As well as addressing a very important issue, Rang De Basanti is so incredibly well-made that you can't help loving it.<br/><br/>Aamir is starting to grow on me. I am not a fan, but after seeing him here, and then thinking about Jo Jeeta..QSQT, I am starting to like his style of acting. He WAS DJ, and was perfect in his role. Alice Patten also impressed me a lot, she was strangely charming, and brought a fresh, Angrezi vibe to the film. Siddharth as Karan was interesting, he can really act! The ending with him and Aamir was wonderful. Sharman Joshi was adorable in his role, and he was a large contributor to the humour of Rang De Basanti. Kunal Kapoor was a very well casted Aslam, I really like the guy, he's cute too :). Soha Ali Khan was fantastic and her performance got to me straight through - I loved her! Atul Kulkarni was decent enough, and Madhavan was great.<br/><br/>Love your country, is a message that I got from this film. I am very protective and passionate about India and this film reinforced my feelings completely. The only problem I really had with Rang De Basanti is the way the movie jumped from light-hearted to very serious. It kills the mood and you find yourself feeling a bit odd. But it is understandable after seeing the film on why it changes so drastically.<br/><br/>This is the best music I have heard in a while. I LOVE Roobaroo, and the title track is also pretty great. Luka Chuppi and Tu Bin Bataaye are the slower tracks, and Khalbali and Paathshala are the party type songs. I even liked Khoon Chala. In short, each song is different and well worth a listen.<br/><br/>One thing I enjoyed the most was the realistic-ness of the characters, and also how much amazing chemistry each actor had with one another. It seemed real, and a deep friendship. The jokes made between the group will keep you in stitches, and also, feel very close to you. It really reminded me of how I am with my friends. Great for the youth and younger generation of India. I guarantee they will think differently after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, the plot well thought out, screenplay, character development, script...Rang De Basanti is way ahead. Rakeysh Mehra has done a fantastic job, and this is definitely one of the best I have seen.<br/><br/>JAI HIND!"

","An excellent script can always take a movie to places-RDB is a clear example.The actors have done just a decent job(Alice Patten esp, not to be forgotten)But it's the script and direction with an excellent music(A.R.Rahman) which suits the scenes and the mood very well,that clearly awakens the audiences. The general mood of the Indian people esp, the youth has been exploited well.It answers all the doubts and criticisms that have lingered in the people's minds through Sidharth's character,Karan. The highlight in my view is the well planned and executed mixing of the current situations and those during the times of our freedom fighters.The sequences will always be remembered for their point that the problems in the country are similar to those during the freedom fight period. <br/><br/>It is really a surprise that this movie didn't trigger an uprising....,or maybe, who knows the change is happening right NOW. <br/><br/>Not to be missed by any Indian esp,the youth."

","Rang de basanti is a very good example of what happened during the struggle of Indian Independence in 1919. This movie tells the other (armed) struggle for independence. Where the movie Gandhi from Sir Richard Attenborough only tips this topic,in Rang de Basanti the why of the Amritsar Massacre gets explained. Also it shows that actually nothing really chanced in the 60 years since India gained Independence. Government is still corrupted, while the people in the streets die of hunger. Together with the movie Gandhi this movie shows the struggle of Indian Independence and what happened in the 60 years after that. Too bad that this movie didn't got the recognition it deserves at the Academy Awards 2006 in the category best foreign movie."

","When I had stopped watching Hindi Cinema because every decent plot in recent times is lifted from some Hollywood or French movie, this one forced me to about-turn and in what a manner. Beauty of the script lies in drawing parallels in British India of early '30s and 'mera Bharat Mahaan' of today. It's an answer to think-tank of Indian politics which gradually has echoed contribution of only 'naram dal' of INC(Indian National Congress) in Indian freedom struggle so many times in our text books, that they had presumed to have succeeded. This movie silently depicts 'right and justified' violent acts and still manages to condemn violence (Karan's answers over Radio in the end). Dialoges are great amalgamation of comedy and emotions, and songs with their music and lyrics are just too good. In all and all a masterpiece. Coming generations for sure would put it in the league of Pyaasa and Ganga-Jamuna. Amen!"

Acting was also up to the mark. The new girl Soha Ali Khan proves herself to be much quicker than her brother Saif, by making a right choice to act in this movie. It is definitely a landmark movie and deserves a spot in the hearts of the young generation. There is quite a buzz nowadays about this movie being nominated for Oscars, well it was a surprise to see this movie up there.

","Simply brilliant. Class acting and direction makes this movie stand apart. The movie is inspired from a real life current event but the way it has been related to pre-independence era and connected through the happenings and characters of today is marvelous. One feels like India has never been independent but on the other side, it gives a strong message that a common man is empowered to bring the change. He has to just stand up and do something. The message is loud and clear, and this movie was able to deliver it. The movie had a cult following and has changed the way people view Indian cinema. Its not a docu-drama. It was able to entertain at the same time. Nice music by AR Rehman. As an Actor, I think Amir Khan is one of the best among his contemporaries."

","Brilliant film!!! A great story, backed up by great direction, screenplay and music. The plot too, is highly inspiring. If I can be critical of it, it is that it has a very tragic and abrupt end; and a 'negative' plot. But it is simply great and it is a film which speaks the truth. The ending is very sad. It could have been made as the protagonist winning an award for exposing a corruption scandal. Instead of killing the politician, the film could have been made showing the politician being caught red handed. As far as acting is concerned, this is arguably(or inarguably) Aamir Khan's best performance. All the supporting actors too, play an important role. And music.. Great music from Rahman.

","RDB is one of the greatest movies to come out of Bollywood. If after decades of senseless for-sake entertainers ruled Bollywood and turned out commercial successes, the intelligent ones were left on the sidelines by the name of art-cinema. If one man could come out with the golden mean and breath life into intelligent, social, revolutionary being commercial cinema... after years it came in the form of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. Rang De Basanti may have been made to just present to the audience with a story that delivered a message. Only if Mehra knew that his story would turn into a movement, and cross the boundaries of being more than just cinema. The Rang De Effect says it all ... RDB has captured and touched the deeper conscience of people all over India. As the capture line reads .. A Generation Awakens .. it certainly sums it up best. RDB has the potential to be a significant part of history as a movement that turned situations on its head, and brought justice to the fastest growing yet corrupt nation. Amazing Direction .. The most innovative Script, with the perfect presentation to communicate with the audience, best supported by a cast that seems to stand out with so much competition within.

A good noble and intellectual story especially for the youth<br/><br/>Patriotism in a new flavoured style<br/><br/>Top class performances by all the star cast.Alice Patten looks cute and acts good.Soha is complete revelation.She looks stunning and acts well Siddharth is quite good with cigarette in his mouth and some pain in eyes.Kunal Kapoor is efficient.Sharman Joshi surprises with his performance.While Atul Kulkarni is brilliant like always<br/><br/>But its Aamir Khan who comes out with a knockout performance.Credit should be given to him for letting all actors so much scope.From the beginning to the end inspite in a streak of powerful performances by others he stands taller than all.After a not upto the mark performance in Mangal Pandey Aamir comes with a vengeance.He makes you sing,laugh and cry too.Bravo Aamir bravo<br/><br/>And thanks to Mr Mehra for making such a nice movie.After a flawfull and overboard Aks this is a welcome back for him.Kudos<br/><br/>From the beginning you will listen a dialogue like this...<br/><br/>'I always believed there are two kinds of people...one who dies screaming and other who dies in silence'<br/><br/>In the end the dialogue changes like this which i don remember exactly but its something like this...<br/><br/>'I always believed there are two kinds of people...one who dies screaming and other who dies in silence'...then i came across the third kind..one who dies laughing...<br/><br/>awesome really awesome dialogue..<br/><br/>And coming to the bo cant say much but i feel it depends much on youths. ....3.5/5"

I don't even have to tell you how inspiring this film is, the whole connection with Bhagat Singh and his revolutionaries and how these modern youth all change to realize how these heroes are still relevant to their societies and how the wrong refuses to be righted and they take on a Punisher-like persona, very superhuman and yet still human. It is quite frankly an amazing film. I had to hold myself back from crying, a thing I rarely do in films these days.<br/><br/>The song and dance routine, often mocked at by lesser people was really great too, really making the mood of this film, especially the last climactic scene, where bullets all run and the movie just goes into a sort of fantasy cum dream state, to soak in the whole incident as it's happening.

Its a story about each and every young Indian, the way we think, the outlook we have about our country. Its incredible, the movie has affected each and every person here in India whose seen it. Now, we really get up and do something ourselves ,to fight the corruption here.. its gr8 to c the youth rising. AAmir has done a wonderful job and just shows that he is really a perfectionist. A R rehman at his best.the music is too Good. the director has done justice to the story.. Sue, being a foreigner does a great job, wit her Hindi!.<br/><br/>3 cheers for the entire team of RDB..each actor is a class apart. simply love the movie.... cant wait to c it again(i have seen it 3 times already)"

","Rakesh Mehra's 'Aks'(2001) was a movie renowned for technical class but lacking artistic ability. He has more than compensated for that in 'Rang De Basanti'. A fantastic movie that all cultures and countries can understand and relate to. The fact that a representative of the erstwhile Colonial Imperialistic Ruler is now more interested in the history of the freedom movement than the youth of the country was a stinging message. The ending showing an uncaring government ordering the guys to be shot even when they give themselves up was originally called unreal, but recent events have proved that to be untrue. As we saw in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, doctors and students from the most prestigious institutes were cruelly beaten up and tear gas and water cannons were launched on them. This augurs well for the west as even those IITians who earlier wanted to stay back in India and help a nation suffering from a westward ho brain drain syndrome are now fervently learning ""The Star Springled Banner"" and ""God Save the Queen"". I support all those doctors who were mercilessly beaten up by an unevolved police force consisting of semi-cro magnon apes who only know how to be bigger criminals than the criminals themselves. My 'Rang De Basanti' will not end with an assassination of Arjun Singh or the Mumbai police commissioner, but will end with my living in Europe and watching CNN as this garbage dump burns."

","Rang De Basanti , a movie starting with fun , migrating back to the history , returning back to the present and finally inspiring the future of this country . The direction is really good as it successfully creates a linkage between the past and present with repeat dialog's such as ""Mar Dalo"". Allice Patten as Su, the filmmaker from UK is perfect and her Hindi gels well with her acting . She comes back to India to make a film on the independence martyr , but finds that the fire of patriotism which she read about in her grandfathers dairy doesn't any exist any longer . The patriotism has been replaced by the materialistic lost youth who thinks India as a poor ,corruption infected place and are completely pessimistic about the future . But , not all youth are like that and Madhavan as a IAF Pilot portrays it very well , especially in the lounge bar scene when they discuss about the country and their responsibilities . The movie seems a bit stretched in mid way especially during the shooting of the movie on martyr , but it was bit necessary also to express the message to the youths of today. The songs are good , but one needs to hear it 2-3 times to really love the songs. Aamir Khan looks old quite a time , but he still manages to portray the role very well because he is no doubt , one of the most talented actor of India. Siddharth has done excellent role as the son of Anupam Kher and one of the friends of Aamir Khan , and also Kunal as Aslam . Soha Ali looks beautiful, seems she can be really one of the leading ladies of the tinsel town in 1-2 years . The cinematography is just amazing , Rakyesh mehra being and Ad film maker himself definitely exploits his cinematography sense in the movie. Overall, the movie is a must watch , but those who can resist a bit of lecture in the middle ."

It should make people rethink whether their 9 to 5 and materialistic pursuits is what we are here for...<br/><br/>Watch this movie for the message and the entertainment - all in one. Well done. A new high for Bollywood in coming up with original stories, a polished look, and a great cast. Aamir Khan is a chimera - easily playing a rambunctious youth and freedom fighter in the same movie. The rest of the cast does not have a ""star"" look to it, but that's their appeal - they are like you and me. This gets the message across easier - you can be the change."

(eg. DDLJ, DTPH, KKHH, KNPH, MR.India, Mohabattein, KKKG, Raja, Rangeela, Hum).<br/><br/>Every Indian should watch this movie, every item in this movie is great the actors, the music, the location each & every thing is great.

","I saw this movie as soon as it released simply for aamir khan. And again this man has not disappointed me. There is absolutely no other actor in Hindi film industry who has the guts to sign only one film every year and produce super hits. It requires a lot of courage and even shahrukh khan accepts it. Coming to the movie. It has some fantastic songs,the flashback and camera work is excellent. I won't be surprised if the camera man and editing wins national award. By far the best portrayal of bhagat singh and other freedom fighters.I have watched all the bhagat singh movies but no other movie really made such impact. Mainly because the previous films failed to describe the true spirit of those young freedom fighters and were melodramatic. Only thing which surprised me was the killing of defence minister which was made to look very easy. But the biggest surprise was the end. And the end was so fast and unexpected that suddenly it makes u think an u forget everything else.I wouldn't say the movie is outstanding or the greatest Hindi movie ever made. But once u watch it, it hits u hard and hits you exactly where it should."

","This is probably the best movie that I have see in recent times. Honestly, I watched this movie because I knew the musical score was done by the one and only A R Rahman. There is no doubting or questioning the guy, he is just simply the best. In fact, right now I'm listening to Tu Bin Bataaye. That is my favorite song out of the whole album. The music is just mind blowing, thank you so much Rahman sahib. Well as I was saying, I originally watched the movie for the songs but what I got was a two in one. Great songs and an awesome film. This is what you call good cinema. I wait and search for good political cult films that also can be considered entertainment rather than a boring piece of work that is only informative. This movie literally has it all. A film on youth definitely has to have partying, going out, eating, and just being careless and yet it has much more. It also has good drama not melodrama, it has a message and a theme that speaks to you. Good jokes in between as well.<br/><br/>What I love especially is the way the actors portray the characters so well. I love the way they all bond with each other on screen. Well I feel that I'm being repetitive but this is just too good of a movie, please do not miss this one, I beg you! OH and make sure to listen to the music, it is the best.<br/><br/>Other movie I would recommend: Bombay by Mani Ratnam, Water by Deepa Mehta, Swades by Ashutosh Gowariker and Lagaan by Ashutosh Gowariker."

I felt the effects of Rang De Basanti (RDB) for the next couple of days  I was disturbed. Recently, the movie that did it to me was ""Crash""  that brilliant movie directed by Paul Haggis with an ensemble cast that took on characters with different racial backgrounds and explored the type of impact society stereotypes have created.

","A group of sensualistic college students live the high life. Though outwardly they seem swayed by the consumerism and shallow popular culture rampant in the country ,the truth couldn't be any different. The protagonists' complete fecklessness coupled with their indifference to worldly issues lies in stark contrast to the rat race and bourgeois careerist ideals espoused by a large segment of the youth and particularly the middle class. They feast on their senses and their life is simply an intersection of their youth and time which they seize in enjoyment...The metamorphosis of such sensualists into revolutionaries is bewildering yet fascinating...but not a surprise if their actions in the first part of the movie are carefully observed. After all the most potent courage is a product of reckless temperaments and the fuel of revolutionary struggle 'passion' is most abundant in sensualists...Plot and character are both well developed...the non linear tempo with cross cutting between the 1920s and today's India builds an effective bridge between the young revolutionaries of the freedom struggle and our group of young protagonists'. Cinematography is excellent especially some of the deep focus shots which combine rich textures of the human form(like when the protaginists run deliriously screaming tearing off their shirts in the mustard field)along with breath-taking spacious landscapes to create a stunning portrait ambient in colour and effusive in emotion. The mise en scene accurately depicts the void of absurdism faced by our heroes which they fill by living on edge( a flagging self esteem due to the bourgeois rat race coupled with feelings of impotence at not having a voice in the corrupt politicized society reflects our heroes exhibitionisms.) The mise en scene of the frame in which two of our protagonists stand on the edge of a precipice guzzling beer highlight their capracious exhibitionism when faced with the absurd.<br/><br/>A very touching and idealized portrayal of India's youth, which also celebrates their great potentional.

","I found Rang De Basanti nice not because of its story, or plot (which I think is too subjective) but because of the camera angles ( at least now i can say, BOLLYWOOD HAS ARRIVED! in that department, with confidence...), background score, acting, and of course, Kunal Kapoor. I liked the way the past merges into the present. And the way they have compared the past scenario with that of the present. The film is very appetizing visually. But apart from that, I really don't find any motive behind this movie. Was it meant for entertainment? Or was it meant to give its audiences some food for thought? Or just another Bollywood emotional drama? The characters in the movie were too drastic. I feel sad for those innocent men who were sacrificed because of two women : ""Gulabo"" is the one who is making the movie and sort of mobilizes them, Soha's character who very cold bloodedly says, ""kill him!"" And she doesn't get punished for the murder! Well, come on now, didn't these people have minds of their own? Couldn't they have talked about their plight on the radio without all that bloodshed? Exposed the people who had wronged them in a better, more mature way rather than those typically clichéd adrenalin driven Punjabi men brought up on lassi and butter-soaked paranthas? I'd rather vouch for Yuva by Mani Ratnam where the youthful energy is channelized in a constructive manner. And something that was absolutely maddening was Madhavan getting shot in the Jalianwala Bagh and saying something like, ""Oh no you spoiled my jacket!"" For Heaven's sake, have some respect for those thousands of people who died out there battling for our freedom!"

The other commendable job done was the stylistic treatment and the cinematogarphy.All the dialogues avoided clichés and the ingenuity is remarkable.The four friends are drawn from reality and there is absolutely nothing in them that makes an ordinary college going student difficult to relate to.The character of Karan is however the best illustrated-silent,brooding,detached yet bound by a fierce loyalty to friends is quite an achievement and the actor has successfully lived upto the expectations,maybe even surpassing it.He is one character who stands out among the crowd... However the only problem with the movie was the overwhelming cinematic and melodramatic ending.The deaths were unwarranted when they came only to surrender and this is an improbable occurrence in a democracy.When the entire nation knows the truth,it is unlikely that the government will take such a step of complete annihilition."

Their lightheartedness is a mirror, as shown by the family life that each must go to at the end of the day. It is as if the daytime antics are only a way to live in a make believe world for as long as they can, knowing that at the end of the day, they will have to face the reality of their miserable lives. It moves on to their initial resistance to accept the sacrifices of their forefathers to win a land under colonial domination. To them, it was a waste of effort as the country went to the dogs anyway. The real story starts after that. The past and the present merge seamlessly to give a heartbreaking story ending.

But it is the treatment and the contemporary touch given to ""Rang De.."" that makes it fall apart from the other movies.<br/><br/>This movie does not have the shallow patriotism of Manoj Kumar movies, neither it has the hollow feeling of morality depicted in ""Dev"" or ""Bombay"". It is a very down to earth movie that asks the same question again - the purpose of life of an average Indian and the corrupt system.<br/><br/>I entered the theatre expecting it to be some kind of either a biography of Chandrashekhar Azaad/Bhaghat Singh, or some antics of so called ""collegeians"". But right from the opening scenes do you realize that you are not watching a typical ""run-of-the-mill"" kind of movie. The setup of the movie is Delhi University - but there are no sissy principals, no stupid professors, students do not dance in the corridors. In fact, college is just used as a sort of backdrop to show the contemporary youth of India.<br/><br/>The story goes likes this. Sue, a movie-maker, who is grand-daughter of a jailer during British rule comes to India to make a movie based on lives of freedom fighters. She has a hand written diary, handed down by her grand-father,which accounts the details of last days of these freedom fighters. How she manages to shoot the movie and how the movie affects the life of the ""actors"" who enact the roles - forms the crux of the movie. Since I have not seen Denys Arcand's Jesus De Montreal, it would be difficult to tell as to how heavily does ""Ran De.."" borrows from ""Jesus.."" But for Indian spectators, ""Rang De.."" sure brings a change from the routine cinema.<br/><br/>Rakesh Mehra proves , that you do not need the lavish plains of Europe or Alpine backdrops to make a successful movie. There are no designer outfits, no lavish sets and homes, no BMWs. The actors are as ""next door"" as they can be. The good part is - there are no songs that ruin the pace of movie. Songs are only there when they are needed and do not obstruct the flow of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is in two parts - One that depicts the life of Chandrashekhar Azaad, Ram Prasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh and his fellow freedom fighters. The other part depicts the moral dilemma that the actors face after having gone into the ""skin"" of these characters. But these two parts are very cleverly interwoven, without any shoddy patchwork. The ""past"" has been deftly shot in the ""sepia"" , which really sets the tone of the ""documentary"". The story frequently switches between the past and the present, and this switch is very skilfully handled.<br/><br/>The photography is one of the foremost strength of this movie. Whether it is the friends hanging out in an old fort or whether it is the Golden Temple in Amritsar - the cameraman has done excellent job. It proves once again, that the good movies should be always seen in theatres, not on a TV.<br/><br/>All the actors have given their best. It is difficult to point out any particular performance. Although, I believe Aamir sometimes goes on top, re-enacting his ""tapori"" kind of role in Rangeela. Even though it is Soha Ali Khan's sixth movie (as per IMDb), her acting shows a lot of maturity. The only disappointment comes in form of Om Puri, who has a very brief role.<br/><br/>AR Rehman once again reaffirms his position as the topmost music directors of recent times. Music has a contemporary feel - yet it is not jarring to ears. Nowhere does the music overpowers the movie. Still it is very effectively used to set the mood of the movie.<br/><br/>To summarize, it is after long time (perhaps after ""Lagaan"") that Indian screen has seen such a masterpiece. Hope it sweeps all the awards during the next year, and maybe get nominated for Oscar. Let us keep our fingers crossed and pray...."
"ankur-ab","10","0","4","11 February 2006"," Indian Cinema at its best.
","Past few months have perhaps produced one of the best movies in Bollywood. Two names that quickly come to my are Rang de Basanti and . Black. Rang de basanti is inspiring and yet light. The chemistry between each characters including Sue was amazing to say the least. Aamir once again proved why is the best actor in Hindi cinema till date and he must have obviously silenced his critcs (those who favor Srk). Rang de basanti is a must watch for youth and all generations as it properly brings out the feeling that youth undergoes when faced with current realities of life. The screenplay, story and direction was flawless. Rakeysh Mehra though was very good with Aks but this time he stuck it right to the birds eye. Sure this will take him to league of big directors. As for Aamir he proved that any role, any character is a piece of cake for him. The way he shared the screen and yet stole the show proves that the actor is way beyond his peers. Having said that the performance by each of his costars was commendable. A modern patriotic film, it is sure to set you thinking about our responsibility towards our country. Do not miss it."

"manutd2india","10","0","4","31 January 2006"," Youth trying to change the state of NATION(politicians)
","I went to the movie with little expectation especially after Amir's below-par movie 'MANGAL PANDEY',which was really hyped-up movie and didn't do well at BO..Even though it was a good movie, it fell flat because of its expectations..but this movie s rocking..<br/><br/>I ve seen lots n lots of movies but now this movie is n the top of my all time favorite list..The movie is really great and it left me speechless..such id it impact..It grips u from the start till the end..A really great patriotic movie<br/><br/>The Story line is pretty well executed, defying the archetypical mode bollywood movies are shot; constantly shifting between two similar story lines and lacing it with the single line witty comedy in the first half. Some lines that hold you rapt with attention are Aamir Khan's ""Sue kar mere man ko"" and Sharman Joshi's belch, when Sue asks them to feel the character before reciting acting them. We immediately strike parallels with the characters and settle in snugly within 20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>About the acting of cast... Madhavan doesn't have too much scope and is anyways credited with a ""Special Appearance"".He has done good with whatever little that he has to do.<br/><br/>Siddharth is nothing short of brilliance, giving a cool demeanor to his character which cracks under stress and has displayed these emotions very well.He looks intense and is the best among the young actors.. <br/><br/>Sharman Joshi, bring him on fellas .. he is not only your ""Style"" bhai but can do much much more when given the platform to perform, here is one actor that has risen from this movie apart from Siddharth. <br/><br/>Kunal Kapoor was anyways a good actor, even in Meenaxi and he continues his good form.<br/><br/>Soha Ali Khan gets the 70's Sharmila Tagore back to life, acting et all. From someone who was expected to give probably a mediocre performance, she rocks the movie filling it with simplicity and a certain honesty to her character and she looks very pretty in the movie.. Aamir the king of acting, shows us why he is the best actor amongst us now. The ""breakdown"" scene with Alice Patton is simply mind boggling, I am sure he would have actually cried to get it right.<br/><br/>Alice Patton moves seamlessly with her brown counterparts often making us forget that it's a foreigner among Indians in this movie, her sincerity with Hindi demanding a special attention.She plays a vital role in the movie and holds the movie together..<br/><br/>Atul Kulkarni was his usual self, you almost expected him to mouth his ""Abhivadayee"" dialogue from Hey Ram and he continues his brilliant acting stint from page3 and his other movies. <br/><br/>The other actors were almost wasted and just drifted along in the proceedings with the exception of Kirron Kher.<br/><br/>There has been a plethora of issues treated very well in this movie, among many more the attitude of Indian youngsters towards patriotism, the anger against corruption and Hindu-Muslim animosity and the ultimate patch up with never seems forced.<br/><br/>Bollywood is slowly (and thankfully !) coming of age and this is one of its best examples. This movie is sure to sweep the masses at large of its feet for its sheer sincerity and brilliant performances and direction.<br/><br/>An exceptional movie and must watch for all u patriotic INDIANS!!"
"aroon_81","9","0","4","30 January 2006"," Bollywood Awakens
","2006 didn't start well for bollywood until now.. Rang de has struck gold with this.. A story about bringing a change well told by taking parallels in the history of India.. <br/><br/>Rakesh mehra redeems himself after the Aks debacle and so does Aamir after Mangal pandey... Heres an actor who's movies are awaited anxiously caz of the newness and the originality in the subject and Rang de is as original as u can get.. Superbly picturised , with sterling performances by all esp Siddharth (Aka Karan), Sharman (Aka Sukhi) , Alice patten (sue) and above all the man himself Aammir who at the age of 40plus enacts the role of college guy with ease.. he gets his teeth sunk in to the character.. One of my fav scenes is when he breaks down in front of sue.. top class stuff. <br/><br/>Another point is the detailing of the North of India. I lived there for about 7 yrs so i know how they r.. things like aamir opening a beer bottle with his Kada.. aamir doing bhangra when its tech-no fast track.. its typical north stuff.. Kiron Kher scolding Soha to eat more and put on some weight.. all this is so the kind of loving people the north Indians are.. <br/><br/>Music is another highpoint of the movie it totally blends with the situation and is very haunting.. <br/><br/>In short don't miss out on this one.. <br/><br/>KUDOS"
"saraswat_puneet","10","0","4","1 February 2006"," The movie runs at fast pace correlating Indian freedom movement with the situation of present day youth.
","This is a movie with a great social message without over burdening lectures on patriotism and ethics. The situation faced by todays youth is presented in good script. Characters are well woven, specially DJ and Karan are outstanding. The sense of humor of characters is awesome and truly relates to this generation. Movie never bores for a single minute. Music is also fresh and goes with the theme of movie. All in all a great movie. A must watch for todays youth.<br/><br/>The only point I like would say is that climax is little lose. Those guys may have surrendered by announcing it on radio itself. Their death was not necessary."
"anurag_st_goat","10","0","4","31 January 2006"," Unexpectedly EXCELLENT.
","For me the only word to describe it was AWESOME. i am a 17 yr old student in India and ill tell u nothing has ever come close to describing my and people my age s' thoughts like this movie. I identified with this movie more than even Dil Chahta Hai. The quality of this movie can be understood by the fact that after the movie was over the other dudes of my age or around who were watching this movie gave it a standing ovation wen it got over. Neone who's gone to the movies will know that the age group of 16 - 25 yrs males are da hardest to please unless the movie in question is American pie.The effect of the movie on me was a feeling of complete upliftment and a deep sense of patriotism in a strange way. I know some people found the end somewhat too drastic but what can u expect from a generation weaned on ram gopal vermas underworld movies and gangsta rap. The plus points of the movies are numerous - gorgeous cinematography, amazing soundtrack, awesome acting, and uncannily actual jokes. Of course with aamir khan as the lead actor nothing could go wrong in the acting department. Another thing about Aamir, when i first heard he was going to play a college student i thought it would be another utterly unbelievable college dude like Srk in k2h2 or Hrithik in K3G but he pulled it off marvelously everything form the tattoo to the chains to the ripped jeans and of course the hairstyle was pitch perfect,But what was very surprising was the language, especially the cussing, which sounded exactly like me having a chat with my pals. Special mention - Sharman Joshis accent and completely believable acting by Siddarth. Of course there are some small things which reminded it was a bollywood movie i was watching such as the stereotypical industrialist dad, a weeping mom mourning her sons dead and the undeniable Muslim fundamentalist angle in the form of Om Puri. But overall a simply fantastic movie for everyone especially the young generation."

","This is a must watch!! Amazing direction! Mind Blowng performance! cinematography... just too good! <br/><br/>I think the msg of the movie is loud and clear.. ""Either live with it ..or be responsible to change it"" .. <br/><br/>Its a youthful drama.. the director has nicely related the story of these youths to the historic events!! .. and he has amazingly portrayed the historic events as well.. like jallianwala bagh .. simon go back .. etc ... very neatly done!! ... All these historic events r reflected in the lives of these young ppl.. they r in the similar situation .. and they don't live with it.. they decide to change the conditions! <br/><br/>Rakeysh has captured some amazing scenes in the movie.. 1. all the historic scenes are amazing .. esp. jallianwala bagh 2. aamir and gang speeding cars and bikes. 4. aamir and gang jumping and trying to reach for MIG. 3. climax scene. and a lot more!!!<br/><br/>Well, they all sacrifice their life in the end... but they ignite the spark... which was needed. Exactly the same as what bhagat singh and other heros had done in the past.. <br/><br/>Well.. the rebel has arrived!!"
"pratyushh_iiita","10","0","4","31 January 2006"," this movie can bring change
","We come across number of excellent movies but what is it that make this a special one. we keep talking about the movie and discuss good and odd of it but how often some thing like that has made our mind baffle about the issues which are not burning but keep creeping in the hearts and never thought to hustle them. I found this movie one of those which can churn the emotion to ya you guessed it write. change change change. when I with some of my friends went to see the movie we found few thing quite unreasonable like parts of old freedom fighter and a analogy was shown between what they did for there freedom and what we youngsters were to do for our freedom from a clean and non-corrupt India. But after a deep consolidated thinking i came to understanding what was the need. It can be understood as youngsters are not letting in their lives because it was personal rather it is same as freedom fighter thought that the fight was for country and the reason they took such an extremist path was personal or say their love for their leader."
