","I don't know where to begin. If one judges a film by its ability to literally transport the viewer to another time and place, this film succeeds. If one judges a film by the cinematography, the composition of the scenes, whether the characterizations are well drawn, this film succeeds. If one judges a film's merits on integrity, truthfulness, honesty, this film succeeds. Good Night and Good Luck captures a moment in time.We look back on the fifties as a simpler time, our period of innocence. This film tells us straight and true that it was no simpler and no more innocent than our lives today.In fact, the sharpest contrast drawn between today and back then is the intelligence and the literacy, the erudition and the commitment to the tenets of good journalism of Edward R. Murrow and his crew.I cannot picture a Brian Williams or anyone else telling the owner of the network, as Murrow tells Bill Paley, ""I can't make it to the game tonight. Thanks for inviting me, but I'm busy tearing down your network."" A flawlessly executed film, the acting ensemble well cast, the point clearly and eloquently made, this film should be nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe and anything else that's out there. Thank you George Clooney. Your father is correct. ""You got it right."" Thank you Steven Soderburgh. Thank you, Mr. Murrow."
"abelardo64","8","409","487","18 September 2005"," Come back Mr. Murrow!
","My hat to George Clooney. He doesn't take the easy way out. His seriousness of purpose is undeniable and his talents as a filmmaker a concrete reality. This, his second feature, is a no frills account of a period in American history that left visible scars but, as it happens, many have forgotten. History repeats itself but its protagonists seem diluted in this modern obsession with political correctness. David Strathairn - best actor at the Venice Film Festival - is chillingly perfect as Edward R Murrow, reminding us that TV times have changed in an unrecognizable way. The space for real thought on network news has been replaced by the circus atmosphere of 24 hour cable shows with loud mouths, sound effects and video graphics. The inter-cutting between Murrow/Strathairn and the real Senator McCarthy creates the perfect illusion of a startling reality. The timing of the film couldn't be more perfect. I hope we can all fill in the voids and connect the dots. It's time to look back and think before our past becomes our future. Thank you Mr Clooney, thank you very much."
"seaview1","8","223","265","12 October 2005"," America on Trial in GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK
","Actor/Director George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero, the newsman of newsmen, Edward R. Murrow, in Good Night, and Good Luck.<br/><br/>In the early 1950's, the Communist scare and the subsequent subversion of citizens' rights was at its apex with blacklists and rampant accusations resulting in ruined lives and careers. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television. With his show's director, Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and his production team, he picks one obscure news item regarding an Air Force serviceman who is dismissed due to unspecified charges. Murrow and CBS essentially take on the US Air Force amid this climate of suspicion and presumed guilt. Later, Murrow's team takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy by making critical comments of the senator's own words and contradictions. McCarthy retaliates with accusations of Murrow's supposed association with un-American groups just as the parent network, CBS, reels under sponsorship pressure and the unpredictable whims of network president William Paley (Frank Langella). As Murrow and his own staff come under tense scrutiny by McCarthy and even CBS, public reaction and the response of the print media come to the forefront.<br/><br/>Nothing can compare to the words that were written and spoken with such conviction and honesty as those uttered by Murrow. The title of the movie is a direct quote that Murrow employed to sign off each week at the close of his interview shows. The filmmakers (including director Clooney and writers Clooney and Grant Heslov) were wise to let the text stand on its own. They also benefit from good performances from a cast headed by Strathairn (L.A. Confidential, A League of Their Own), a journeyman actor who has finally found a core role to call his own, and he makes the most of it. He gets the mannerisms and cadence down quite convincingly, and while Strathairn may not look exactly like Murrow, he has the persona nailed. Frank Langella (Dave) is excellent as the mercurial Paley whose support of Murrow was tenuous at best. Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) registers in what could have been a more defined role as a doomed newsman whose guilt by association triggers some life changing events. Patricia Clarkson (The Station Agent) and Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) as secretly married staffers, Joe and Shirley, round out the cast. Ironically, perhaps the best performance can be attributed to McCarthy himself as newsreels offer a fascinating, perverse glance at the infamous politician whose flamboyance and dogged theatrics doomed the careers of many government officials and film or television actors. The duel between Murrow and McCarthy seems like two heavyweights going at it verbally in the public arena.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Robert Elswit (Magnolia) is crisp and starkly lit in black and white to evoke the past. The production design and costumes are consistent with the period. Just the sight of newsmen typing on old style typewriters or production assistants carrying around film reels instead of videotape or discs is amusing. The editing by Stephen Mirrione (Traffic, 21 Grams) is tight and well paced. At times the studio broadcasts of a female blues singer bridges various sequences in theme and mood. The broadcast of a live network news program is staged with realism and with the frenzy and excitement that only live television could bring. One wonders what TV veterans like Sidney Lumet or Robert Altman could have brought to the table.<br/><br/>Murrow's show was kind of a precursor to the current granddaddy of all prime time news shows, 60 Minutes. It was interesting to see that his was not a perfect career having to mix fluffy showbiz interviews with such personalities as Liberace on his Person-to-Person show with legitimate news reports. At 93 minutes, the film surprisingly seems a bit short. You almost feel like this is a big budget episode of the famous You Are There reenactment shows. The story ends almost abruptly as it begins being bookended by a formal event honoring Murrow in 1958.<br/><br/>A couple of things don't quite work in the film. The characters of Joe and Shirley must come to terms with the network's policy forbidding marriage among its coworkers, but this subplot doesn't significantly serve to move the story forward. Clooney shows a workman-like approach to directing the film but it just doesn't grab you as emotionally as you would like. You sit there entranced by the history but are never fully given to the pathos of its characters. Instead, the film becomes almost a quasi-documentary bereft of much feeling.<br/><br/>As previous films have dealt with the Red Scare and blacklists, this film compares favorably with The Front and the great television movie Fear on Trial. Although the Soviet Union was a major threat to the United States during the Cold War, the accusatory enemy from within was perhaps as great a menace. The implications and parallels to today's political climate and the role television has in shaping perception are clearly the point Clooney and gang are trying to make. Murrow's formal speech, which begins and ends the film's story, is itself a prophetic and sobering commentary and indictment of the possibilities of television and foreshadows the future with amazing prescience. It shows that one man made a difference. Such is the testament to a heroic reporter whose integrity this film manages to capture, albeit in a brief history lesson."
"bagloon","Null","359","436","13 October 2005"," Clooney's presentation of McCarthy
","The film does not - as some have suggested - unfairly portray McCarthy as a sub-human monster. Its presentation of McCarthy is limited strictly to the thread of the storyline and never does it waver toward name-calling or character assassination. This is particularly striking given that MCarthy was a well-seasoned alcoholic and clearly suffered from a narcissistic personality disorder. He was ripe for parody because his eccentricities were so pronounced, but this film is remarkably even-handed about the Senator's deeds and behavior. There are no allusions either to his peculiar friendship with Roy Cohn, whose notorious homosexual relations with private G. David Schine eventually led to McCarthy's demented charge that the Army was infested with Communists. Some have even suggested that McCarthy was no stranger to gay trysts. All of this could have made for an explosive - and typical - ""Hollywood"" movie and would indeed have been propagandistic, shallow and simple-minded. Instead Clooney has made an intelligent, cogent, fair-minded film about ethics, high standards and integrity."
"jotix100","8","106","130","21 October 2005"," Broadcast news
","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is the kind of film that has elicited strong opinions in the IMDb forum. In fact, most of the critics point out at the manipulation of the actual events and what they perceive as character assassination of the late Joseph McCarthy and the role he played during the ""witch hunt"" conducted by the late senator from Wisconsin. Whether these points are right, or wrong, in the minds of the contributors, most seem to disregard the film on that criteria, alone.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" shows a time in the American past that served as the model in the way television introduced the format in which the news was going to be shown to the country using the emerging technology to keep people informed. As such, CBS under William Paley's leadership, amassed a lot of talent and it became the yardstick in which other news programs were going to be judged against. George Clooney, in his second directorial job, recreates what he and his co-writer, Grant Heslov, thought about that period at the beginning of the era of television news.<br/><br/>The film has a documentary style that serves well to illustrate the story being told. Most of it occurring in the CBS studios in New York during the fifties. The crisp black and white cinematography, by Robert Elswit, gives the movie a nostalgic look to the way things were done in those days. Mr. Clooney has inserted scenes where a black jazz singer interprets some standard songs as though it might have been the next program following the actual news hour, and act as a buffer in the events being presented.<br/><br/>At the center of the story is Edward R. Murrow, the CBS anchor at the time. Mr. Murrow was greatly admired for his contributions during WWII and his broadcasts from London bringing commentaries about the war to America. Mr. Murrow was a giant in the field, most admired by all Americans because his integrity and the way he presented his stories, which ranged from the sublime, to the ridiculous, as it is the case with the interview with Liberace in Sherman Oaks where he asked the entertainer about his future wedding plans. <br/><br/>The strong cast assembled for the film is excellent. David Strathairn, one of our most versatile actors plays the leading role. His take on Murrow's mannerisms and the way he spoke to his audience in front of the camera is captured with great detail. Mr. Strathairn gives a good performance, but one never really knows much about the man in the way the screen play has been written. Yes, one gets the impression of Mr. Murrow's high ethics, but as far as what made him tick, one has to wait for another biopic to find out.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast plays well under Mr. Clooney's direction. Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels, and George Clooney are seen in the newsroom as they portray their models under Mr. Clooney's direction."
"jsemovieman","9","147","183","11 October 2005"," One of the very best films of the year.
","""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is one of the best films of the year. Beautifully directed by George Clooney (who also co-stars), this is a film that exercises a powerful message and social commentary that remains relevant today. Filmed in tight frames of black and white, ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" also brings back the smoke-filled atmosphere of broadcast journalism and television in the 1950s. The film focuses around CBS journalist Edward Murrow and his attempts to take down Senator Joseph McCarthy through his news program, ""See it Now."" David Strathairn, playing Edward Murrow, gives one of the best performances of the year and is surely swimming in Oscar territory. Clooney makes his biggest leap in the film industry yet. He, too, may join Strathairn for an Oscar nomination, but in the Best Director category. Filming in black and white, and interspersing news conferences with actual footage of McCarthy, Clooney is an emerging talent worth watching. The ending and the very last frame lets ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" stay with those who watch it. It ends very abruptly, as if Clooney wants to show the failing, yet lasting effort Murrow had--how he stands as a symbol for the continuation of truth and who is willing to bring it out to the public. The end has a very honest bleak tone to it--we want to see Murrow continue to let the public know what's actually going on in the country, but one man's fight isn't good enough. Clooney chooses a perfect and powerful ending. He makes a bold statement on how public interest in television has contributed to the decay of society, whether it is 1950 or 2005."
"schappe1","9","88","109","13 November 2005"," When Things Were Black and White
","I've had the ""Edward R. Murrow"" Collection from CBS for years and have enjoyed watching it's biography of Murrow, the complete Milo Radulovich, McCarthy and Annie Lee Moss shows many times. I'm sure George Clooney must have these as well as he used the actual footage extensively in his fine drama ""Good Night and Good Luck"". As a previous poster said, by concentrating on what was actually presented, Clooney is able to focus on the ethical issues that were the real substance of the broadcasts, rather than the tragicomic personalities involved. He wants us to see that the same issues are in our lives today, (Clooney has had his own battles with would-be modern McCarthys like Bill O'Reilly), but he isn't going to force the issue. He's doing exactly what Murrow and Friendly did with the McCarthy broadcast: using the actual record to tell the story.<br/><br/>There are minor, but significant embellishments, mostly an impressive cast of actors who can tell us more with one look than an entire speech. Leading the way is David Straithairn as Murrow. Except for possessing a higher pitched voice than the original, he's got his man down cold. I would pick Frank Langella as William Paley, here presented as a man with ideals but who is rooted in the realities of business, the sort of guy who has to make the tough decisions the idealists like Murrow don't have to or want to deal with. Then there is Ray Wise as the vulnerable Don Hollenbeck, who was one of the co-creators of ""You Are There"", a program this film somewhat resembles. He wound up being ""there"" when he didn't really want to be.<br/><br/>What really enhances the show is the black and white photography, (actually, according to the notes, it was ""The film was shot on color film on a grayscale set, then color-corrected in post""  whatever that means). Not only does it heighten the drama, (magazine photographers, in the days when they had a choice, said ""black and white for drama, color for excitement""), but the tremendous resolution seems to bring out each furrow and poor on each person's face, allowing the viewer to see into their souls."
"reddpill","9","119","151","16 October 2005"," Strathairn and documentary footage produce a winner
","This film was a real treat, with Strathairn's dead-on performance as legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow a sure bet for at least an Oscar nomination. Perhaps the best decision by writer-director George Clooney was to cast no one in the role of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Instead, Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy in the HUAC hearings and press conferences. Movies based on actual historical events often sensationalize events, but the extensive use of documentary footage brings home the reality of this movie's story line.<br/><br/>In addition to Strathairn's best performance to date, the entire cast delivers, from Clooney himself as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly, to Frank Langella as CBS chairman William Paley, to Ray Wise as the insecure anchorman Don Hollenbeck. If there is a weak point in the cast, it is Jeff Daniels, who was given little to do in the role of news director Sig Mickelson and did little with it.<br/><br/>As most people today are acquainted with the 1950s through black-and-white images, the decision to film in black-and-white also feels appropriate, and helps the documentary footage to blend in seamlessly with the filmed actors. The only real failing of the movie is the lack of real drama. Throughout, Murrow and the gang are seen to have the upper hand, although they sweat about the potential consequences of every action. The slice of history, the ideas presented concerning the proper role of news media, and the terrific performances all more than make up for this, however, and I strongly recommend this film to those who lived through the McCarthy era and to those, such as myself, who only have witnessed it in the rear view mirror."
"fred-287","Null","35","42","31 October 2005"," Got smoke?
","The brilliance of George Clooney's ""Good Night and Good Luck"" lies in it's very tight (almost claustrophobia-inducing) evocation of an early 1950's news studio with all those clean-cut button-down white guys (the few women on hand tend to get sent on errands) with their horn-rimmed glasses and their bottles of Scotch and their ubiquitous cigarettes. There is so much smoke wafting around that it becomes the element in which these guys function, like the water in a fish tank. Clooney didn't need to pound the point home by showing the ad for Kent cigarettes but I did get a chuckle out of it. The heady mixture of nicotine and testosterone palpably drives the news crew toward their fateful piece on Sen. Joe McCarthy which, for all they know in advance, may be the cliff over which their lives and careers plunge. Clooney has impressed me hugely with his ability to keep this great ensemble cast (including himself, not as the ""star"") on pace. I avoided his ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (having had my fill of that ""Gong Show"" guy back in the Seventies) but I look forward to his future directorial efforts. D. Strathairn is quietly masterful as Edward R. Murrow; I look forward to being disappointed when the Academy snubs him for an Oscar nomination. The comparison between the anti-communism crusade then and the anti-terrorism crusade now is merely made available to be observed, not trumpeted to the heavens. The line ""Dissent is not disloyalty"" sums it up pithily.<br/><br/>Given what ""Night"" does so well, it seems almost churlish on my part to mention some things it doesn't do and probably couldn't have done without disrupting it's artistic confines. I personally would have liked a sense of how the ""Red scare"" permeated the populace as a whole; I would recommend Cedric Belfrage's book ""The American Inquisition"" which includes annual ""fever charts"" detailing that in 1953 the town of Moscow, Idaho demanded that the capital of the Soviet Union change it's name, or when citizens in Wisconsin were asked ""What is a Communist"" responses included ""A crook, I suppose"" or ""A person who wants war."" In 1954 a woman legally changed her name from Allred to Allgood and a high school in Idaho expunged the word ""comrade"" from the school song. Sound a little silly? Does anyone remember ""freedom fries"" recently? It also would've been a big mouthful to chew if ""Night"" had made the point that ""Tailgunner Joe"" was essentially a figurehead. He himself had little interest in communism until it became a ticket to fame; he got most of his headline-grabbing tidbits from the American Reichsfuehrer J. Edgar Hoover (McCarthy was a frequent guest in Hoover's private box at the local racetrack) and he was tolerated by General Eisenhower until he ""went too far"" and denounced the army as ""pinko."" (""Night"" mentions several real persons whose names were besmirched but not Major Irving Peress, the ""pink dentist,"" whose family received threatening letters and phone calls and rocks thrown through their windows. ""Night"" just barely hints at the anti-Semitic undercurrent of the phobia, culminating in the ""public burning"" of the Rosenbergs for ""giving away the Bomb"" based on evidence that would get laughed out of most courts today.) After McCarthy was allowed to ""twist in the wind"" and drink himself to death, Hoover continued his police-state activities with other allies, but we never heard about any of this until ""Watergate."" Read ""The Boss"" by Athan Theoharis and John S. Cox for the whole sordid story.<br/><br/>By all means see ""Night"" which deserves a ton of credit for getting people thinking about this again if nothing else. By the way, beware of revisionists like Ann Coulter claiming that McCarthy was validated by the ""Venona Project,"" the secret program to intercept and decode Soviet diplomatic telegrams. Only a fraction of the cables were decrypted (some only partly) and their meaning is still debated by scholars. (The Soviets apparently did have two sources within the Manhattan Project, ""Quantum"" and ""Pers,"" who are still unidentified.) To assert, like Coulter, that ""hundreds of agents of an enemy foreign power were working for the U.S. government"" is the kind of logical leap much favored by the Far Right .never mind where that lands.<br/><br/>I wish that ""Night"" had ended with a brief text mentioning that Murrow, a true American hero, died of lung cancer, thus completing the cigarette motif. I'm sure he would have ruefully allowed that there too, ""the fault lies not within our stars but within ourselves"""
"evo8mr","10","121","175","16 October 2005"," A terrific film
","I just saw this film, and I have three words to sum it up: A terrific film.<br/><br/>Yes, there were people who thought this was just leftist propaganda but they all walked out in agreement that 'Good Night' was a very well made movie about a person who exploited fear in the people of the united states in 1953.<br/><br/>David Strathairn gives the performance of his career as Edward R Murrow, a legendary 1950's news reporter. His performance has the complexities, mannerisms and subtleties that you would expect from Murrow. His performance does for Murrow for what Adrien Brody did for Wladyslaw Spilzman, you truly do believe him. Count on a Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>George Clooney's direction, writing and acting are all very strong this side of Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful'. Clooney may direct himself to his first Oscar.<br/><br/>Another revelation in this movie is Frank Langella, who plays Bill Paley (the head of CBS). He backs Murrow and Friendly to the end, but also tells them the cold, hard truth . He tries so hard not to jeopardize the both of them.<br/><br/>All that being said, this may be the underdog movie at this year's Academy Awards. Strathairn and Clooney both give outstanding performances but this year their competition is stiff. Straithairn going after Philip Seymour Hoffman for his performance in ' Capote ' and Clooney going after Peter Sarsgaard for his performance in 'jarhead'.<br/><br/>A very good film and worth the 90 minutes of your time."
"maxlebow","10","74","104","24 January 2006"," Very Relevant
","This film portrays an episode in television history. That period was covered in a class on documentary film that I took many years ago as an undergraduate. So, I've seen the full episodes of Murrow's challenge, McCarthy's attack on Murrow, and Murrow's response.<br/><br/>McCarthy overreached when he went after the Army. And Murrow, I have learned from other sources, waited until McCarthy was politically wounded before challenging him. These elements are missing from the film. My guess is they were omitted to avoid boring the audience.<br/><br/>For those with no experience with McCarthyism, the film may be boring anyway as some have already commented.<br/><br/>However, like Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible, which set McCarthyism in the time frame of the Salem witch trial hysteria, this film does a decent job of portraying the atmosphere of fear engendered by continual hysterical threats to the personal safety of the American people from within or from without. It does not show the chilling effect the atmosphere of fear imposes on the journalist.<br/><br/>It does show a relationship between the corporation and the journalist. This is an important point. It is well made. I find this the most relevant part of the film."
"zeedunn","8","6","6","3 June 2008"," History Made More Understandable
","I heard about McCarthyism when I was in high school or was it middle school? For me, it's one of those events you hear about but can never truly understand. This movie brought me just a little closer to understanding.<br/><br/>It takes place right in the middle of the ""witch hunts"" McCarthy instigated back in the 1950s. Various government employees, actors, and other people on the fringe were accused of being part Communists or Communist sympathizers. Perhaps this person was a Russian spy? They do seem suspicious. I saw them reading leftist newspaper articles the other day. Her brother used to be involved with an organization that is now funding the Russians, etc. McCarthy claimed he had a whole list of people that were suspicious characters. And he had evidence! However, it was in a sealed envelope with nothing written on it, and no one had actually seen the contents that could attest to them. The whole thing was suspicion and hearsay. But, it was effective! People were fired from their jobs, shunned from society, and whispered about in corridors. Imagine the shame.<br/><br/>So in this movie, a CBS news correspondent, Edward R. Murrow, decides to challenge McCarthy. He doesn't directly claim that McCarthy is lying. Only that he wants to see what is in all of these evidence reports. After a tug of war for the hearts of the American people, McCarthy is impeached. This may or may not have been a direct result of the Murrow shows, but it was clear the public tide was turning. In this movie, they show how the events surrounding this showdown might have played out on the inside. There are many meetings and threats. There is much brow-wiping and collar twisting. And it makes for a very riveting film.<br/><br/>We see how this whole thing could have blown up in Murrow's face. We see what a risk he took and how the executive producers of the station might have treated him for taking that risk. We see fear and bravery.<br/><br/>This was a 2005 Oscar nominee in 6 categories, none of which it won. But it is a very interesting piece of work. What's amazing is that this event happened on the heels of the Holocaust and Nuremberg trials. The United States had just spent a lot of time pointing fingers at other countries that had let fear and speculation run the day. Many people got sent to concentration camps based on this same type of rumors and hearsay as displayed in this film.<br/><br/>This film makes for riveting entertainment, but don't try to watch it when you are in the mood for something light. This is a fairly clean picture, rated PG. It could be useful in an educational setting."

","""This instrument can teach, it can illuminate and yes it can inspire. But it can only do so to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is nothing but wires and lights in a box."" Thus spoke Edward R. Murrow, somewhat a legend of broadcast journalism. Better than average but less than legendary is Good Night and Good Luck, a new film about Murrow's historic confrontation with Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The timely themes of the film will not go unnoticed by even mildly aware viewers and though the film is certainly competent, that it perhaps its greatest contribution.<br/><br/>The films opens with Murrow (David Strathairn) giving a speech to the Radio Television News Directors Association. His speech encapsulates much of the problems of that television had then, and still has now. The film shares the beginning of the speech at the beginning of the film and ends with the end of the speech. In between are scenes of the decision making that led to See it Now's confronting of McCarthy and McCarthyism. Other journalists had been poking at McCarthy for some time and Fred Friendly (Clooney) and Murrow found an opportunity to do an excellent piece on television that would add their names to the growing ranks of dissenters. The first shot fired was on Oct. 20, 1953 when See it Now broadcast the story of Air Force reservist Milo Radulovich. He was discharged from the service after his father and sister were labeled as communist sympathizers. Ending the program with, ""the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, even though that iniquity be proved beyond all doubt, which in this case it was not,"" Murrow and Friendly had for the first time taken their personal misgivings about McCarthyism public. This confrontation, and subsequent ones, missed a vital point that the film misses as well. In a free society, what's wrong with being a communist if you want to? Instead of labeling all kinds of people as communists incorrectly, what if McCarthy had been 100% correct? Clooney does not investigate what the problem would have been about having competent professionals, who are communist, in government, or private industry, position. One can only imagine the laughter that would loose should an agitator for a single-payer health system be labeled a subversive Canadian agent. Being a docudrama perhaps it would have been a bit out of place for the film to go there but it was the fundamental flaw of McCarthyist, and anti-communist ideologies, that communists had no place in America, a purportedly free nation.<br/><br/>Clooney does an excellent job fitting the archival footage of McCarthy and others into this film. He guides the film with a good pace but it still seems to be padded a bit. A subplot about the secret marriage of Joe & Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. & Patricia Clarkson) is neat enough and good for a few one-liners but there doesn't seem to be any reason for it to be in the film. It stands in contrast to the subplots of CBS' wavering support for Murrow and the pressures applied to coworker Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) about his supposedly subversive activities. The transitions between scenes are welcome each time with wonderful jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves performing old time pieces in the CBS sound studio. The strength of the performances by Strathairn, Clooney and especially Frank Langella as CBS head William Paley help keep the flaws of the film fairly well hidden.<br/><br/>Though perhaps mildly overstating the importance of Murrow's influence on the downfall of McCarthy, Good Night, and Good Luck does a good job of elucidating the atmosphere of paranoia that pervaded many parts of the country at the time. It makes a strong and enjoyable contribution to the body of work involving the Red Scare but in the opinion of this reviewer, it still misses an important point. After seeing it, if you're taking public transportation home, be sure to listen for the recordings that ask you to look out for suspicious activity around you. Then the real strength of the film will be even more evident."

Segregation signified a rudimentary lack of tolerance for another individual regardless of his race, color or creed!! An issue more pertinent to this film was the fact that the Russians had the hydrogen bomb, which meant every upscale home built in the 1950's included construction of a bomb shelter.. Phobia infiltrated mainstream America,and an integral facet of such archaic thought was ""McCarthyism""...Named after the junior senator from Wisconsin, Joe McCarthy!! The most disturbing aspect to this convoluted logic, otherwise known as Communist trepidation via ""McCarthyism"", was not that some extremist was expounding about the enemy of Communism being ubiquitous!! ..More to the point, this unwarranted paranoia had a strong American market to support it!! What the film ""Good Night and Good Luck"" focused on was the fact that television was not just about watching ""Superman"" and ""Steve Allen"", but also, it served as a vehicle for dissecting the truth ..Now enters Edward R. Murrow !! A newscaster who cogently believed that television was not just tubes and wiring which provided an onslaught of innocuous entertainment, more significantly, it should act as a bevy of information to expose facts to the American public! Countering an issue brought on the potential for depicting lies and distortions about the issue... In this case...McCarthyism!! The small screen communication known as television, which was nationwide, negated the long enjoyed sovereignty for the hegemony of America's revered institutions..in this film, namely, the Air Force!! Television had interpretive reporting to contradict facts issued by military intelligence, this in essence nullified their impunity and carte blanche disposition!!!! McCarthyism was destructive dogma which motivated Edward R. Murrow's professional integrity... Two sides of an issue brought on a liberal view!! Not liberal in the pejorative sense, whereby it manifests itself through patterns of irresponsible behavior, but liberal in the context as a euphemism for intellectual diversification!! This movie was incredibly substantiated by remarkable directing, paramount acting performances, and camera angles which made the cold war motif of this film extremely authentic!! In 1954, television became a tertiary source of information, today it is a primary source of information..This is largely due to the fact that less than 12% of Americans read newspapers!! I recommend to anyone who recognizes that on occasion we encounter milestones in our perception of what reality means in the United States, that they see this film....Ultimately, Edward R. Murrow became the calculated guinea pig for the faulted America...His philosophy of making the distinction between disloyalty and dissent reaffirmed this nation's understanding of our constitutional right of freedom of speech.. Murrow's succinct tenet of how the truth is the truth whether it is heard half way across the world or at the other end of the bar, inevitably prevailed as the television industry's accountability for standards and practices!! Edward R Murrow died a very fortunate man, as he accomplished something most of us do not, his obituary had an added codicil to it that he made a difference in this world... Such a feat is commensurate with the accomplishments such as having a lot of people who love and respect you, or the gratifying reward of raising a child properly!! The inadvertent cultural and social conflicts that television besieged the American people with, let the proverbial horse out of the barn, hence, television would change America forever!! George Clooney, the director of this film, who has had a fabulous acting career, sought perhaps a vehement empathy for Edward R. Murrow in his quest to set an occupational precedent!! A producer of the film, Steven Soderbergh, who also produced ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" (A fantastic film) possesses a knack for delving into the domicile for the disconcerting, this makes him very effective in his ability for articulating realism!! David Strathairn, who played Edward R. Murrow, conquered an acute resemblance to Murrow, not just in terms of his physical appearance, but also, in terms of Murrow's subtle resolve and undaunted demeanor!! Give the rest of the cast and crew credit for having a grass roots recognition of what fervor these 1954 CBS television executives coveted to unveil the truth concerning McCarthyism!! This film gives the movie audience an opportunity to delve into the plethora of facts and philosophies that immersed this film into intellectual and political rumination!! Clooney perceived this story as a stellar idea for a movie... Giving pontification to the premise that television was more than just a citadel of insulated amusement, and indeed, an avenue for news accuracy for back then as well as for permanently in the future, was something that Clooney thought would titillate the American movie goer!! He was right!! <br/><br/>See this film... Five Stars... No question about it!!!"

","Rarely when an actor tries to direct does it work, and when it does you get ""character study"" without all the supporting scaffold a real filmmaker would provide.<br/><br/>Clooney is a smart man who knows this. So he structures his projects in ways that are well serviced by what he has to give. The last one was an actor playing a character who created a character within. The structure of the thing was all focused on building and exploiting those ambiguities. <br/><br/>Especially clever were the staging devices. Many were novel and a few were particularly striking.<br/><br/>Now this is a more serious, but has the same values. It is after all a character study, and one that deals with these same two worlds. The man when off the camera, and the man on. Fabricated truth as an act by politicians. ""Journalism"" as way of piercing through those layers.<br/><br/>Two evils, McCarthy and Paley. Clooney's point is that control over the pipeline is what matters in delivering the ""real."" So he works with some very studied staging. This movie has some of the best staging in recent memory. It must have taken forever to set the angles and lighting. Fortunately these are so powerful that no scene needs more than two setups. This is the way this cinematographer works for PT Andersen too.<br/><br/>The switch in lighting from when Murrow is on the air to just after he goes off is rather thrilling: both are intense, in fact the on-air lighting is stark. But there is a powerful and visible shift from external to internal energy.<br/><br/>If you just saw the script as words on a page, it would seem boring and preachy. It is the staging that makes this thing come alive, that gives a container for the great acting. The only actor who seems off is McCarthy, which is telling.<br/><br/>I have the book Clooney's dad wrote about movies. Fortunately the son has better insights into what works and what doesn't, and has good intuitions about what to attempt.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","An American citizen working abroad, I watched a preview screening of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" in early December 2005 in Melbourne. David Straitharn (Murrow) was on hand to introduce the film, and he commented that journalists in the U.S. covet ""the Edward R. Murrow Award."" Having won one myself, I had to suppress an Arnold Horshack-like desire to jump up and seek acknowledgment.<br/><br/>Born five years after the ""See It Now"" that became the flash point for the decline and fall of Joseph McCarthy, I always felt uncomfortable in a lifetime of hindsight watching conventional wise men excoriate ""the junior Senator from Wisconsin."" Yes, his rapacious lust to seize on America's post-war, post-Berlin Airlift, post-nukes paranoia was unforgivable.<br/><br/>But while McCarthy was reckless with his grabbed power, I often wondered if the backlash against The Red Scare wasn't itself tinged with counter abuse.<br/><br/>Fearing this would be another case of a good point made badly (see ""Fahrenheit 9-11""), I was pleasantly surprised to find ""Good Night and Good Luck"" to be even-handed, even paying some lip service to my lifelong concerns.<br/><br/>It wasn't so much the quiet, understated confidence of Murrow in this film that sold me on the fact Clooney provided an untilted platform. It was more the balance offered by the characterization of Paley, who fortunately was not portrayed as the right-wing bad guy. Nor was he fairy-taled into some crusader, either, as the why-don't-they-make-executives-like-that-anymore liberals would have us believe.<br/><br/>For this, Clooney deserves a great deal of credit. Yes, the long, unwieldy stretch of HUAC testimony made the second half of the film a bit ponderous. But that's a quibbling point against a foundation of overwhelming cinematic excellence.<br/><br/>The '50s were never more beautiful than this film. The long-gone mood of unabated scotch and cigarettes, the anachronistic anti-nepotism policy at CBS, the heavy woolen clothing, the horrible eye wear, the great jazz - the forgotten art of how to light a film for black and white. It's all there - and a wonderful tribute to the son of an old-school broadcaster like Nick Clooney.<br/><br/>A little spoilage, though, from Down Under. As I sat in the nearly full cinema on a Monday night, the crowd - mostly in their 20s-60s - giggled at the oddest places. The quaint Kent commercial. The occasional, go-get-'em dialog. The news anchoring tragic and his endorsement of Murrow's broadcast. Giggles. Very off-putting, almost disrespectful to a time gone-by.<br/><br/>It was almost as if they were saying, ""Yeah, we know better, and we were born that way."" Glad to know somebody got to skip the '50s in order to get to the 21st century."

","At the present times, when the film and film-making in general has undergone such a drastic change that more often than not, a major portion of the viewers is accustomed to a film with either action, a lot of humor, exceptional chills, over-the-top stories, and so on and so forth. The very root of film-making seems to have been forgotten. The film, we must remember, is also an agent of communication. It puts forward a message. Good Night, and Good Luck is such a film.<br/><br/>As we hear David Strathairn's Edward R. Murrow speak, we are reminded of the positive points of what we call television. He asks the public not to underestimate or overlook the fact that television has a potential to inform and educate. Good Night, and Good Luck is basically a political drama, playing out an event that took place in the early 1950's in the Columbia Broadcasting System. The war of words between CBS' broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Republican U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. It is more of a docu-drama with actual footages and dialogue from the happenings.<br/><br/>Directed by George Clooney, who also stars in the film, Good Night, and Good Luck is completely in black and white. It is exceptionally stylized. The repeated shots of Strathairn holding his cigarette, the light reflecting off his well-oiled hair, and his chiseled expressionless face; the glare he gives the viewers at the end of each broadcast, is the very point of the film. There is no added material here, no extra ingredients to spice up the events and modernize it, no effort to make it more appealing except for giving it the actual look and feel of the 50's. Almost the entire film is inside the CBS newsroom, or its adjacent offices. The music that occasionally plays in the background is more often than not a part of the diagesis, perhaps a jazz recording, or a broadcast in an adjacent room.<br/><br/>Then there is Edward Strathairn's performance. Flawless. His acting, more than anything else, takes us into understanding and realizing the consequences of the events that are taking place. The calm yet ruthless nature of him, the clarity with which he speaks in the broadcasts, is perfect. The supporting cast is also top notch with the likes of Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. Frank Langella is exceptionally brilliant in the sequence in his office with Clooney and Strathairn.<br/><br/>At ninety minutes, the acting and the stylization make the film a visual treat. It is however suggested that one be informed of the events that the film portrays beforehand. It is the mere representation of an event; without any explanation, any commentary, any justification whatsoever. The film never tries to be something it cannot. It is not meant to be an entertaining action-packed film. It's action lies in the play of dialogue between characters and the facts that the conversations eventually reveal. It is man against man. One trying to bring out the truth about the other. It is a debate. It is a fiery battle of words between two men. It is about one man who dared to tell the truth, and went to all ends to bring it out into the open. Good Night, and Good Luck is a detailed and accurate account of the feud between broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.<br/><br/>Dare."
"The_Void","3","28","44","7 February 2006"," Looks the part, but lacks emotional involvement
","Of all the critically friendly 'Oscar Contenders' of 2005, Good Night and Good Luck was the one that stood out the most for me. Not because I have an interest in the plot, or any confidence in the people that made it, even; but merely because it seemed to come out of nowhere, and it's often these films that become the surprise hit of the year. With that in mind, I am disappointed to say that, given the task of describing this film in one word, I would have to select the word 'dull'. Director and star George Clooney has done a great job of ensuring that his film looks and feels as it should; we are given a convincing portrait of the USA during the 1950's, and the film is always lovely to look at. However, it's good points end there; as there is barely any plot to speak of, and the film simply feels like a timeline of events. The plot revolves around the cold war, and Senator Joseph McCarthy. Two journalists; reporter Edward R. Murrow and producer Fred Friendly, decide to take on the senator and expose him for inspiring fear in the American people.<br/><br/>The way that George Clooney uses archive footage instead of an actor cast in the role of the senator is a really inspired move; but the inspiration stops there. We are never allowed into the heads of any of the characters. Their actions show, but we are never given any motivation, and this makes the film very hard to care for on an emotional level. David Strathairn fits the film in that he looks the part; but like the rest of it, he is never given a chance to shine. Robert Downey Jnr and Patricia Clarkson are entirely wasted in a subplot that has little point, while George Clooney fails also to make any kind of impression in the acting department. To be honest, I'm really surprised that this film did go down well with the critics. Good Night and Good Luck is a purely aesthetic experience, and despite the fact that it looks great; surely great films cannot be called such merely because of how they look. I'm sure that George Clooney thought he was making a great film here, but it's missed the mark entirely. If you're really interested in the subject of this film, you might get some kind of enjoyment out of it; but since this film is basically a glorified documentary, you'd probably be better off seeing an actual documentary. Disappointing."

","Cinema can be entertainment, it can be art, it can be a popular voice. It can be eye-candy or sometimes it can be a force for good. Modern U.S. cinema and its audiences have long been primarily regarded (sometimes unfairly) as entertainment only. A few Independents have stood out, but works of significant art or important social comment have been largely seen as uncommercial.<br/><br/>Leading filmmakers set out to challenge that with a company called Participant Productions. Their hypothesis was quite simple: there is a mainstream audience for well-made films that have the power to inspire on important issues. They believe ""in the power of media to create great social change."" Good Night, and Good Luck (like North Country and Syriana) succeeds in attracting critical and commercial success.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is about the struggle to protect democratic freedoms. It came on general release in the UK, the day after the United Nations called for the closure of Guantanamo Bay - a centre where people are detained without due process of law and for lengthy periods merely on suspicion of involvement with terrorism. It went on general release on the same day that Channel 4 Television aired a programme by Walter Wolfgang, the lifelong Labour Party activist ejected from last year's Labour Party Conference for speaking out against the Foreign Secretary on Iraq - a programme showing how the British Government has gradually reduced dissent within its own ranks and that new legislation designed to prevent terrorism is being used by the police in ways that are effectively eroding our civil liberties. (Footage included peaceful protesters who had been stopped under the Terrorism Act including an elderly man held in Brighton for wearing an anti-Blair t-shirt and the 11-year-old girl stopped and searched while participating in a peace march.)<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is set in the 'McCarthy' era of American history, one of the blackest periods for U.S. civil liberties, when the merest hint that a person sympathised with 'communists' was enough to lose them their job. The Junior Senator, Joseph McCarthy, used people's fear of the communists (who were making real and frightening advances in Korea, Eastern Europe and China) to round up people with witch-hunt hysteria. Disagreeing with McCarthy was tantamount to being a 'dangerous communist' and could mean blacklisting for oneself and one's family or even imprisonment without proper trial. It took a long time for people to speak out. Broadcaster Edward Murrow (and his producer Fred Friendly) was one of those who lead the charge, using their own money when CBS and television sponsors refused to publicise their programme. The public was overwhelmingly supportive. Emboldened, televised Senate investigations led to McCarthy's downfall, even as he attacked Murrow.<br/><br/>In only George Clooney's second experiment in the director's chair, he has scored both a palpable hit of a movie and also dug his feet in for integrity in film-making - both in content and style. Parallels between the McCarthy indictment-without-evidence and the U.S. detention-without-trial of Guantanamo Bay (or the UK's powers-of-detention under the Terrorism Act) are exceedingly (and intentionally) plain. If we sacrifice the freedoms that are the bedrock of what we claim to be protecting (whether it be from Communism or Terrorism) then the struggle ceases to lose much of its meaning. What makes Good Night, Good Luck so powerful however, is that it leaves viewers to make the connection themselves, by the careful telling of history, rather than the dubious rantings of left wing softies. The evils of McCarthyism are no longer disputed by many - nor was Murrow's patriotism ever in any doubt - he had a magnificent track record of upholding the liberties of which America is so proud, so the film stands first and foremost as a patriotic clarion call to freedom. Neither does it embroider - the only scenes of McCarthy used are archive footage (just as when Murrow attacked him, he only used actual footage of the Senator speaking). Murrow claimed that Americans were not only able to be strong militarily, but they were able to be strong in robust debate. This movie, 50 years later, is a tribute to that robust debate.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the use of black and white throughout reminds us of the magic of that medium (especially on modern high quality 35mm film). The 50's are lovingly recreated, from the deep jazz soundtrack with Dianne Reeves and Rosemary Clooney's band, the hand-written prompts for announcers in TV's early days, to the (less acceptable today) world of ubiquitous cigarette smoke and a male-dominated business world. The mannerisms, haircuts, dress, and even the way the film is edited, all persuade us that we are watching a film made closer to that era and miraculously brought to us with digital sound and wide aspect ratio. Admittedly, the shots of McCarthy and the Senate are of noticeable poorer quality (and with poorer make-up), but the real and symbolic importance of using original footage outweigh the slight visual inconsistency. Clooney has not only directed admirably, but has excelled himself in co-producing a taut script as well as delivering an excellent performance as Fred Friendly. David Strathairn (as Ed Murrow) establishes himself as an actor of major strength: the indelible picture of Murrow he projects is one of towering humanity, moral probity, belief in self and a courageous judgement free of bias - an icon for any reporter to hold high.<br/><br/>In the USA today, we see vigorous debate and the rule of law replaced by religious conviction and secret knowledge. In the UK, rigorously scrutinised laws and debate within Cabinet and political parties has been replaced by a mass of hasty legislation authoritarian politics. Safeguards in the political systems of both countries have failed. It was against such moral vacuity that the broadcast media defeated McCarthy and returned common sense and democracy to America. Films such as Good Night, Good Luck can be seen as a small step in a similar direction."
"imaginarytruths","7","33","55","22 October 2005"," a good film but lacks depth and historical context
","Well-acted across the board, I loved the Patricia Clarkson-Robert Downey combo so much that I kind of wish they had their own movie. Stylish and effective cinematography- the darting to and fro, the perpetual smoke, the use of shadow and silhouette. All very well done. And the overall message of the film- that the media and the American public need to wake the *beep* up and pay attention- is one that I heartily commend.<br/><br/>Part of my problem with the film stems from the fact that I am a history student with a keen interest in the time period. And Clooney does nothing to place his story in historical context. He's just taking pieces of a story and expecting the audience to fill in the rest. Like the loyalty oath piece. It really has nothing to do with the rest of the film. It is not explored further in any other scene. It is not really debated. Just one scene, designed to get the audience to recoil and say ""wasn't that horrible?"" Then it's not mentioned again. No reference to Stalin...hell, no reference to the Cold War, the atomic bomb, the Korean War, or even any aspect of the Red Scare other than McCarthy. There's one line about Alger Hiss near the end, but it provides little context or explication. The film makes it seem like McCarthy was a one-man wrecking crew instead of a particularly ruthless and ambitious politician taking advantage of a fear that was already widespread and deeply penetrating.<br/><br/>And loyalty oaths still exist, by the way, and the truth is that for the most part we accept them. I had to sign a loyalty oath to be a public schoolteacher.<br/><br/>As for the idea that Clooney is trying to make commentary about how society has changed in the past 50 years, I agree that such is his intent. In this regard he is clearly inspired by Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, which his company produced and which he vigorously promoted. But Haynes does it much more elegantly. He shows his characters confounding their stereotypical roles; Clooney merely reinforces them. I wanted to see Patricia Clarkson's character do something other than fetch newspapers. I wanted to see a black character do something other than belt out jazz tunes that lay out the plot like something in an old musical. Otherwise, their presence smacks of tokenism, of the worst kind of liberal condescension. Also, Haynes' film is a fiction commenting on the fictional representations and actual reality of a bygone era. Clooney's is, at least in its central scenes, practically a documentary. Having subplots whose primary purpose is smug contemporary commentary detracts from the versimilitude.<br/><br/>The scene near the end in the office between Langella and Strathairn is the thematic lynchpin of the film. However, this is where I think Clooney most clearly falls short. It seems to me that they address Murrow's earlier complicity in the Red Scare (re:Alger Hiss) surreptitiously by burying it in a set of defensive comments that are presented like a bunch of excuses for the network's moral cowardice. It's scripted in such a way that Murrow does not have to respond. As for the idea that corporations run the media for profit and that the nightly news is more distraction than edification ...well, that was a bold statement when Network came out 30 years ago, not so much now anything more than stating the obvious. I wanted more from this.<br/><br/>I almost feel like Clooney was torn between making a documentary and making something truly scathing in the Network vein. As documentary the film is brought down by its lack of context, which is a shame because Strathairn's line readings are chillingly good. As social commentary the film simply doesn't say anything particularly perceptive, and at times it comes across as liberal bourgeois moralizing."

","Clooney has joined the ranks of Mel Gibson and Ron Howard as recent actors that have proved themselves capable of top-quality directing.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck is a film about an aspect of American history that I care greatly about. So I was predisposed to be very critical, and I was hesitant, though excited, to see it.<br/><br/>The film, especially Strathairn's intense performance, and the great support from Clooney, Langella and Clarkson, exceeded my expectations greatly. I will enjoy seeing this again, and mining the DVD for commentary and supplementary material.<br/><br/>The connection of the McCarthy communist witch-hunts to today's 9-11 9-11 terrorist terrorist mindset should not be lost to the more free-thinking members of the audience, but you should not let the politics of the film distract you from the heroic story it tells and the principle point - which is expressed so ably in Murrow's acceptance speech for a journalism award at the beginning of the film - TV can be a great tool for education, but we should not confuse education and entertainment. The film is shot in black and white. This choice is not simply an attempt to give it 'that period feel', but it is also a profound metaphor for the press and the advent of television journalism. It also gives the few scenes that pit Murrow against McCarth in juxtaposition a sense of reality which could not be achieved any other way.<br/><br/>Well, Clooney has managed to make a film that is as entertaining as it is educational, and misses no opportunity to make its central argument clear.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film to anybody with even a passing interest in the politics of terror, the role of the media in American society, and the value of a free press."
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","3","11 February 2017"," When Individual Fears Don't Compromise Collective Courage... and Vice Versa...
","In the middle of the 50's, McCarthyism reached the heights of fear and terror. It appears that it is partly due to the personality of Senator McCarthy and lines of questioning that confined to bullying and intimidation at the expense of legal procedures. Being submitted to the HUAC could make you as communist as Stalin, so no one dared to criticize McCarthy for individual safety's sake. Terror and fear were the vital components of McCarthyism, a shameful time of America's history, that was close enough to repeat itself in the 2000's for that's the way history punishes those who forget their lessons.<br/><br/>And the main lesson we can grasp from George Clooney's ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is that you can't fool everyone every time. McCarthyism crossed a few boundaries, notably when the Air Force threatened to expel a soldier if he didn't denounce his father and sister, suspected of communist inclination on the basis of revelations sealed in an envelope. So CBS 'Person to Person' host Edward Murrow (David Strathairn) felt it was time to confront the dubious methods of the Commission. This was a time where television was the new medium and Murrow was a man of no-nonsense rigid face and unflinching cigarette perfectly exuding unflappable professionalism. Strathairn gives the performance of a lifetime as a journalist who's confident, sometimes overly, but who's a pro to the core, he only consider facts and can't accept that lives would be destroyed without any substantial proof.<br/><br/>And Murrow isn't a lone crusader for he finds support from his colleagues, his co-producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), the CBS news executive (Jeff Daniels) and chief executive (Frank Langella). If anything, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" praises the merit of team working and the solidarity driven by decency and principles. There's a moment where (before attacking McCarthy), Friendly asks the team if any of them can be accused of Communist sympathy even in the loosest way. The conclusion of this scene says it all ""terror is right there in this room"" and the scare of the moment was enough a reason to walk the walk. The paranoia is even induced by an interesting subplot involving Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson, as two workers of very strange behavior, until we realize the purpose this subplot served: highlighting our own paranoia.<br/><br/>George Clooney's retelling of the pivotal moment where America rebelled against McCarthy through the figure of Ed Murrow carries the mark of the 50's, it has a great black and white cinematography, a lot of smoking and the use of real footage of senator McCarthy complete the touch of authenticity. But the film is also a timely reminder of the value of good and honest information, it says a lot about the 50's but speaks volumes for the 2000's. Clooney has always been vocal about human rights and democracy. By choosing to tackle this subject, he reminded the audience that America has been through this, and September 11 instated a Green Scare that had nothing to envy from McCarthyism. And from the Patriot Act, it became clear that you had no other choice than proving loyalty to the flag or you were deemed as a traitor. But a good American beyond any reproach had the guts to destabilize McCarthy in the 50's, by doing his job.<br/><br/>And ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" with a meticulous precision shows how the job is done, the meetings, the way they all pick quotations for McCarthy and deconstruct them. Murrow criticizes the Senator but invites him to give any refutation or correction. McCarthy's defense is to accuse Murrow of Communist sympathy. I thought that was the 'dramatic' moment where Murrow would finally take a hit. No, Murrow's next statement was nothing but brilliant. Since McCarthy didn't make any reference to all the statements made, that means he found no mistake. That's the power of Murrow, he doesn't flinch and his professionalism, empowers everyone around and it's a matter of time before McCarthy gets destabilized with the infamous ""have you go no decency?"", when brave people, without showing sympathy to Communism echoed this famous line of Sir Thomas More: ""I would give the devil the benefit of the Law, for my own safety"".<br/><br/>It's not about McCarthy but Law.<br/><br/>The downfall of McCarthy is a victory for Murrow but of bittersweet taste because the program will not be renewed, for lack of sponsors. And that might be another of the great lessons from such a short yet complex film. Like many movies about the 50's, ads play a significant part on TV, ""Quiz Show"" had Geritol, here we have Kent cigarettes and Alcoa, and as a buff of TV game shows like ""What's my Line"" I know that TV couldn't survive without it. So, the film rises the most important issue, one that works as a bridge between the 50's and now: if people have money to sponsors shows, if they can threaten a show to be canceled then information obviously belongs to the sponsor. It's as simple as that, and in a context of globalization, this reality gets even scarier..<br/><br/>The movie ends with a warning, that if we take TV as just a medium for entertainment and not information, then we'll be alienated candidates for mediocrity. One can argue that Internet provided an alternative, but in a way, it also alienated us a little more and too many information are harder to control and verify so anything can be build on rumors and falsehoods. If McCarthy could use the Internet, maybe more lives might have been destroyed, he might have as well become president or someone like him.<br/><br/>But that's a prophetic aspect of Clooney's film I don't want to venture into, it depressed me to the point I envy anyone leaving this ugly world, and if it ever happened to me, I would be tempted to tell those I love; ""good night and good luck""."

"marcelbrooks","Null","5","6","21 January 2009"," Astonishing!
","Good Night, and Good Luck is a singularly gripping, powerful movie about the epic battle between a blustery, Red-obsessed senator and a resolved veteran newsman. Photographed in stark black and white and infused with a real 1950s feel, George Clooney's sharp homage to one of the greatest journalists America's ever known is utterly captivating and discomfiting.<br/><br/>Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was one of the biggest stars in CBS News as the host of ""Person to Person"" and ""See It NoW."" When he gets wind of a soldier who's been fired from the Air Force for a tenuous Communist connection, Murrow springs into action, choosing to use Senator Joseph P. McCarthy's own words and actions against him, rather than attacking the man.<br/><br/>What Murrow did was nothing short of astonishing. This was the mid-1950s. The press genuflected to royalty (i.e., politicos) much more than exercised genuine critical analysis of it. What's more, McCarthy's fellow senators did little to prevent the man from running roughshod over the rights of those suspecting of being ""card-carrying Communists."" With no press to question him and no colleagues to rein him in, McCarthy had carte blanche to root out the evil-doin' Reds from all facets of American life.<br/><br/>The stand that Murrow took - putting the reputations of himself, producer Fred Friendly (Clooney), and the CBS network on the line - took an incalculable amount of courage. One misstep by Murrow and his team, and his career would be over. (As it turned out, his undoing of McCarthy was also his own undoing, but that was less his fault than the fault of CBS chief William Paley.)<br/><br/>More than fifty years have passed since Murrow won by decision over McCarthy (the senator was censured by his colleagues, which allowed him to remain in the Senate but severely diminished his influence), but the events that take place in this film resonate deeply today. Indeed, it is not unimaginable to see a politician like McCarthy run amok in a avaricious grab for power and prestige. The passage of time, however, allows us to reflect perhaps a bit more objectively, to examine the fight for the civil rights of every man, woman, and child in the United States. How far have we come in the ensuing half-century? Who are the Murrows of today?<br/><br/>Strathairn is nothing short of remarkable. He's not an especially large man, but he has such gravitas in this film that he seems to fill the screen even when he's merely sitting in the background. He is a man of many faces and expressions, and every one of them seems to ring perfectly true. Strathairn has knocked around Hollywood for more than a quarter century, earning scores of accolades from his peers and the media, but he's never been a leading man in a such a widely praised film. Indeed, he's the kind of actor who disappears into roles, who is a superb character actor, adding color and depth to every role he touches. He's been nominated for an Academy award at this writing, and he stands a good chance at bringing home the statuette. It's long overdue.<br/><br/>Strathairn is ably supported by a well-picked cast, including Robert Downey Jr. in his fortieth comeback, Frank Langella as Paley, and Clooney as producer Friendly. Even more beneficial, though, is the look and feel of the movie, and the near-flawless direction by Clooney. Clooney wisely stuck to the main tet-a-tet between Murrow and McCarthy, rather than building up Murrow as a character first; indeed, there's little else in the movie besides the row with McCarthy. For one thing, we learn virtually nothing about the personal lives of Friendly and Murrow. And that omission works very well within the structure of this film.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is a mesmerizing glimpse at how the power of the press can be used to uphold the rights of man, and a chilling snapshot at what can happen if ego and authority go unchecked."

","Clooney deserves a pat on the back for taking such a risky subject and making a remarkable film of it. Good Night, and Good Luck.' is impactive. The film gives the feel of a documentary where we see the passionate journalists of CBS at work and this is intercut by real footage. Clooney excels as both writer and director. His actors also seem to share a good comfort zone which may have influenced their on screen interactions and extract authentic performances. I disagree that this movie is 'deviod of emotions'. The performances are subtle but one can relate to the characters' dilemma and empathize for them. Strathairn is truly remarkable and he is supported by the likes of Downey Jr., Clooney himself and Clarkson who are all fantastic. The costumes and black and white colour evokes a feeling of the past. Cinematography is smooth. The dialogues are skillfully written. The film wonderfully reminds us of a forgotten dark period in American history that has haunted many lives, a time when hypocrisy was running high. Many have criticized it for being too documentary-like but I feel that it has instead worked towards its benefit because documentaries enlighten viewers of the truth. At the same time you don't forget that it's a movie you're watching because there is a story to be followed, a fascinating story that provokes ones thoughts."

","""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" tells the story of CBS Newsman Edward R. Murrow's courageous fight against Senator Joseph McCarthy. As a student of both history and journalism, I have viewed Murrow as a hero and was very excited to see this film. Overall, David Strathairn's performance is impeccable, capturing Murrow's nuances, genius, and even the cigarette addiction that eventually killed him.<br/><br/>George Clooney directed this film and plays Fred Friendly, who produced Murrow's broadcasts. Clooney also is credited with co-writing the screenplay, and that's where the problem arises. Aside for the lengthy film footage of actual Senate sub-committee testimony, and the genuine, on-screen words of Murrow and others, the screenplay is sparse.<br/><br/>We get very little insight into the characters of Murrow, Friendly, and CBS President William Paley (played by Frank Langella). In addition, Clooney wastes a superb supporting cast including Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., and Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>Clearly, George Clooney has made a noble film that captures the spirit of the time and the words of those involved, and if there was ever any doubt that McCarthy was a self-serving hypocrite, it is erased by this film. But the director failed to develop characters that were interesting in their own right. As such, the film is only slightly more involving than a documentary on the subject might have been."

","This is the one of the most intense, original, and beautifully-crafted films in the history of cinema. David Strathairn's performance is simply astonishing. Juxtaposed with the actual footage of Senator McCarthy, the recreation of Edward R. Murrow takes on an eerie quasi-reality which makes this film so absorbing. It is rather an insult for moviegoers to have to pay to watch a sloppy, inaccurate period piece; therefore, kudos to the production team for paying such meticulous attention to detail. The use of black-and-white is the central cohesive element, yet in such soft focus that the surface appears to have been delicately scratched with sand. Even the subtle jazz soundtrack is incorporated visually into the film. George Clooney shows a genuine sense of artistry here and a directorial Oscar in 2006 is not out of the realm of possibility. Most assuredly, David Strathairn will be giving Philip Seymour Hoffman a run for his money."
"majic-5","7","7","11","5 November 2005"," Intelligent, timely, and heavy-handed
","To create a showdown drama, the movie keeps a laser-sharp focus on the public media duel between Murrow and McCarthy. Nearly all the scenes take place in the CBS building or the nearby bar where the CBS journalists hang out. There's no dealing with Murrow's or McCarthy's backgrounds or personal lives. There's just one related minor sub-plot about the ""Red Scare."" Focusing so tightly on a short period in time and very few places served to heighten the risks that Murrow and his support team took, and the courage they mustered to face them. The black-and-white cinematography was a good choice, both for period authenticity and reinforcing the starkness of the showdown. These elements, combined with Murrow's spartan personal manner, created a tension and claustrophobia that riveted me. <br/><br/>As Murrow, Strathairn is terrific. According to what I've read about those knew Murrow, Strathairn captured Murrow's reserve, intensity, body language, and quiet anxiety exactly. When contrasted against McCarthy's flamboyance, blustering, and even charm, Murrow comes off like a sleek, deadly, truth-seeking missile. It was a bold stroke to have Mcarthy represent himself by showing him only in clips from archival news footage. There's no chance that anyone can criticize an actor, director, or producer for misrepresenting McCarthy, when scene after scene, the senator himself behaved like the Grand Inquisitor. Of course, one can make the charge that selective playing of the archival news footage demonstrates an obvious bias. But at least the filmmakers are upfront about it: When CBS CEO Bill Paley questions whether Murrow is presenting both sides of the McCarthy story, Murrow declares, ''I've searched my conscience, and I cannot accept that there are two equivalent sides to every story."" Murrow's dedication to the facts of the case and his declaration that not all sides of a story should carry equal weight are a clear slap at the ""fair and balanced"" approach to network news reporting today.<br/><br/>If this rebuke had remained largely implied, this would have been a thoughtful film that respected its audience's ability to draw its own conclusions. But the filmmakers clobbered the audience with their criticism of American news reporting and television usage in general. By bookending the movie with Murrow's retirement speech to his co-workers, the movie drove these points into the ground. Apparently, this heavy-handedness was intentional from the genesis of the movie. The film was produced by Participant Productions, a venture of Jeff Skoll, an Ebay founder. Each Participant picture tries to extend its themes through accompanying ""social-action campaigns.'' Said Participant's president, Ricky Strauss, ""It's a key part of our business to use the social-sector organizations. Jeff created the company with the idea that media can create social change, and we need to give audiences a chance to do that.'' Crossing the line between drama and advocacy significantly weakens the film dramatically.<br/><br/>In addition, the movie is so tightly focused that the missing historical context lessens the film's credibility. More back-story on the communist fears of the McCarthy era and Murrow's career would have reduced the propagandistic subtext. Also, the sub-plot about the married co-workers who have to keep their marriage a secret seems out of place. If there was a connection to the main story, I missed it.<br/><br/>There are many lessons one can draw from Good Night and Good Luck: Character assassination is wrong, and that we need, and need to support journalists who would speak truth to power, to name two. Myself, I came out of the movie remembering two famous sayings: <br/><br/> ""Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.""  George Santayana<br/><br/> ""Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.""  Samuel Johnson"

","In a world where fear of the unknown permeates society, the 1950's was a turbulent time. Rumors are running rampant and people are suspicious of even their closest friends. This is the premise of the Warner Brothers Independent film, ""Good Night and Good Luck."" David Strathairn plays legendary newsman, Edward R. Murrow,a chain smoking, relentless pursuer of the truth when reporting the news. There are various stories that Murrow reports but, none are more important than the activities of the Permanent Sub committee on Investigations, headed by Senator McCarthy of Wisconsin. The questioning of ordinary citizens has created a climate of distrust throughout the country. It is a time of war and in light of the conviction of Alger Hiss, everyone is a suspect. To Murrow, these practices are unfair and therefore must be addressed. Murrow, the most respected journalist of the time, sets out to report the facts of these proceedings despite the peril he himself may suffer. Directed by George Clooney, it is a riveting tale that allows the viewer to have a ringside seat at what was referred to as a witch hunt. The camera is very friendly to all involved and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The viewer is transported to a time when just the mention of one's name and communism in the same sentence, could create a tsunami of accusations and even imprisonment if not death. Whom do you trust? Trust Murrow and his ""colleagues"" to deliver the goods and restore a sense of sanity in the world as we know it. This film should not be missed. It could happen to you."

","Good Night and Good Luck (2005)<br/><br/>Filmed with a low-key and brooding intensity, with lots of curling smoke and fast, overlapping dialog, this homage to Edward Murrow is also one of the best insights into the insidious evils of McCarthyism on film. Director George Clooney, who also co-wrote and appears in a major supporting role, manages a nuanced and delicate approach where something sensational would have been tempting. <br/><br/>The gradual building of the CBS effort to speak out against McCarthy is layered with more personal problems among the newsroom staff, some of which have to do with being hunted down by red scare henchmen. The maddening complicity of the country as a whole, which often watched passively as people were called to committee hearings or simply fired from their jobs for not signing loyalty oaths, is the real terror, and it has echoes in the current practice of employees signing loyalty oaths to the corporations that then control them unreasonably.<br/><br/>What to look for? The seamless interweaving of archival footage of Senator McCarthy and the contemporary scenes. The startling perfection of much of the acting, especially David Strathairn playing Murrow. The photography, which moves lyrically through the glass walled studios, and shoots from behind people and through groups, and plays with light and layers of images. And most of all the subtle way the political reality is inserted into what looks at first glance to be a period drama.<br/><br/>Fascinating production details? It was filmed on color film stock and converted to black and white, and so it has a slightly softer sharpness than true black and white film. Test audiences complained that the McCarthy actor was too exaggerated to believe--until they were told that it was all actual footage of the senator form the 1950s. Clooney was paid one dollar each for his roles as actor, writer, and director. <br/><br/>The main events occur in 1954, a year after Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible,"" which made its anti McCarthy statement on stage. But Murrow reached the masses, and took a huge risk for his own career and for CBS's reputation, and it paid off. But there were casualties, and compromises, and Clooney includes some of the messiness even as he makes a hero of Murrow. A relatively bleak film, but never slow, and not humorless, either (the characters are writers, largely, and they are witty and sardonic). And necessary, a drama for our own times."

Today it's very difficult to believe that this is possible in the media scene of the USA in present (but that's my personal point of view as an non-American) and as well in many other countries, too. The movie shows in a real good wise the conflict of interests by finding out an uncomfortable verity and also the problem to make a established truth. Clooney did a great job as actor and director as well and the monologues of Edward R. Murrow are awesome. Ray Wise showed that his best work is always stand out in a crowd by playing a broken man (if you remember Twin Peaks). Only Jeff Daniels vulnerable the gravity 'cause i always must think about ""Dumb & Dumber"" (but don't take this to serious, it's my own funny feeling by watching this movie). All in all a very lovely movie which gives an deliver insight the work of critical reporters and their difficult activity, also if it had not really something in common with the real story of Senator McCarthy."

"zoni4316","2","9","16","16 March 2006"," Style over substance, no real controversy here!
","Good Night and Good Luck has more style than substance. The photography, costumes and the music were great. But that is where the brilliance of this movie ends.<br/><br/>Joe McCarthy is shown only in newsreel footage making him something of a 2 dimensional character. This really diminishes his impact. He certainly isn't the ugly threat the filmmakers would like us to believe in. There is a tragic and human drama in the story of McCarthy. He played a high-stakes political game and self-destructed in public. Why that sort of real drama is completely missing from this film is beyond me.<br/><br/>There is no attempt to explain the real reason for anti-communist paranoia and that makes the film feel historically unbalanced. The sort that Clooney associates with apparently thought there was no need to put the McCarthy era in proper context. But younger generations who don't remember these events firsthand will wonder what all the fuss was about. With tens of millions of people dying in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin paranoia on all sides was impossible to avoid. The party purges under Stalin make the politics portrayed in this movie look like something from the Sunday comics.<br/><br/>The very cool ""smooth jazz"" music in the movie is great and that, unfortunately, is also one of the films biggest problems. That style of music was not widely popular in the 1950's. The pop charts of the time were full of the sort of light pop vocal and musical show tune crap that spells box office disaster today. The real pop music of the 1950's was the type of thing that made the rise of rock and roll inevitable! A dramatic orchestral score could have heightened the impact and would not have drawn undue attention away from the story as do the musical performances in this film.<br/><br/>Controversy always has more than one side. There simply isn't much room in Clooney's world for type of real controversy that would have given the film some dramatic tension and turned it into serious entertainment. In short, the film presents a highly skewed view of events oversimplified and tailored to fit the biases of one man. The unintentional paradox is that while presenting the story of a neutral journalist, Clooney shows a distorted view of the surrounding historical events. I guess it is just too bad for us that the real world is so out of touch with George Clooney."

","Itis obvious that George Clooney has a feel for the history of Television. Several years ago he helmed a live telecast of the Doomsday thriller ""Fail Safe"" which was well received.<br/><br/>Now Clooney returns to the historical genre with this brilliant retelling of one of the scariest eras in our nation's history. The Joseph McCarthy era. Clooney the co writer uses the late Great Edward R. Murrow as the focal point of the picture. It was Morrow, one of the best journalists in history, who took on the Junior Senator from Wisconsin whose irresponsible Communist finger pointing would make anyone who so much as would wear a pink shirt cringe.<br/><br/>Clooney the Director, photographs the movie in Black and White and creates a true feel for 1954 when Morrow's show ""See It Now"", a CBS and Morrow staple since the Radio days when it was called ""Hear It Now"", unearthed the story of a member of the Air Force was asked to resign because of one time alleged Communist affiliations in his family. The show and the incident was to manifest itself into a ""confrontation"" between Morrow and McCarthy"".<br/><br/>And while the CBS portion of the story are played by actors(a marvelous ensemble cast), McCarthy, Roy Cohn and others involved are played by themselves due to the use of archival footage. What is particular noteworthy is a shot of a young Robert Kennedy at one of the hearings and another shot of Joseph Welsch who presided over the Army-McCarthy hearings that would bring the senator down. Film buffs may remember Welsch shortly thereafter as an actor, portraying Judge Weaver in Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy Of A Murder"".<br/><br/>Clooney has assembled a dream cast and each one delivers. It begins with David Strathairn as Morrow. He has already won an award for best actor at the Venice Film Festival and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this, something is wrong. Clooney, the Actor, plays Fred Friendly, Producer of ""See It Now"" and Morrow's confidant, he could pick up a nomination in 4 categories. Frank Langella Plays William S. Paley, the head of CBS. Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr, Ray Wise and Patricia Clarkson are all uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>I have been called a purist, a charge I plead guilty to.

"mullermike","4","12","23","4 November 2005"," Well done but a typical anti-McCarthy diatribe
","Going into Good Night, and Good Luck, I pretty much knew what to expect. George Clooney is one of Hollywoods most outspoken liberals and aside from abusive males and Christians, the favorite target of Tinseltown is Joe McCarthy. Lately, he's become a hot topic, due to the invasion of Iraq. Clearly this movie is capitalizing on the mood of the times.<br/><br/>Let me start off with something good to say about this film. George Clooney actually is a talented director. His use of lighting was great, good all around acting, and mixing jazz into scenes really grips you. This movie took you back in time and made you feel like a part of an era. I guess Clooney has learned a few tricks since Red Surf.<br/><br/>However, this portrayal of history, though accurate on many counts, delivers a rather slanted view of history, leaving out facts that don't support the argument. Take the clips of the Annie Lee Moss hearings. Clearly this scene portrays McCarthy as a raving nut, going after a supposed innocent woman who was just minding her own business being a wash woman until the bogeyman McCarthy came.<br/><br/>I can't explain the reason McCarthy leaves the hearing, I don't know the context of that particular incident, but what's troubling is the omission that Moss 1) had her name in Communist Party records 2) she had the Daily Worker delivered to her house, even though she switched addresses several times. The Daily Worker was a Communist paper, as admitted by Whitaker Chambers (I'll mention him later) in his testimony before the House on Un-American Activities Committee. He would know, as he edited the paper for years. Might I add that at the time the army, which was employing Moss, had instances of keeping suspected communists on their payroll, men such as Irving Peress. The army showed this negligence even after the Rosenbergs, people that helped Stalin get our nuclear secrets, had been tried and executed. So going after the army for harboring communists was not completely preposterous.<br/><br/>The whole time I watched this movie, I waited for Alger Hiss to be mentioned. This State Department official not only was convicted of perjury but also wrote the UN charter. When the movie mentions that he was convicted of perjury, not espionage, I realized that Hollywood is clearly behind the times. As a fellow IMDb reviewer stated, the Venona Papers released in the mid 90s produced cables proving that he was a Soviet spy. It's not even debatable anymore. I know this movie is a period piece, so Ed Murrow and others weren't privy to this information. But mentioning this truly weakens the movie's credibility. Why use an argument that's been proved wrong? <br/><br/>The main thing that bugged me was the sensationalizing of journalists. These poor reporters were just trying to tell the American people the truth, perhaps that's why they smoked so much. But these underdogs, valiantly going against the wishes of their boss, took on McCarthy anyway. Frankly, when have journalists ever been scared of anything? They spewed the same rhetoric when they took down Nixon. And Murrow went after McCarthy when his career was already headed for the ash heap, Murrow didn't cause McCarthy's downfall.<br/><br/>All and all, the movie was well done but had an obvious agenda. Personally, I think McCarthy was behind the curve, so I don't know why he had such an impact on America. The aforementioned Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss, plus other high level government officials like Harry Dexter White, had already been convicted of espionage. The late 40s and early 50s was really the heyday for catching these American traitors, so McCarthy was late to the party. He wasn't the first to mention communists in our government. He may have been flamboyant but many people he accused of being communists in fact were. And sorry Sean Penn, he didn't hurt anyone in your family, Hollywood was dealt with by the House, not the Senate. <br/><br/>Attribute my low ranking of this film to my political and historic views. Clooney did a pretty good job of saying what he wanted to say but like Michael Moore, he leaves out facts that don't support his message. The characters, though I credited them with being well acted, were sort of undefined. Even Murrows character didn't go too in depth. Every character was overshadowed by the ominous presence of McCarthy. A little melodramatic in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>I think Hollywood should produce a movie about a communist defector that spoke out against Soviet atrocities, like Elizabeth Bentley. A woman like her was far more courageous and risked her life by speaking out against communism, a much braver act than going after a US senator. Going after McCarthy has been done so many times it's become redundant. Sorry George."

That is how my liberal friends described it. They were being lenient. I would describe it as nothing more than presumptious garbage from the left. Morrow is the only one with a pulse and hardly one at that. Clooney is reduced to a impotent sidekick (not sure if thats bad or good). So many secondary characters in the film that no one should even try to care about. Its just not worth the time or attention. If I would of attempted to view it in a theater I would of fallen asleep withing the first act and not been sorry for missing the ineffective last two. What struck me as odd was that they didn't even talk much about blacklisting or the Hollywood angle. It was mostly about military personnel. What a joke. Clooney really misfired with this one.

Nothing could be further from the truth."
"Polaris_DiB","9","8","14","21 December 2005"," Mediated Media
","The visual media of television and film can be a tool or it can be a toy, a means of discourse or merely an object of entertainment. At either extremes, The Media (sic) can be either a degrading escapism that unfocuses the audience away from reality, or harsh propaganda designed to center the masses towards one specific ideology.<br/><br/>How do we treat media? How do we know where to draw the line between entertainment and discourse, objectivity and subjectivity, documentary and mise-en-scene? These are the types of questions that come immediately to mind when regarding a film of this type, one that shows the effect media can have on life, politics, and truth, both personally and publicly, while attempting to create an effect itself.<br/><br/>The set is McCarthy-era US, the characters a group of reporters, the drama the desire to defeat the fear of McCarthyism while keeping a safe distance away from Communism to be able to do it without losing their lives. Around the desire of the characters to defeat the clouds that hang over their heads is the almost defeatism stoic resolve they feel as they press ahead with full knowledge that they could lose their jobs and maybe even their way of life in the process. All to present one message: the television is a tool, not just a flickering image.<br/><br/>What is compelling especially of this film is its comparison to two other noteworthy films about journalism, Citizen Kane and All the President's Men. Citizen Kane, being famous for its use of deep-focus, presents a character who is decidedly subjective, while deep-focus itself is a method of objectivity. This film, Good Night, and Good Luck., presents characters who are altruistic in their belief in objectivity and standards, and yet most of it is shot with a very small depth of focus, often times leaving most or all planes of action slightly fuzzy or completely indelible. All the President's Men presents an idealistic image of heroic journalism with open, clean spaces and long, white rooms for the newspaper men to move through. This film presents characters entrapped by their surroundings, already pre-imprisoned before they've even had the chance to fight back. Shadows cover the frame, and the edges of the shots are all dark.<br/><br/>As a method of presentation, Clooney chooses to show the antagonist, McCarthy, through found media, acquired documentary images of actual things that he had done and said. This has a profound two-fold effect: on one hand, it's verite style creates an objective McCarthy, the real man, a knowledge that he actually existed and said such things. On the other hand, it means we never really see the diagetic McCarthy, the one that fits into the story. As a way of presenting a villain, it means that it's impactful to have true media, but on the other hand it removes said media from the audience twice, once as a mediated image between actual event and audience sitting on their couch, and once as said image being re-imposed through yet another screen, creating two layers of pixellation to affect our imagining of this character. The characters in the film struggle with presentation, thus reminding us post-structurally that we are being presented something by Clooney, meaning the discourse has been removed from us enough that we have to call into question the character of McCarthy as he was presented, not as he was.<br/><br/>Now this is not some banal nor malevolent attempt by Clooney to create tension between the audience and the discourse, it's meant almost entirely of an expression of the issues with subjective media and the effects on human rights and their potential for abuses. The problem with mediating media is that it can't help but call attention to the director's own bias, whether or not that is the point, even if the audience didn't initially question the producers of the original medium.<br/><br/>Such semiotic reading comes to a point where it becomes an almost infinite loop. For example: I am now writing a review about a film about an event in television about an era that ended fifty years ago. How far removed, then, are you, the audience, from the actual event? What are you to think of this film by itself from my own discourse, much less McCarthy or the era he moved within? I'm sure you, as my potential audience, are merely wondering whether or not this film is any good, or if it's worth the time to see? So I end rather bluntly and uneloquently: Yes, it's quite good, and you should see it if you get the chance.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Let me start by saying this was a briskly paced, well acted serious movie which does a superb job in showing the events following Edward Murrow's decision to take on the red scare crusade being led by Senator McCarthy. David Straithairn does a fantastic job in portraying the stoic, courageous, and fiercely independent Edward Murrow.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is it too narrowly focuses on these events. It never makes clear why living in America in this time period was so wrought with fear over communist infiltration and how a man like McCarthy was able to gain such a stranglehold on the American people. As seen here our only understanding of the fear and power his committee hearings held is in the CBS owner growling, ""This could be bring down my whole company"" and CBS lawyers interviewing Murrow's news team for communist ties.<br/><br/>It is a great failing of this film that it seems so perfectly logical for Murrow to bring McCarthy down. One never appreciates the great amount of courage Murrow had to muster to take McCarthy on and that is truly a shame. A young audience member who watches this film will not come away understanding how out of control the fear of communism had become in this county and the civil liberties that were being violated for hundreds of ""alleged"" communist sympathizers."

","As someone who lived through this period and remembers every terrible moment of it -- initially as a college student and later as a member of the U.S. Army -- I believe this film has everything exactly right. The words are (with small exceptions) Ed Murrow's, McCarthy's words are his own, the atmosphere at CBS is depicted pretty much as it was depicted at the time (and later on) by those who were in the middle of it. And although Ed Murrow was handsomer (by far) than David Strathairn, Strathairn had Murrow's voice down pretty well and the cadences exactly right. George Clooney took a chance on making this movie, was right to do it in black and white, smart to accept a subordinate role as Fred Friendly (believe me Clooney is a lot handsomer than Fred Friendly was), and the script and editing were excellent. I hope it wins a ton of prizes. There is only one thing I wish had been done a little differently. I wish they'd given a few minutes late in the film to the McCarthy attack on one of Joseph Welsh's young associates so as to provide the context for his famous remark: ""Senator, have you no shame. At long last, have you no shame."" His question was greeted with applause that reverberated through the hearing room and was heard around the country. All credit to Ed Murrow for what he did and to the unmentioned heroes like Margaret Chase Smith who attacked McCarthy on the floor of the Senate when it was inexpedient to do so. But, in my opinion, it was the Army -McCarthy hearings and Joseph Welsh who ultimately drove the stake through McCarthy's heart. I wish the movie audience had been shown just a tiny bit more of what McCarthy did that provoked Welsh's devastating response."
"Fred-S","1","20","43","25 April 2006"," Like a long lecture by a very boring professor
","Perhaps George Clooney did about as much as he could with a story that really did not have a lot of depth. I suspect that Clooney set out to make an ""All the President's Men"" sort of movie featuring Murrow as the crusading journalist. Murrow was a very competent and very popular journalist - one of the first of the TV editorialists - but in the McCarthy case he did not really have to crusade. Like many of today's journalists, he used his show to voice his opinion about a very controversial man who was on a very controversial committee investigating reports of Communists in high government positions. In 1980, this might have been an interesting and informative movie, but much more has been learned since then. We now know that the agents of the Soviet Union McCarthy was searching for did exist, as information from the Venona files has verified. Actually, had Clooney chosen to include the Venona Project he might have made a truly historic movie.<br/><br/>The Venona Project was carried out during and after World War II. American military intelligence officers secretly recorded transmissions between Washington and the Kremlin. (You can find information about it on many web sites, including an article entitled ""Significance of Venona"" on Wikipedia.) The transcripts were sealed until Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynahan sued under the Freedom of Information Act in the mid-90's to have them released. It would make a great movie. Hollywood has not chosen to tell the Venona story, just as they have not chosen to make movies about the Soviet gulags or China's Cultural Revolution. <br/><br/>So, Murrow was no hero, he was doing what Sixty Minutes (or, perhaps, The O'Reilly Factor) does now, although in a manner more suited to the dignified 1950's. McCarthy's popularity faded as a stream of witnesses ""took the fifth"" (as they said back then) and the investigation produced very little. McCarthy was indeed very heavy-handed and overly zealous in his approach and his treatment of witnesses (as was Richard Ben Veniste of the 9/11 commission). He was not really responsible for the ""black-listing"" of some of the people who were called before the committee, nor was he responsible for the apparent suicide of Don Hollenbeck. It was movie producers and publishers who decided (often as a result of investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee rather than the Senate's Tydings committee) who they would and would not use, just as they do today, and it was other reporters who attacked Hollenbeck, who chose (as the movie indicated) to involve himself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, McCarthy's ""crusade"" lost its popularity and he was demonized and driven from his position in disgrace. Anyone who reads the papers or watches the news has seen this happen to numerous senators and congressmen in the past fifteen years or so. It is what is called ""hardball politics."" Even if McCarthy was as bad as he is portrayed, his effect was minor. The Tydings committee (on which McCarthy served) was active for only one month and led nowhere.<br/><br/>So, that's the story. It could be told very well in 30 minutes. McCarthy's story has been kept alive by Hollywood and book publishers. Much better movies such as ""The Crucible"" (ostensibly telling of the Salem witch trials) have been based on these investigations and, as fiction, have had interesting stories woven into them.<br/><br/>People who cannot remember back to that period find it hard to understand our concern with Communism, which is now viewed by many as a benign alternate form of government. I think the people who risked their lives to escape Cuba, East Germany, Stalin's USSR or Mao's China could probably explain it."
"Bachchoy","2","19","41","6 November 2005"," If you're looking for facts on the late Joseph McCarthy, avoid this film.
","The only reason I gave this movie a 2 star rating is because of the acting. Factual inaccuracies aside, it did have a mostly good cast. As for the film itself there are a number of things that need to be pointed out that Mr. Clooney either didn't know or purposely left out in order to only show the viewer the story he wanted to see. The truth about McCarthy that many liberals choose to ignore is he DID uncover many Communists and Soviet agents. This can all be proved thanks to declassified Soviet Intelligence such as the Venona Files.<br/><br/>Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, Lauchlin Currie have each been confirmed to have been agents of the USSR, among any others. Also, we now know of at least three Congressmen working for the Soviet Union during this same time period. This Communist infiltration went far beyond the government and included such people as I.F. Stone, Michael Straight, Walter Duranty, Owen Lattimore, Edward Posniak, Mary Jane Keeney, Gustavo Duran, John Carter Vincent and Armand Hammer (who laundered money for the Soviets) were also agents of the Soviet Union. The Screen Actors Guild was also a union dominated by Communists. There lies the problem with this movie: It portrayed McCarthy's quest as a witch hunt when in fact he was right.<br/><br/>One person, Annie Lee Moss, is what Edward R. Murrow used as ammunition against McCarthy. He even devoted his weekly ""See It Now"" program to Mrs. Moss's plight. However, a year after McCarthy's death it was revealed that she WAS indeed the same Annie Lee Moss whose name and address appeared on the rolls of the local Communist Party, another fact neglected by this film. In the end, this is nothing but a propaganda piece using lies and half truths to further demonize the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. It's a shame, too. This could have been one of the best movies of the year if the director had bothered to do some research before making it."

I was also fairly impressed with Clooney's script. The dialog in this movie is very sharp and funny in the right places.<br/><br/>Although I think some people will more than likely try to pin certain political tags on this movie, I think it accomplished something that goes beyond politics. In the end, I think the movie is not about Senator McCarthy, but about the tenacity, intelligence and wisdom of Murrow, and about the message he was trying to send us in 1953. Let's hope this movie helps us to inspire journalism that transcends its mere use as a political foil.<br/><br/>Above all, I think this movie is a fitting tribute to someone who was there for this country in one of its darkest hours.<br/><br/>""We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home."" - Edward R.

","George Clooney's movie ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" about pious parson Edward R. Murrow and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, failed to produce one person unjustly accused by McCarthy. Well, now we know the truth. Decrypted Soviet cables and mountains of documents from Soviet archives prove beyond doubt that Lawrence Duggan, a friend of Murrow, was one of Stalin's most important spies. ""McCarthyism"" didn't kill him; his guilt did.<br/><br/>Because of Murrow's good buddy Duggan, innocent people were killed. Not just the millions murdered during the purges while Duggan was earning ""employee of the month"" awards from Stalin. At least one man was murdered solely to protect Duggan's identity as a Soviet spy.<br/><br/>Ignatz Reiss had been the head of Soviet secret police in Europe. As such, he was aware of Soviet agents in the U.S., including Duggan. But unlike Duggan, Reiss was stunned by Stalin's bloody purges. In 1937, Reiss defected from the Soviet Union, threatening to expose Duggan if they came after him. It was his death warrant. Soviet officials later happily informed Duggan's handler in America: ""(Reiss) is liquidated, (but) not yet his wife. ... Now the danger that (Duggan) will be exposed because of (Reiss) is considerably decreased."" <br/><br/>Despite all Clooney's double-sourced fact-checking, he missed the part about Murrow's good friend Duggan being an accomplice to murder. I give this movie a one for complete failure and George should just act and stay out of politics!"

","I finally saw this tonight with a friend. We both agree that it's just not a very good film. Clooney's direction and the screenplay give us little sense of how menacing the senator really was. It's very insular; the film would have been better if it took to the streets instead of keeping everyone in the newsroom the whole time. Cool and jazzy is always the mood, with a black woman appearing every now and then to sing random ditties. That doesn't work for me. The film wants to be about something serious but the score conflicts with that. Then there's a subplot about a marriage between staff members played by Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr. Nothing comes of it. David's performance as Murrow would be fine if Edward R. Murrow weren't a historic figure. But because he is one and because many of his own performances are readily available in film archives, it becomes obvious that David was either miscast or just didn't do his research. The real Edward R. Murrow was much more charismatic than David would have us believe. Even the decision to shoot the film in black and white is questionable. The characters are smiling and cracking wry jokes half the time. Nothing dark about that, nothing suggestive of Schindler's List. It's a self-important film that probably benefits (at least with critics) from assumed parallels to our current political atmosphere and the fact that it takes place in the middle of the 20th century like so many other acclaimed films of late. I'm a liberal guy but I think it's possible to judge even a film this political without compromising my own views. As a film, it just didn't work for me. I nonetheless admire Clooney for bringing this story to the screen."

","More auspicious than his first directing effort, George Clooney has directed what is definitely a good film here. The visual side is excellent, with the feel of both a documentary and noir combined into one. While the technical aspects are great, it is a bit shy of being a brilliant film. There is little to complain about as such, except for the inclusion of a subplot with two supporting characters that is meant to be symbolism of McCarthyism, but it is too obvious to work, and is awkwardly fitted into the storyline. The main problem with the film is that it lacks in complexity. It portrays the important events but it does not dare to deeply explore them. Murrow is not explored in much depth as a person either. There is no emotional involvement to be had - it is not much different from reading a history book. Sure, the film tries to say some things about television and the power of mass media, but the ideas are delivered more so as lessons than as subtle and effective messages. So, some parts of the film do not quite work, but it is a fine production overall. If not quite brilliant, the performances are competent and the sound recording and soundtrack music help in establishing atmosphere. It is a well-done film, but when push comes to shove, it had the potential to be more than just a good film. It is certainly worth seeing though, if for nothing else than to see what Clooney is capable of as a director."

In 1953, while fear ruling this nation and an incipient television, the CBS journalist Edward R.

In this latest hunting, many careers and families were destroyed by the paranoia of communism, with shallow and even false accusations of being ""pinkos"" or communists. George Clooney made an excellent research and delivered a magnificent film. Using a stunning black and white cinematography with excerpts of footages from the fifties, and excellent cast, highlighting David Strathairn, and supported by a beautiful music score, this movie is a great example that politicians can deceive electors but not history.

"frankiehudson","6","5","8","13 March 2006"," Good Luck to the modern media
","This is a dull yet watchable film about the final days of the Senator McCarthy communist witch-hunts of the 1950s. David Straithairn is outstanding as the dour, chain-smoking manic depressive TV presenter Edward R Murrow, a legendary journalist who had reported from London during the early days of World War II and who became the famous 'anchor' on CBS television.<br/><br/>Murrow finally decides he's had enough of McCarthy and his paranoid crusade against non-existent enemies within  given added impetus by the sacking by the Air Force of a private  and goes on the offensive. It is a make-or-break, career defining moment for him.<br/><br/>The archive shots of McCarthy in the Senate are uncannily reminiscent of the Stalinist show-trials of the 1930s  innocent people like the black cloakroom attendant hounded and persecuted by the fanatical McCarthy.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck is surely the only film that is shot entirely indoors. The claustrophobia is unrelenting, enhanced by the black and white film and the film studio setting, a place of darkness and quiet. It is like a TV station version of Downfall, the film about Hitler's final days in the bunker, with Murrow a vampire of the microphone, shrouded by cigarette fumes. He is a nocturnal agitator, a ghost of some faded liberal, pre-Cold War past who is about to hit McCarthy.<br/><br/>It is the mission of these TV station journalists to confront the over-whelming force of McCarthyite censorship, from their defiant bunker, to rejuvenate American journalism. That is the theme of the film - the challenge of free speech over fear.<br/><br/>Murrow is not above reproach, of course, specialising in fake interviews and product placement. He cashes in on his obsessive smoking, kowtowing to the Kent cigarette company.<br/><br/>The film features various editorial meetings, with Fred Friendly (George Clooney), Sig Mickelson (the ever-reliable Jeff Daniels) and Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jnr) deliberating over the magnitude of their quest. However, for me, it lacks the gravity and dramatic impact of similar scenes in All the Presidents Men.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a clear warning on the situation today in America. There is now a docile, compliant and corporate-controlled media which blindly and slavishly peddles Bush's line on the phoney War on Terror, etc., thereby aiding the war machine that is American industry. There is no real journalism left, certainly not on TV.<br/><br/>Murrow's massive, over-powering speech at the beginning and end, bookmarks and encapsulates the entire theme of the film: the conflict between entertainment and ideas; the commercial imperatives of running a corporate-funded TV station; and the responsibility the TV journalist has towards his audience. It is a true 'Iron Curtain' speech  like the famous Winston Churchill speech in Fulton, Missouri, in 1946 when he prophecies the Cold War.<br/><br/>Murrow considers the conflict between journalistic integrity and the commercial dynamics of a TV station  the corporate advertisers who avoid controversy like the plague. And the extreme political pressure from government and military sources that is inevitably brought to bear on the people that run such an awesomely powerful medium."

","Clooney has certainly shot a beautiful film - black and white, great details evoking what I imagine the 1950's television industry was like. The performances are all good. However, I can't help feeling that critics are raving about the film simply because its subject matter (McCarthyism and the way the media handled it) also speaks to us now with similar concerns that many Americans have with the Bush Administration and the way the media has/has not been handling it. I get a sense from the film and many reviewers that they wish an Edward R. Murrow and a courageous broadcaster would appear like a knight in shining armour to skewer the current administration and expose it for what it is, and that they feel this film is an artistic call to arms. I don't feel that the film's topicality is sufficient to make it a ""brilliant"" film that everyone should see.<br/><br/>I felt there was no narrative tension ... perhaps this is because we know so much about McCarthyism. Certainly there were a few scenes when I wondered if CBS would support Murrow & Friendly, but everything seemed inevitable: ""the good"" (Murrow) standing up against the evil (McCarthy). Yawn!"

Late Paddy Chayefsky would have been proud of it.Reminded me a lot of a 1956 movie called PATTERNS, written by Rod ""Twilight Zone"" Serling. David Strathairn as journalist Edward Murrow gives a terrific performance; his character is very dry and controlled, his eyes the only way to let his inner emotions out. His speech at the beginning and at the end of the movie, it's clearly intended to touch the audience consciences about the dangerous times we are living nowadays. There's a lot of dialog, some of the best lines are spoken by Frank Langella as William Paley, CBS executive. Only little disappointment is the way they used Patricia Clarkson talent. Her character is out of focus and seems to me it serves to lighten the main story, supporting a sub-plot that only releases the tension of the whole thing when comes around.<br/><br/>Anyway, worth to see, if only to understand how political paroxysm can ruins people lives.<br/><br/>A very, very liberal piece of cinema, could have something to say at the next Oscars night.<br/><br/>Well, good night, and good luck..."

I think this movie uses Murrow's attacks on McCarthy to discuss these topics. Besides, a movie is a piece of art, you can't throw a poem away simply because you disagree with one of the poet's opinions. Yes, I realize that in this case George Clooney was dealing with historical figures, but it's the same concept. Evaluate a movie for its worth as a piece of art, not as a list of ideals.

Besides the fact that Murrow portrays truth and inside information for his public to understand, we see what else goes on in the boardroom from staff members such as Fred Friendly (George Clooney), CBS reporter Don Hollenback (Ray Wise) and others find stories that are good enough for the ratings.<br/><br/>With the film under ninety minutes, director/actor/co-star/co-writer George Clooney shows what else goes on inside the world of journalism prior to freedom of speech. There are subplots where workers for the CBS news are questioned by the government on communism to two staff members (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) who keep their marriage quiet and realize they are breaking a rule stating that married couples are not allowed to work in the same company.<br/><br/>With today in the world of journalism, who can tell the truth about what is going on? Or is it all about looks and personality? While I wasn't familiar with Edward R. Murrow since I was born in the early 1980's, everyday I watch different news broadcasts and see what kind of stories they have to point out everyday. Why is it that people like to watch the news? Is it because they want to find out about what goes on in the world or is it about looks? Many people would watch the news to see Diane Sawyer or Peter Jennings's looks where as seeing Dan Rather for his somewhat redneck humor he probably got from a Jeff Foxworthy book.<br/><br/>While being under the impression that Mr. Clooney's father worked in a news station when the actor was a child, I was impressed he can do more than just play a hero on screen or in real life.<br/><br/>If i had words to end my comment: Pure talent!"

However the paranoia of Communism remained for the remainder of the decade, and with it came the ""duck and cover"" air raid drills and canned food storage drives aimed at keeping children safe at their elementary or parochial schools.

""Good Night, and Good Luck."" is another in the long line of critical successes this year that deals with highly complex and difficult subject matter. Clooney is a one-of-a-kind when it comes to directing, but his style is definitely not for all tastes. The picture's tone, flow and look make the viewer feel tense, uncomfortable and claustrophobic. The movie is black and white, but in truth it is gray. It has that 1953 television screen look to it that honestly makes it appear cheap and unrefined. Also smoke is in seemingly every frame. I nearly got lung cancer myself watching as cigarette smoke is prevalent throughout thus we have light gray on a slightly darker gray canvas. Though used by Clooney to prove a point, the style is not easy to watch or adapt to. Supporting players all over the place come and go like they are on a merry-go-round. Frank Langella stands out as a top executive with CBS. Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr. deliver distracting parts as closet husband and wife employees (CBS did not allow married couples to work for them during that time). Jeff Daniels, Thomas McCarthy, Tate Donovan and Alex Borstein are also on hand in the venture. Ray Wise's tortured newsman who worries about having his life taken away with past affiliations brings much needed heart, emotion and light to an otherwise dreary and depressing film that nearly never finds its legs. Important story and fascinating production from varying angles and views, ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" will never find a mainstream appeal with the masses but it still has many positives going for it if you can find them through the clouded screen. 4 stars out of 5."
"beame","7","4","6","19 January 2006"," A well-made, well-acted history lesson
","The fact that Good Night and Good Luck is going to be a history lesson, heavy on the word 'lesson', is evident in the first few minutes with the extensive caption setting the context of Joseph McCarthy and HUAC. This is a history lesson that is exceedingly timely and well made and it has drawn extensive praise for both of these qualities. However, it concentrates so much on being faithful to the history, including details of television production in Murrow's day (fascinating as they are), that this history lesson does not make for great drama. Murrow's knock-out blow on McCarthy is a counter-punch but it is so total, unanticipated and without build-up that much of the drama is lost. While viewers can briefly cheer the triumph of his few lines of rebuttal that do the trick, their emotional impact is not sufficient to carry the denouement as Murrow's brand of high quality journalism is moved out of prime time. As a result the denouement does not produce the sense of loss that it might. <br/><br/>David Strathairn is outstanding as Edward R. Murrow. As one might expect, he perfectly captures Murrow's intonation, mannerisms, and familiar hard-hitting journalistic style, but Strathairn also subtly and eloquently communicates how Murrow squirms while doing his obligatory celebrity interviews, or is affected by his protégé's suicide. Frank Langella is also excellent in showing the two sides of CBS head William Paley, both the broadcaster willing to go out on a limb and the CEO whose decisions are dominated by the bottom line. (It is interesting to think that CBS also led the resurgence in prime-time journalism with ""60 Minutes"" more than a decade later.) George Clooney as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly adds little; he seems better behind the camera. Robert Downey Jr and Patricia Clarkson as secretly married staffers on Murrow's show are very good, though their subplot seems put in place solely for the history lesson since they disappear as soon as we learn how the 1950's work rules affected married couples.<br/><br/>The script feels somewhat thin and is stretched by frequent interludes with a jazz singer (Dianne Reeves who is excellent) and repetition of footage that we see twice, once as the staff is previewing it and again as the show airs. There is a certain sense of smugness in the point of view. We know that right (not the right, of course) will triumph and it seems inevitable. We can also be smug with our knowledge of the future of commercial television (while we of course watch Frontline on PBS). That seems right: Good Night and Good Luck is like a superbly acted Frontline episode without the usual narration."

","At the 1960 conventions on CBS, Murrow, Erik Sevaraid, Charles Collingwood and others would gather in a dark room off the convention floor and analyze events. Wreaths of smoke curled overhead, half blinding the audience. Everyone smoked during those post-convention sessions. <br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck has Ed Murrow smoking during the famous Joe McCarthy documentary on See It Now. The real Ed may have used a cigarette as a prop interviewing Marilyn Monroe but never on See It Now, his serious show. <br/><br/>George Clooney co-wrote, directed and appears as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. I've read twelve books about Murrow, McCarthy and McCarthy Counsel Roy Cohn, but I thought Jeff Daniels was playing CBS President Frank Stanton, not CBS News President Sig Mickelson, until the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Straithern must have dieted seriously for Good Night and Good Luck. He is seriously thin in the movie. Murrow's gauntness emphasizes the stress he endures and foreshadows the cancer he will die of eleven years later. David Strathairn has never looked as old and frail in a film as he does here. <br/><br/>Strathairn's performance is difficult to accept for those of us who remember Murrow. Strathairn doesn't want to do a straight imitation, he wants to act the part. When he says good night and good luck he turns away as he says good luck. Ed would never have done that. Strathairn is being pinched by the many constraints of the role.<br/><br/>In the film Murrow smokes incessantly. Murrow to Fred Friendly: ""Freddie, every time you light my cigarette, I know you're lying to me."" <br/><br/>The movie opens with the Murrow staff at CBS in Manhattan preparing to canonize an Air Force Sergeant who has been tossed out of the Service because his father reads subversive magazines.<br/><br/>Already CBS Chairman Bill Paley is feeling stomach pains and Friendly and Murrow haven't mentioned the McCarthy show.<br/><br/>The audience needs to stretch its legs in this one, but Clooney keeps the action mostly confined to the studio.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Junior has little to do here as a member of the Murrow Documentary team. Patricia Clarkson plays his wife and colleague at CBS. Clarkson registers as a bright spot among the shadowy, Noirish filmmakers. She lifts the energy of Murrow's Raiders each time she appears. The film brightens too.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels is cynical as Mickelson the news chief, Paley's henchman overseeing the Murrow crew. But Frank Langella's CBS Chairman Bill Paley is more chilling than the Dracula Langella played twenty years ago. <br/><br/>Clooney is average as Murrow Producer Fred Friendly, though he must have put on 60 pounds to play the part.<br/><br/>Clarkson, Daniels and Langella have to make way for Ray Wise, who plays WCBS anchorman Don Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck comes under siege from newspaper columnist Jack O'Brien. Wise, who has mostly played showy characters in low budget films, manages a brilliant performance with little screen time.<br/><br/>There are fabulous ironies buried in the film. Murrow is smoking himself to death while one of his sponsors shows a spot on his program saying Kent cigarettes have filters on them that make them safe. I saw that commercial when I was an impressionable nine. I finally was able to stop nine years ago.<br/><br/>Alcoa sponsors See It Now. Its cornball commercials run unremarked upon by Murrow and his men. Liberace is interviewed on the popular but lightweight Person to Person Ed hosts to balance the books at CBS for losses on See It Now. He asks a youngish Liberace when he is likely to get married, another irony since everyone knows now the flamboyant piano player was gay.<br/><br/>The film uses the real McCarthy from film clips, and the real Liberace. Only once did I hear the real Ed's voice on the track. Assistant Defense Counsel Bobby Kennedy could be seen in clips along with Arkansas Senator John McClellan and Missouri Senator Stuart Symington. Archive film integrates smoothly with acted material.<br/><br/>Murrow colleague Eric Sevaraid said that Ed was late going after McCarthy. Clooney uses a less dramatic part of Army Counsel Joseph Welch's attack on McCarthy to make it appear it was Murrow who slew Joe and not Welch at the McCarthy Hearings. <br/><br/>But it was neither Murrow nor Welch who finished Joe. McCarthy Committee Chief Counsel Roy Cohn and Private David Schine earlier toured Embassies and US Information Agency stations in Europe with the press in tow. The two censored and replaced books like a couple of disciples of Joseph Goebbels. The Press had a field day mocking them. McCarthy backed up Schine and Cohn with an investigation of the Army after it balked at letting Schine be relieved from duty to serve on Joe's staff. It would have been the moral equivalent of the Army assigning PFC Elvis Presley to serve as assistant to Sun Records Producer Sam Phillips.<br/><br/>One day during the three months of the McCarthy hearing Welch needled Cohn and McCarthy with an absurd conversation about 'pixies,' a sly attempt at unmasking Cohn's homosexuality to hip viewers, while subtly informing McCarthy that Welch had sharks teeth too. <br/><br/>Welch's dramatic condemnation of Joe for revealing Welch colleague Fred Fisher as a member of a Communist Party Front was left on Clooney's cutting room floor. That missing footage was powerful enough to get Welch a role as Judge in the film Anatomy of a Murder.<br/><br/>McCarthy was censured by the Senate and died three years later of acute cirrhosis. A decade later Poet Alan Ginsberg came to Appleton, Wisconsin for a poetry reading and afterward danced on Joe's grave.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck is a movie for cynics. A film for people who lived during the era and cracked wise. Even the New York Times couldn't resist a wise guy tout for the film: ""SEE IT NOW!"""

","Habeas corpus, due process, and guilt by association play a mighty part of our daily news in the Bush administration. It is sadly reminiscent of the ""good old days"" from other periods of history in our country, notably the period covered by this fine film. Pastor Martin Niemoeller's quote from Nazi Germany is important to the theme of the film, ""First they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the communists and I did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me."" Murrow was a great American in his time. The question is who carries the burden of the U.S. Constitution's vital safeguards of political liberty today? This writer is having difficulty naming courageous contemporary journalists, too."
"brillpro","10","4","6","21 October 2005"," A Must See Film with Oscar Possibilities: There will never be another Murrow
","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a must see film for everyone whether you know the story of the battle between CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joe McCarthy or not. Sitting in a half filled theater with patrons with an average age of 50 only strengthened my belief we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past because there are so few of the current generation who want to learn the history of how we got to where we are.<br/><br/>The film, which is George Clooney's second as a director, is a gem. Interestingly enough it took a big screen project to give renewed life to a small screen voice. The fact it is only 93 minutes only enhances the story it tells.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot in black and white it draws upon a narrow focus of scenes shot entirely inside the CBS building. You never wander outside except for a moment in the beginning and you constantly feel the intensity of this important story, even with its side journeys. These side journeys are neither little, nor unimportant. Instead they lead to the bigger issue at hand which are myriad personal freedoms we enjoy today which were kept from us 50 years ago.<br/><br/>For 93 minutes, despite the side lights as important as they are, the main issue the story focuses upon of course is the purge of Communists and the US Senate hearings conducted by McCarthy. Clooney brilliantly decides early on in the process he will not get an actor to portray the junior Senator from Wisconsin but instead uses actual clips of McCarthy as he purges, twists and manipulates his way through the terror of these historic hearings. Clooney shows how Murrow and his team take on McCarthy in defense of the constitution over the objections of CBS head William Paley and the sponsors.<br/><br/>One of the cool things shown in the film is several commercials of the day. The one for Kent Cigarettes is particularly troubling as it admonishes the pleasures of smoking and how intelligent people are the ones who know to smoke Kent Cigarettes. It shows how far we've come. It is also interesting since Murrow himself has always been synonymous with smoking; never without a lit cigarette in hand even on the air. Imagine that today? Clooney's use of Diane Reeves soft yet powerful jazzy vocals help set the mood everywhere they are used as breakers or transitions from scene to scene. It is a nice touch and yet not overdone. The music is gentle enough but poignant to where you believe it's something from above, someone higher up looking down on what is happening. The music gives you just enough time to digest the points made moments earlier and Reeves smooth tones help you digest it perfectly. Clooney is moving into Oscar land with this one.<br/><br/>Another key focus of the film is Murrow's insistence TV is a powerful medium which if (said in the 1950's) we aren't careful will become a tool used to broadcast mindless gibberish. Murrow was a prophet in this respect because what he warned of is so true today. Murrow likely turns in his grave at reality television. It all came down to money and Murrow was lucky enough Paley stuck with him to a point. A point which helped McCarthy eventually self destruct.<br/><br/>Through all of this you almost lose sight of the fact actor David Strathairn, who plays Murrow flawlessly, is acting. He is Murrow and will deservedly get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal. It won't hurt Murrow is so highly regarded among the Hollywood elite but even so Strathairn as they say ""nailed it."" There are a few easy going funny lines in the film and Strathairn handles them so deftly you wonder why this established actor doesn't do more comedy.<br/><br/>For fans he has been excellent in such films as ""Eight Men Out"" and ""A League of Their Own"" along with dozens of other pictures. He is likable and while usually permitted only to play under stated characters, he uses this same technique to give Murrow the depth he deserves. Murrow is deep in his convictions and while sometimes troubled by them, remains stern and true to the course. This in the end is the legacy Murrow leaves behind; true to the course of true, fair, enterprising and analytical journalism. Always asking the question of ""why"" backed with the facts.<br/><br/>Seeing a true newsroom allowed me to remember my days at UPI, at the time one of the only remaining facets of real journalism, a wire service independent of advertisers. I was reminded of one of the reasons I left the world of commercial journalism because TV and radio had become just what Murrow warned they would become; garbage in and garbage out. <br/><br/>Finishing with the film in question, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" shows us all something else. It shows us why there will never be another Edward R. Murrow. The medium has gone past his wildest criticisms and sunk to depths he would never survive. He'd be off in seclusion likely writing a book, or thriving on PBS."

","If you have long bought into the popular liberal Hollywood premise that Sen. Joseph McCarthy was the ""anti-Christ"" of free speech -- and most of us were taught exactly that in school and still hold to it, then this film production from self-avowed liberal George Clooney will be that manipulative paean that satisfies your sense of self-righteous indignation about the mythical ""witch-hunt"" of the 1950's.<br/><br/>Fortunately for us but unfortunately for Clooney, that premise has been called into question with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the resulting release by our government in 1995 of decryptions of Soviet intelligence cables from the 40's and 50's. These cable messages, called the Venona cables, confirm Sen. McCarthy's suspicions of Soviet agents in essential government agencies. <br/><br/>If you examine the Venona cables, it turns out that McCarthy was right, after all.<br/><br/>Eleven years later and it is surprising that the release of these decoded ""spy messages"" from the former Soviet Union are not better-known. Hollywood, a bastion of liberalism, has no plans to produce anything that examines the Venona evidence since it will put McCarthy in a more reasonable light. Where's the entertainment value in admitting someone might have been wrongly smeared? <br/><br/>With the release of the Venona papers -- and eleven years later, the release of ""Good Night and Good Luck"", one can see Hollywood ""circling the wagons"" as more and more of these decryptions of Soviet messages become known and McCarthy's suspicions and allegations turn out to have been either true or well-based.<br/><br/>With the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991 leading to the opening of Soviet archives that had never been examined by independent scholars, the whole question of McCarthy's charges is reopened. This film addresses none of it.<br/><br/>The historically rich documentation first made available in Moscow's archives in 1992 has resulted in an outpouring of new historical writing, as these records allow a far more complete and accurate understanding of central events of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>Not only do the Venona files supply information in their own right, but because of their inherent reliability they also provide a touchstone for judging the credibility of other sources, such as defectors' testimony, FBI investigative files and, ultimately, Joseph McCarthy's warnings and revelations.<br/><br/>Through most of the twentieth century, governments of powerful nations have conducted intelligence operations of some sort during both peace and war. None, however, used espionage as an instrument of state policy as extensively as did the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. In the late 1920s and 1930s, Stalin directed Soviet intelligence at nearby targets in Europe and Asia. America was still distant from Stalin's immediate concerns, the threat to Soviet goals posed by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. This perception changed, however, after the United States entered the world war in December 1941. Stalin realized that once Germany and Japan were defeated, the world would be left with only three powers able to project their influence across the globe: the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States. And of these, the strongest would be the United States.<br/><br/>With that in mind, Stalin's intelligence agencies shifted their focus toward America.<br/><br/>One mission of these Soviet intelligence officers, however, was espionage against the United States. The deciphered Venona cables do more than reveal the remarkable success that the Soviet Union had in recruiting spies and gaining access to many important U.S. government agencies and laboratories dealing with secret information. They expose beyond cavil the American Communist party as an auxiliary of the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union. While not every Soviet spy was a Communist, most were. And while not every American Communist was a spy, hundreds were. The CPUSA itself worked closely with Soviet intelligence agencies to facilitate their espionage. Party leaders were not only aware of the liaison; they actively worked to assist the relationship.<br/><br/>Information from the Venona decryptions underlay the policies of U.S. government officials in their approach to the issue of domestic communism. The investigations and prosecutions of American Communists undertaken by the federal government in the late 1940s and early 1950s were premised on an assumption that the CPUSA had assisted Soviet espionage. This view contributed to the Truman administration's executive order in 1947, reinforced in the early 1950s under the Eisenhower administration, that U.S. government employees be subjected to loyalty and security investigations. The understanding also lay behind the 1948 decision by Truman's attorney general to prosecute the leaders of the CPUSA under the sedition sections of the Smith Act. It was an explicit assumption behind congressional investigations of domestic communism in the late 1940s and 1950s, and it permeated public attitudes toward domestic communism.<br/><br/>The Soviet Union's unrestrained espionage against the United States from 1942 to 1945 was of the type that a nation directs at an enemy state.<br/><br/>Sen. McCarthy knew this.<br/><br/>Of course, where's the benefit to Clooney if he had to re-examine his beliefs and address how Hollywood has wrongly smeared an American senator who turned out to be patriotic and correct after all? Who in Hollywood would fund such a film? Ah, but Hollywood millions will pour into a film like this. <br/><br/>Move over, Michael Moore. George Clooney is now in town."

","A dishonest act of cowardice from George Clooney comes at the same hour Clooney is spinning sympathy for suicide bombers and terrorists in his other current movie. Can there be any easier target than the late Senator Joseph McCarthy, long since deceased and the subject of pervasive Liberal propaganda for the last 50 years. Most people who think they have a reason to hold McCarthy in contempt really have no valid information about his history; indeed 50% of what he's now blamed for had nothing whatever to do with McCarthy and his anti-Communist hearings. For example, Lib-spin blames Senator McCarthy for the HOUSE UnAmerican Activities Committee, but indeed as a Senator, not a Congressman, McCarthy had no part in it. Eventually, by the way, multi-Academy Award director Elia Kazan blew the lid off the Hollywood Communists with his insider testimony of their guilt. This film is about Edward R. Murrow, a liar, a coward and a Pharisee; just as Dan Rather would be CBS'S latter day liar, coward and Pharisee. Living now in legend, a legend underlined by George Clooney's movie, few today are old enough to remember that CBS News was as corrupt 5 decades ago as they are today. Murrow has been praised in Lib-Spin for 50 years, with counter-opinion seldom expressed. Those who see and believe still another Big Lie movie are destined to continue flirtation with ignorance until they grow up and seek out real facts."
"aharmas","10","9","18","9 October 2005"," Integrity and decency
","Clooney's film presents the themes of integrity and decency with an assured hand. It depicts journalism as an ethical and responsible function that is compromised and attacked by others who might have interests other than the public's at hand. ""Good Night"" reintroduces us to the historical period where some innocent people might have prosecuted without any evidence of a crime, where the pervasive atmosphere of paranoia overtook common sense and allowed some individuals to become drink with the power of manipulation. It reached levels of madness and indecency, as journalists such as Murrow began questioning intent and agendas. Soon, Murrow became the target of people like McCarthy, who refuse to surrender the spotlight and the power they now command.<br/><br/>In ""Good Night and Good Luck"", there is never any of the frenzy and heightened emotions so common in media films we had before. The issues are critical and important to the nation, the events are highly emotional, but Clooney assured direction keeps us calm while we observe and study this part of American history. It's interesting to note that some of the speeches by Murrow in the opening and closing scenes are so relevant to today's atmosphere. We live in a country where the media exerts so much power and so rarely it educates us in what is really important. Once I asked a friend what would happen if all the newscasts were canceled one day? He replied ""not many people would complain"", then I replied, ""what about sports events?"". His sarcastic comeback was: ""it would be the end of the world"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film will probably receive well deserved accolades for its fine craftsmanship and performances. Its glorious black and white cinematography enhances and makes us focus on the content, and the accurate and detailed production values support the outstanding performances and directions. It deserves an audience and plenty of awards. Will the public find it? Maybe if they run commercials during some fluff, and then again, we might be busy getting snack or playing with the remote."

Or was it that Mr Clooney's budget wouldn't run to colour stock, after all, he did boast in the pompous commentary to his brainchild that he hired the lead because he was ""cheap"".<br/><br/>Seldom have I seem such an unengaging movie with such a lack of character definition masquerading as important work apart from the equally excruciating Crash. The unbelievably one-dimensional characters merely come across as smug as they slap each other's backs at another blow for freedom and democracy, while David Strathairn staring moodily into the camera and blowing smoke everywhere as he educates an awestruck US public with his masterful insights merely made me splutter with laughter. As for the character that is so hounded he gasses himself, the issue is treated in such a perfunctory way that five minutes later it is easier to remember he was the barber in the Man Who Wasn't There than who he was in the movie.

","In the '50s, paranoid US senator Joseph McCarthy led a witch hunt against all people suspected of being communists, ruining a lot of lives (Academy Award-winning screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was among his victims). This compelling and honest movie is about the one man who tried to take down the senator, a journalist who eventually started a chain of events leading to the end of McCarthy's terror.<br/><br/>That man's name was Edward Murrow (the film's title comes from his trademark sign-off at the end of each broadcast), and like fellow journalists Woodward and Bernstein (see All the President's Men) he looked for the truth, knowing about the consequences and facing his enemy fearlessly. He was the kind of anchorman we really need nowadays, and thanks to George Clooney's second directorial effort, he'll never be forgotten.<br/><br/>In the movie, McCarthy is shown through archive footage, making it more realistic (besides, there's no need for an actor to embody his buffoon-like personality), as we see Murrow ( David Strathairn) and his colleagues (including Clooney himself, who's also written the script, and Robert Downey Jr.) reveal the truth about all the people who are dragged in court because suspected of supporting communists or being communists themselves. Even Murrow is accused of being anti-American, but he doesn't care and goes on with his battle.<br/><br/>With this very personal opus (his father Nick was an anchorman and a huge admirer of Murrow's tenacity) George Clooney shows us that journalism, just like in the already mentioned All the President's Men, is an instrument that should be used only to tell the truth, and he gets great help from the excellent Strathairn, best known for smaller parts in modern classics (he was Tom Cruise's brother in The Firm and Kim Basinger's pimp in L.A. Confidential). The supporting cast impresses as well (other than Clooney and Downey, there are also memorable turns from Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels and Patricia Clarkson), but it's Strathairn's slender figure and calm voice that dominate the entire picture.<br/><br/>Justly awarded for Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival and a very likely Oscar contender next year, This is a real masterpiece, one of the must-see films of 2005. If you're looking for a powerful, moving, flawless anti-blockbuster, then look no further:<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck"
"WriterDave","9","7","14","17 October 2005"," A Timely Call for Responsible Journalism
","In this day and age of terror alerts, alleged torturing of prisoners, corporate run news programs, and the potential erosion of civil liberties, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" couldn't be more timely. George Clooney has crafted a near perfect docu-drama about CBS News (and in particular Edward R. Murrow-played spot on by David Strathairn) in the early 1950's when they dared to take on Senator Joe McCarthy's misbegotten hunting down of American Communist sympathizers.<br/><br/>Clooney makes three great directorial decisions here that really help the film stand out. First, it is shot in black and white and looks like a crisper cleaner version of the TV news programs of that era. Second, there is no music score save for some perfectly timed jazz numbers (almost done as commercial breaks dispersed after key moments in the film, and always with relevant lyrics). Third, and most effectively, he uses only real archival footage of McCarthy. It keeps the ""villian"" at a comfortable distance while at the same time being alarmingly true to the actual nature of McCarthy's devious ways.<br/><br/>The set designs, cinematography, and supporting cast (Frank Langella, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downy Jr., and Ray Wise) are all fantastic. At the end we are left with a plethora of great quotes that are very meaningful today from Murrow and an earnest call for journalists to rise up and bring the real stories to the public. The film seems to be saying that there is no way to have truly unbiased reporting. What is important is that everything is reported on (and that intimidation or fear of being unpopular or losing your job should not effect the news that is reported), and that if opinions are to be had either way concerning important topics, they need to be heard. Everyone in America deserves to have their forum, even Joe McCarthy, and that is what makes this country great."
"isisherbs2000","9","7","14","16 October 2005"," Oh, what a masterpiece
","This movie is something else - as a movie (theme notwithstanding), it is wonderfully paced, controlled, with something unforeseen and interesting on the screen with every new scene. Mr. Clooney is a wonderful director.<br/><br/>Also, theme notwithstanding, the acting is superb - Strathairn gave me goosebumps, Langella was masterful, Clarkson phenomenal, and the rest of the cast was absolutely wonderful. An incredibly marvelous cast.<br/><br/>Now, about the theme - if ever there was temptation to show 'the good ol' days', this would be it. After all, we all know how it ends - McCarthy was horrible, McCarthyism was an all-out attack on civil liberties and everything American and Murrow is a mythic hero. Right? <br/><br/>Well, this movie shows that, although all involved were convinced McCarthy and McCarthyism were wrong, the time period wasn't so black-n-white for the characters. There was fear, there was self-doubt, there were not-so-wonderful compromises made. This movie is about REAL people and it shows them in a REAL way - with humor, with fear, with anxiety, and even with extreme mental illness.<br/><br/>And, this movie has a point of view - it does not hide that it is a strident plea for better news media. And, like Murrow did with McCarthy, it uses Murrow's own words to make its case. Now, if you hate movies with a point of view, you may think you don't want to see it - but, I think you would be doing yourself a disfavor by staying away. Good Night and Good Luck doesn't assume we are sheep (or dittoheads), willing to simply follow. No, this movie MAKES A CASE, one that allows you to think for yourself and one that spurs discussion. <br/><br/>One little 'downside' - if you don't know much about McCarthy or Murrow except the broad strokes of quick history, you won't learn much more from seeing this - Clooney and Heslov don't spend time with back-story. They just dive into the action, and it is a GREAT ride."

Not about people smoking, but about the public media battle between CBS anchorman edward R. Murrow and Senator 'Tailgunner Joe' McCarthy.<br/><br/>The film Starts off in a dimly lit theater where Murrow is about to give a speech, with people, yes, smoking, and a profound 50's atmosphere which no doubt pales the real ambiance that those years must have held, shot in eyecandy monochrome. <br/><br/>With more than ample performances by the overall cast it is Director/Actor Clooney who seemed slightly absentminded. His patented casual acting style, however, was kindly lend by Robert Downey Jr. who in this film does it even better than Clooney did himself in Oceans Eleven. It is however David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow who steals the show.<br/><br/>Although one would suspect this movie to deal primarily with dodging political pressure in a period of time in which red wasn't just a colour in the spectrum of light, the movie unfolds strongly around intrigue as well. It would prove to be the films Achilles-heel somewhat because it makes the film lose focus. The movie however never bores, but it doesn't fully captivate either. I found myself frequently getting up from my chair to get a drink without even bothering to pause the movie.<br/><br/>That said, this Film Noir is entertaining with a straight forward plot and it absolutely stands out in the cinematography department. The music intermezzo's sung by Dianne Reeves were suitable, adding to the typical 50's feel but felt a bit unsubtle and slowed down the film which wasn't traveling at light-speed anyway.<br/><br/>Not a must see per se, but certainly not a must miss. 7/10"
"howard.schumann","8","5","9","27 February 2006"," The candor of Edward R. Murrow
","Framed by a 1958 speech to broadcast executives in which he warned that the media was losing its soul to commercial interests, George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck shows the candor of CBS-TV newsman Edward R. Murrow and, by implication, how it has gone missing in today's media journalism. Clooney attempts to recreate the political and social climate of the early 1950s when red baiting and security madness generated by the Korean and Cold Wars dominated the headlines by dramatizing Murrow's conflict with the Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the notorious anti-Communist crusader from Wisconsin. The film is shot in black and white with a hand-held camera and has a 50s feel with an all-male, all-white television studio, jazz interludes, heavy cigarette smoking and Scotch drinking, and Liberace, in an interview, forced by convention to lie about his marriage plans.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck concentrates on two broadcasts: one dealing with Milo Radulovich, an Air Force Reserve weatherman who had been discharged from the service after his father and sister were accused of Communist ties; the other challenging Senator McCarthy on ""See It Now"". David Strathairn in an Oscar-nominated performance as the beleaguered reporter, captures Murrow's mannerisms: his clipped cadences, his chain smoking habits, and his no nonsense delivery but does not project much warmth and the film, for all its timeliness and potential for high drama, feels strangely flat.<br/><br/>Murrow took on McCarthy after the Junior Senator accused him of being on the Soviet payroll because of his participation in a summer exchange program in Moscow during the thirties. Murrow retaliated with a ""See It Now"" broadcast about the Senator's tactics in which McCarthy plays himself through the use of archival film clips. He then invited McCarthy to respond which he did several weeks later but instead of answering Murrow's charges, he continued to attack the newsman as a dupe of Communists. The rebuttal made it clear that McCarthy was a bully who had no respect for individual rights or the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution and approval ratings for the series of shows ran as high as ten to one in favor of Murrow. These broadcasts, however, brought Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) into conflict with CBS President William Paley (Frank Langella) and eventually cost him his regularly weekly TV spot.<br/><br/>The film zeroes in on these two programs but does not mention the context in which the events took place. For those in need of a reminder, in 1949, President Truman initiated a program that required a loyalty investigation of every person entering civilian employment in the executive branch of the Federal Government, the Rosenberg's were executed for espionage, suspected subversives were questioned before The House Un-American Activities Committee beginning in 1947, and Senator Pat McCarran further trampled on constitutional rights with his Internal Security Act of 1950. By omitting these details, the film suggests that McCarthy created the climate of fear, rather than exploiting it for his own personal gain.<br/><br/>The film also implies that Murrow was the David who slew Goliath but the truth is more complex. There were many others who spoke out against McCarthy long before Murrow such as Professor Henry Steele Commager of Columbia, New York Post editor James Wechsler, and Democratic Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson who said in 1952, ""The whole notion of loyalty inquisitions is a national characteristic of the police state, not of democracy and pointed out the dangers of ""phony patriots"", ""ill-informed censors"" and ""self-appointed thought police"". While Murrow did stand up to McCarthy, it was pretty late in the game and, while it took considerable courage, did not make much of a dent in McCarthy's armor. It was left to McCarthy himself to self-destruct with an ill-advised attack on Eisenhower (who had never challenged McCarthy) and the U.S. Army.<br/><br/>Where Good Night, and Good Luck does succeed is in making us painfully aware that the forthright journalism personified by Murrow has gone the way of the hula-hoop. In his exposé of McCarthy, Murrow challenged America to distinguish between dissent and disloyalty, a distinction that is more relevant than ever today. He said, ""We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes which were for the moment unpopular. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of the Republic to abdicate his responsibility."" That statement should be required reading in today's corporate media boardrooms."

","I went with high expectations, and at the start I thought it was terrific, and it only got better.<br/><br/>Shockingly good. The use of Billie Holliday as interludes, in lieu of a score was outstanding. The use of black and white not only allowed the filmmakers to use actual footage, but our memories of Edward R. Murrow are all black and white.<br/><br/>There are so many interesting but very subtle contrasts here, and there are parallels that might be drawn between these events of the fifties and subsequent occurrences. It would be a disservice to point them out if you have not seen the film.<br/><br/>The acting was uniformly awe-inspiring. Let me leave you with one impression I had: before I saw the film, I had read little about it, and knew only the subject it dealt with. I didn't know for sure who directed it, but thought I recalled that Clooney did. As well as writing it. Toward the end, when Bill Paley (Frank Langella) gives bad news to Murrow and Friendly (George Clooney), Paley asks Friendly to stay for a moment as Murrow leaves the room. Oh, no, I thought, here is the Oscar-winning scene that Clooney wrote for himself (because there had not been any until then). I had to wait for the credits and then I was amazed that Clooney had in fact directed and written the film--because there was NO Oscar-winning scene. The camera waited outside with Murrow. This is definitely not a Clooney ego trip. The news of the fifties was very entertaining today. I'd give it an eleven if I was allowed."
"PensacolaBeachBlog","9","5","9","3 December 2005"," Clooney's alternative ending is a clue to the morality of this tale.
","Alternative Endings: Good Night and Good Luck<br/><br/>George Clooney's elegant film, ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" playing locally at the Gulf Breeze Cinema 4, frames itself with a notable speech Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) delivered from a brightly lit elevated lectern at the National Radio and Television News Directors Assocation convention in 1958. The speech was delivered near the end of Murrow's career as a CBS journalist, just seven years before he died of brain cancer at age 57.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, the stylishly-dressed audience smiles up at Murrow with good humored expectation, much as any audience might show eager anticipation at the start of a new show. By the end of the speech, to which we return as the film concludes, the audience has fallen silent. It is in shadows. Is the audience stunned by what has been said? Angry? Bored? We can only guess what the people are thinking -- if they are thinking at all.<br/><br/>Inside this frame, Clooney (who co-wrote, directed, and plays the role of Fred Friendly) tells the story in lush black and white cinema photography of Murrow's dramatic exposure of the witch-hunting tactics of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. In Clooney's hands, as a number of reviewers take the trouble to explain for the many readers who do not know of it, this is a tale of individual journalistic courage during a very dark time in our nation's history.<br/><br/>Our former wartime ally, the Soviet Union, had become a Cold War adversary. Nuclear war seemed imminent. Propaganda films taught us to ""duck and cover"" in school when the bombs start falling. Neighbors shrouded their homes in canvas, vainly trying to hide the bomb shelters they were building for personal use. School teachers, employees of private companies, journalists, and millions of others were forced to sign loyalty oaths on pain of losing their livelihoods.<br/><br/>* * * The film certainly presents, front-and-center, a tale of journalistic courage in confronting the evil of Joe McCarthy. Not just the courage of Murrow, either, or of his See It Now team of journalists and producers. There were others whose names are now all but lost to history, like Elmer Davis, I.F. Stone, George Seldes, Herb Block, Bill Mauldin, to name just a few.<br/><br/>Standing in for all of them in Clooney's movie is the tragic figure of Don Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck was the Walter Cronkite of his day -- a voice as recognizable and trusted by Americans as any in the history of electronic journalism. <br/><br/>* * * With a film message like that, most professional reviewers of Good Night and Good Luck have been unable to resist commenting on the contemporary political parallels raised by this historically grounded story.<br/><br/>* * * Other than Denby, few reviewers go beyond the main drama of Murrow's personal heroism to suggest, as honestly as Clooney's film does in its sub-plot with the character of Bill Paley (Frank Langella), what the root cause may be for our modern media's malaise. But Ben Bagdikian and Robert W. McChesney put it forthrightly in their latest books, The New Media Monopoly and The Problem of of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st Century.<br/><br/>Owing to a series of new laws and FCC regulations beginning in the late Reagan era and a dramatically changed legal environment that now endorses monopolies rather than prosecuting them, today, as Bagdikian documents, ""five global-dimension firms, operating with many of the characteristics of a cartel, own most of the newspapers, magazines, book publishers, motion picture studios, and radio and television stations in the United States.""<br/><br/>* * * As McChesney writes, this monopolization creates a ""crucial tension... between the role of the media as profit-maximizing commercial organizations and the need for the media to provide the basis for informed self-government.""<br/><br/>* * * For Roger Ebert, who liked it very much, Clooney's film ""is like a morality play, from which we learn how journalists should behave.""<br/><br/>One suspects Murrow would have disagreed. Twice during the film -- once, just as he did on the air when confronting McCarthy -- Murrow quotes Shakespeare's famous line, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.""<br/><br/>If Good Night and Good Luck is a morality play, it's not just about how journalists should behave. It's about what kind of media policies we, the public, should be demanding at the ballot box as well as in our homes.<br/><br/>A clue to this lies in the darkly amusing anecdote Clooney shared with Cole Smithey of Arriviste Press shortly after the film opened. Asked if he had given any thought to an alternative ending, instead of closing with Murrow's parting words from the 1958 speech, Clooney said they actually filmed one:<br/><br/>We had basically made a montage of the greatest hits of television moments, and then as they rapidly decline it was down to the O.J. chase and then the piece, done in L.A., where there was a car chase and the guy sets his truck on fire, and he takes off all of his clothes, and he blows his head off on live television. And you could hear the people in the background, in the newsroom, laughing and the guy says, ""There's your lead news story.""<br/><br/>* * * It doesn't have to be that way. But it's up to each of us to write an alternative ending."
"suessis","9","5","9","26 November 2005"," An eloquent reminder
","One thing that impresses me about George Clooney as an actor who is also a director is his two films where clearly NOT created as a means of showcasing a monumental ego as Redford, Beatty, and Eastwood did. Clooney's characters in both films are there to both figuratively and literally support the lead character, in this case very convincingly portrayed by David Strathairn. That alone convinces me that the focus here was on making a truly great film, and that is exactly what old George has done.<br/><br/>He has assembled a wonderful cast. Besides Strathairn, Frank Langella gives a good performance as Bill Paley who is torn between siding with his boys in the newsroom and his job as the head of the network. Other actors like Robert Downey, Jr. lend able support.<br/><br/>Clooney's artistry makes us feel as though we are in the studio and the office with Murrow participating in these events as they unfold. The questions about whether everything as far as the set, the clothing, and other things here and there are completely historically accurate makes no difference. I was more interested in the action unfolding to notice or care about those things. His choices in film techniques do an excellent job setting the mood.<br/><br/>I thank Mr. Clooney for this eloquent reminder about what journalism should be."
"donanddonnazuckerman","9","5","9","22 November 2005"," Splendid Performance by Strathairn
","David Strathairn not only nails the Murrow mannerisms, even holding his cigarettes at the very angle the consummate newsman employed, but he also splendidly captures in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" Murrow's peculiar speech patterns. Brilliant use is made, moreover, of film footage of the ""Junior Senator From Wisconsin"" himself at his most overbearing. What the movie does brilliantly, too, is to evoke the aura of '50s television, and for that, as well as the McCarthy footage,kudos should go to George Clooney for his direction and writing. The movie also brings home the fact that even a talent as prominent as Edward R. Murrow had to temporize his standards by hosting that piece of unfortunate Sunday night fluff remembered as ""Person to Person."" Frank Langella, playing CBS president William Paley, does an excellent job of showing how one in his position was whipsawed by the competing demands of a fiercely independent news department and those of a sponsor, Alcoa, which in turn responded to the repressive climate of the times.<br/><br/>What prevents me from recommending a ""10"" rating is the film's failure to evoke--at least in my wife and myself, who both remember vividly the ""See It Now"" Cassius program and the Army-McCarthy hearings--a strong emotional response. Part of that failure may be attributed to our belief that the film peaked too early: we think it should have ended with the ""See It Now"" episode at issue or with McCarthy's censure by the United States Senate. <br/><br/>""Good Night and Good Luck"" nonetheless remains a film well worth one's time."

","Greetings again from the darkness. What a thrill it must be for George Clooney to see his pet project come to life in such a meaningful and impressive manner. Many have seen the interview where Clooney beams when re-telling the story of his dad's review of the film, ""You got it right"".<br/><br/>The film opens with an Edward Murrow speech given the week before I was born. His words are just as powerful now as they were then. TV can, and does, manipulate the viewer. Of all the changes of the past 40 years, few mention the dramatic changes in TV news. Today's broadcasts are dominated by two things: the impressive looking anchor who reads the teleprompter and the investigative reporter who tries to blow the lid off some new scandal (we have Watergate to thank for this). As Murrow says numerous times during the film, dialog on the issues is key. Sadly, this is a lost art.<br/><br/>From that opening speech, David Strathairn is Edward Murrow. He so fully captures the drive, integrity and quest for truth. Just as powerful is his near-disgust at having to provide the ""person-to-person"" pieces that CBS demands as balance for the hard pieces he lives for. As terrific as Strathairn's performance is, I would not label this as a bio film. It is much more an expose on a period of our history that was downright frightening and how lucky we are that someone was courageous enough to stand up and point out the injustice of the accusations from Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his committee. McCarthy's actions so went against the foundation of our country that normal, everyday people were intimidated to the point of being paranoid and afraid to discuss the topic of communism. How amazing that this was only 50 years ago.<br/><br/>Writer/Director/Actor Clooney assembled a very strong supporting cast including Robert Downey, jr., Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella as William Paley, and Grant Heslov as Don Hewitt (future backbone of ""60 Minutes""). Clooney made two decisions that really add to the authenticity of the film. First, he filmed in Black and White. Second, he used actual clips of McCarthy. Nothing is scarier than reality.<br/><br/>This film would make for great classroom discussion in High School civics or government classes and could be a great tool for future and current journalists. Kudos to Clooney for bringing this uncomfortable time in history back to the forefront to ensure history does not repeat itself."

"Andrew_The_Wise","9","5","9","5 November 2005"," Films like this make me love movies...
","I was very impressed with nearly every aspect of this film. <br/><br/>First, the look and the feel of this film is just amazing. The camera-work and editing were top-notch and definitely Oscar worthy. The black-and-white film used gave Good Night, and Good Luck the feel that it was taken straight out of the stock of film reels from the 1950s. <br/><br/>Second, it was less of a shot at conservatives and more of a shot at modern day television and where it's going. At the end of the film, the final speech give by Murrow was a definite sign of where things were going to go if we let this box corrupt us. In the end, it's more like NETWORK than an attack of the conservative right.<br/><br/>Third, the ensemble cast was just amazing. Clooney, Downey Jr, Clarkson and Daniels were all good, but the two supporting roles that stood out (to me) were Ray Wise and Frank Langella. Wise, as depressed news anchor Don Hollenbeck, added some emotion to a story that would've lacked a little in the humility department if Wise hadn't been in the film. Langella, although was only in the film for about ten minutes, was explosive as CBS President William Haley and gives a lot of fatherly guidance to the relatively younger staff. <br/><br/>Of course, this film would be nothing without David Strathairn. He wasn't an actor portraying Edward R. Morrow; he BECAME Edward R. Morrow. This is what acting is all about. His mannerisms, the tapping of his toes, the chain smoking, his sharp-wit, etc. It was a pure joy to see this acting done today. So far, his work is the best I've seen, but this won't be the last film I'll see this year. <br/><br/>George Clooney should be commended for this film. With this film, he's evolved from a Hollywood Actor to a true artist. Most conservatives are ripping him for making this film, but if they knew that his father was a television journalist at around the same time, they'd realize that this event had a huge effect on his family. To me, this was the film he was destined to make and in the long run, this is what he'll be remembered for. He knew that in order for him to make this film great, he'd have take a step back and let the ensemble, not him, carry the film. Films like this give me hope that great films will always be coming, no matter what crap is released these days. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 (because no film is ever 10)<br/><br/>Oscar Chances: Best Picture, Best Director, *Best Actor - David Strathairn, Best Supporting Actor - Frank Langella, *Best Original Screenplay, *Best Cinematography, *Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design <br/><br/>* - IMO, immortal locks. the rest are all up for grabs"

"huntley_haverstock","10","6","12","30 November 2005"," Brilliant
","Last night I had the privilege to view, for the second time, possibly the greatest film to be produced this year, at least the greatest that I am aware of. Co-written, and directed by Hollywood mega star George Clooney, ""Good night, and Good Luck"" breaks past the realm the typical motion picture generally strives to accomplish and delivers in addition to simple entertainment: education, and most importantly, inspiration.<br/><br/>This film attempts a task not easily achieved as it works to tackle a moment, and event in American history as important, and controversial, as any the country has ever known. Within a mere hour and a half, Clooney has managed to fully encapsulate an emotionally, and politically tumultuous time with the kind of relevance rarely seen in modern movie making. Centering around the CBS newsroom as run by one of televisions greatest news men Edward R Murrow (David Strathairn), during the communist witch hunts of the nineteen-fifties as run by the junior senator from Wisconsin Joe McCarthy, the film poses the types of questions that have faced television from it infancy, and continue to plague those of society who refuse to sit idly by while one of our most powerful resources is reduced to nothing more then fluff and entertainment catering to the very lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>As I came to the end of my original viewing of this film I felt as though there was so much more this film was attempting to tell me than what I had perceived. At first I was mostly taken by the stunning visuals presented, shot entirely in black and white, the director's use of shadow and light, camera angles, and imagery are enough to make repeat viewing a necessity. I found it refreshing to see that the film broke ranks with the typical story arc employed by so many biopics, choosing to focus above all else on a central theme. The film knows its goals and it doesn't waste time on peripherals. There was no talk of a world outside the newsroom, no family life, or socializing that would have taken this succinct and well paced film down with the type of biopic cliché's I was disappointed to find in another of this years high profile, personality driven films, the Johnny Cash project ""Walk The Line."" <br/><br/>Upon my second viewing, I realized that this film went far beyond a simple retelling, it examined the American politics of the nineteen-fifties, and reflected on what we can learn from the eerily similar situation the world finds itself in today. This film is about responsibility, it is about the misuse of a medium that even in it's earliest existence was so brimming with potential it's possibilities seemed endless. It was about a man's fight against the corporations who saw television as nothing more then a much larger, and further reaching billboard. Murrow's dream was that this new medium might educate the masses about their world, bridge differences between nations, enlighten the world in a way that no other means of communication had been able to before.<br/><br/>As I sat in the dark theater listening to the words of Murrow's closing speech, I couldn't help but think that those words were intended more for the television executives of today than Murrow's contemporaries; for just as history would eventually see Murrow's ideals, and ambitions for television become trumped by a fad of sub par T.V. game shows, so has the modern chances of television reaching out to the more artful realm of theater and motion-pictures, been eliminated by the likes of ""American Idol"" and the scores of reality based dribble. The failure of our society to live up to the challenge of Murrow's final statements rang loud through my mind, as the films final words echoed over the ending credits: ""This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire, but it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box...Good night, and good luck,"" Murrow remarked as if wishing luck to the generations of news reporters who would follow in his footsteps attempting to accomplish his dream."

Another notable, and a potentially comeback performance was from Frank Langella, as Edward R. Murrow's boss. However, the aspect of ""Good Night & Good Luck,"" which deserves the most honor, is David Strathairn. As great as he was in every role he ever had, David Strathairn blew all of those previous roles miles away. He has completely out done himself. Stratharin is flawless. Every mannerism, vocal pitch, facial expression, you name it is perfect. Even the way he holds his cigarette is noteworthy.

"kenbarr-ny","10","6","12","11 October 2005"," George Clooney Sets Out His Stall, Emphatically
","""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is a starkly realistic retelling of one of the darkest chapters of American history and some of the people who fought against it. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the junior senator from Wisconsin, hopped on the red-baiting hysteria of the post World War II era and rode it to become one of the most powerful men in the country. His use of a Senate Investigating sub-committee to terrify both the powerful and the ordinary through the use of such tactics as outright lies, innuendos and half truths struck fear into the nation. Edward R. Murrow, the most celebrated broadcast journalist of his era, decided to take on both the redbaiters and McCarthy on his weekly half hour news program on CBS-TV, ""See It Now."" He mobilized his legendary staff, which included Fred W. Friendly and ""60 Minutes"" creator Don Hewitt, and successfully challenged McCarthy by using his own words and actions against him. George Clooney, who co-wrote, directed and played Friendly, hits the viewer right between the eyes with the message that fear breeds cowardice and dissent is not traitorous. David Strathairn's portrayal of Murrow is almost identical to Murrow himself, down to the voice, pacing and inflections. Clooney pulls a Murrow by using the actual footage of McCarthy rather than casting an actor to portray him. Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr., who play the secretly married couple Shirley and Joseph Wershba (CBS policy forbade married couples from working together in the 1950s), bring an interesting sub-plot to life. Frank Langella and Ray Wise, as CBS Chairman William Paley and reporter Don Hollenbeck, provide highly realistic portrayals to their roles. There is one interesting omission from the movie. After McCarthy broadcast a reply to Murrow's program attacking him, Murrow held a press conference in which he sets forth how he wanted to be remembered. ""When the record is finally written, as it will be one day,"" the reporter read from a prepared text, ""it will answer the question, who has helped the communist cause and who has served his country better, Senator McCarthy or I. I would like to remembered, if at all, as the answer to that question."" Certainly George Clooney thinks so, as does history. A must see film, especially given the times in which we live. Here's hoping this limited release film, shot in black and white, is given wider release. As of today (10/11), it is showing on only eleven screens in New York and a similar number in Los Angeles."

(and without mentioning names) the same thing is happening in today's White House administration. The film warns against complacency of the media and their responsibility to expose the attempts by government to squelch freedom, especially in the name of patriotism. The film uses real footage of McCarthy and the House Unamerican Activities Committee. The whole movie is in black and white, as television was in the 1950s. The acting was understated and wonderful: Clooney, Straithairn, Daniels, Langella, Downy and Clarkson didn't show a lot of unbridled emotion, but you could see their feelings--especially Straithairn and Langella--just beneath the surface. Beautifully done; I would see it again."

","I think that it is horrible for an American to defile history with such an intentionally deceitful portrayal of history. To not address the communist spies who were being uncovered by the hard work of the HUAC and Senator McCarthy is a disgrace. To not address the slanders launched by the communists against McCarthy, and former communists who were then shedding light on the communist menace, like Chambers, is a disgrace. All that deceit in order to aggrandize Murrow--who was personally avenging the death of one of his communist spy friends by going after McCarthy--is a disgrace. It is only those who are politically motivated, with hatred for America, who can do these things. This, after all we learned from Venona, is a disgrace. A new generation of useful idiots ...with Clooney as their leader."

","In this dry portrayal of the daring Edward Murrow, Clooney attempts at capitalizing on Murrow's genius. In doing so, Clooney uses Murrow's writing verbatim, proving his brilliance as a journalist, while also indicating his own flaw (Clooney's) as a poor writer.<br/><br/>Clooney's poor writing, however, does not shadow Strathairn's performance. Stratheim accomplishes what all actors aspire to do, he is. He delivers his performance so true that it does not seem he is even acting at all. Strathairn takes a drag from his cigarette he exact way that Murrow would. His suave and perfected performance will make one feel as though they are seeing the real Edward Murrow in higher grade film.<br/><br/>Still, Clooney markets to the pseudo-intellectuals, making one feel obligated to like a film of such caliber. The subtle relationship between the McCarthy era and our current situation seems to drive people into believing that this film is a well made movie. In short, the content of the piece out ways the execution of it.<br/><br/>I recommend this piece to those who admired Murrow for his bravery or who want to see Strathairn's break out performance. However, if you are searching for a film that will entertain, this is not it. This is a film for those who find text-books fascinating."

","Although I agree that the acting and direction were superb, and with the grainy B&W I had to keep reminding myself that it was not archive footage, I found the film unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Although I live in England, I know enough about McCarthy and his witch hunts to know what a devastating effect they had on American political life, and on the media and entertainment. None of this came over in the film - one Chicago-based airman, and a half-wit who had suddenly been promoted from cleaner at the Pentagon to the coding room - what was all the fuss about? Similarly, I knew about Ed Murrow - I grew up in Britain just after the war, when his reports from the US were a regular feature of BBC output, and I had a great admiration for him even before I found out that his reports from London during the war had played a major role in softening up US opinion so that after Pearl Harbor the US came in and helped us win the war.<br/><br/>But how did he come over in the film? Ineffectual and vindictive (with good cause - but vindictive none the less). The film ended when McCarthy was about to be called before the Senate to answer for his actions, and I suppose we were meant to believe that Ed Murrow and Fred Friendly had played a part in this (as I am sure in real life they did), but their broadcasts seemed peripheral and to take place in a vacuum - were they really having such an earth-shattering effect? In short, the film failed to make its point. I am sure those guys at CBS did a great job, but if you didn't know that before seeing the film I doubt if you would come out of the cinema convinced."

","GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK <br/><br/>Wow what a disappointment. GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK was the last film of the Best Picture nominees that I had to see, and it was my last chance to see a nominee that I could truly, passionately admire. Unfortunately, GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK was nowhere close to my favorite film of the year.<br/><br/>I can admire some elements of GN&GL, and it's definitely a well-crafted film. It is beautifully shot with possibly the best ensemble cast I've seen in a film this year. George Clooney has combined the visual style of his film and the emotional lives of his ensemble to create a beautifully naturalistic world.<br/><br/>This ensemble really mingles like people living their lives. It doesn't read like a bunch of actors performing opposite each other, there was a genuine sense of camaraderie, respect, and individualism that naturally exuded from the group scenes. These were probably the highlights of the film for me.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Edward R. Murrow, played with incredible nuanced restraint and subtlety by David Strathairn. His mission and work are the only parts of his character we ever gain insight to, and David Strathairn plays it all to a tee.<br/><br/>However, aside from some great performances, a wonderful visual style, and a couple exciting moments... GN&GL didn't even feel like a movie to me.<br/><br/>While I did find it's brisk running time to be a good asset, the way that running time was utilized left me confused. It seemed that only an hour of this film was actually a movie. The other half-hour consisted of documentary footage and silent montages set to period music. It seemed like so much time was wasted in creating a mood and getting the facts out that the actual people in the newsroom because an afterthought.<br/><br/>While I admire a director who refuses to follow certain Hollywood ""rules"" in storytelling, Clooney's method of minimalization just didn't work for me. In the same way that Spielberg's MUNICH was hurt by it's ""neutral"" stance... Clooney's film is hurt by it's ""minimalistic & neutral"" stance. It never gives enough insight into the characters and therefore never gives their story much emotional heft.<br/><br/>When I left the theatre, I felt like I was stupid for not really appreciatting the movie. As if, b/c I didn't really get into the story, I must just be too inexperienced and unfamiliar with the story behind McCarthy to really get the film.<br/><br/>Maybe that is the case, and I certainly think if I was more familiar with the McCarthy era I would have found the film more interesting. But it seems Clooney directed this movie with only the people who knew this era as his intended audience.

"majikstl","6","4","7","12 January 2006"," To Murrow's yesterday, today ...
","GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK begins and ends with Edward R. Murrow giving a keynote address at the Radio-Television News Directors Association's 1958 Chicago convention, at a fancy dress dinner designed to honor the newsman himself. The film spares us the lengthy address in its entirety, but the gist of the diatribe finds Murrow bemoaning the declining state of broadcast news in particular and the mediocrity of television in general. He takes exception with television wasting its potential with the likes of Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen, when what the public really needs -- whether it wants it or not -- is documentary reports on deteriorating schools and the dire state of mid-Eastern politics. <br/><br/>Murrow is, of course, the patron saint of TV journalism. Whenever a situation requires that the highest standards of broadcast journalism be defined, Murrow's name is evoked as the benchmark by which all other newspeople must be judged. Thus the problem facing GOOD NIGHT director and co-author George Clooney was how to portray Murrow without making him seem too godlike. So, we get Murrow's 1958 speech: He was invited to be showered with rose petals for his contributions and he responds like a stern father scolding his children because they didn't make straight A's on their report cards. As played by David Strathairn, Murrow comes off as cold, condescending and humorless. It is a deft performance, but certainly not endearing. <br/><br/>But, I suppose, Clooney didn't think Murrow had to be likable, since he is already beyond reproach. GOOD NIGHT concerns Murrow's legendary confrontation with anti-commie crusader Sen. Joesph McCarthy and never is there any doubt of Murrow's righteousness nor of McCarthy's evil. The film is in black and white in more ways than one. Whether or not this represents historical accuracy, it does make for strangely indifferent drama. There is little doubt that Murrow will put McCarthy in his place, thus the only real drama in GOOD NIGHT stems from how and when the newsman will be allowed to launch his attack. If the film has a villain it is the medium itself for being too timid -- the point of the opening sermon. <br/><br/>The irony is that while the filmmakers call for a more aggressive and activist (liberal) media, the film itself is surprisingly inert. I won't question the courage it took for Murrow and company to stand up to McCarthy, but I don't think the film gives a clear picture of just why it took courage in the first place. As portrayed in GOOD NIGHT there is little real sense of the power that McCarthy held and even less sense of the genuine fear that communism held for the post-war American public. Communism was a growing power in the world and a threat, not just to good old American capitalism, but to journalistic and artistic freedoms as well. The film discounts that reality -- perhaps, because liberals never have seen communism as a real threat -- thus it is never acknowledged that McCarthy had his appeal and wasn't just some evil right-wing bogeyman. McCarthy's power and popularity grew as much from the public will as it did from his own overzealous paranoia. <br/><br/>There isn't a hint of the danger that communism represented (whether real or imagined) and not even much feel for the threat of McCarthyism either. On the one hand, Clooney chose an easy target by having McCarthy as his villain, but on the other hand he paints himself into a corner by giving us adversaries who never even meet -- not even in making the film, as flesh-and-blood actor Strathairn plays Murrow and McCarthy is represented by vintage film clips, mere shadows on celluloid. Did Clooney think McCarthy's evil should speak for itself, or was he afraid an actor might actually give the character some sympathetic dimension? Whatever, the film is dramatically weak because there is no sense of confrontation in this confrontation. Murrow says something on air, McCarthy responds weeks later on film and Murrow responds to that. It's less a debate than an elaborate game of phone tag. <br/><br/>Inadvertently I suspect, Clooney gives us a picture of a news media that seems isolated and insulated from the real world. The story barely leaves the newsroom, except for in archival footage. And in a strange display of political correctness, the film tries to establish the mood through musical interludes by African-American jazz singer Dianne Reeves, whose lovely voice can't quite disguise the fact that she is totally out of place in this film, in this story and in this era.<br/><br/>Clooney establishes a nice feel of newsroom camaraderie and clearly tells his story in appropriately restrained journalistic fashion, but his story never gains momentum. It is admirable that Clooney keeps his drama low key, avoiding sensationalizing the material, and I'll just assume that the story is as historically accurate as any film can be. Though it is annoying that a film celebrating journalistic excellence has a title that is grammatically incorrect."

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is an interesting film re-enacting the feud between Edward R. Murrow and Joseph McCarthy. It is a part of American history I had heard about but was not familiar with the details.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it isn't the most entertaining subject in the world. Most of the film consist of a bunch of people sitting around talking and smoking. There isn't much depth to the characters. All we really know about them is that they want to do what they think is right.<br/><br/>The photography, acting, and directing is all really good. George Clooney has a surprisingly good eye and creative ways to use the camera. At 93 minutes, it seems like they didn't have enough story to fill the time slot so they added some filler to stretch it out; although I liked the segments with Dianne Reeves.<br/><br/>""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a decent, but somewhat overrated film."
"JohnPowers","7","4","7","10 November 2005"," It's healthy to read beyond the headlines
","Red Scare? Or Red Herring?<br/><br/>Like the turning of each page of a crisply unraveled newspaper, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" unfolds itself just as plainly. There were promises of headlines too. ""McCarthy!"" they all said. But the story of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is not about McCarthy. It is about the future oftelevision. It describes how corporate pressures under threat of loss of advertising revenue combined with political fears of retributionwould inexorably lead to the decline of television as a powerful medium for provocative, and substantive commentary and transform it into what David Strathairn (Eight Men Out, Limbo) who plays Murrow, said in one of his very last lines, ""Just wires and lights in a box."" <br/><br/>The film is done in black and white, and opens in the year 1958 at a banquet held in honor of the film's central character, legendary broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. While waiting to be announced, Murrow stands off stage, his trademark cigarette ever present, held poised in his signature style. He appears uncomfortable with what he is about to say. Pushing through the smoke he arrives at the podium and tells his audience that everyone in the room, including himself, has become ""Fat and complacent."" He warns them about the perilous direction television may be heading in. <br/><br/>In straightforward fashion the film switches to 1953, the year that Murrow publicly clashes with Senator Joe McCarthy. Cramped into tiny studios and control rooms, that at the time Newsweek described as looking like the, ""dashboard of a Model-T Ford,"" Murrow and his perennial associate Fred Friendly,(George Clooney) broadcast a popular nightly, documentary style newscast called ""See it Now."" Aside from playing Fred Friendly in the film, George Clooney is both writer and director. ""Section Eight,"" a ""Warner Brothers"" based film and production company that partners, as its owners, Clooney and film veteran Steven Soderbergh, adds ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" to their list of credits,in addition to George Clooney's directorial debut film, "" Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" the irreverent tale which purports that ""Gong Show"" host, Chuck Barris was a covert CIA operative. ""Section Eight""president, Grant Heslov,(CSI and Fox's X-Files) wrote the screenplay for ""Good Luck,"" and apparently wrote himself an on screen part as Don Hewitt, the director of ""See it Now.""<br/><br/>Hewitt directed the landmark 1953 broadcast that publicly challenged Senator McCarthy and his methods by using McCarthy's own words, collected from various newsreels, against him. Between this and McCarthy's highly anticipated response, ""Good luck"" manages to continually reinforce its unusual cadence by adopting an unconventional style of storytelling comprised of long, and awkward silences. The reasons for the silence aren't emphasized, because there aren't any reasons for it. The emphasis is on the simplicity of the silence itself, and more often than not, the long awkward silence isn't awkward at all. And the silence is merely a pause. Pausing to take time to watch Murrow pick a flake of tobacco off of his teeth. Pausing to hear the sound of a newspaper having its creases ironed out, or the jiggling of ice being twirled with one's fingers in a half empty, well deserved glass of scotch. These scenes have density and dimension, and are a woven fabric of smoke and quiet, watermarked over imagined conversations and gestures that give clues to thoughts that don't exist. The film's concentration on what is usually omitted,like the sound of someone exhaling and the movement it causes to the thousands of dust particles that flutter in search of light, is precisely what defines the style and signature departure from formula that ""Good Night and Good Luck"" successfully achieves."

","I enjoyed the movie overall, but it was a very fleeting glimpse of a disgraceful era in American history and it should have given more context. If you didn't know anything of the history of the period (and I suspect a lot of people don't), then you wouldn't get any sense of McCarthy's reign of fear, the lives he destroyed, the blacklistings, the way people were forced to choose between ratting on their friends or going to jail, the careers in ruins. Also, this was the first time the media shone a spotlight on an individual in this manner, and Murrow himself was wracked with doubts to the end of his days over whether he had done the right thing, but you don't get any sense of that inner turmoil. The whole movie was pretty muted and it could have been ramped up a notch."
"gortx","Null","4","7","3 November 2005"," Impressionistic, if too low-key portrait of the Murrow-McCarthy conflict
","Despite Director/Co-Star George Clooney's statements that he was not trying to take a point of view, nor directly comment on our current Post-9/11 climate, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, clearly comes across as such. It is not just because we know of Clooney's personal politics, but because the script and the film production make it clear that it wants to portray Murrow as a hero.<br/><br/>The true test of a movie based on real characters and events is not whether they have a perspective we might ""agree"" with, but whether making it a feature length dramatic (or comedic) film gives us an added insight into the people and incidents portrayed. It is here, that GOOD NIGHT falls short. We really gain little knowledge or get a better feel for Murrow, than we would with a well done straight documentary. Indeed, one might argue that the most interesting parts of this film ARE the genuine documentary scenes which it liberally uses (There isn't an ""actor"" playing McCarthy at all, but the man himself in archival footage. This adds a film semiotics question which some might want to explore on the efficacy of this technique. For instance: Is it ""fair"" to have a sympathetic actor play Murrow with 50 years of hindsight? Murrow is photographed in crisp 2005 35MM Cinematography, while McCarthy is seen in grainy 50's newsreel 16MM. Etc. ).<br/><br/>What the film does well are in the acting and production design elements which are both well mounted. You do get a sense of the period and the performances are fine as far as they are allowed to go. Oddly, the screenplay chooses to go more into the personal lives of some of the background characters (such as the Wershbas and Don Hollenbeck) than it does with its lead characters. An odd choice despite some of the symbolism contained in those relatively minor characters. <br/><br/>As a Director, Clooney uses an almost impressionistic style to seemingly just ""drop in"" on the situation at CBS. It also plays (perhaps not coincidentally, as a sort of updated Live TV Theater version of events - except with much more mobile cameras). The B&W photography, the low key screenplay and direction, and the lack of a true score (Dianne Reeves is used as a sort of background chorus) mitigate against true drama, or even, genuine excitement.<br/><br/>The film is admirable and interesting, but in an almost academic sense. One might argue that Clooney's CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND suffered from a bit too much cinematic trickery, but GOOD NIGHT is weakened by a lack of it."
"LadyLiberty","8","4","7","30 October 2005"," Good Night and Good Luck is Just Plain Good!
","While I was in Washington DC last week, I took the opportunity of being in a much larger city to see something that probably won't show up in my own relatively small town theatres. That is how I ended up buying a ticket to the award-winning film. Good Night and Good Luck. After having seen it, I truly can't imagine a more appropriate story for either the time or the place.<br/><br/>Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) revolutionized both radio and television in his day. He was an electronic journalism pioneer, and a strong advocate of free speech. Murrow, who revamped his ""Hear it Now"" radio show into TV's ""See it Now"" in the 1950's, was a regular presence in most American households at the time. His partner and producer, Fred Friendly (George Clooney), was in on virtually all that Murrow determined to do including the greatest risk of his career: taking on Senator Joseph McCarthy.<br/><br/>McCarthy, as most of us know, was the power behind the Senate's unAmerican activities hearings. In short, McCarthy had a jones for Communism so strong and paranoid that he saw Communists everywhere. Fear on the part of many, and a desire to share in the power for some others, resulted in damaging testimony and ruined lives and careers throughout Hollywood, politics, and the media. Murrow saw it happening, and determined to take it on; the head of the CBS networks, William Paley (Frank Langella) and of its news division, Sigfried Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) discouraged Murrow, but  to their credit  didn't stop him.<br/><br/>Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson) did research and reported stories from the print media or from political news releases to the writers and reporters; her secret husband, Joe Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) was also an integral member of the production crew. As the ""See It Now"" crew worked to put together more shows on the subject, news anchor and reporter Dan Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) found himself attacked by McCarthy's accusations. Though Murrow and his crew are sympathetic to say the least, nothing will stop them from making public the paranoia and the unreasonableness behind McCarthy's efforts.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck is a wonderfully done story about a time in history that many of us don't even learn about any more (I certainly wasn't taught anything about it in school!). The acting is superlative on all counts, but is truly breathtaking on the part of David Strathairn. Though confident as the on screen and off screen Murrow, little tics, twitches, and the look in his eyes let you know just how frightened he is of the possible repercussions of what he's doing. Wise's Hollenbeck is first angry, then afraid, and finally desperate; his portrayal conveys all of those things brilliantly. Although those two performances are worthy of singling out, the bottom line is that there's not a mediocre or even an adequate performance in the bunch. They're all just terrific.<br/><br/>George Clooney directed and co-wrote Good Night and Good Luck, and did a brilliant job at both. The single criticism I'd have (and it echoes precisely the comments of the friend with whom I saw the film) is this: it's never truly conveyed just how terrified people were  and with what good reason  of the McCarthy Communist juggernaut. Although bad things happen in the film, many are so peripheral that we don't get the real feeling of the horror those days were for some people; we also don't get a real sense of the bravery involved in those who took the project on since the fear isn't adequately conveyed from most.<br/><br/>But that's really a small criticism, especially since it's the very under-statedness of the film that offers the most impact. That it's filmed in black and white and with flawless costuming and sets makes Good Night and Good Luck almost more a documentary than a storytelling, and it's that much the better for it. The icing on the cake is the insertion of various ""musical breaks"" courtesy of jazz singer Dianne Reeves. They're mood-setting, entirely appropriate for the moment, and just plain amazing editing devices (kudos again to Clooney). Good Night and Good Luck is a true story that everyone should know; but it's also a truly wonderful movie.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: In one of his on-air speeches, Murrow intones: ""We must not confuse dissent with loyalty,"" and ""We will not be driven by fear."" He notes that we're not descended from fearful men, and that they in their time had the courage to speak the unpopular. Murrow, of course, was certainly heroic in the 1950's when he chose to fight McCarthy's hold on America. But it was chilling in many ways to see the film in a day and age where we're told that merely speaking against the war in Iraq is unAmerican, and that being critical of the war effort or the government is tantamount to terrorism. Lives and careers are at risk now, too, and we can only hope that the Fourth Estate will do its job as Murrow and other luminaries of the past envisioned and ensured for themselves in their day.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Good Night and Good Luck is rated PG because ""some material may be unsuitable for children."" In truth, I don't believe that any of the movie is suitable for children. That's not because of language, violence, or the like, but rather because of the nature of the story itself. Only adults will be able to grasp all of the implications of the plot; only adults will be able to appreciate what happens during the movie. I suspect that even the most mature child won't get much out of the movie, and will probably be bored out of his skull. You, on the other hand, won't be if you're there to see history, superlative movie-making, or both."
"MITCH!","6","4","7","29 October 2005"," Close to Impressive
","I should start by saying I don't know all that much about Edward R. Murrow or the McCarthy hearings in general, other than having seen some archival footage over the years. Thus, I was prepared to learn a lot more about the situation from this film. Unfortunately, despite being beautifully photographed, the film really didn't hook me emotionally in the way I was hoping. Here's why:<br/><br/>There's no dramatic tension in the film. The events depicted were fraught with tension, I'm sure, and the actors are asked to convey that fear and uncertainty, but the picture as a whole feels more like a cross between a history lesson and an homage to the 1950s than a living narrative. As result, while it's technically adept and certainly informative for anyone unfamiliar with the events themselves, it doesn't pack the punch I was hoping for from the dynamic trailer.<br/><br/>I suspect the fault here lies with Clooney's direction, which is a shame because he's shown a lot of potential both here and in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. This topic is clearly an incendiary one to tackle, especially during these similarly unnerving times in American politics, so kudos are in order for even being able to get the project off the ground. However, I don't think Clooney has developed the requisite subtlety and confidence in himself as a director to make his point without being obvious.<br/><br/>As a result, we're left with too many cases of telegraphed emotion, wordless ponderances and performances subverted by newsreel footage of the actual events themselves. Another example: the use of period jazz music during scene transitions whose lyrics (though, again, wonderfully performed) hit the emotion of the scene on the head, every time. How much of this is also due to Clooney directing a script he co-wrote is anyone's guess -- if it's a problem on paper, and you wrote it, do you recognize it on film? -- but I feel the material would have been better served by a less heavy hand. It's obvious that everyone involved in the project felt strongly about it, but I think the end result falls short of the galvanizing experience they (and I) hoped for.<br/><br/>*SIDE NOTE* I saw this film in a theater in a predominantly Jewish part of Pittsburgh, and the theater was half-full even during a Saturday matinée in a theater that's double-billing the film. It was an interesting crowd to experience the film with, considering how many Jews were implicated in the McCarthy hearings. The moment footage of McCarthy appeared on screen, I heard rumblings and hushed profanity from the audience behind me. When the lights went up, I sat through the first minute or so of credits and then started to make my exit. Not surprisingly, I was just about the youngest person in the theater. What did surprise me was the fact that most of the other patrons were still seated, contemplating the film as the credits rolled. As someone who's used to being the last person out of the theater during most films, it's obvious that this film packs a punch for a certain audience closer to the material than I am, which means my estimation is worth what it's worth -- one man's opinion."
"Quinoa1984","10","4","7","21 October 2005"," a terrific combination of a directorial style matched with intelligent subject matter
","Good Night, and Good Luck, is one of the better (if not one of the best) films I've seen this year, and it's definitely the most thought-provoking and successful one to look at the news business since 1999's the Insider (coincidentally, including CBS). It works chiefly because co-writer/director/co-star George Clooney is even more confident with his style here than with (the under-rated) Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and that it doesn't sell short its audience the slightest. This is an important point; another director might have done things a lot differently with this film to make it more ""accessible"" or ""mainstream"", such as over-using a score, or doing the typical 'everyone watches the TV's all across the country' shots, or having an actor portray Joseph McCarthy and other historical figures shown as themselves here. Clooney makes some brave choices, and they all pay off at the expense of an intelligent, truthful script, and some interesting performances.<br/><br/>Chiefly in these performances is David Strathain, an actor I'm not too familiar with, but after seeing this I definitely want to see more of his work. His turn as Edward R. Murrow, the legend of a newsman of the 20th century, is quite remarkable because it's all done for effect. Almost all emotion is repressed under the veneer of his total professionalism on and off camera, and it's a good contrast with the other newsman, who happens to not be taking things too well when it comes time for the showdown with McCarthey. He helps to counter Clooney's style with the black and white camera, which is very elegant at times, and also is very wise in taking in the close-ups and shadows (this, of course, is also a credit to his DP). And as the film goes along, and the suspense goes up and down with story, one can't help but see how effective the film goes to making parallels with today's current events. The big difference, of course, being how much depth and honesty was really in the news of Murrow's day.<br/><br/>But another success to the film is that it can hit home to anyone, regardless of political affiliation. It does include the communism struggle in the Cold War era. But it is more concerned with the ideals of what it means to be a serious journalist, to stick by your story and how it has creedence and importance to the public, even if there are risks. Another key performance is also Frank Langella, who happens to give that objective balance between someone like Murrow and someone like McCarthey. This is a fine contrast with the footage of the hearings themselves, which take up a quarter of the film. Aside from some flashes of a jazz band playing songs, and a couple of-the-time commercials (those the only minor liabilities for me, although still setting in the mood), it is focused on these guys, on the CBS news team, and the whole cast (Strathain, Clooney, Downey, Clarkson, etc) are so good it helps keep the look of the film from not going too much over the rails. It's a mature film for those open to the subject matter; I'm not too surprised that it's not out at the cineplexes, but that being said it's far more worth the time than most of the films that are there now."

The historical details were well-researched. The acting by everyone in the movie was superb, making you feel every tense moment. David Strathairn deserves an Oscar.

I saw Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and enjoyed it immensely, though I found parts of it meandering and in a way flawed, but it put Clooney in a whole new light, and I gained a tremendous amount of respect for him (which had been missing since I saw the Solaris remake). However I found this film perfect in every way, and I hope it garners him some Oscar nominations. Minimalist, (it all takes place in doors in television studios), captivating cinematography, sly and highly intelligent dialog that never resorts to using the 'F' word. Tense and intimate drama that transcends its subject matter and hopefully will resonate with younger crowds since it pertains to current situations. Perfect."

","An excellent film. I will see it again and will likely buy the DVD when it is released.<br/><br/>I remember the McCarthy era and the way he used the fear of communism to cow people and organizations. While we didn't have television in our house I remember seeing the weekly MovieTone News at the Saturday matinée which always had something about McCarthy in the stories. Frankly, almost everyone thought McCarthy has doing the country a service and it was only much later that the techniques he used were recognized as something not to be proud of.<br/><br/>This movie comes to the screen at an appropriate time because it should call to the attention of anyone who views it these same McCarthy-esquire techniques so in vogue today to sell a vision.<br/><br/>The use of black & white in this film is key to setting the stage for the story. Color would have been a distraction. To me it enhanced the feeling of a two-sided conflict where gray areas didn't exist.<br/><br/>Clooney did an excellent job at a difficult task of being Director and playing a supporting role (Fred Friendly). He was in almost every scene but maintained his character as secondary to Murrow. The only thing I found that was a bit off was the voice of David Strathairn (Murrow). It was a little thin but he made up for it in his believable portrayal of Murrow's characteristic way of speaking.<br/><br/>After seeing this film I realized how much I missed the days when radio and television news people were really reporters and not just ""talking heads"". I now own ""The Edward R. Murrow Collection"" DVD set from PBS."

","It is worth the watching just to see David Strathairn channel Ed Murrow. Good cast all around with Frank Langella as William Paley, for instance. It uses a lot of real archive footage of McCarthy and others to add authenticity. Aside from being in black and white, it also goes to some effort to portray live television of the era in the CBS studios. It certainly tries to address the larger point of whether mass media will only dumb us down or help to inform us that there are matters that are truly important. The Murrow speech which begins and ends the film may or may not resonate with audiences today but the subject is more timely than ever."

","So what if the Verona cables proved there were Communists in our mists, and Khrushchev's memoirs confirmed the Rosenbergs committed treason, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" will make those who share Boy George Clooney's world-view (especially Oscar voters) want to hug themselves.<br/><br/>The irony of using African-American Dianne Reeves to underscore the ""crusade"" being launched by Murrow and his lilly-white staff is totally lost on Clooney. He isn't much of a director, either: the pacing is sluggish, the scenes are poorly blocked, the characters are not fleshed out, and a sub-plot goes nowhere. To top it off, he decides some gay-bashing is in order. That Clooney socks it to Liberace, of all people, and is being given a pass by the media, is despicable.<br/><br/>McCarthy did not create the blacklist; he did not blacklist Larry Parks for naming names and Zero Mostel for not naming names and Faye Grant for speaking out at a colleague's funeral while ""friendly witnesses"" Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper went on with their lives -- Hollywood did. CBS blacklisted numerous artists as well, which Murrow surely knew of, but Clooney ignores. He provides very little background about the hearings or any historical context; he hopes those going in won't be up on the minutia.<br/><br/>He uses McCarthy's claim of 200 card-carrying Communists in the State Department to lead the audience to believe the basis for the ""witch-hunt"" was false. Eisenhower finally put the brakes on McCarthy, partly because of his police-state tactics, but mostly because he had set his sights on the President's cabinet. And, despite what Clooney insinuates by closing with Ike extolling the virtues of American society, including the right to self-determination, he never publicly denounced McCarthy.<br/><br/>At one point, Paley says McCarthy wants William F. Buckley to do his rebuttal to Murrow's attacks; Clooney doesn't tell you that Murrow refused because he knew that Buckley would have ripped his pompous ass to shreds in a debate.<br/><br/>Too bad Boy George didn't explore instead how the Fourth Estate destroys innocent lives - as Richard Jewell and Wen Ho Lee can tell you - without fear of reprisal. But what do you expect from a self-righteous twit who declared that Charlton Heston deserves to get Alzheimer's? I don't care what your political affiliations are, no one deserves to get Alzheimer's!<br/><br/>And, how cheeky of Clooney not to mention that Time magazine's founder Henry Luce backed Tailgunner Joe. Could it be it's because his baby's distributor is a subsidiary of Time-Warner? Nah!"
"Tony43","Null","8","18","7 October 2005"," A good civics lesson, but only a fair movie
","I have a feeling most of the critics of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" are going to come from the political right --those who think it is part of the long liberal tradition of bashing Joe McCarthy, who is dead and gone and cannot defend himself. I take a slightly different stance. I'm somewhat critical of the movie, and I think McCarthy deserved everything he got in life and more, much more. My problem is not with the movie's politics, but with its film-making.<br/><br/>First, let's mention the good stuff. George Clooney does a solid job as director, keeping the pace swift, the performances universally good and ringing everything he can ring out of the camera and the editing equipment. He makes lots of use of quick cuts and dramatic camera angles, all of which flatter the players and heighten the tension.<br/><br/>And Clooney does an excellent job as actor. I have to admit I was skeptical when I heard he was playing Fred Friendly, but he pulls the part off and then some and you are able to forget he is a handsome Hollywood leading man and accept him as a behind the scenes administrator.<br/><br/>Full marks, too, to the ensemble cast including Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Junior and Jeff Daniels, and especially to Frank Langella, who pulls off his ""William Paley"" role with ease.<br/><br/>What of David Strathairn in the pivotal role as Edward R. Murrow? I have long been a Strathairn fan (especially in all those John Sayles movies) and think he gives it everything he's got. But he finds himself in the tough position of playing an historic character who is too fresh in our minds. He has neither the physical presence nor the timber of voice of Murrow and I kept flashing back on the real life CBS icon, which distracted from me paying attention to the actor up there on the screen. Whether those not overly familiar with the real life Murrow will face this problem or not, I don't know.<br/><br/>But it is those not so familiar with Murrow and this particular chapter of American history who I feel were short changed the most. And that was because of a thin script, the place where George Clooney, co-screenwriter, fell down.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that the movie failed to establish the era and the stakes involved in this battle of wills in the early days of television. The film does have a brief opening prologue, which quickly crawls up the screen as it tells about the influence McCarthy was having and the fear he struck in people's hearts.<br/><br/>But that's sort of like saying Attila the Hun was a rowdy house guest. What the film needed to do was to show the impact red baiting had on America from the end of WWII until the mid-50s. It needed to talk about the HUAC hearings, the Hollywood black list, the government purges, the spy trials, the fear of the bomb, the raging debate over ""who lost China,"" the suicide in '49 of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, all these things created a climate of fear which had a strong impact on the nation, and which led to the rise of McCarthyism.<br/><br/>While a movie is NOT a history lesson, this is a movie about history being made and the audience, especially those not around when this was all going on, needs to understand the stakes that were involved here. There was even fear in the 50s that McCarthy was maneuvering himself into a position where he'd either have to be given a cabinet post or Eisenhower would have to put him on the GOP ticket in 1956. Luckily, Ike, no matter how much he disliked Nixon, had even greater disdain for McCarthy, who he looked upon as something of a dangerous demagogue, if not a cheap thug.<br/><br/>All these things could be told, either in fast paced news clips or newspaper headlines of the day at the beginning of the film, or mixed in later, anything to raise the stakes in this film.<br/><br/>What could have also been used was drawing a contrast between Murrow's celebrated service as a war correspondent in London, and ""Tailgunner Joe's"" self proclaimed heroics on bombing missions.<br/><br/>Some or even any of this might have added drama to the story, as would a few words about how McCarthy came to be censored by the Senate, what happened to him and to the perpetually cigarette smoking Ed Murrow.<br/><br/>Whether or not George Clooney had the budget to add another ten minutes to the film, I don't know. But those ten minutes could have lifted a good film into the realm of greatness. As it is, the film fails to live up to the importance of the events it is depicting."

","I found Goodnight, and Goodluck, the supposed story about the fight between Edward R. Murrow and Sen. Joseph McCarthy against the wrongful accusation of people as Communists and wrongful punishment of those innocent people, to be pretty boring throughout, a little confusing, but good when it got to the central point. It takes a while for the movie to get going, but when it gets to the central topic, Murrow attacking McaCarthy it becomes interesting, but after that conflict ends so does the movie essentially except it keeps going for another 20 minutes or so. I found it interesting to see the sorts of supposed evidence and facts that are thrown back and forth between the two and how Murrow had a great impact in bringing down McCarthy. It also shows how the media has a great impact on this countries government that one could argue was initiated by Murrow. However, for all the interesting parts of the movie, there are probably more that don't make much sense and are probably worthless. There are a few scenes in the movie where you see Robert Downey Jr.'s character w/ his wife, whose relationship was forbidden b/c they worked together, both at home and in the office talking about various subjects. At the end of the movie, those scenes were completely worthless, they have no impact on the film at all. Why even include them, now that I think about it, those two characters were completely worthless in the entire movie, other than one other scene w/ Robert Downey, neither his character nor the character of his wife were in any scene that was apart of the central plot. The movie is also very boring most of the way through, most of the show takes place in the CBS studio, they don't show much of the actual McCarthy conflict other than what they showed on the air. The only interesting parts are when Murrow is doing his live pieces to try to deface McCarthy and some of the sessions in the editing room where they are deciding what to cover and how to cover it. Otherwise there is a lot of useless crap that leaves the movie bland. Being that the movie is only about an hour and a half long, it seemed as if the writers couldn't think of what else to include in the movie so the made up some useless story lines. As a student of history I came in expecting to learn more about the despicableness of Sen. Joe McCarthy and to see the battles between Murrow and McCarthy and the impact the free press plays on American politics. Instead I saw a movie more about the internal politics of a major TV network (CBS) and the relationships between the people working at CBS, specifically Murrow's show. The one positive thing about this film is that it is fairly short so you don't have to sit through it too long, but don't be surprised when you find yourself looking down at your watch every so often."

","A sterling effort, perhaps too sterling. I have seen the original Edward R. Murrow See It Now shows about the Air Force Lt. Milo Radulovich who was discharged from the USAF because his father read Serbian language newspapers and his sister was an obnoxious person, probably a Communist, but then, that was her private business. I saw the episode where Murrow took on Joe McCarthy and the episode containing McCarthy's ridiculous response.<br/><br/>This film added nothing to my understanding of the issues, the time period and the people. So, since the See It Now episodes are available on DVD and video, why see a movie with movie stars that simply recreate those shows almost verbatim? If the film doesn't go any deeper with the issues than the TV broadcasts, or doesn't go into any new territory with the characters, what's the point? <br/><br/>I suppose they could have overly dramatized the situation and co-writer/director George Clooney shows restraint in not doing that, but you can go too far the other way and turn an inherently dramatic situation into a dry history lesson. I wanted this fictionalization to engage my emotions, my feelings and my passions. I felt like I was in a Civics 101 class and I was listening to a less than inspiring professor. Say what you will about Michael Moore's style, but his films do get the blood boiling, either you're for him or you're against him, but you ARE moved emotionally.<br/><br/>This film could have used a nice dose of moral outrage. It wasn't that McCarthy and others were immoral, they weren't, they were ordinary sleaze-bags so nakedly hungry for headlines they recklessly charged people with treasonous crimes and then did nothing to support their claims. All of this was done as an ego boost and a power grab and it was painfully obvious to anyone who bothered to look. This film didn't need to give McCarthy's viewpoint a fair hearing; Murrow himself in the film says that sometimes there aren't two equal sides to an argument. Murrow has a point; slavery has no justification in any scheme.<br/><br/>I really wanted to be moved by this film, but I wasn't. It was all too clinical, something I usually like, but here it didn't work. For example, I have seen documentaries on Titanic that informed me but did not make me cry as I did when I saw the James Cameron film Titanic. And I didn't cry because of the silly love story in that film, I cried at the lost humanity and terror of the people on the ship and the inevitability of their demise. Good Night and Good Luck suffers from too much restraint.<br/><br/>There are too many unanswered questions in the film; for example, I wanted to know why at CBS two employees could not be married? Why did Murrow and Fred Friendly sign the dreaded loyalty oaths? Everyone seems surprised to discover that Murrow signed it; he must have had a reason. Why not share it with us? What's with all of the long, long silences after Murrow finishes his newscasts? What's with all of the shots of people walking aimlessly though the CBS building while non-synchronous sound is overlaid? Why film in black and white? The world did not exist in black and white in the fifties. That's an aesthetic choice, but I can't really substantiate it, except that it is cool looking to have cigarette smoke wafting around inside closed rooms.<br/><br/>Good Night And Good Luck is a noble effort, but for the real history of what Edward R. Murrow and company actually did and said, watch the actual See It Now TV shows, they are available. Regarding the paranoia and emotions of this era, that is better dealt with in the Martin Ritt film from 1976 called The Front starring Woody Allen and Zero Mostel."

","More than anything else, I loved, loved, LOVED how director George Clooney shot this film. Not just in black-and-white, but in HIGH-KEY black-and-white- so that you can barely feel the hot studio lights in every shot. Hand-held cameras catching script meetings, echoing the newsreel cameras shooting the big location news stories. (A lot of the cinematography reminded me of the PBS documentary from a few years back on Rod Serling called SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL.) The whole presentation of the nightly live broadcast of SEE IT NOW- from director cues to film feeds to cue cards- is wonderful to watch. And, of course, the kinescopes and newsreels of the McCarthy hearings- amplified to grainy, scratchy proportions- are still chilling to watch. The movie is an interesting companion piece to say, BROADCAST NEWS- despite the fact that the films are almost 20 years apart and represent two different time lines of the same subject matter. And the entire business still yields a controlled, crisp, central performance- worthy of an Oscar nomination- from David Strathairn."

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is an uplifting confrontation between longtime news journalist Edward Murrow and the infamous Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy who once accused Mr Murrow of being a Communist in 1950's America. The script was penned by George Clooney which is apropos since Clooney was a journalism student in University and was co-written by Grant Heslov. The movie provides a plethora of archives that would make this movie almost documentary like rather than a political drama. In addition to that, Clooney also directed and performed here as well. The movie begins with Murrow (David Strathairn) being honoured at a dinner ceremony, which then quickly shifts gears to a heated battle with Senator McCarthy. Murrow defends himself with a CBS executive based on a news story about an Air Force officer being dishonourably discharged after McCarthy claimed he was secret spy. And from there the heat takes off from there. There are tow other worthy subplots one that involves the marriage of two CBS employees and a news anchorman on the brink of suicide.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that George Clooney is one of the best performers in the world today. He's come a long way from the 80's sitcom ""The Fact of Life"" to the hospital drama ""ER"" to the big screen. Edward R. Murrow was an iconic journalist in his time and became a public figure back in World War II when he was doing broadcasts in London during the air raids.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a gripping and and upbeat political drama that leaves no stone unturned. And sure we never look into Mr. Murrow's personal life, but the black-and-white images have that certain nostalgic look of what and how the news was covered in the fifties. I was expecting something a little more satirical almost to the point of being like a farce. Boy was I wrong! But I digress, this movie was serious in delivery and everything looked and felt authentic. The stories and coverage being shown felt like I was on a class. The release done in black-and-white was symbolic and yet very scintillating. Even the cigarette smoking tolerance was pretty much in the 1950's.<br/><br/>If I was to pinpoint a weakness to ""Good Night and Good Luck"", it would have to be that it was way too short and a lot of coverage was still underdeveloped. The Red Scare fiasco could have been more further explained and more of the fear and paranoia that materialized towards the civilians during the 1950's. McCarthy didn't intentionally wanted fear and doubt on America, but he surely relished it like a conductor holding his baton.<br/><br/>This is a good film for those who are studying journalism or pursuing goals in journalism and too see the physical and metaphorical black and white of journalism in the 1950's. The script by Clooney and Heslov was truly a masterpiece that truly earned its Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Historians will love the film for its accuracy and how television news that was in its infancy operated. The dramatic and excellent dialogue make this film all the more poignant."

","""There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful. The instrument can teach, it can illuminate. Yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise, it is merely lights and wires in a box"" Good Night, and Good Luck is a very intelligent film and it has some great performances as well as it focuses on real events from the 50's dealing with TV journalist Edward Murrow and his confrontation with Senator McCarthy. It is a political film and one of the best movies about television journalism as well. Murrow was one of the pioneers in journalism when TV was in diapers and he set the standard for serious and intelligent news reports. This film was nominated for Best Picture in 2006, and received five other nominations although it went home empty handed. George Clooney directed this film and co-wrote it along with Grant Heslov (who later directed Clooney in The Men Who Stare at Goats) and received two nominations for it as well. His portrayal of the CBS studio feels so real and it is enhanced by filming it entirely in black and white. The atmosphere and set really contributed to the success of the film as did David Strathairn's performance as Murrow. Clooney manages to enlighten us as to the importance of Murrow's stand against McCarthy and warning us that sometimes patriotism disguised can be used for evil. It is not wrong to question certain acts just because we fear to be labeled unpatriotic, we must learn to question things and television can be an important instrument when serious and fair journalism takes place. The problem is that most of the time it doesn't and TV just becomes an entertainment device. The same can be said for Hollywood and its movies, but Good Night and Good Luck is one of those rare films that enlightens us and isn't just another popcorn flick.<br/><br/>We all remember studying from History class about the communist scare in the 50's and hearing about Senator McCarthy's communist witch hunting tactic. Clooney directs this historical event focusing on Edward Murrow's (David Strathairn) confrontation with Senator McCarthy (himself since newsreel footage was shown every time he appeared) during his TV show on CBS. Murrow decided to expose the Senator for using the public's fear of communism and exploiting it to accuse people of being communists without having credible evidence. CBS boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), gave Murrow and his producer, Fred Friendly (George Clooney), liberty to attack the controversial Senator despite losing some important advertisers for it. The struggle came at a great cost for CBS and its crew. The film focuses entirely on this issue as we see glimpses of the early years of television and know now how several news shows have modeled themselves after this one. The only side story the movie has is that of the relationship between CBS reporters Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.) and Shirley (Patricia Clarkson) who had to keep their marriage secret because CBS policy prohibited spouses to work together.<br/><br/>The film works very well and it sometimes has a documentary feeling to it because of the way the movie was shot in black and white. Robert Elswit does a great job with the cinematography. David Strathairn really captures Edward Murrow's mannerism and impersonates him very well, and he is one of the reasons this film works so well. George Clooney has directed a great movie focusing on an important era for television and has written a decent script along with his close friend Grant Heslov. Overall the film works really well and manages to entertain while enlightening us at the same time. Good Night, and Good Luck is a rather short film, barely over 90 minutes long, and its title comes from Murrow's classic farewell signature after ending each show. Dianne Reeves is shown several times throughout the film singing jazz music while we see in the background several journalists smoking and drinking margaritas, and I guessed it served to evoke the era. Clooney really did a great job of making the film look real and overall it has a nostalgic effect on the viewer over that time period where television was just being discovered.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"JamesHitchcock","7","3","5","29 November 2009"," Murrow's message is even more relevant today than in 1958
","Like a number of well-known actors, George Clooney has also tried his hand at producing and directing films. A notable feature of those films where he has acted as producer or director is that many reflect his own liberal political opinions. (This liberalism is not always reflected in his choice of films as an actor, such as the gung-ho political thriller ""The Peacemaker""). ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" was his second film as director and was written by Clooney and his close friend Grant Heslov, who directed him in the recent ""The Men who Stare at Goats"".<br/><br/>The film portrays the clash between the notorious Senator Joseph McCarthy and the television journalist Edward R. Murrow, who made a number of broadcasts attacking McCarthy. (The title comes from the catchphrase with which Murrow routinely closed his broadcasts). It is noteworthy for three brave decisions taken by Clooney. Firstly, it is one of the small minority of films made in black and white since colour became the norm during the sixties. Secondly, there is no actor playing the role of McCarthy. Thirdly, although Clooney was the film's director and co-writer, he is not its star, appearing only in the relatively minor role of television producer Fred Friendly. The star role of Murrow went to David Strathairn, normally as a character actor. Although I had previously seen him in a number of films such as ""L.A. Confidential"" or ""Memphis Belle"", he was always in supporting roles; the nearest he came to a leading role in any of those films was as Meryl Streep's screen husband in ""The River Wild"".<br/><br/>Of these three decisions it is the third which is most successful; Strathairn gives a great performance, which won him a deserved ""Best Actor"" nomination. The other two decisions are closely linked. Clooney decided to film in black-and-white because he had already decided not to cast anyone as McCarthy. The Senator does, however, appear in genuine newsreel footage from the period, and black-and-white photography was needed to match this. I am not convinced that these decisions were the right ones. Murrow is so much the central character in the movie that it can at times seem unbalanced (in an artistic rather than a political sense); a greater contrast and sense of drama might have been achieved had McCarthy figured as a character in the film. Most black-and-white films from recent decades, like Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" or Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" have been made with a particular artistic goal in mind, but Clooney's aim of matching the look of fifties' newsreels did not strike me as particularly artistic, and I felt that the film would have been more visually interesting had it been made in colour.<br/><br/>Politically any film on this subject was bound to be controversial, as shown by the various reviews on this board. Although the American Communist Party enjoyed very little popular support (even when they achieved their best-ever national result, in the 1932 Presidential election at the height of the Depression, they polled only 0.3% of the vote), the Soviets did indeed use American Communist sympathisers as spies or agents of influence; in the circumstances of the Cold War it would have been remarkable if they had not used such methods. The fears of McCarthy and his supporters about Communist infiltration and subversion were not, therefore, entirely due to paranoia. What made McCarthyism so objectionable was not his stated aim of defending American democracy against an undemocratic ideology but the methods he used in pursuance of that purported objective. McCarthy was notorious for making allegations unsupported by evidence and for attempting to smear anyone who questioned his methods, and failed to realise that his crusade was actually destructive of the very freedoms he claimed to be protecting. It therefore required considerable courage for Murrow to criticise him; as we see in the film, McCarthy predictably responded to this criticism by making unfounded allegations that Murrow himself had Communist affiliations.<br/><br/>As I stated, the film is perhaps over-reliant on the character of Edward Murrow; most of the other characters are not particularly interesting. The one exception is perhaps Frank Langella's William Paley, the chief executive of CBS television, who is torn between a personal admiration for what Murrow is doing and the commercial demands of his business. (Many of CBS's advertisers disliked what they saw as a left-wing slant to Murrow's broadcasts). The film's subplots about two journalists who have to hide their marriage to save their jobs at CBS and about a third who commits suicide are not particularly well developed.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"", however, is worth watching, if only for Strathairn's excellent portrayal of Murrow as a man of decency, integrity and courage. (There is also a very good musical score featuring the jazz singer Dianne Reeves). The film begins and ends with a speech Murrow gave in 1958 to the Radio and Television News Directors Association in which he warned that the power of television to inform and educate the public was being ignored in favour of trivial entertainment. I am not sure what American television was like in the 1950s (British television during that era, especially on the BBC, was dominated by the public service ethos of Lord Reith), but it seems to me that his message is even more relevant today than it was in 1958. For the last few days the lead story in several national newspapers has been the performance of glamour model Katie Price on a ""reality"" TV show called ""I'm a Celebrity- Get Me Out Of Here"", and before that the British public's main obsessions were with equally trivial programmes like ""Strictly Come Dancing"" or ""The X Factor"". We need more people like Ed Murrow to shake us out of our complacency. 7/10"

","The McCarthy era caused so much pain in this country. It's interesting that after we had just finished fighting a multitude of tyrants, a man like the Senator from Wisconsin was allowed to play the same kinds of mind games that these despicable men did. Ed Murrow is part of my youth and I remember the sober, almost dark way he looked into the camera. He was incredible because he should have been scared. He kept us informed when the fledgling networks were trying to find out what they had in their hands. This film oozes with threat. Not the Freddy Kreuger kind of threat. The kind that is in the house next door and in the minds of the guys sitting at the local bar. Murrow was often seen as a ""Pinko."" It's so interesting that the people who look out for the little guy are portrayed as threats. It's that ""What's wrong with Kansas"" thing that becomes more dangerous than most threats because it is inside us. Anyway, fine performances all around, great tension, and a retelling of a very exciting if terrifying chapter in our history."
"bgood26","10","3","5","5 March 2007"," What journalism used to be
","In 1954, television was still a new invention. Few Americans owned one, and those who did had only three or four channels to choose from. It was the time of the Red Scare, of Joe McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, of Edward R. Murrow.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is not your typical biopic or docudrama. It does not delve into Murrow's childhood or marriage. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his news producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) learn an obscure story of an Air Force Lieutenant who is discharged because his father might have been a Communist. With his commander (""24""'s Glenn Morshower) unwilling or unable to explain his dismissal (one of the contents of a top secret envelope), Murrow and his team take on the ring leader of the Pinko witch hunt, Sen. McCarthy. (And if you don't think it can happen now, visit a university campus or listen to talk radio, and take note of the venom spewed by so-called ""experts"" who think they have a monopoly on truth.) <br/><br/>Standing in the way is CBS news manager William Paley (Frank Langella), who has to balance his journalists' integrity and freedom with the desires of his sponsor Alcoa. Murrow convinces Paley to let him run his critique of the Senator, mostly by washing his (Paley's) hands of Murrow if it blows up. So on March 9, 1954, Murrow's show ""See It Now"" used McCarthy's own speeches to show inconsistencies between his words and actions.<br/><br/>A month later, McCarthy appeared on ""See It Now,"" accusing Murrow of being affiliated with the Communist Party. Of course, he had no proof. ""We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty,"" Murrow says. Viewers responded overwhelmingly against McCarthy. After that, politicians of all stripes openly criticized McCarthy, and McCarthy's career spiraled downward.<br/><br/>Filled with jazz and cigarette smoke and filmed in black & white, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" brings the viewer back to 1954. Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr., and Ray Wise round out the supporting cast with terrific credibility. At only 93 minutes, the movie--which has no sex, no violence, and only one blasphemous swear word--is anything but boring, letting the drama of the time dictate the action.<br/><br/>""Good Night and Good Luck"" is less a movie about McCarthyism than it is about courage and journalistic integrity. All journalists, especially those who tripped over themselves to cover OJ Simpson's trial and Anna Nicole Smith's death, and columnists who close their minds to the opinions of others, need to see this movie so they could learn what journalism really is."
"oliver-123","9","3","5","4 March 2007"," Why can't people write like Ed Murrow any more?
","As my title indicates, I was extremely impressed by everything Ed Murrow is presented as saying, which presumably represents what he actually did say. Maybe I'm being unfair to modern-day broadcasters (and being British I don't see American news programmes anyway), but I do not get the impression that anyone working now has that kind of authority.<br/><br/>Just hearing the man speak was enough to make this film very worthwhile. I felt that the use of documentary footage was just a little excessive, especially when we got parts repeated, and one did ned to pay close attention to be clear what was going on. It was not always entirely clear who people were, and, no doubt deliberately, the hubbub of comment made catching what any individual was saying difficult at times. But it all felt authentic - and, omigawd, the *smoking*! (None of the women smoked, that I noticed - a tribute to the days when it was felt rather fast, if not a sign of a dissolute or dangerous woman as in film noir?).<br/><br/>I hope that everyone who saw this took away some lessons. The use of smear tactics, guilt by association, etc. and the demonising of groups perceived as alien or hostile has not diminished, and is practised all over the world (cf. the President of Iran on Jews); the reluctance of powerful organisations to have their actions questioned and be required to justify them publicly has not diminished.<br/><br/>Given that the media played a major role in turning the US against the Vietnam War, some of Ed Murrow's gloom about the future of TV, as expressed in 1958, might be thought excessive. But the points he made are still valid today - and it was very interesting to hear him indicate doubts about American policy in the Middle East, in 1958."

","George Clooney directed & wrote, re: true story of Edward R. Murrow as lone journalist up against McCarthy's witch hunt and American security paranoia. Timely stuff, straightforward, no hanky-panky Hollywood fluff. Clooney turns out to be an interesting and informed guy. It was nominated for everything, but won only lesser awards for cinematography (filmed in stark black & white), but it did win more recognition overseas in Australia and Europe. One only hopes that American journalists watched it! Perhaps many reporters were indeed inspired by this timely reminder of the heroic Murrow, since it appears that the media in 2005 began to ""speak truth to power"" and to openly question the executive decisions being made -- e.g., about the flooding of New Orleans, the occupation of Iraq, the sudden loss of habeas corpus rights, the extraordinary renditions of kidnapped civilians out to secret prisons where torture is routine and legal trials are nonexistent, about the distorted and fabricated ""facts"" to persuade Americans into the war, and more recently against the proposed strikes on Iran. That's an incredible list of journalistic duties, and compared with what Murrow was up against, we live in a darker and more disturbing time. Clooney knows this, has said as much, and ought to be thanked for reminding us of Murrow's courage, now needed doubly."

","George Clooney sets the stage in a very professional manner with the film Good Night, and Good Luck. The film is based on actual events that took place during the Cold War. <br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1953, when the television is still a new establishment. David Strathairn plays the role of Edward R. Murrow, a broadcast journalist whose program used to be featured on the radio but is now on television. Always ending his stories with his quote ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" he finds himself in a conflict with Joseph McCarthy, the junior senator of Wisconsin. <br/><br/>As communism was a major threat to citizens of America at the time, being accused of practicing it was a major enormity. When Joseph McCarthy accuses Edward Murrow of being a communist, Murrow decides to editorialize his news program and deal with the issue on television, retaliating as he grows weary of the senator's methods. This stirs a considerable amount of controversy, but Murrow still doesn't capitulate. He continues to form reprisal by stating his ill opinion of McCarthy on the television for the citizens of America to hear. <br/><br/>This film helps open eyes to some common issues that were dealt with during that time period, something that is motivating to those who see it. It does not only apply to the 1950's either. The issue dealt with in this film are still highly relative today. <br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is presented in black and white quality which helps capture the cinematic era for its viewers. It is, undoubtedly, an exceptionable work of historical fiction, and it can currently be purchased or rented on Warner Brothers DVD.<br/><br/>9/10!"
"thinker1691","9","3","5","31 March 2006"," A Fearful Dream
","The United States is a great place for the creation of dreams. It's citizens are privileged to seek fame or fortune or to alter those of others. Those fragile fortunes always stride hand in hand with the fear of losing them. In the 1950's when the country was riding the high road of prosperity, Americans were enjoying the benefits of the second world war. With little to fear, it was left to the government to create one. It was called the ""Red scare"" or Communism. Most Americans were too complacent to worry about it. Thus it was left to one man to not only terrorize us with that fear, but to cultivate it. That individual was Joseph MaCarthy who hitched his star to a threat not of his creation, but his decision to feed, nurture and manipulate it to destroy the lives, careers and dreams of many citizens. In this remarkable film, audiences are given the rare opportunity to witness the classic confrontation between the Junior senator from Wisconsin and the controversial, chain-smoking hero of CBS, one Edward R. Murrow (supurbly play by David Strathairn.) The film is in Black and white as were the issues of the day. Noted for it's caricatures of the CBS news staff, the film pointedly reveals the uncertainties, triumphs and tragedies of the times. A courageous attempt to remind modern audiences that our present dreams and fears are no less precarious. With the government adroitly using the fears of global terrorism, a man like Edward Murrow is not only welcomed, but long overdue. ****"
"afosawips","6","3","5","23 March 2006"," Nice history less for the unknowing, but a slow film
","Being 60 today I was aware of the McCarthy era as it unfolded and of Ed Murrow's role in fighting against McCarthyism. I consider it a heroic role in real life for Murrow. I was also fairly well acquainted with his prior journalistic pursuits.<br/><br/>That said, for me the film was rather dull and unenlightening. At least it was only 93 minutes of dull. It probably reflects my desires and expectations in a film, with which many may disagree, but I was more than happy to fast forward through the opening several minutes of music and zero dialog. About 20 seconds was enough to set the mood and era for the film.<br/><br/>And although I learned some trivia of the times, eg. CBS prohibition of coworkers being married to each other, I didn't learn much about Murrow I didn't know. I would have been interested in learning more about his family life. It's a stark contrast, for me, to the last film I saw, which was ""Walk the Line"", which was rich in details about the personal life of its main character.<br/><br/>If the film's goal was to be any kind of a biopic, it was unsuccessful. As a history lesson, it is good for the unenlightened but not much for those who lived the history."
"bob the moo","Null","3","5","19 March 2006"," Fascinating film with great acting and directing that works as basic history lesson and social commentary
","The story of a young man ejected from the Air Force because he refused to disown his father for once reading a ""communist"" publication comes to the attention of the newsman Edward R Murrow and his team at CBS. Despite the concerns of the corporation and the sponsors, Alcoa, Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly decide to run with it and attack the fact that there was no evidence, no proper trial and that the whole event is a knee-jerk reactionary piece of fear mongering from Senator McCarthy. This begins the conflict between McCarthy and the CBS team where all the pressure on Murrow and Friendly is to soften their reports and go with the flow.<br/><br/>I always liked George Clooney as an actor even if I think he relied on that hangdog charm a bit too much to get him out of ER and into a cinema career. But with recent years he has impressed me more and more with his intelligence and his determination to do more with his chances than just churn out average action thrillers  not to say he hasn't done those too but recently he has sought to do more with his money and fame. It helps that I am more on the left of centre than the right but generally I respect his stance. This film is a good example because he has delivered a story that engages and fascinates as it educates and challenges. If this sounds a little full of itself then perhaps you are right because those with more of a right wing leaning will perhaps feel that it is being smug, overbearing and simplistic; as I tended to agree with its targets I cannot comment but personally I felt that it was no more or less critical than it needed to be.<br/><br/>The story opens with a potted summary of the time and then jumps right into the start of the battle between Murrow and McCarthy. From here on it was intensely interesting and covered the action at the time while also giving plenty of food for thought for modern times (although not in an obvious or obtrusive manner). The narrative is fascinating and it does a great job of recreating the time and using archive footage blended really well. Clooney also handles the theme really well that the media and the people need to be able to hold their Government up for criticism and inspection and the inability to do that is totally against the idea of democracy; this is most obvious in the story we are being told (where it was easier to keep your head down) but you do not need to look too far in recent years to see how the story is still applicable now. As director Clooney is excellent and the only criticism is that he maybe over-directs, by which I mean that there is not a shot in the film where I didn't think ""they've done a good job with that""; but this is as weak a criticism as it sounds. The black & white looks fantastic, the lighting is great and the framing of shots is expertly done, mixing flowing motions with static long looks. The running time also shows a discipline in the production as it is at its best for being punchy  it stops it becoming preachy or labouring the point.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent both on paper and in reality, although many have quite small roles. Stratharim is excellent with his convincing newsman  I don't know the real person but he really works within the film. Clooney brings his charm to the piece well but doesn't push himself forward like some others might have done. The support cast have limited time on screen but they are all really good and the number of well-known faces just adds to the feeling of depth. Clarkson, Wise, Langella, Downey Jr, Daniels and others all hit the mark just right and I was surprised by how deep with quality the film really did feel.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent little film that gives a potted history of the period in a fascinating and punchy fashion while also challenging the audience to have a thing about the current state of affairs. It is deep with talent, looks great and mostly avoids the smug overbearing approach that a lesser film might have had. The ending is also encouragingly downbeat and makes sure that we know there are no easy answers to the problems and that a bigger change is needed than a few good men doing the right thing."
"cstuesday11","9","3","5","9 March 2006"," Absolutely Brilliant
","In the year of the so-called ""socially important"" film, this one stands out as both technically brilliant and frighteningly prescient. Clooney details the ominous warning that Murrow presents in the film--that pop culture and ratings could ultimately reduce news divisions, particularly editorials, to nothing but meaningless entertainment. Though set in 1953, it is terrifying that Murrow's warning has most certainly come to pass. Where are the Murrow's of modern-day CBS, NBC, FOXNEWS, etc.? Why are anchors no longer allowed to editorialize? Why does the American public expect the news to be not only banal, but trivial and ""safe?"" This film should be viewed by everyone who places faith in the reporting of CNN, ABC, or any other news division. I, for one, cannot trust any of them anymore. Clooney's film is not the reason for this, but simply articulates a notion I have had for many years. A spectacular and important film."
"donut_whistle_blower","9","3","5","9 March 2006"," Stunning movie, with a lot of current day relevance
","I was moved by this film. Not just by the expert-direction (the set and the moods created) and the superb lead acting (Strathairn). I think the most impressive element of the movie was the dialogue as delivered by Strathairn. McMurrow had to tread very carefully and not resort to gutter tactics to take out McCarthy. The threat that McCarthy posed was massive. He used the fear of Communism to smear anyone who didn't agree with him. 40 years on and Fox News' Bill O Reilly is using precisely the same tactics to smear anyone who doesn't agree with his rabid Republican views ! He is analogous to the journalist who repeatedly smeared CBS in the movie. (Phrases like we are at war, accusations of unpatriotism etc). I was moved by the monologues to camera given by McMurrow. They represent the core ideals of democracy. Someone should nail them to the forehead of Rupert Murdoch."
"Matt_Layden","8","3","5","2 March 2006"," Know What You're Getting Yourself Into....Or Else Be Bored.
","In the 1950's Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly looked to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy. Through much controversy they stood up against all odds and brought down the Senator.<br/><br/>George Clooney is at the directorial chair for a second time. After taking on ""Confession of a Dangerous Mind"" I was eager to see what he had in store for us a second time around. With Good Night and Good Luck, although not perfect by any means, does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Good Night is a movie that has class, which is evident as soon as the bold black and white hits the screen. Good Night has classic film written all over it, and is a new classic film for this era. Clooney knew exactly what he wanted for this period piece, down to every little detail. Such as smoking, which seems to appear in every single scene. The smoke from the burning cigarettes look beautiful on screen, especially with the black and white. Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy and the trials which blends in with the black and white of Good Night.<br/><br/>Good Night And Good Luck is not for the younger crowd, as it's not very ""entertaining"". Nothing really seems to happen in it, it's geared towards an older crowd. It's odd to explain how the film made me feel, because even with nothing much happening I felt totally into the film. It could've been the content in the film or they way Clooney presented it. In the final scene, I was surprised to see it come up so fast, but knew it was going to end as soon as that scene was finished. This can't be said for all, since nothing really happens in it, you must be really intrigued by the content to not feel like the picture is dragging on and on...*cough* CAPOTE *cough*<br/><br/>A gripe with the film is the lack of it's supporting cast. With star power such as Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr and Frank Langella it would have been nice to see more of them. Robert Downey Jr. is basically useless, he really serves no purpose other then the fact that he was an actual character in that time period. The same goes for Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella although does serve a purpose and does get more of a spotlight then the others, but he could have used a little more.<br/><br/>Good Night's strongest feature would be David Strathairn's performance. Although, it's no where near as great as Hoffman's Capote, Strathairn seems to finally get his place in the spotlight. After many years of supporting roles, Strathairn is able to break-out and shine in the film and is acknowledged just as well. He gives a powerful performance and if the film was done in any other year, then I would really be amazed by it.<br/><br/>Good Night is a film that Clooney can be proud of. It's a big improvement over Confessions and is one of the better films of the year. You just need to know what's going on with it's story, or you can be lost throughout the film. If you're lost, then you'll ultimately be bored out of your mind. Don't go to be entertained, go to watch a film with a message, and for Strathairn's performance of Murrow."
"gsygsy","6","3","5","1 March 2006"," it's a bit dry, but it's worth seeing
","Doesn't work as a piece of story-telling but it has a lot to commend it, notably the acting, in particular the central performance by David Strathairn and a very fine one by Frank Langella. The choice of black-and-white was presumably made so that the archive footage would fit in pretty much seamlessly, and I think this pretty much worked, although the use of a haze of cigarette smoke was overused. I could see the point of the little subplots but they still seemed kind of malnourished. As a history film it seems to me to be preferable to the Spielberg or Mel Gibson approaches, which err on the side of entertainment. There's no doubting the seriousness of Good Night and Good Luck - it avoids sentimentality except, maybe, in one area, which is in its uncritical acceptance of journalists as latter-day knights, guardians of our freedoms. Ed Murrows are few and far between, after all. Most journalists would never have dared to do what he did. I would imagine that Clooney and his team decided that to show a counterbalance to the crusading journalism on view would involve broadening the film out and weakening its power. So what we get is a rather dry affair, but it was worth making and is worth seeing. Keep an eye on your freedoms, this film says. That is a worthwhile message."
"markgorman","9","3","5","18 February 2006"," Unexpected tension and greatness
","I wasn't overly optimistic about this movie. Having set out on a 'see all the Oscar nominated 'best movies' before the Oscars weekend'(tricky in the UK as they often come out AFTER the awards) my wife and I picked up Crash (truly appalling and heavy handed scriptwriting)and Munich (good, not great, also with a touch of overt politicking) along with Good night, in the last 24 hours.<br/><br/>We saw Brokeback a few weeks ago and, it too, has a central politic; in this case, the freedom to ride bareback with your cowboy mates - it is far less political but disappointing in several ways.<br/><br/>Good night and good luck was my least anticipated of them all, (I have to say the trailers were, at best, dry) but it is, by a significant margin, the best movie of this bunch (time will tell if Capote is in my running as it's not out yet in the UK).<br/><br/>As the most overtly political movie of them all Good Night succeeds mainly by not banging the political drum which it has every right to. The performance of David Strathairn is utterly spellbinding (sorry Joaquim, but you've been beaten for best actor despite your wonderful Johnny Cash tribute).<br/><br/>George Clooney is an able sidekick (in a slightly George Clooney way) but his direction is phenomenally restrained, the art direction and cinematography utterly convincing, not least for the way the stock footage is woven in so effortlessly, and the script really tight.<br/><br/>Obviously McCarthy was ripe for a good doing over but he is almost treated with respect. For me the way Clooney resists the temptation marks him out as a much more sophisticated director (and scriptwriter) than most, especially the frankly embarrassing Haggis(Crash) and yet Haggis seems to be getting great reviews for portraying the race issue in LA with all the subtlety of The Simpsons.<br/><br/>Good Night is as tense as any thriller I've seen recently (and that includes the excellent 'Hidden'). The cast as good an ensemble as you'd like and the musical interludes outstanding too. It looks, sounds and feels like a world where standing up for something was worth doing.<br/><br/>If I were an Academy voter Good Night... would clean up."
"bopdog","10","3","5","18 February 2006"," Important, well-crafted. Wouldn't have worked 10 years ago, but hey, it wasn't needed then either
","I really liked this movie. It's black and white, which I hate. It's kind of heavy, and it deals with sad political realities. Even so, it is an important movie. It is extremely well written and well crafted.<br/><br/>I always had a personal 'connection' with Edward R. Murrow. I never knew him--- I'm way too young, and not at all important--- but I got a master's degree from the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication at Washington State University, which was Murrow's alma mater as well. We were steeped in his history, and his culture. I feel a bit proud of our 'hometown hero'.<br/><br/>More, though, Murrow stood for an integrity and honesty in journalism that is virtually extinct today. He gave a speech in 1962 or so where he spoke to an audience of broadcasters in Washington D.C., noting with genuine horror that commercial adverts were now appearing adjacent to news broadcasts. He spoke of a foreboding future when he remarked to that crowd, 'It's not too outrageous to imagine a day in the future when there might actually be advertising WITHIN a news broadcast'. He was right, of course, much to the sorrow of the modern world.<br/><br/>This movie captures the 'Ed' spirit very well. The production of the film has obvious political motives. George W. Bush is clearly portrayed by the stupid yet cunning, selfish, self-aggrandising, greedy and all-around evil Joseph McCarthy. Sadly, the resemblance is spot on. The movie pulls in archival film of folks in the day, Murrow, of course, and even President Dwight D. Eisenhower to point up the short-sightedness and tawdry vibe of the McCarthtry/Bush style of politics. Eisenhower, who also warned America and the world of the growing threat of the power of the 'military industrial complex', is shown supporting the Murrow approach. It is not a stretch to imagine that Eisenhower, even though he was a Republican, and a military general, would be horrifed at George W. Bush, and the current administration.<br/><br/>All together, it is an important movie, and a splendid movie. It probably wouldn't have gotten the attention it has if it were made, say, 10 years ago. But then, it wasn't needed then."
"ignatiusloyala","9","3","5","17 February 2006"," Documentary like
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a movie which one'll either like or hate. I, however, as a non-American, take a more neutral stance.<br/><br/>GDAGL is a honest movie depicting the Red Scare of the 50s when the fear for Communism was very heightened in the US. To say it's a movie might be an exaggeration, since in many ways, it looks more like a documentary. Historical footages feature rather strongly in the film, making the acted part seem like its supplement. It is interesting, however, that the story told by the acted part, which is very great by the way, thanks to both Strathairn and Clooney, is the main storyline. We saw a group of TV programme producers struggle to censure the madness of a senator whose influence gained weight over the years and brought the political terror to new heights. The story was not very powerfully delivered, but it is this relatively calmness of the atmosphere (e.g. no music or sound effect most of the time; no emotion-provoking elements found in similar movies like 'The Insider') which brings out the seriousness of the issue.<br/><br/>The movie, however, suffers from a relatively weak character development. While the story about Strathairn and Clooney was reasonably well-told, other characters which have a measurable screen time are like blackboxes to the audience. Although one may argue that it is the story which matters in the movie, one cannot but wonder what the significance of Patricia Clarkson's story is.<br/><br/>GNAGL is not a thriller with cliffhangers popping up every five minutes. It is on the contrary a solid piece of historical work: it only reminds the audience of a story which the director finds important. In other words, no viewers should watch it and expect a breath-taking experience but should be prepared to be briefed on a serious political event retold by an amazing cast."

I was definitely yearning for more at the end, a rare occasion. The actors are splendid all around, David Strathairn being the crown jewel. A smart movie that realises it's limitations and uses them into it's advantage (the usage of footage being the only portrayal of senator McCarthy being one of them). A delightfully fresh breeze of air that only comes along every so often, ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" is a great movie experience that probably won't win awards come Oscar night (p.s.-who gives a damn), but will be shared and admired among people who will discover it for what it really is - pure independent marvel, the best kind! 9/10 Recommendations: anyone who likes the era and simplistic, kind of easygoing feel of the 50's, anyone who just want's to see a smart movie"

"DeeNine-2","8","3","5","9 February 2006"," Lacks somewhat in focus and tension, but still worthwhile
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>I won't join the chorus of accolades for George Clooney for his direction of this movie, but I will give him credit for making it. The way the press has been pushed around (and especially let itself be pushed around) during the George W. Bush years is a disgrace, and it is good that Clooney is here to remind us of a journalist who had the guts to go after a power-hungry demagog whose agenda included finding traitors among those who disagreed with him. Sound familiar? So, just as Arthur Miller's celebrated play The Crucible was timely in that it symbolically chastised those who would conduct witch hunts in the name of patriotism, Clooney's film is timely in that it reminds the Fourth Estate of its responsibility, a responsibility sorely neglected in the buildup to the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>As far as the film itself goes, a black and white fusion of documentary footage and an acted-out story line, it was good, but not great. David Strathairn, playing Edward R. Murrow, certainly had Murrow's voice, cadences and mannerisms down pat. However, because there would be a viewer's eye conflict with the actor's appearance and the way the real Edward R. Murrow looked, we were unfortunately not shown footage of Murrow himself. Which is a shame. Even though I was a child at the time, seeing Murrow's dark, penetrating presence on the old Muntz TV was indelible. He had a way of talking straight to the viewer and doing so in a manner that was clear, fair and to the point. Strathairn does a good job of reenacting that presence.<br/><br/>And it was good to see some footage of the demagoging junior Republican senator from Minnesota, Joseph McCarthy, in all his drunken, bullying vainglory. And I was fascinated to see President Eisenhower giving a spirited speech. Indeed the film managed to atmospherically recall the era of the early fifties when TV was all in black and white and everybody smoked to excess, especially Murrow. (But softening accusations of receiving Big Tobacco money, Clooney was wise to include an old TV commercial for Kent cigarettes in which the hyping of their new ""safe"" filters sounds cruelly ironic today.) Frank Langella was excellent as Murrow's careful, yet supportive boss, media legend William Paley. And Clooney himself played a nicely understated Fred Friendly. I have to say however that the film lacked a certain tension and that the focus was not as clearly defined as it might have been. A film without much tension and with a fuzzy focus can be boring (as some viewers have had the temerity to point out). Yet would it have been better to have simplified the issues for the sake of an easier understanding and accessibility for the average viewer? I don't know, but if I had been Clooney I would have more directly tied the issue of the responsibility and independence of a free press (the central issue in the film) in with what is happening today and what has happened in recent years.<br/><br/>Almost stopping the show by herself was jazz vocalist Dianne Reeves singing some of the standards of the era, including ""How High the Moon,"" ""One for My Baby,"" etc., and the very catchy and ironic, ""TV is the Thing This Year."" Her easy but intense concentration, her beautiful voice, and her exquisite timing were for me one of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line: After seeing this on a return flight from Hawaii I can now say that not EVERY film that I have seen on an airline has been unwatchable. However flawed, Good Night, and Good Luck is definitely worth the time and effort, especially for those who care about the history of broadcast journalism and governmental attempts to control the media."

Murrow, the legend of broadcasting from back in the 50's. His performance captures the essences of Murrow and makes you truly believes that its Murrow himself on the screen. An Oscar nomination is not far off.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels and Robert Downey Jr. also give excellent overlooked supporting performances as Sig Mickelson and Joe Wershba co-workers of Murrow and Friendly(Clooney) which add to the intrigue of this great film.<br/><br/>All that being said, Good Night and Good Luck will have a tough time bringing the Oscar home with BBM gaining such momentum as the Oscars approach. The Screenplay may get the Statue but all of the Acting in the film will go away empty handed for the competition is too stiff this year.(Phillip Seymour Hoffman for Capote, and Clooney beating Clooney for Syriana) <br/><br/>This is the film of the year in my opinion worth every second of your time, if you haven't seen it go see it now.

Clooney depicts another time, but yet the film resonates oh-so-strongly in this era. I thought several times of Bill O'Reilly or Tucker Carlson or some such pinhead in the role of ""the junior senator from Wisconsin"" but unfortunately, as another commenter mentioned, and has been well- documented, there really isn't a media figure of Murrow's stature in this day and age who has the nerve to, as the saying goes, ""speak truth to power"". Murrow's coolness under pressure, nerve, knowledge of his obligations, and the opportunity that he had seem to be sorely missing in this day and age while America craves an anchor or media figure with such integrity. <br/><br/>The choice of Murrow's opening speech in which he foresees a dim future for for television if it isn't used wisely is quite prescient when one considers just how much garbage has been featured in the last 50 years. The broadcast of Murrow's celebrity interviews were particularly amusing in that after them, and after the program wrapped, while the staff congratulated him, he just reclined and took deep breaths of smoke (seeing an anchor smoke was funny) and inhaling deeply while he considered just how useless the piece had been. I'm not old enough to have seen Murrow or have any memory of the period but I am aware at least of his name. And it's very interesting to see Murrow taking his journalism so seriously and his consideration of what was important. He recognized that McCarthy was essentially a bully and that if bullies are challenged directly that their ""ideas"" will not stand and they certainly won't. So it was with McCarthy. Murrow recognized that McCarthy was going to come after him personally as that was all that he had. This was the problem for the newsman (Don Hollenbeck-played as heartbreakingly sensitive by Ray Wise) who couldn't abide the criticism of his reporting-when really all he should have done is realized who was criticizing him and that he did not have much integrity-either that or not read the reviews, as Murrow suggested. <br/><br/>All the same, the film seemed to me to have a lot of relevance for today and I think Clooney, notwithstanding his well-known liberal sympathies-made this film as a means of reminding America, and particularly media movers and shakers-of their responsibility to use their power for good. The performances were very good, particularly the astonishing David Strathairn. While, as mentioned, I didn't remember this period of American history and Murrow's demeanor, other commenters have noted Strathairn's accuracy in his depiction of Murrow and it would seem that with such particular mannerisms and demeanor that he was going for a something very specific. In any case, his very economical, efficient performance seemed to capture the integrity and reserve of Murrow. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is truly one of the best American actors, in spite-and maybe because, of all the things he's gone through. He was great in Chaplin 14 (wow, 14) years ago and he's still very very talented. Frank Langella is wonderful as the CBS President Bill Paley who feels put-upon by advertisers and the government but yet protects editorial independence. Again, I was concerned that no network President would today have the editorial integrity that Paley had. The inclusion of Dianne Reeves' vocals, not to mention the almost omnipresent smoke and clean black and white cinematography seems to enhance the clear moral dimension underpinning the film. Clooney himself is excellent and his direction, as mentioned, keeps the film moving along briskly so that it clocks in at a lovely 93 minutes. You will want to see this film again and again. I haven't seen Brokeback Mt. or King Kong or Syriana, but I can't imagine that Brokeback would be better. Syriana...well...anyway. I would certainly favor Mr. Strathairn for Best Actor."

","This movie illustrates the results of citizens allowing an elected official to use their fear to foster his agenda. It shows how important it is for each individual to guard against all efforts to trade personal freedom for national security, lest we help destroy one of the most fundamental rights on which this country was founded. Both can coexist. This movie's message is so important that it should be part of the history curriculum in every middle and high school and parents should encourage their children to discuss the movie's message at home. Family values will be raised and we will have a stronger country.<br/><br/>I lived through this period, graduating from high school in 1954. People were so consumed by the fear of being accused of being a communist, that many allowed guilt by innuendo and the suspension of due process. Far too many gave misinformation against their neighbors and colleagues that resulted in discrimination, job loss, Hollywood blacklisting, or worse, in an effort to appear as loyal citizens and protect themselves. Oftentimes, the ""offense"" was nothing more than a person having been seen talking to someone about a socialist subject or attending a meeting to learn about socialism.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone to see this movie and then make up their own mind."

Particularly noteworthy performances include: Strathairn as Murrow; Langella as the CBS big boss; Clooney as Fred Friendly, and especially Ray Wise as Don Hollenbeck. He and Strathairn should receive nominations. This film makes me want to learn lots more about Murrow. The film depicts him as brilliant, and incredibly eloquent and articulate.

","The nineteen fifties were a turbulent time for journalism. Senator McCarthy was on a head first conquest to rid America of communists, people of left-wing actions and communist sympathisers; no matter what it took and who it hurt. No one dared stand against McCarthy, fear of being labeled a Communist or sympathisers was to great a deal. On the CBS, one show, See It Now was committed to presenting factual stories to the public. After Edward Murrows presented a story on Milo Radulovich, a serviceman who was discharged on grounds that his farther may have a tainted past. Senator McCarthy attacks Murrows, claiming he has a communist past and still is. Murrows and his producer Fred Friendly finally take the fight to McCarthy, he's been untouched for too long.<br/><br/>Civil liberties and freedom of speech have been a delicate element of human rights. Good Night and Good Luck presents a time when journalism was about the stand for these rights. While many never acted in brash manner as Murrows, yet he and his team were the only ones who fought for the truth. Even with the precognition of being attacked and labeled communists and dangerously controversial, their fight to bring the truth behind McCarthys egomaniac fight to rid so called communists in America, was the most honest work of journalism.<br/><br/>While the film is stamped with the monochromatic look of black and white, the story sings depth beyond doubt. George Clooney having a history in journalism; his father being one, he has knowledgeable depth of the subject. You can tell the subject matter is close to heart, the research can not go unseen, bringing this story with truth and honesty, much in the vain of Murrows. The use of actual footage; Senator McCarthy's rebuttals against Murrows, court cases, interviews with Radulovich and even commercial ads, shoot the realism of Good Night and Good Luck through the roof. All the stock footage is seamlessly blended in from the black and white visual.<br/><br/>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind wasn't really the breakout nor great standout for Clooneys first feature. For Good Night and Good Luck, his focus never falls, with a brilliant screenplay and wonderful direction. His direction has taken a simplistic approach, which it soars for. Your kept at a distant, never taken into peoples lives. At times shots are done through glass or different rooms, giving the reminder that you are just the fly on the wall, not an actual participant. David Strathairn delivers a powerhouse performance as Edward Murrows. Through each deliverance of his speeches, you are locked to him and can't look away. George Clooney brings one of his best performance as Fred Friendly. The supporting cast all deliver great performances; highlights from Patricia Clarkson, Frank Langella and Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>While at first this does get stuck in the haze of cigarette smoke from all the actors, after the story on Radulovich, the haze clears and the target of McCarthy is set, for some of the most revetting drama. Good Night and Good Luck shows what journalism used to be, the search for truth. It's a disappointment that journalist today aren't like Murrows."
"Derek237","10","3","5","8 January 2006"," Save your Job. Save your @$$. Save your soul.
","I saw this movie the day after I saw Peter Jackson's King Kong. Compared to a movie that drones on and on for 3 hours, I found Good Night, and Good Luck, a movie no longer than 90 minutes, to be a much more rewarding and worth-while film experience. As the story begins, we see room full of reporters and investigators chatting and joking about what they should air, while in the back of room, sitting still and silently, is Edward R. Murrow (played wonderfully by David Strathairn). This quiet, humble man, as we learn in the prior scene, will soon emerge as a hero.<br/><br/>When I came into the movie I expected to see a rousing story about the little guy standing up to the big powerful villain and taking him down. What it ended up being was so much better than that. This is not a David versus Goliath story, it's not a ""going the distance"" story ala Rocky Balboa, this is a story about right and wrong. It's about morals. Edward Murrow saw that senator Joe McCarthy was doing wrong, abusing his power, and causing unneeded grief in already difficult times. Murrow saw that he himself had a position of power, having access to millions of homes as a television personality, and he used it to get his message across. With help from some other brave friends, including Fred Friendly (George Clooney), this mission came with both victory and sacrifice, both of which he was willing to accept. The film opens and closes with a speech Murrow makes several years after his battle with McCarthy. His words tingle with relevance, urgently and obviously intentionally applying to modern times. It really doesn't matter if it's the 1950's or 2005: if used with honourable intentions, and most importantly, the truth, the media can change the world for the better.<br/><br/>George Clooney, merely in his second directorial effort, has made an excellent film. It's serious when it needs to be, and it's casual and down-to-earth at moments when we need to be reminded that this is real life. David Strathairn leads an enormously talented cast, giving the best performance of his career, and one of the best acting showcases of year (topped only by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote in my opinion). See you on Oscar night. Good Night, and Good Luck.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"FADrury","Null","3","5","30 December 2005"," A Powerful Mood Piece
","""Good Night and Good Luck"" presents the McCarthy hearings of the 50's through the prism of a very particular individual, broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, and the organization he worked for, CBS. While many people have commented about the failure of the film to place these hearing in historical context, or the political viewpoint (anti-McCarthy) the films is expressing, I think these observations are a bit off mark. While Clooney is definitely taking a political position, I believe his main purpose is to convey the mood of that time, that place, and those people. Once the decision is made to directly attack McCarthy, there is real fear present among the participants. Clooney also is willing to include details that tarnish the halo around CBS and Murrow. The loyalty pledges are signed, Murrow is chastised for pulling some punches on some McCarthy misstatements. In addition, the sub-plot about the ""hidden"" marriage of two of the characters adds to the tension. Fear doesn't just come from big, politically-charged issues. Even a liberally-minded employer can reach into your personal life and the impact can be just as potent.<br/><br/>If think if you see this movie as a mood piece, it succeeds masterfully. If you want the history, there are plenty of better places (of varying political viewpoints) where you can learn more."

The cast is uniformly excellent, lead by David Strathairn in a breakout performance as Murrow, and George Clooney as producer Fred Friendly. The script is witty and profound, never beating you over the head with rhetoric, but getting it's message across loud and clear. ""We cannot stand in fear of each other.""

This film was an enlightening and educating experience, prompting me to find out more about this era. The core subject matter  freedom of speech; litigation by due process (c.f. the witch hunts that went on in the McCarthy era)  evokes passion in many and is particularly dear to my heart.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film on many levels. I found it intellectually stimulating, engaging and educational. It was well acted, with a particularly memorable performance by David Strathairn as Ed Murrow, delivering deliciously enunciated readings.<br/><br/>It is well scripted, in that it is short and sharp; getting the point across without labouring it and assuming that the audience has a reasonably high level of intelligence.<br/><br/>I felt it was appropriately filmed in black and white, which gave added realism to the archive footage shown.<br/><br/>One small detail I enjoyed was that it gave a sense of a bygone era. Almost everyone was smoking and at every opportunity, including those on camera during filming of the evening shows. I particularly liked the advert for Kent cigarettes  that was a brand that ""intelligent people"" were supposed to smoke! How the world has changed Plus ca change, plus c'est la même chose"
"EUyeshima","8","3","5","12 December 2005"," Clooney Proves to Be an Observant and Urgent Filmmaker Recreating Murrow-McCarthy Showdown
","David Strathairn's uncanny impersonation of legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow is the centerpiece of George Clooney's sophomore venture as a feature film director. Granted it comes across a bit like a stylized civics lesson on free speech and responsible journalism, the movie is also sharply focused and extremely evocative in recreating the claustrophobic atmosphere of TV journalism in the 1950's. It's obvious that Clooney did his homework as you see all the details of the production from the smoke-filled sets to the extensive use of historic video from that period, whether it's Murrow's ""Face to Face"" program or the Congressional hearings identifying possible Communists.<br/><br/>Shot in crisp black and white by Robert Elswit, the story co-written by Clooney and Grant Heslov is driven by the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist witch-hunts when in 1953, McCarthy bullies the US Air Force into discharging one of its young officers based on a vague allegation that the man's father was a leftist. This outrages the otherwise reserved Murrow who, with the assistance of producer Fred Friendly, uses their CBS News program ""See It Now"" to expose McCarthy's egregious act. Of course, this brings down the heat of the brass at the network, in particular, president William Paley, but Murrow and Friendly are allowed to continue, even allowing McCarthy to respond to the allegations.<br/><br/>Clooney smartly uses archived footage of McCarthy rather than cast an actor to play the ruthless senator, but he has assembled a top-notch cast to fill out the remaining roles. Frank Langella brings his trademark authoritative malevolence to the intimidating Paley but with hints of humanity that make him seem more vulnerable. Clooney himself takes on the rather pedestrian role of Friendly with his usual panache. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson easily play secretly married CBS News co-workers, but their subplot is dispensable. Jeff Daniels makes a welcome return as a mid-level CBS executive trying to convince Murrow to pursue the relatively safe target of Joe Kennedy.<br/><br/>There are in-studio performances by jazz singer Dianne Reeves that act like a chorus to the story, but as expert as her singing is, these are the only false steps the film makes. The film's most intriguing performance actually comes from Ray Wise as CBS anchor Don Hollenbeck, displaying a frozen smile and fragile psyche as a powerful New York Post columnist regularly accuses him of being a Communist sympathizer. The movie, however, belongs to Straithairn in an elliptical performance that shows Murrow's evolving position between drags of his constant cigarettes and to Clooney who has directed a piercing history lesson that does not ambitiously portend any present-day relevance. Yet, the message that we should not confuse dissent with disloyalty rings just as true today."

","Ten years ago, when ""Good Night, and Good Luck's"" director George Clooney was a driving force on ""ER,"" who would've thought, ""So he can write and direct, too."" Certainly not me or the rest of America's top critics.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" opens with the story of a 1950's soldier who was unfairly judged by other superior officers on his and his father's views on the global threat of Communism. We see TV news journalist Edward R. Murrow (portrayed by character actor David Strathairn) as he attacks the military on their actions with the soldier on his journalism news show ""See It Now."" After the show airs, military officers come to see him about the episode saying it was all based on myth when Murrow and ""See It Now"" producer Fred Friendly (played by the film's director) retort the military's actions against the soldier were based on fabricated fact, some of which was made up, evidence the soldier's superiors weren't shown, and heresy. However this is light compared to the backlash of Murrow's attack against House Un-American Committee (HUAC) chairman McCarthy and his tactics for rooting out communists.<br/><br/>When producer Friendly decides it's time to attack Sen. Joseph McCarthy's tactics for rooting out Communists, the environment around the ""See It Now"" grows tense, especially from the CBS president. When the episode airs, a disclaimer is aired, by Murrow himself, as a message to McCarthy that he may come on the show to retort the facts that would be stated. At the end of this episode, Murrow states what the episode was communicating and perhaps the entire film: ""We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. Good night, and good luck."" When the episode attacking McCarthy airs, the support from viewers overwhelms CBS with letter supporting Murrow and Friendly 15:1. When McCarthy finally exhibits his interest to retort to the claims made on the show, one month earlier, the senator sends in a recorded tape which is played on air with commentary from Murrow.<br/><br/>This film is amazing considering it's coming from a first time director, especially a TV veteran. This has potential to scrounge up several Oscar nominations including Best Actor for Strathairn, Director for Clooney, Writing for Clooney and Heslov, and Best Picture."

","You've seen the kind of movie this is: a movie that takes you back to a horrible time in our nation's history with no sex and violence. So of course, it will never win an Oscar. But the writing is superior, McCarthy plays himself ...which is hilarious, when you hear the criticisms of the 'actor who played McCarthy', and David Straithairn is more Murrow than Murrow was himself.<br/><br/>I practically caught lung cancer from all the cigarette smoking. That and the jazz captured the mood of those dark days in our country's history, much like today. The sound track of all that jazz will be a great addition to your collection.<br/><br/>Having been a high school junior at the time of these hearings, I was unaware of what courage Sen. McClellan of Arkensas showed, as he fought back against the un-American tactics of the demagogue, McCarthy (think a combination of Rush and O'Reilly). He used lies spoken with great authority, repeatedly by many people, much as Georing and the Bush crowd do, to obtain 'credibility'. The fact that he goes down in flames is not credited to Murrow, but it DOES happen after Murrow takes him on. The suicide of the newscaster Don Haversham is treated with great seriousness, as this subplot continues throughout the movie. Thus, the great damage done by despots such as McCarthy is shown, That he could be put in a good light by the revisionists of today's goons indicates how our society has degenerated.<br/><br/>The part played by Langella can't have been a lot of fun, since he plays Paley...but not as a dictatorial monster. He plays Paley as someone who is trying to help CBS survive, and knows the mood of the Congress right then can be very dangerous. As it was, Murrow gauged the mood of the American public and won. He was taken off the air for his work, another Profile in Courage.<br/><br/>Tblack and white used for the film was completely appropriate, not only because that's the way we the people saw TV back then. But also because of the mood: a dark time, where suspicions were easily aroused of neighbors by neighbors and jail time was done by innocent people for innocent political activity when such was popular among 'intellectuals'. <br/><br/>This movie was altogether timely, in view of the tight censorship being placed on reporters today. The government isn't so much actively censoring the media, as subtlety NOT allowing access to the sources of news for those reporters who refuse to spin. It took a few brave souls, as depicted by David Straithorn in a role that SHOULd net him an Oscar, but won't since we don't give honor to such high quality movies with such a message as the need for liberty in a time when despotism is called 'patriotism' and speaking out against the lying is called 'being a traitor'.<br/><br/>See it, even though you'll have to find it in some art house around. Hope Arkensas shows it in every little town, as Sen. McClellan makes a Southerner such as myself feel proud of our accent, something we rarely do these days."

","(I'm fairly new at writing reviews on IMDb and I'm not certain exactly what a ""spoiler"" is by IMDb definition, so their may be one or more spoilers herein. For this I apologize.)<br/><br/>This movie is an accurate and stirring reminder of a turbulent time in the history of America. World War II had been over for less than 10 years, the so-called ""truce talks"" in Korea were in their second year with no end in sight and a nation America had supported as an ally in WWII turned out to be a sneaky and dastardly enemy. The film is done in black and white to not only take advantage of archival footage of the time, but also to transport the viewer into the world of network news in 1953 America, which it does admirably.<br/><br/>Senator Joseph Raymond McCarthy (Tail-Gunner Joe) began his anti-communist campaign in 1950 with vague and groundless charges that the U.S. State Department was ""infested"" with communists. Those charges were summarily dismissed, but that didn't stop him. Over the following years, he used accusations (mostly unsupported), innuendo and outright slander to tarnish the reputations of those he considered communist and therefore enemies of America. People were afraid to speak out against him, as he would use their opposition to infer that they were communist sympathizers, or ""Pinkos."" But not Ed Murrow and his boss, Fred Friendly of the CBS news department.<br/><br/>That's where this movie picks up. Murrow confronting McCarthy, unafraid (or so it seemed to his viewers) and with the full support (apparently) of his network, CBS.<br/><br/>And here also is where this movie excels, picking up on the undertones of the man (Murrow) the whole news team and the network in the person of President William Paley. Murrow's inner conflicts when it came to going to Paley's office or dealing with the death of his friend. We can only imagine what his home life was like.<br/><br/>One of the things that struck me was the way the actors were presented. The makeup was subtle; it took me quite a while to make out that Murrow was portrayed by David Strathairn. I had to hear his voice to make the connection and even then, I found it hard to believe that the man I saw on the screen was NOT the real Ed Murrow. The same holds true for George Clooney. I suppose it was the authenticity of the clothing, harsh reality of the black and white filming and the fact that nearly EVERYONE was smoking... heavily. I could almost smell it.<br/><br/>Performance wise, David Strathairn gave a powerful yet subdued rendition of a historical figure, a man known and respected in most of the free world to this day. The feeling of roiling emotions under his facade of cool control gave the impression that this was not a man to mess with, even though he was slight of build and did not carry himself in any sort of confrontational manner. I cannot think of any actor more suited to the role. Watching him delivering Murrow's broadcast gave me shivers it was so powerful to see.<br/><br/>I won't waste time or space naming the other performers except to say that they helped to make the scenario believable and thereby add to the feeling of being transported to 1953 and watching history unfold. Congratulations to all and especially to George Clooney. It will be a crying shame if this film doesn't win at least 4 Oscars for best actor, best supporting actor, best director and best cinematography.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to everyone born before 1950 as a reminder of the times we lived through and to those of later generations as a lesson in history, one that can be applied to the world today.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 (""Excellent"" is too tame for this film. I think it rates a more powerful adjective like ""Outstanding"" or ""Superior"")"

","I teach history to high school students, so when Hollywood runs out of fresh ideas for horror flicks and tries to make a historical movie, I get nervous.

Murrow, this film was a wonderfully refreshing surprise.<br/><br/>Filmed entirely in black and white, ostensibly to be able to include 1950's footage of McCarthy himself, the film has the look, feel and taste of the decade. Smoke oozes from the screen, just as it did in real life before such behavior was taboo in all public places.<br/><br/>Clooney, who directs and acts in the film, was very nervous about finding an actor who could play Murrow convincingly, before finally settling on Strathairn, who in my opinion, gives the performance of his storied career. Accurately mimicking Murrow's rhythmic tone of voice and carefully portraying his television persona, Strathairn, near perfectly puts you on McCarthyism's doorstep, reminding us in the time of the War on Terror of the dangers of blind faith just the way Arthur Miller used The Crucible to warn 1950's Americans of McCarthy's tactics.<br/><br/>It's stunning the way in which the parallels, highlighted in McCarthy's and Murrow's own exact words from the time, can be identified in today's debates over patriotism, secrecy and the Patriot Act. Clooney undoubtedly intends this, and the film is a masterfully timed and crafted piece of nonfiction because of it.<br/><br/>It's not going to get Harry Potter dollars or even probably the Oscar nods it deserves, but it's honest and it's true and it's even funny in the right places, and you couldn't do better where Hollywood is concerned.

This is a film about the intense work and sweat of a big network TV news staff in that era, informed by two consultants to Clooney who were part of the team that worked elbow to elbow with Murrow, Joe and Shirley Wershba (played in the film by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson).<br/><br/>Another brilliant touch is having the jazz singer Dianne Reeves perform several songs from the era, numbers whose lyrics are often, ironically, in touch with the issues being depicted in the film.<br/><br/>Strathairn, who has made a career of performing quality supporting roles in 70 films since his debut in 1980 in John Sayles's ""Return of the Seacaucus 7,"" gets his chance to shine in a star turn here and makes the most of it. He is entirely convincing as the chain-smoking, dour, principled, hard hitting, eloquent Murrow. Ray Wise gives an outstanding supporting performance as the emotionally frayed Dan Hollenbeck, a CBS newscaster and protégé of Murrow's who was accused of being a communist by a newspaper columnist and eventually committed suicide.<br/><br/>Frank Langella is properly dyspeptic as CBS boss William Paley, whose backing of journalistic freedom in his news department proved to have significant limits when Murrow went after McCarthy. Clooney casts himself as Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, and does a decent job of playing down Friendly's famed aggressiveness, instead sharing his many scenes generously with the other players. Downey, Jr., Clarkson and a pudgy Jeff Daniels are put to dubious use playing other characters who were apparently important at CBS news at the time but are not written well into this screenplay (prepared by Clooney and Grant Heslov).<br/><br/>The film is on target, resonating keenly with our times. Murrow remarks early on, when he goes after McCarthy, that dissent should not be mistaken for disloyalty in a free society. Shades of all those post-9/11 debates. Not since the McCarthy era have civil liberties been as broadly threatened as they now are by the U.S.A. Patriot Act, military prisons and tribunals, and other restrictions put in place in the name of security against terrorism. Clooney, a liberal activist and the son of a television newscaster, slugs away at these issues: his film has been criticized for being overbearing in this regard, though I did not feel preached to.<br/><br/>""Good Night"" also offers an important critique of television itself, by way of a prophetic vision that Murrow offered in a 1958 speech to news broadcasters, recreated scenes from which are shown at the beginning and end to frame this film. He said then that TV seemed to be approaching a crossroads, a conflict between its role in public education versus shallow entertainment. The bruises left after his falling out with Paley over the McCarthy programs obviously had not healed. Murrow chided network bigwigs for sitting complacently while the medium is ""being used to detract, delude, amuse and insulate us."" Two years later he was out of TV altogether, working as chief of the USIA, having been appointed by John Kennedy.<br/><br/>Forty seven years on, Murrow's prophesies about television have for the most part come true. Today television and radio are corrupted by a legion of shrill, bombastic cheerleaders for the right, while our more dispassionate, serious media journalists (print and TV) have frequently seemed either craven or muzzled in not pursuing egregious problems brought on by the Executive branch and Congress.<br/><br/>The only downside to the film, apart from the acting talents wasted here and there, is its highly focused, clichéd Hollywood emphasis on the ""big showdown"" between the good guys and the bad guys. It's a reductionistic, somewhat dumbed down account. Phillip Lopate, writing in ""Film Comment,"" recently observed that ""...Clooney's smug recasting of Cold War issues as a simple matter of decency versus intimidation fudges the film's politics. We never do learn whether Murrow was a member of a Communist front organization involving international education in the Thirties, as McCarthy claimed...To what degree was Murrow's 'taking sides' dictated by his own personal politics?...What does (Clooney) make of the influence of Stalinist Russia on the American Left at that time, and whether it held any possible danger or was entirely illusory?"" Say this for the good guy - bad guy formula: it does get the juices flowing. I was spellbound watching this film. And we do need to be reminded of the truths told here, which hit harder in a two hour movie if not too freighted with nuance.<br/><br/>Bertolt Brecht famously said, ""Pity the country that needs heroes."" He meant, of course, that a yearning for great leaders - past or future - is all too often a sure sign of a nation foundering in a current leadership vacuum. Pity the media that need heroes, as well. It is apposite that Clooney at this moment offers his reflection on Murrow, surely a media hero for all times. My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 10/16/05).

It is not a bio pic or a broad message film. Instead, it concentrates its attentions on what happens when one man decides to exercise his constitutional rights to challenge a public servant whose actions are causing real pain to American citizens in the name of ""national security."" The story stays laser-focused on Edward Morrow and his team as they grapple with the impact this servant is having on their beliefs in what America stands for and their personal lives. It is done with style, class and gripping actual drama. To paraphrase the usual definition: melodrama concerns how the plot pushes the characters forward, drama shows it is the characters who push the plot along.<br/><br/>GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is about an issue that could not be more relevant today: the issue of destroying individual rights in the name of protecting them. Anyone who trots out the hoary claim that this film is about attacking communist-hunters has either not seen it or cannot grasp the difference between questioning methods versus questioning goals. Several times it shows Morrow telling his television audience that he finds communism to be against his beliefs and rightfully has no place in the US.<br/><br/>What he objects to is the way Sen. McCarthy used methods better suited to the Soviet Union to search it out, not caring if such methods would destroy innocent American lives. Milo Radulovich was not the only US citizen who was shown at the time and history has confirmed was guilty only of being yet more meat for the grinder of McCarthy's tactics. The fact that he was a man serving his country and tried (contrary to our laws) entirely on the basis of ""sealed"" very questionable evidence is what makes his inclusion the heart of Morrow's reason to attack McCarthy's methods.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a film about ideas. If that makes it ""preachy"" to you and you like your movies to simply entertain you, then the other 99% of what gets released each year is probably more your speed. Because at the end of the night, the only two valid sides in discussing this film are pretty simple: you either believe believe that destroying even thousands of innocent, loyal American lives is justified to protecting us when some elected officials claim it is; or you think that to do so pretty much invalidates the principles the country were founded upon.<br/><br/>GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK says it believes the latter and could have easily closed with this, my favorite quote about real patriotism: ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" <br/><br/><ul><li>Benjamin Franklin</li></ul>"

Too many young people see movies like this and come away with a distorted perspective about the era following WWII, which did not really end until the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of Soviet communism. Mc Carthy was not the only person who made a fool of himself. Those who denied the threat of communism in this county were members of a tribe that Lenin called ""useful idiots"".

","With his second directorial effort, George Clooney made a marvelously stylish film. Filmed in crisp black and white, the story focuses on the battle that took place between the already legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and senator Joseph McCarthy (real archive footage was used for his portrayal) in the early days of broadcast journalism. George Clooney and co-writer Heslov largely took their material from Murrow's broadcasting program ""See it Now"", which aired for six years at CBS, beginning in 1951. When Murrow launched his first attack on McCarthy in 1953, exposing his tactics on American television, McCarthy turned on Murrow and accused him of communist sympathies as well.<br/><br/>Clooney, whose father was a news anchor and almost pursued a career in broadcast journalism himself, has a keen eye for detail, with his loving and accurate recreation of the fifties television studio, the fashions and the habits of Murrow. One of those small but key elements is the smoking, everyone is smoking like mad. A constant smokescreen. But it never becomes a stiff or dull period piece, it all looks incredibly vivid.<br/><br/>Many parallels with the current position of the media have been drawn, but the film never becomes an outspoken pamphlet against lackluster right wing media moguls. Clooney dissects his subject to the bare bone, with perhaps the inevitable consequence the film is somewhat distancing at times, emotionally speaking.<br/><br/>David Strathairn is perfect as Edward R. Murrow, with just the right tone and intonation in his voice to deliver the sly wit and intelligence of Murrow with great intensity. This is great film-making in all departments, and it takes a lot of courage and persistence to make a project like this. In more than one way, a film that gives us something to think about.

"noralee","10","4","8","24 October 2005"," A Powerful and Pointed Docudrama
","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a powerful docudrama that is a parallel to ""All the President's Men"" in vividly demonstrating the importance of the fourth estate. Like ""The Crucible"" used an earlier period to contemporaneously criticize the 1950's, co-writer/director George Clooney uses the 1950's to criticize politics and journalism today. <br/><br/>The irony is emphasized through the structure of the film. With less opening background crawl than ""Star Wars,"" the film opens at a dinner in 1958 honoring Edward R. Murrow where broadcasters are congratulating themselves for his role and he delivers a portentous challenge to television news, that we of course know has rarely been fulfilled.<br/><br/>Then flashing back to 1953 by utilizing lengthy excerpts of kinescopes of Joseph McCarthy, ""the junior senator from Michigan"" as he's frequently called, including a marvelous throw-down of Shakespeare quotations, and hearings he held, as well as recreations of Murrow's serious and celebrity interview broadcasts, the editing and spacing adds commentary. <br/><br/>In a riveting performance, David Strathairn doesn't just copy Murrow in look and sound but adds subtleties like a raised eyebrow and hand motion that add volumes of meaning.<br/><br/>The film makes clear that journalists are relevant to their reporting and that the times forced them to be, as everyone has secrets and standing to protect that can get compromised or can compromise a story -- from a new mortgage, to school tuition, to an ex-wife, to actual memberships -- as Strathairn's Murrow intones ""The fear is in this room."" <br/><br/>While the film only glancingly notes that the Communist hunt hysteria had already been going on for at least six years before Murrow's pieces, including the coverage in newspapers that are the team's sources of information, it does establish right away that he had already personally signed a loyalty oath, to indicate that he had tolerated quite a bit before deciding enough was enough.<br/><br/>The hypocritical context of primitive 1950's television is established particularly well. In addition to the casually sexist language, we see all the participants chain smoking away, we see a Kent cigarettes commercial, reminding us how the government and corporations were lying to us about the affects of cigarette smoking (which would kill Murrow a decade later through lung cancer). It is followed immediately by an interview with Liberace that is such a cover-up of his homosexuality that even though Murrow has agreed to conduct these celebrity interviews ""to pay the bills"" for his investigative journalism, he can't bring himself to completely play along with the farce. <br/><br/>The chapter breaks of songs by Dianne Reeves also represent how CBS was otherwise going on with entertainment programming (as well as a tribute to the director's Aunt Rosemary), emphasized by a line that Milton Berle was then the most trusted name in television.<br/><br/>But all these references and cultural touchstone may well go over the heads of anyone under 50, and there were none in my audience of a fairly crowded suburban multiplex with defective projection quality. Will they even know that Murrow was a patriotic icon for his war time radio broadcasts from the London Blitz, or what were the Wobblies that McCarthy accused him of being a member of, or who was Roy Cohn, or even the flashes of RFK as a staffer on the HUAC committee, PM Magazine, the Red Channels newsletter editor who confronts one of the reporters, or the senators who discovered their backbones after Murrow showed that the emperor had no clothes. This will doubtless be the first they hear names such as Bill Paley and Frank Stanton. <br/><br/>Unusually for this kind of film there is no concluding scroll that reminds viewers of the distinguished careers of the participants, such as Don Hewitt, producer of ""60 Minutes."" The dialog does have an ironic exchange about what happens to McCarthy.<br/><br/>The connections to today's issues of the Patriot Act and the means justifies the ends in anti-terrorism, particularly now that television is used far more slickly than by McCarthy, are emphasized by Strathairn's Murrow several times stating that it is the methodology of the accusations he is concerned with, as he stresses process, procedure and the rule of law overcoming innuendo, implication, smears and out and out distortion and lack of facts.<br/><br/>Clooney's Fred Friendly creates an easy partnership with Strathairn's Murrow, as he's just barely off the TV screen as they create the famous broadcasts together, even as Friendly jokes about Murrow risking the most as the most visible.<br/><br/>In addition to a beautiful black and white texture that smoothly integrates the original footage, Clooney's gliding directing helps to build the tension. Several scenes of silent waiting for count downs and a phone to ring are as tense as ""Apollo 13."""

","Having just seen ""Good Night and Good Luck"" last night, I couldn't help but reflect on the American people's relative ease of acceptance of the tyranny of a minority. What McCarthyism was to the 50's, the wave of Christian Fundamentalism is to us today. There is a lesson to be learned in Clooney's film - that any despot in any form is to be found out for what he is and the general public needs to know. It is the media's responsibility to do the research and report the facts, without fear of being called 'leftist' or 'liberal' or... And by the way, what is wrong with being called a 'liberal'. It used to be a badge of courage, a statement of compassion...<br/><br/>Where are the responsible newsmen of the 60's and 70's... the Murrows and Huntleys and Brinkleys and..... today? I would hope that CBS or NBC or even Disney's ABC might look into this film - and the very positive response to the film - at least with the crowd that I enjoyed it with last night (admittedly in Los Angeles.. but still) and let the American people see the other side of Fox's continuing propaganda."
"StrangledPalooka","2","12","35","8 November 2005"," Horrible
","This film's thesis, that the media has grown cowardly, is disproven easily by the publicity brought to the film. In addition, Murrow's behavior throughout reeks of bias, including taking rejection of McCarthy's case as justification not to report it, while even saying how intelligent his audience was. If his audience was so intelligent, why wouldn't they be able to see how bad McCarthy was if Murrow presented the case? Clooney takes these accusations and throws them out the window as disguised attempts to give McCarthy preference. Also, aside from a single, brief rebuttal broadcast, McCarthy's side is given no opportunity to defend themselves as they are sent through the meat grinder. Not only this, but Murrow encourages his co-workers not to read columns criticizing them. One scene consists of the various workers at a newsroom debating how best to attack McCarthy. Yes, historical fact, but Clooney not only does not acknowledge this as a flaw, but he glorifies Murrow for it! Furthermore, Clooney shouldn't have given himself such a prominent role; it detracts from the main plot through distraction. I'm a chest-beating right-wing idiot from Massachusetts, and frankly, this film was terrible! (I give it a 2 because, while I cannot find any redeeming value aside from a few moments of comic relief, I reserve a 1 for truly, truly horrible films.)"

","Good Night,and Good Luck is not a bad movie at all but it is a dry history lesson that's probably just as tolerable as listening to the history professor drone on and on. I can see talent used to make the film but I guess it never clicked with me. I was waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing really happened. I liked the idea on how they used black and white filming because it gives the film an authentic look for the time period it was in.<br/><br/>George Clooney's film is about how Edward Murrow and his team do all they can to discredit Senator Joseph McCarthy and his communist claims about people infiltrating the American government.<br/><br/>The film has a bunch of solid performances most notably David Strathairn. He really pulled out the stops to play Edward Murrow. He even acted the way the real Murrow did. The supporting cast led by George Clooney, Patricia Clarkson, and Robert Downey Jr did an awesome job. Even McCarthy did a good job since he played himself thanks to archive footage.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a bland film despite it being pretty historically accurate. If they added a bit more to the film, it could have been better. This film literally put me to sleep and that never happens to me in movies.

The director combines the two and uses black and white to capture the time period with a talented cast acting the parts to perfection.

"trioxinforlunch","10","2","3","22 October 2010"," An outstanding film
","Following 2002s underrated Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Clooney's sophomore film again addresses the world of television, however he retreats from the surreal world of Chuck Barris responsible for the 'game shows' which would provide the blueprint for reality television. Instead, Clooney's film is a restrained though thoughtful examination of famed CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow (David Strathaim) who stubbornly refused to submit to the doctrine of undemocratic and outlandish communist witch-hunts perpetrated by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. Good Night and Good Luck is at heart an illuminating study of a time when journalistic responsibility as well as the integrity of the television medium itself was not incongruous with optimal ratings.<br/><br/>The film, thematically akin to documentary, is essentially confined to the studio from which Murrow's show See it Now was broadcast. Robert Elswit, the favoured cinematographer of Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Boogie Nights) shoots these often cramped environments with a crisp clarity, recalling Roger Deakins' work on The Man Who Wasn't There. Strong silhouettes amid smoke-filled network offices and boardrooms confirm the 'feel' of the 1950′s. The inclusion of whip-cuts, shallow focus, the odd zoom and objects obscuring the frame compliment the black and white palette, impressing on the viewer the sense of urgent response felt towards McCarthyism. Murrow is routinely framed in such a way as to emphasize his tenacity; the shot lacking in the significant movement which defines the rest of the uniformly excellent cast.<br/><br/>Strathaim's portrayal of Murrow is accurate in all the right ways. His performance asserts the quiet dignity and resolute determination of Murrow. Clooney himself portrays Fred Friendly, co-creator of See it Now. Frank Langella is excellent as CBS Executive William Paley. The scenes between Langella and Strathaim are absorbing to watch; Murrow obstinately refusing to reject his principles while Paley attempts to reconcile corporate interests with the moral strength of the See it Now show. In an interesting move, the decision to use archival footage of McCarthy rather than cast an actor seems designed to assuage commentators who might suggest the film is uneven in it's treatment. I thought it achieved this quite successfully. None of McCarthy's well-known characteristics are exploited in aid of ridiculing him. He is presented appropriately as he was; a demagogue intent on summoning divisive rhetoric to achieve his aims.<br/><br/>Though essentially a dramatization of the events surrounding the McCarthy trials, I prefer to enjoy the film as both a light character study of Murrow and as a sub-textual indictment of television. The quote above is taken from the beginning of the film, an awards dinner in 1958, exemplifies his staunch provocation towards the media. Murrow represented the true potential of the television medium, tirelessly working to ensure it's enduring status as a tool for extrapolating and critically engaging with issues. He was critical of the role sponsors may have in editorializing and wary of corporate investment eschewing integrity for entertainment, notably embodied by the influx of game shows in the 1960s. Having been a pioneer in television's enormous growth he also witnessed the mediums downfall.<br/><br/>To my mind ""decadence, escapism, and insulation"" is no less prevalent in the television of 2010. It's tempting to argue that the internet allows respite from the one-way street of sloganeering, self-help and ostensible objectivity emanating from ""wires and lights in a box"". Murrow's work might suggest that even if this were to be true, it should still be ceaselessly scrutinized and complacency rejected. The media, whatever it's incarnation, plays far too great a role in our lives for us to be so forgiving of inaccuracy and fabrication."
"waggler","6","2","3","19 May 2008"," A half-hearted recommendation
","I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation. It has nothing to do with the thesis. Those who have commented that Venona intelligence somehow vindicated McCarthy by proving that there were highly-placed Soviet spies are, at the very least, putting the cart before the horse. McCarthy or no McCarthy, it was assumed that there was a Soviet spy network operating in the US, and that it would be placed as highly as the Soviets could manage (otherwise, what would be the point?). However, the thesis of this film only addresses McCarthy's *methods*, and the passive tendency of TV as a medium in general. At any rate, there is no indication that McCarthy had any direct access to Venona intelligence, which was unavailable to Truman and Eisenhower.<br/><br/>No, the film didn't thoroughly impress me just because it wasn't that good. Every scene was skin deep, there was no probing into character or motivation and nothing going on below the surface. The direction was undistinguished, a connect-the-dots job, and the inclusion of the jazz numbers (which in themselves were very good) added nothing, and evoked such devices used on pedestrian TV shows, such as ""Ally McBeal"" and the like. What little development there was, was so painfully foreshadowed by the acting that it came as little surprise.<br/><br/>This just coasted along on a rather obvious ""Newsreel Noir"" atmosphere, a competent ensemble cast, and the quiet charisma of Strathairn as Murrow. Ironically, it offers as little to chew on as most of the medium it's critical of."

I don't care whatever subject the movie is about, because this is a movie about the human side of us all, filmed with intensity, and depth. One could argue that the McCarthyism is approached with some naive touch, but again, you shouldn't see this movie for the subject, but feel it for the means Clooney arranged of passing through his message. And it all began with the decision of filming it in black and white. This alone is a powerful cinematography decision. Then, Clooney picked an sequence for opening for the movie, that presents the main characters in a way that lets you look at them like you were there, but looking at the scenes in a corner of the room. All this ""coloured"" by Dianne Reeves instrumental ""When I fall in love"", that I simply can't get enough of. I could see these first 2 minutes of the movie, over and over. To end my comment I would like to quote again Murrow on a sentence that could be said this very decade about Americans self-consciousness: ""We have a built-in allergy for disturbing and unpleasant information"". Good night,... and good luck."
"dragonshield","7","2","3","3 May 2007"," As a movie it lacks some emotion, but as a documentary it's almost perfect
","An important film the Americans say, which I'm not doubting at all. A movie about courage to stand out, even if you're outnumbered. The movie is based on real events and I guess it's pretty accurate when it comes to that. A fear of communism was at its highest point at the 1950's and a man embracing those fears was a controversial Senator called Joseph McCarthy. CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow and his close friend, also his producer, Fred Friendly decide to challenge the Senator and his beliefs by making it all public in Murrow's own talk show. A stubborn, yet a very clever exposé done.<br/><br/>One thing that probably makes this movie stand out the most is the casting. There's honestly all the right actors for the right roles and it gives the movie more of this feeling of it being so real. That said, the film is overall more like a documentary acted out than an actual movie. One hell of a good documentary though. What comes to role performances, there's really one man that stands out the most and he is an actor named David Strathairn who plays the role of Edward R. Murrow. As I am myself in a young age, I can't remember how Mr. Murrow actually was like, but what I've heard I think Strathairn is almost the perfect mirror image of Murrow. And I must say he does some really fine job, well worth Academy Award Nomination. There's just something so powerful in his voice that it just makes the character feel so real and every word spoken by Strathairn is there for a reason, every word has its own purpose. Magnificent role performance indeed.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by George Clooney, who also co-stars in the movie as the producer Fred Friendly. His role performance is also great and he just fits for the role, but it's still nothing near Strathairn's performance. This movie is a very good example of the fact that Clooney can also direct, as the directing really is good along the whole cinematography. I'd say it was a pretty bold choice to shoot the movie totally in black and white, but it does fit very well if you ask me. It captures the real essence of the 1950's and makes it also a bit darker, as it really was a dark period back then. Nicely done. The screenplay is well written, overall the movie has a pretty good flow and it progresses itself in a nice tempo. I wouldn't say there is so much nonsense, because as far as I can see it, every scene does its justice by being there which also makes the movie a bit short. Everything is over in just 1 hour and slightly over 20 minutes. The lenght it good though, as if there had been more stuff it may had caused the movie to be a bit boring.<br/><br/>For me as a Finnish person and as a person at my 20's, it's pretty obvious that I can't remember anything from the 1950's and the whole fear of communism at the US. That's why the movie is also a bit hard for me to understand, though I know a few things here and there. I would have hoped the movie to be more emotional, as now it just comes and goes without waking up some real emotions in me. A pity, as the movie is good, but it would have been much better that way. Clooney could have dramatized some situations, but it may have made the movie too cliché though. But as it is a historical event and more importantly an important historical event, it could have been an emotional-packed-ride. Like I mentioned before; As the way the movie is now, it does feel more like a documentary. Overall it's a nice movie despite this negative feedback, so I can recommend it to everyone. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well worth watching, especially if you're interested in that specific period of time and how all the people working around it reacted to Murrow's ""statements"" and how people were scared. Above a decent movie, nice one indeed."

","i just watched good night,and good luck,which is about CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and his fight against senator Joseph McCarthy, a junior senator from Wisconsin,during the 1950's.this was a time of hysteria regarding communists and communist sympathizers in America and anyone else who may have had dealings with them.it was basically a time where anyone who was deemed a threat to national security was targeted by senator McCarthy and others in hearings held against them.many of these people lost their jobs or worse based on little or no evidence against them.that is the premise of the movie good night and good luck.it is based on a true story,but you have to take it with a grain of salt as it is biased on the side of Edward R. Murrow and other people who share his view and opinions.obviously it is slanted towards the view of the people who made the film.so you really have to make up your own mind about how accurate it might or might not be.however,as simply a movie,it is very entertaining,with great performances all around from an ensemble cast.it is well directed and shooting it in black and white was very effective.at times however,it was preachy,which was annoying,and i'm still not sure why Murrow ended each broadcast with the words""good night and good luck"" and i found that a bit annoying.i would have liked the filmmakers to give an explanation for those words,maybe show the genesis behind them and give them more meaning,put them into context.i'm not saying whether the movie was accurate or not,and can only rate it for it's entertainment value as well as its technical merit.overall,the film was well made, with a good eye for detail of the era,and it had a very authentic feel about it.it was well paced with crisp dialogue and for a drama it was better done than many films of the genre.it was at times engaging,yet not quite riveting.the only other complaint i have is that it could have had more substance and been a bit more in-depth.otherwise,i enjoyed it. 6*"

","Having been very disappointed by Syriana, I was looking forward to my faith in Mr Clooney being restored. To a certain degree, it was, but I was still left with the feeling that this could have been a wasted opportunity. Goodnight & Goodluck has an intriguing story, excellent cast (though Clooney and Robert Downey Jr are somewhat wasted in supporting roles) and the black and white cinematography works well. Some of the key scenes, however, lack genuine tension. Unfortunately, the sparks fail to fly; there is little drama,few really memorable scenes and a rather lacklustre ending. Overall, an admirable film but hardly a classic."
"sarcy_stuch","9","2","3","23 February 2006"," Where are the Murrows of Today?
","I sometimes wish I had a typewriter, the tap, tap, tap is quite probably a lot more satisfying than the quiet click of laptop keys. I often wish I, instead of the occasionally annoying gum, had a cigarette in my mouth as I type these endless rants about nothing at all. The smoke slowly curling up towards my ceiling as I screw up another piece of paper and throw it into the bin. My tie would be slackened and my sleeves rolled up to the elbows, the once neatly combed and side-parted hair now flopping down over my forehead. And of course, such clichéd goings on could only be portrayed in the magic of monochromatic film.<br/><br/>Myself and Ed Murrow seem to share few things in common. For one thing, we share a hair cut, albeit that I have substantially more on top than he did. The 50s side-parted, slicked back hair is (wrongly) overlooked nowadays. I think I was born in the wrong era. But we also share a deep disgust and frustration at the way in which television and other medias are used to ""distract, delude, amuse and insulate us"". It is even more disturbing that after such a man had existed, nothing has changed. He was listened to and then instantly forgotten by the masses, as if his words and ideologies no longer existed after the television was switched off.<br/><br/>It is hard to connect with Murrow on any other kind of level, which shows the skill of Clooney's script, keeping characterisation to a bare minimum as far as Murrow is concerned. Leaving as more of a mysterious character - as all heroes should be. We watch him take on McCarthy for no other reason than to expose what is going on within the country that breaks some of its people's basic rights. We don't need to know about his home life and other such things that could have led this film down the wrong path of biopic.<br/><br/>All that was needed from this film was the newsroom and what went on within. And that is what Clooney gives us, and with some skill it must be said. The script is snappy and witty, without slipping into comedy territory and tells us everything we need to know, without basically re-telling the audience what it going on. The cinematography perfectly captures the the hectic nature of a newsroom, contrasting well with the slow panning and wide-framing of anything outside.<br/><br/>If Clooney's debut (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) was something of a self-conscious affair, Good Night, And Good Luck overcomes this. Sure, it's very idealogical and a little less than subtle in how its message resonates today, but that's point. Sometimes we need someone to slap us across the face to wake us up."

"mppullar","10","2","3","4 February 2006"," Truly incredible movie-making
","I must admit, I've been quite a bit of a fan of George Clooney for some years now, dating, I think, back to when I first saw him in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"". I can't remember if I'd seen him in anything before then, but I couldn't resist his charisma and comic timing in that movie, qualities that I then went on to appreciate in films like ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and even ""Three Kings"". Clooney was, I realised, a film-star in the Classical Hollywood sense - dynamic, entertaining, vibrant, witty, sickeningly good-looking (I'm sure I'll never be able to look that good when I'M grey) - a truly energetic screen-presence. When he made his directorial debut in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", we saw glimpses of something deeper, and his working relationship with Steven Soderbergh began to evolve, seeing the two co-producing numerous movies, some innovative and intelligent, others just generally enjoyable. They also made ""Solaris"" and ""Ocean's Twelve"" together, two movies which couldn't be less alike if they tried. Anyone that saw ""Solaris"" (all three of us) would have noticed that there was a strange evolution happening. Clooney was becoming a bit more brooding, a bit more fragile, a bit like the change in Fred Astaire from ""Shall We Dance"" to ""On The Beach"". The man had some deep thoughts going on in that prematurely grey head, and as self-deprecating as he continued to be in the press (one of his most admirable qualities), he was starting to suggest that he was more than we had thought.<br/><br/>And now we have ""Good Night and Good Luck"", a film that would be a masterpiece from anyone, but is all the more precious, all the more rewarding, for knowing where it came from. The man who was first noticed on our movie screens as the third Batman has now emerged as a bona-fide artist, as an actor, director, and, for the first time, screenwriter, and has four Oscar nominations to show for it (sadly, no acting nomination for his beautiful performance here as Fred Friendly, but I'm going to have to check out ""Syriana"" when it comes out in Australia to see the performance that earned him a Golden Globe and will hopefully win him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). This is a stunning movie - beautifully filmed, scripted, paced, performed. All actors involved give their all - and what a cast to see giving their all! Patricia Clarkson is, naturally, a standout, as is the often hard-done-by Robert Downey Jr, and Ray Wise, who I remember fondly as Leland Palmer from his ""Twin Peaks"" days, gives a performance that will threaten to bring tears to even the most hardened viewer's eyes.<br/><br/>But this is not just an amazing work of art. If it was just a beautifully filmed, acted and scripted movie with an intriguing story, brilliantly told, it would still deserve to make every ""Best of 2005"" list, but this not just a brilliant movie - it is an important movie, and, thank heavens, one that is confident enough in its importance not to feel the need to become an Important Movie. Clooney has a message, but he doesn't bludgeon us with it, or declare too loudly that he needs to be heard. He speaks softly, and earnestly, and eloquently, and is thus heard for the merits of what he says and how he says it. His message is that of his hero, Ed Murrow, a message that was relevant in the 1950s, and is just as relevant today, if not more - a message about the responsibility of the media to communicate truth, to challenge the status quo, to give the public the information they deserve, even if it isn't the information they want. It is a message that lies at the heart of democracy, a philosophy that all western societies currently feign adherence to, although failing to realise that, without free and reliable information being distributed to the people, the people themselves cannot make informed decisions as to how they should be governed. So long as they are lied to, and encouraged to think as little as possible, they can never know what is right, or know how well they are being governed - and this is the message that Clooney and company declare loud and clear. The truth must always be told, and each side of every story must receive a fair and equal hearing, for the sake of the truth, for the sake of liberty. What a message to be declared in 2005, and what a spectacular job Clooney does of declaring it - with humility, intelligence, caution, clarity and heart.<br/><br/>Everyone - I repeat, everyone - should see ""Good Night and Good Luck"". This is a movie of compassion, intelligence, grace, craftsmanship and significance the likes of which I have not seen in a long time. To be completely honest, I don't think a movie of this level of importance has been made in my lifetime, and I've had a few months since seeing the movie to confirm that I still feel this way. This film has the urgency and poise of a film like Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or Kramer's ""On the Beach"" - a film that demands to be listened to, and heard. Everything about this movie works, and everything about it is brilliant. I wish there was a way of conveying that, when I give this film 10 out of 10, I would even like it to be placed above almost any other film to which I would assign that rating. Numbers are not enough to communicate how incredible it is, nor are words.<br/><br/>Mr Clooney, thankyou."

","I was only three when the events of the movie took place. I was enjoying my youth before starting my journey of 13 years of Catholic education with kindergarten looming on the horizon. Obviously, I wasn't aware of the Red Scare that Tailgunner Joe used to his advantage before he was brought down by Morrow and others.<br/><br/>Now, don't go to this movie expecting historical accuracy. Morrow himself admits that he was late in the game and there were many others that went after Joe McCarthy before he did. That is not important, as this is the story of a small group that set out to change the world and, as Margaret Mead said, that's the only way things get changed.<br/><br/>You can bone up on your McCarthy and Morrow history, or you can simply go to enjoy the movie. Good Night and Good Luck stands on its own as entertainment, and it is definitely the best film I have seen this year (Crash is number 2).<br/><br/>David Strathairn as Edward R. Morrow gives a performance that will be hard to top as qualifications for the Oscars hits full throttle. I have to admit that I hadn't seen him since L.A. Confidential. I'm going to have to catch up on some of the other movies he has done. I guess I could look for him when Heaven's Fall comes out - he plays the Judge in the trial of the ""Scottsboro Boys."" I am certainly going to stop by the video store to see if the have a copy of Twisted. I don't know how I missed that as I love Ashley Judd and Samuel L. Jackson. It should be great.<br/><br/>It is interesting to watch history and the Red Scare and the right-wing Senator who used it to his advantage. It is interesting because that same right-wing and their Red States are using the same tactics today. The blow-hards of the right - Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh, and O'Reilly, among others - are branding anyone who doesn't agree with the government as traitors, just as they were branded communists in the 50s. Fortunately, they can't get away with it today as the blogoshphere keeps them honest - but they don't keep trying! One last and funny thing about the movie. Man, do they smoke! It seems that everyone had a cig going at all times. I haven't seen so much smoking in the movies since JFK.<br/><br/>Like the name of Morrow's show, you have to See It Now."

","The Oscars awarding Crash best picture of Brokeback Mountain is explainable. One only has to realize that homophobia is still omnipresent throughout society as well as the Academy's taste tending to favor urban stories and the event is understandable. But trying to explain how Crash *also* beat out this great film is a loss.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is very sexy. On every single level it is an extremely well considered thriller and civic engagement piece. Murrow's fight with McCarthy is rendered with precision and the screenplay does a great job of balancing the various needs of a story. It avoids lionizing Murrow (it contains a few criticism of him in fact) while demonstrating the the great service he did to this country. There is deft touch to the writing that manages to be completely factual while containing barbs at the correct targets. The way in which Strathairn renders *junior* senator icy disdain is a good example of this. But the script is the least of it.<br/><br/>This film is just effortlessly cinematic and atmospheric containing the whole of the red scare in a few black and white frames. It has a fevered quality to the visual construction that not only makes the history come alive but creates a wonderful engaging mood. It should have won cinematography at the Oscars for its lyrical inky images-the cigarette smoke alone pregnant with meaning. Add in spartan art direction and the classical direction and this is a period piece that simply lives.<br/><br/>I adore this film. So glad I re-watched it the other day."
"richard-1787","10","1","1","15 July 2019"," One very powerful movie
","I first saw this movie when it came out in 2005, and was deeply moved and impressed by it. I've seen it a few times since. I decided to watch it again tonight because I had just finished reading David A. Nichols' book *Ike and McCarthy: Dwight Eisenhower's Secret Campaign Against Joseph McCarthy*. (It's a well-documented book, and interesting, but it overstates its argument.)<br/><br/>There is a lot to like here. It didn't get six Academy Award nominations for nothing. (Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a great performance as Truman Capote in that movie, but I still don't understand why David Strathairn didn't win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Edward R. Murrow here.) The script is first-rate, the acting and direction wonderful, the black-and-white look perfect. Even though nothing was a surprise to me, having just read Nichols' book, I found it very suspenseful.<br/><br/>This time around, however, I was left with a few questions, comments:<br/><br/>1) Focusing the first part of the movie on Murrow's treatment of the Rodulovitch case doesn't prepare the audience for Murrow's subsequent attack on McCarthy. If anything, it diverts us into thinking that Murrow is angry with the military, which is not the case. It's a shame we weren't given examples of what McCarthy was up to and why Murrow disliked him so.<br/><br/>2) Even for someone like myself who has studied this period in American history, it's not always easy to figure out who some of the characters are and what they were up to at the time. That might have been handled better if the movie had been screened while in progress for a young audience who didn't know who these people and issues were. Then the script could have been adjusted, or something like that.<br/><br/>Still, this is one hell of a good movie, and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in 20th century American history or, more broadly, the role of the media in defending our freedoms."
"ncruz-77996","10","1","1","27 June 2019"," This Film Deserves A Higher Rating
","Intro:
Good Night, and Good Luck is simple a masterpiece, comparable to Citizen Kane. An accurate retelling of the story of Edward R. Murrow. And it's more than deserving of a rating higher than measly 7.5/10.<br/><br/>The Story:
Telling the story of broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow, and how he seeked to bring down Joseph McCarthy. This film really knows how to bring you into the time period, with the use of black and white (which will go more in depth to later). But mostly the way it's written, taking inspiration from old 50's and 60's films, and presenting itself like a film from that era.<br/><br/>And the film also presents the question, how far can you take journalism? As the Murrow doesn't just say what's going on, but he also presents his thoughts on it, and claims that McCarthy's ways are wrong. Telling the United States government to tell him otherwise. Almost like a sort of war, between him and U.S. government. As both sides present what they think is right the American people.
Another thing to really praise is the dialogue, it's straight to point about the issues, and presented to us like it was from an old 50's film. Again, really bringing the audience into the time period.<br/><br/>It's this so called war in the film, is all done with words. Arguing for or against each others ideals. Crafting a great film about standing up for what you believe in, and not being afraid to stand up for it. At the same time, very little is made up, it was all real. And that's what for me, makes or breaks a historical film, or biography.<br/><br/>It's truly a film rich with atmosphere, interesting characters, and interesting dialogue. And truly, a film with a great story.<br/><br/>The Characters:
Like I said before, very little is made up. So, the characters are all adapted perfectly from their real life counterparts. And along with that, good performances in the mix. It's amazing how this film presents Murrow, as some of the stuff he says about McCarthy is almost unbelievable. Such as, calling him, ""Leader of the jackals."" It's simply insane some of the stuff they could say back then.<br/><br/>And the same really goes for the supporting characters.<br/><br/>The Visual Style:
As I mentioned before, this's filmed in black and white. And it crafts an interesting and outstanding visual style. Really making it feel like an old film from the mid 20th Century. And as someone who likes black and white films, and if I made a film, it would probably be in black and white, I can appreciate this movie's use of this technique. In my opinion, a very underrated technique, that allows a movie to stand out.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
All I have to say, is thank you. I thank the people that made this movie, for crafting a piece of truly amazing art. And I will always come back to this film, because it's a movie that inspires me, and if I made a movie, (something I wanna do), I would take inspiration from this movie, as well as some others, but they can the spotlight in some other review. So to end this review, watch the film, it might change you like it changed me."

","Good use of video

""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is an exceptional film and much of it is because we too often forget our history...and as a result don't learn from it. It's an excellent history lesson. My only complaint is that the context for the Red Scare and McCarthyism is missing...and I would have appreciated it had it been included or even mentioned. While nearly everyone attacked for communist sympathies during this era were decent people, there were some things that gave reason for the concerns about communism. Stalin was behaving very threatening...decided to keep all of Eastern Europe following WWII and developing his own atomic bomb. But, and this is important, this does not in any way justify folks losing due process and their constitutional rights because of these fears...and the 1950s were a time of intense fear of the USSR. For folks unfamiliar with the era, this missing context might make the film a bit confusing. Despite this, the movie is a very important lesson..though the context might have been appreciated by retired history teachers, like myself!<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, the film is ABOUT Senator Joseph McCarthy but instead of focusing directly on him, you only see stock footage of him making his anti-communism tirades in Congress. Instead, the film centers on Edward R. Murrow and CBS's investigation of McCarthy and his methods...an interesting choice and one that makes the film quite clever.<br/><br/>
David Strathairn is excellent as Murrow and the director/writer/actor George Clooney did a nice job in capturing the feel of the time. Everyone is smoking heavily...which is what folks did back then. Heck, that's what ended up killing Murrow...a three-pack a day man himself! It was also smart to make the picture in black & white--as it not only captured the look of the time (when most everything was in black & white) but helped to make the McCarthy clips seem more real and less jarring. Overall, an exceptionally well made film...one well worth your time."
"billcr12","7","1","1","13 December 2015"," Solid Drama
","George Clooney directed and also stars as Fred Friendly, who was Edward R Murrow's boss during the red scare days in the 1950's. This is well known material well told by Clooney and featuring David Strathairn as the chain smoking news man. The entire film is in black and white, giving it the look of a documentary of the time period. Real footage of Senator McCarthy is used with the intended chilling effect. Murrow is shown sitting at a manual typewriter actually composing his own material for the CBS broadcast. The past equivalent of Fox News; at that time in the print newspaper media, presented a vicious attack on Murrow and anyone attacking Senator McCarthy. History, of course, has proved Murrow courageous and correct for his fight against McCarthy. The movie is only 94 minutes and is a bit fast paced and frenetic, but it is well worth watching."
"pottergurl4457","7","1","1","13 November 2015"," Beautiful but boring
","My succinct review with no plot summary because I don't feel like putting in a whole lot of effort: Good Night, and Good Luck is definitely a well-made film. Cinematically, it is truly beautiful. The way Clooney manipulates lighting with the black and white creates some great images. That being said, I thought I would really enjoy this movie for 2 reasons. First: I love American history, especially the mid-century. Second: I am a journalism major. While really not a bad movie, I found myself dreadfully bored while watching.... it just didn't live up to my expectations. Do I regret watching it? No, but I didn't particularly enjoy the plot and the way the story was told."
"StoryCharts","5","1","1","20 July 2013"," Civil liberties must be defended at all cost
","Good Night and Good Luck uses two plots to try to prove the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost. One plot is a reporter's external quest to defeat Mccarthyism: the violation of civil liberties in the name of national security. This plot succeeds: Mccarthyism is defeated. The second plot is the external quest representing the reporter's career and well being. This plot ends in a failure. So the movie tries to demonstrate the idea that civil liberties must be defended at all cost by showing that the successful defense of civil liberties cost our heroes their jobs, careers, and even their lives.<br/><br/>This idea is a timely one for us: today the world is captivated by the tales of Edward Snowden: an ex-CIA worker who has given up his career and possibly his life to reveal massive violations of the civil liberties of all Americans by their government. As of now, we don't know how this story ends. We don't know if the cost of his sacrifice was enough to earn a ""success"" of protecting our civil liberties. What we do know is that the US government, and much of the public, believe that it is necessary to give up certain civil liberties in the name of national security. What this movie tries to demonstrate is that the US Constitution is built upon the idea that basic freedoms cannot be compromised at all, and that they must be defended to the death. As our hero says:<br/><br/>""We can deny our heritage and our history but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. We proclaim ourselves as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the Junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his, he didn't create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it, and rather successfully. Cassius was right, the fault dear Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Good night, and good luck.""<br/><br/>So the movie picked a very important idea to prove. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a very good job of proving it. <br/><br/>The plot depicting the cost of our heroes is bland. There are no uplifting turning points on this plot. The heroes lose money, security, their jobs, the lives and their careers in a steady drumbeat of bad news. Because there are no twists and turns along the ride of this plot, the costs seem episodic and didactic. This makes the heroes seem flat and unreasonably ""good"" as they continue their march against the villains irregardless of casualties and consequence. Basically there aren't enough twists here to keep the story interesting. None of the heroes undergo internal arcs (they are all conscientious from start to end) and none of them undergo relationship arcs (they are all in it together from beginning to end, even a married couple who were forced to split up).<br/><br/>This make the film seem didactic: it is a series of self righteous speeches by our heroes against the villains and we are asked to watch the movie with the hindsight of history to see their actions in the proper moral light.<br/><br/>Ironically, the Snowden story playing out today has more interesting twists and drama than Good Night and Good Luck:<br/><br/><ul><li>we don't yet know if Snowden will be successful in convincing the American people to defend their own freedoms. - Snowden has obviously acknowledged and accepted the costs to his career and possibly his life. - Snowden's internal ideals are tested enormously now: he has ironically sought political asylum from countries that have horrendous human rights track records as compared to the USA. This has already compromised his public reputation and may affect the outcome of his external quest as he could become an international political pawn.</li></ul><br/><br/>President Obama has even acknowledged in a condescending manner that the Snowden story might make a ""TV movie"" someday as he tries to convince the American people that civil liberties must be ""balanced"" with national security. Depending on how Snowden's internal struggles and his external quest turn out, his story just might prove the idea that civil liberties cannot be compromised at all and must be defended to the death.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"

He calls for television instead to educate, provoke and expose the world for its flaws, ugly or boring as they may be.<br/><br/>""Good night, and good luck"" does exactly what Murrow prescribes. The movie itself is not what I'd call entertaining. Definitely not like Oceans 11, 12, 13 or any of the other blockbuster hits of recent years. Instead it's a fascinating, enlightening and sobering history lesson which is particularly important to re-visit today.<br/><br/>Director George Clooney takes us on a powerful ride through a world where the government has total, unquestionable control over the fates of individuals, and those who speak out against it do so at their own risk. Sounds like some Orwellian dystopia? Well it really happened in the US of A, barely 50 years ago. And it may be happening again.<br/><br/>That's all I'll say as far as socio-political commentary. After all we're here to talk movies. And what a movie this is. While I can't say it's a crowd pleaser, I think it's masterfully crafted with excellent dialogue, effective camera angles & movements that add to the tension, and great acting all around. The whole movie is in b&w but it's not just a gimmick. Not only does it transport us back to the time period (mid 1950s), but it allows for the smooth blending of actual stock footage from the McCarthy hearings. Apparently the blending was so smooth that initially some people criticized the ""actor"" playing Sen McCarthy as being too over-the-top. Haha, it's the real dude, folks.<br/><br/>I watched this movie without knowing who directed it, and for a long time I could've sworn it was Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"", ""Solaris"", and particularly ""The Informant!"") with its meticulous, clean shots. Not much of a surprise to learn that it was Clooney who has starred in half a dozen Soderbergh films, his likely protégé.<br/><br/>The music can only be described as ""cool"", featuring a jazz combo and the talented singing of Dianne Reeves who, in a surreal studio fly-by, is shown performing on the CBS soundstage, putting the music in a nice perspective.<br/><br/>If you like strong historical films, particularly focusing on scandals or underdogs of 20th century America like ""Quiz Show"", ""Tucker"", ""The Hoax"", or the aforementioned ""The Informant!"" then don't hesitate to check this out. It's probably the most tense & claustrophobic of the bunch, strangely reminding me of ""Das Boot"" (a 5-hr film about a bunch of Nazis stuck in a submarine). Maybe the b&w presentation had me fooled, but I was also reminded of the b&w masterpieces ""Citizen Kane"" (about the questionable success of a very William R Hearst-like character) and maybe even ""Dr. Strangelove"" (a dark satire about the atomic bomb and America's postwar paranoia).<br/><br/>There aren't any car chases, shootouts, damsels in distress, romantic hook ups, nude scenes, blood & guts, swearing or big laughs in this film. It's rated PG, but the irony is I can't imagine too many teenagers wanting to see it. Nonetheless, it's a well-made, dramatic, important film and a dose of medicine I recommend to everyone."

","Good Night, and Good Luck. is a drama that portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti- Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.It stars David Strathairn and George Clooney together with Robert Downey, Jr.,Patricia Clarkson,Frank Langella,Jeff Daniels, Tate Donovan and Alex Borstein.The movie, although released in black and white, was filmed on color film stock but on a gray-scale set, and was color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when the media offers a voice of dissent against the government.It was also directed by its lead star,George Clooney and the screenplay was written also by Clooney and Grant Heslov.<br/><br/>In 1953, Edward R. Murrow was one of the best-known newsmen on television as host of both the talk show Person to Person and the pioneering investigate series See It Now. Joseph McCarthy, a U.S. senator from Wisconsin, was generating no small amount of controversy in the public and private sectors with his allegations that Communists had risen to positions of power and influence in America, and an Air Force pilot, Milo Radulovich, had been drummed out of the service due to McCarthy's charges that he was a Communist agent. However, Radulovich had been dismissed without a formal hearing of the charges, and he protested that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. Murrow decided to do a story on Radulovich's case questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal, which was seen by McCarthy and his supporters as an open challenge to his campaign. McCarthy responded by accusing Murrow of being a Communist, leading to a legendary installment of See It Now in which both Murrow and McCarthy presented their sides of the story, which was seen by many as the first step toward McCarthy's downfall. Meanwhile, Murrow had to deal with CBS head William Paley, who was supportive of Murrow but extremely wary of his controversial positions, while Murrow was also trying to support fellow newsman Don Hollenbeck, battling charges against his own political views, and working alongside Fred Friendly, the daring head of CBS News.<br/><br/>This is a film that will live on for years, because it bears a message about dissension, and the power of the press.Also,it still proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending for it is an excellent film that uses the past to make today's media and their audiences address their responsibilities.Aside from that,it is a passionate and concise civics lesson from the past, arriving with much political and cultural relevance to today.Finally,the film imparts a cautionary tale: Don't let anyone else do your thinking for you."
"dimplet","8","1","1","28 June 2011"," It is what it is
","Good Night and Good Luck seems more like a re-enactment of key ""See It Now"" broadcasts than a movie. In doing so, George Clooney has performed a public service, helping to bring the history of that era alive to a new generation, and generations to come. But those totally unfamiliar with the period will need to read up on Sen. Joseph McCarthy and Edward R. Murrow to better understand the events. <br/><br/>The Murrow broadcasts were before my time, but there was an old book I treasured that had the transcripts of the key programs along with photos. Perhaps the most memorable was the Milo Radulovich episode. That could have been any of us being accused unfairly, and defended by Murrow.<br/><br/>America would be a different place today, had it not been for Edward R. Murrow. But it is not different enough. Each generation needs a new Murrow to defend the truth. And we have had them, thanks in part to the talented journalists Murrow hired, beginning in the 1930s for CBS radio, and later for the CBS television network. (See the Murrow's Boys entry in Wikipedia.) That is the larger impact Murrow had, untold here. <br/><br/>Perhaps what is needed is a fuller biography on film of Murrow, going back to his time as a war correspondent in London, reporting live by radio to the United States, microphone in hand, from the roofs of buildings as bombs fell around him before America entered the war, continuing through to the early days of television in 1948, Murrow's first live coast to coast broadcast, and television's rapid maturation as a medium of entertainment in the 1950s, ending with the famous 1960 Harvest of Shame program. <br/><br/>It is tempting to editorialize about the message this film has for our time, but that is unnecessary. It is what it is. Either you see it, or you don't. Sometimes simple objectivity is more powerful than preaching. I sat in silence when the film was over, and almost felt like crying. <br/><br/>I was not in a hurry to see this film because I already knew so much about Murrow and the surrounding events. The film seems to have gotten everything right, especially the ethos of the era. <br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it is too short. I think there should have been more discussion about the making of the episodes to give more context. They had time to show more of the actual Murrow episodes. If there is enough good stuff on the cutting room floor, perhaps there could be a longer director's edition. <br/><br/>It is always interesting to see an actor playing a real person, and succeeding. David Strathairn seems to have gotten inside Murrow's head and recreated his inner character. He also gets the pace, tone and intensity of his voice right. <br/><br/>Murrow was a chain smoker, had a cancerous lung removed, and died of lung cancer in 1965. Eric Sevareid said, ""He was a shooting star; and we will live in his afterglow a very long time."""

","You can see the great pains this film took to tell a story about the most important moment in media journalism in this country, and then the unfortunate consequences of that moment. Edward R. Murrow achieved greatness by using the truth to bring down Joe McCarthy. Murrow used Joe against himself. He did it with honestly & integrity, which sadly were missing from media journalism almost since this happened. The film shows the hard work behind getting the truth & the pains involved in telling the truth. It shows that truth does not get rewarded in this type of work. It proves how hard truth is to get. The acting is perfect, the telling of the tale is perfect though a bit static, definitely not for the action picture crowd. The ending surprised me in how well it tells to truth. This will spoil it for you but at the end of all this, William Paley, head of CBS, calls Murrow into his office with the ultimate good news-bad news agenda. The good news is Ed that you show is now going to be an hour instead of 30 minutes. The bad news is, your show is moving from prime time to Sunday afternoons, effectively killing your show. This shows how much power & influence government & corporations already had on the media in 1954. Murrow later quit CBS in disgust before he died. It proves that the media has not been accurate since then. To prove this, a quote from Dan Rather in the 1960's on seeing the home movie of John Kennedy being killed - ""Kennedy jerked forward when he was shot in the head."" Rather was the only pool media reporter allowed to see that film, and when he filed one of his journals just before he retired from the CBS EVENING NEWS- he aired it again, word for word. For a film which can make you think, Good Luck, because the media will never ever get back to 1954, to telling the truth the way Murrow had the guts to do."
"jackjack-2","10","1","1","11 April 2006"," A timely and accurate commentary
","Many will accuse George Clooney of using this film as a statement of his left wing views. But as a person who lived through the McCarthy era, I found the movie not only to be very faithful to the actual events, but startlingly timely in relation what is happening presently. While the movie is outstanding, it does not really bring out how bad McCarthyism was. It only hints at it and viewers unfamiliar with how radical the anti-communists were between the end of World War II and 1954 will never fully understand or appreciate the story this movie tells.<br/><br/>What happened during the McCarthy period is of particular interest to Hollywood because so many in the film industry suffered as a result of McCarthyism in that for many years they were barred from the industry as a result either of their association with communist movements or because out of principle they refused to rat on their fellow members.<br/><br/>It is not that I was a liberal or even a leftist during this period. I was a staunch anti-communist and a veteran of two combat tours in Korea. However, I was never afflicted with the paranoia that gripped America after WWII. I never saw American communists as a threat and I was well aware that many of those that associated with the communists prior to 1946, particularly during the Great Depression, did so out of a mistaken idealism, and that almost all disassociated themselves with communism after the Iron Curtain fell over Europe when the utter brutality of the Soviet regime and its failures became obvious. Almost all of those tarnished during the McCarthy era were very loyal Americans and it troubled me greatly at the time that the America I was fighting for could be so cruel to them.<br/><br/>This movie is about Edward R. Morrow, who had the guts to stand up against McCarthy, and until recently I have always been a fan of CBS News for showing the way. But in firing Dan Rather CBS yield to the extreme right and it has lost the way. It is no longer the network Morrow made it to be. Fox News and radical right talk show hosts now are the McCarthys of the 21st Century and people like Bill O'Reilly and his ilk are today's McCarthys. If you watch or listen to these McCarthy disciples they follow his precept of constantly attacking the press as ""liberal"" or ""far left"" just as McCarthy and his contemporaries attacked any newsman who dared challenge McCarthy. An example was depicted in the movie when CBS news analyst Don Hollenbeck committed suicide because of the attacks on him."

","I was a small boy in the rural south when Edward R. Murrow was doing his best TV work in the 1950s. I can't say that I really remember him, because we didn't have a TV during most of that time. But I do have a feel for that period and this movie, filmed in B&W, is an excellent representation of that period.<br/><br/>Murrow made many important contributions to the art of journalism, but this movie focuses on one of them, the work to expose Joseph McCarthy for the mean-spirited person he really was, conducting Communism witch hunts and lying often to do so. The extent of Murrow's investigation and reporting resulted in McCarthy's censure, and he died, literally drinking himself to death, only a few years after the period represented in this movie.<br/><br/>David Strathairn is good as Edward R. Murrow, and was nominated for Best Actor. Robert Downey Jr. was Joe Wershba, Patricia Clarkson was his wife, Shirley Wershba, although married couples were not supposed to be working together at CBS. Frank Langella was William Paley, Murrow's boss at CBS. Jeff Daniels was Sig Mickelson, and George Clooney, who also directed and co-wrote, was Murrow's key associate, Fred Friendly . The movie makes ample use of old footage showing McCarthy and some of the hearings in Washington.<br/><br/>Good movie, and is a ""must see"" for anyone wanting to understand more about the political and news climate of the 1950s."

","Two newsrooms preserved in black and white 60 years apart; two men who enjoyed power - albeit one considerably more than the other - who both thought it gave them the divine right to manipulate public opinion; two exceptional ensemble acting teams. I doubt very much whether George Clooney knowingly set out to replicate aspects of Citizen Kane and I doubt even more that he'd wish to invite comparison between his own fine film and Welles's masterpiece but the parallels are there as noted. One of Clooney's problems is going to be that he is portraying events of half a century ago so that the people on whom they had most impact will be, by definition, now in their seventies or older, nevertheless this is a splendid effort at capturing a particular social climate and it's probable that the one glaring error - though originally written as a ballad in the thirties by the late forties/early fifties How High The Moon had become a 'bop' anthem and was invariably performed at breakneck speed yet here Clooney slows it right down to one half-tone above a dirge - was deliberate, a metaphor for times that were out of joint. Apart from Strathairn who turns in a monumental performance acting honours were a consistently high standard and divided evenly among the whole ensemble."

The camera angles and close ups were uncomfortable, whether intentionally or not I don't know. Found myself much more informed about the complexions of the actors than I really wanted. I went with someone who knew virtually nothing about Murrow, and very little about the era, and he was totally confused. Clooney might have wanted to consider giving the viewers a bit more context. Not necessarily a straight narrative, but just some help here and there. As always, Robert Downey Jr was mesmerizing."

","An interesting movie - documentary, really - which describes the hysteria permeating Cold War America. Senator McCarthy, for all his shortfalls, turned out to be the villain after all was said and done, although his intentions did not seem unreasonable. As many liberals place intentions high on the courage meter, this should at least warrant a ""nice try"" for McCarthy.<br/><br/>Of course, it didn't, and now we have this movie to re-open that sad episode, which shall be numbered in the countless episodes where our Government has come a little too far through the front door of our homes.<br/><br/>Director George Clooney is capable and the movie has a comfortable flow through the story. But from a historical perspective, Murrow was simply one out of many who were clamoring to get a piece of McCarthy. Indeed, if Clooney had checked a bit more, he'd have realized that journalists Elmer Davis and Martin Agronsky were reporting about McCarthy's tactics long before Murrow. Murrow himself has admitted that he had very little to do with McCarthy's fall.<br/><br/>Despite the left-leaning storyline, the acting was sublime. There were too many individual contributions to note, but certainly Oscar-caliber performances.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the black-and-white format which rubbed me a little bit. Also, I think that if you were around before color, and forced to watch everything in black-and-white, then you shouldn't be submitted to it again. I'm done with monochrome, no matter what the topic.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie played too much like an editorial documentary. Way too many inferences and speculations about what really happened. And I can't see why that would be, when you've so many references straight from the original characters to solicit.<br/><br/>If you're a conservative like me, it can be entertaining.

","Every once in a while, a character actor who has made a living popping up here and there in mostly unmemorable roles, is cast in a film and does such an amazing job that everyone starts immediately wondering why he or she isn't more famous. However, if you think about it, this sort of makes sense. Character actors don't carry around the baggage of being big-name Hollywood personas; they can entirely sink into a role and not fight audience tendencies to watch them as a celebrity rather than as a character. This works even more to their advantage when they're asked to play real people.<br/><br/>I'm not even that familiar with Edward R. Murrow, the famous American newscaster who waged a media war that eventually brought down Joseph McCarthy, but even if David Strathairn comes nowhere close to accurately impersonating Murrow, he gives a fantastic and intense performance. This movie is a terse, succinct account of the Murrow/McCarthy debates; there's not really a wasted moment or one single superfluous scene or line of dialogue. George Clooney (who deserves much credit for his work as director on the film) plays Fred Friendly, producer at CBS and, as portrayed here, Murrow's chief ally. The chemistry between he and Strathairn is terrific, especially in a scene toward the end of the film when they both have their hands slapped by the head of CBS, played by Frank Langella. Despite the fact that he appears in virtually every scene, and as good as he is, Strathairn does not walk away with the picture; it's a generous lead performance in that he allows every other actor, even in mostly small roles, to shine (Clooney should probably be credited for this as well). Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson play a secretly married couple who work on Murrow's news team. Their storyline might feel unnecessary on a casual viewing, but I thought it brought a nice dose of humanism to the film, and reminded the viewer that the war against McCarthyism was not simply an effort to save careers and professional reputations, but also to save personal and private lives. The movie is so tightly contained and so confined to the world of the news room, that it would be easy not to think of anyone in the film as having actual lives beyond the ones they lead at CBS, and the Clarkson/Downey, Jr. storyline is a clever way to convey that. And let me throw in one last bit of praise for another actor, Jeff Daniels, who in recent years has really impressed me with his versatility, and makes quite an impression in this film in only two or three brief scenes.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is unashamedly one-sided. Clooney obviously has very strong feelings about the role media should play in American culture, and the responsibility news providers should feel in brining the public what they think the public needs, not necessarily what it wants. Given the fact that a recent devastating earthquake in Pakistan has been all but ignored by American media in favor of World Series coverage, I'd say this message has significant relevance. And in the lessons learned by the McCarthy debacle, it's not hard to draw a parallel to the current Bush Administration, and its efforts to label anyone remotely critical of American policy in Iraq as unsupportive of our troops or as unpatriotic, a band wagon on to which too many Americans are jumping for my comfort.<br/><br/>I've not seen as good a film about the American media since ""Network,"" and in some ways I like this movie even more. ""Network"" is satire, effective satire, but satire nonetheless; it never feels exactly real. ""Good Night..."", on the other hand, is remarkable for how authentic it feels; I never felt like I was watching scripted actors, but rather was watching an especially exciting documentary. This is easily one of the ""must see"" films of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","This movie, which is presented in the form of a semi-documentary, is meant to dramatize the showdown between Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954. But, sadly, this movie fails to hit the mark. It's all show and no substance. It promises a lot and delivers little. In short, this movie is pretentious. Edward R. Murrow is portrayed as a nervous, chain-smoking shell of the reporter who was the most famous war correspondent of World War Two. Further, the vaunted showdown between Murrow and McCarthy doesn't happen. They don't even speak to each other. Instead the movie uses old stock footage to vilify Senator McCarthy, yet in much of the footage McCarthy sounds quite reasonable and makes a case for ferreting out subversives in the government. The fact is that in 1954 the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in the Cold War and Soviet agents were operating as spies in the United States. Okay, Senator McCarthy may have accused the wrong people of being Communist subversives, but was his claim of Communist infiltration into the U. S. government so much off the mark? Was there not at least some cause for concern? And by the way, what's with all the chain-smoking in this movie?"
"pizzawarrior1956-1","Null","4","10","26 October 2005"," A great idea for a movie, BUT ....
","Before I begin, I must admit to all of you that I have yet to see this movie.<br/><br/>But as a student of history, especially of the period depicted in this film, one cannot avoid mentioning its potential influence, as well as the protagonists depicted.<br/><br/>Every era has its Murrow and McCarthy.<br/><br/>In our history, we have experienced threats to our civil liberties and there would be those who would come to their defense, and it is good to be reminded of the importance of this struggle.<br/><br/>It would not take a real genius to do a halfway decent job of telling this story, especially if director/producer George Clooney simply sticks to the basics, and I am sure that is exactly what he will accomplish, in spite of the fact that other films (""MURROW"" and ""TAIL GUNNER JOE"") have already dealt with this subject.<br/><br/>Of course, Clooney and Company can't be blamed for allowing their generation to make a statement, and while I hope they will be successful, it would be good that in the telling of this story, THIS TIME, they should delve towards who may be the true villain of the piece--and that is, THE MEDIA !!!!!<br/><br/>This is especially important today with the unprecedented power the 24/7 cable outlets now wield, and the clear potential for idealogical distortion of the news, which in itself is even more dangerous than Communism ever could be.<br/><br/>The fear of Communism existed long before McCarthy, dating back to the 1920's, when some obscure laws and a technicality about WWI not ending until 1921, allowed a Justice Department clerk named J. Edgar Hoover to advise the Attorney General to legally round up and deport a group of anarchists to Soviet Russia, after a series of bombings, including a 9/11 style attack in NYC in 1920.<br/><br/>Newspapers went out of their way to sensationalize crime and scandal, as well as create mythic folk-heroes that to this day evoke fond memories, as well as villains.<br/><br/>In the late 1940's, the hysterical response to spies and Communist sympathizers seeming to infest all walks of American life was once again picked up by those in the media, this time unwittingly helping to create a climate of fear that would start a unstoppable ""feeding frenzy"".<br/><br/>The Alger Hiss case and the Rosenbergs were well covered in the press, mostly in sensational headlines that sold newspapers, making the Communist threat highly profitable as well as being newsworthy.<br/><br/>And with the Russians having the A-bomb and the ensuing threat of WWIII, an unprecedented period of anxiety swept the nation, just waiting for some event to touch off a reaction.<br/><br/>In February, 1950, an obscure U.S. senator named Joseph R. McCarthy made a speech in Wheeling, WV, charging that 205 members of the State Department were 'card-carrying Communists' and a treat to our national security.<br/><br/>Almost immediately, a new media star was born, as the press repeated McCarthy's charges without bothering to investigate their validity, even though his numbers kept changing and McCarthy's own reputation was highly questionable.<br/><br/>With the start of the Korean War, the media seemed to be swept along with all the rest of society, reporting the threat as well as the 'sideshow' behind it.<br/><br/>As it turned out, McCarthy never found any Communists, though he did create the climate that forced people out of their jobs, mostly by superiors fearing for their own situation, not want to appear to be Communist sympathizers themselves.<br/><br/>While some brave souls spoke against this insanity, they would do so to at great risk, losing their livelihoods or even worse.<br/><br/>In short, it was an atmosphere that forced the majority to be silent and not rock the boat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, McCarthy and his ilk soldered on, which would include vicious, right-wing vigilantes who would force liberals out of all walks of life; as well as some strange allies.<br/><br/>Joseph P. Kennedy was an early McCarthy supporter; and Bobby Kennedy actually served on McCarthy's Senate investigating committee as one of the minority counsels !!!! <br/><br/>Then came Edward R. Murrow, a journalist who worked with the BBC during the war, free from commercial influences and with the support of CBS, would broadcast a series of reports that finally responded to the McCarthy threat in 1954.<br/><br/>While it is true that Murrow got in some good licks at McCarthy's expense, the Senator's eventual downfall later that year during the Army-McCarthy hearings was really his own doing.<br/><br/>It was his performance on TV, as well as his heavy-handed tactics and bullying that finally damned him for what he was; and while Murrow deserves much creditfor this, the names of Army counsel Joseph Welch, and Missouri Senator Stuart Symington need to be mentioned also for allowing McCarthy to hang himself.<br/><br/>It is important then that we understand that things like McCarthyism cannot flourish without the unwitting cooperation of others, especially those who are supposed to be the guardians of our freedom, such as the media.<br/><br/>After all, the press is the only organization granted special protection under the First Amendment, other than religion, and those in the media should remember that they should wise use their power, and use it responsibly.<br/><br/>And as the evidence shows quite clearly, IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN !!!!<br/><br/>Therefore, we need to remember Murrow, and I am certain that this movie will do him justice, in spite of the potential flaws.<br/><br/>BRAVO !!!"

It was that terror that McCarthy tried to ride to power. Clooney misses the public hysteria and so leaves his best material on the floor. Instead we get a well-reenacted but thin outline of the domestic battle between Unflinching Murrow, Fumbling McCarthy and the less than heroic bit players.

"jdesando","Null","4","10","12 October 2005"," Classic journalism noir
","Edward. R Murrow represents the epitome of the crusading and self-sacrificing newsman, who risked his career in the 1950's to bring down the most infamous senator of the last century, Joseph McCarthy, the junior senator from Wisconsin and the chair of the Senate Subcommitee on Investigation. McCarthy's witch hunt for ""Reds"" created cowards by the score and a few heroes, Murrow one of them.<br/><br/>Most journalism and media types hold Murrow in the highest regard, so director George Clooney's left-leaning, hero-worshiping film is not surprisingly pro Murrow and CBS. Clooney directs a monochromatic, silvery mise en scene with subtle care, using the camera to record shifts in responses through close-ups and the black and white to emphasize the era and the clash between good and evil. Hmmm, Orson Welles used similar techniques and won him immortality; there may not be in Good Night those clashing scenes in Citizen Kane that gave it such energy, but there are reflective moments showing Murrow aware of the danger in confronting a US senator, changing his glance only slightly to show emotion that would have writ large on hammier actors.<br/><br/>Clooney as Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, underplays a role that he could have easily taken over the top, and Frank Langella as William Paley, the president of CBS, is torn by the exigency of keeping a productive station and the idealism of bringing down a red-baiting senator. Langella effectively shows Paley not so much an idealist but rather a pragmatist who wants to support his rebellious crew but must take into consideration the survival of the station. David Strathairn's stoic Murrow is both a fine imitation and an interpretation on its own, making him a sure shot at an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>In a way, Good Night is a companion to The Insider, another account of CBS on the dilemma horns as Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt (also present in the current film) go after big tobacco and threaten the survival of the station. Good Night can also be seen as an allegory about repressive government capable of creating crisis when there is none and intimidating anyone not supporting their ruse. The setup for the war in Iraq quickly comes to mind as well as President Bush's ""You're either with us or against us"" ultimatum.<br/><br/>Allegory or not, Clooney has framed a classic journalism noir film in which the heroes are real and the bad guys scary. Television journalism was the big winner, for it became with Murrow a part of the checks and balances so necessary in a democracy. The heroics serve to highlight the atmosphere of fear today where such heroes are hard to find.<br/><br/>""We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty"" is a mantra for our times, echoing down the 50 years since Ed Murrow dared to proclaim it. That's heroic in any age."
"PanamaJoe","8","4","10","9 October 2005"," Excellent move, and I actually learned something
","This is a very good movie. I had known some of the history of McCarthy and McCarthyism, but wasn't aware of Murrow's role in the downfall of such.<br/><br/>The film strikes a excellent balance between dramatization and reality. We see the buzz of the newsroom, the paranoid fears of the time, and the stodginess of the corporate Powers That Be. However, we are also exposed to genuine archival footage and Murrow's real words.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD* Although I like how this movie is about a specific period of time, and doesn't attempt a full Murrow biopic, I thought the ending was a little abrupt. At what should have been the peak of Murrow's victory (the censuring of McCarthy), he suddenly loses his time slot and the movie ends.<br/><br/>I was intrigued enough to go home and do some research on Murrow -definitely the sign of a good movie - and found out that as television began to change, things like quiz shows gained in popularity, and people weren't as interested in hard-hitting quality journalism. Although we do hear some of Murrow's thoughts on the downfall of TV, I think that, were it illustrated better, the point would be driven home a bit deeper - here is a man who represents all that is good in broadcast journalism, and he is ultimately being taken down by The Price is Right and the $25,000 Pyramid.<br/><br/>Still, an excellent movie all around, and fully deserving of my 8/10."

","The VENONA Project files, declassified in 1995, provided indisputable evidence that nearly all of those McCarthy accused were traitors to America. Not surprisingly, the media ignored these documents completely, instead choosing to run yet another round of anti-McCarthy propaganda. As if that wasn't enough, in 2005 Hollywood released the greatest propaganda film since ""Triumph of the Will"", an anti-McCarthy slander picture known as ""Good Night and Good Luck"". Dead for fifty years, McCarthy's body has now been tarred, feathered, crucified, cremated, and his ashes shot into space by a leftist media who cannot handle the truth of their own miserable existence. The anti-McCarthy media claims the Senator wrongly implicated many. Despite their accusations, no critic has ever brought forth a single documented case of someone being wrongly accused by McCarthy.<br/><br/>While the film portrays Senator George McCarthy as wrong for seeking to ""out"" Communists, the facts came to light in the 1990s that McCarthy was on the right track. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Secret Service archives were opened to the public, where researchers found evidence that over 340 Communist spies and sympathizers had indeed infiltrated a number of State Department positions in the U.S. government during the Cold War.<br/><br/>Recently declassified Soviet documents prove that, not only was McCarthy RIGHT, the problem was even worse than he and J. Edgar Hoover were aware. Just a few facts the viewer should keep in mind while watching this wretched abortion of a movie."

Why would George Clooney actively further diminish what little credibility he has left because of his outspoken political insults directed toward more than half a national population?

"onepotato2","5","3","7","4 June 2010"," Important events... average movie
","In the 1950s, Senator Joe McCarthy misappropriated the entire machinery of state to harass nobodies and consolidate his own power. What he did was fundamentally, grotesquely unAmerican. The combined talents of Clooney and baseball impresario Mark Cuban have reproduced that narrative. But they are not aware of subtlety. This film presents important events but does so with such a veneer of solemnity and self-admiration that it's not very edifying. The most dramatic moment in the film comes oddly when Army Counsel Joseph Welch (in historical footage) takes self-loathing runt lawyer Ed Cohn to task, and the McCarthy house of cards comes tumbling down. The rest is an elaborate frame for that footage. Strathairn's delivery of Murrow's speeches is so bloodless and off-putting that it kills the movie's momentum, and it makes for an extremely poor ending. The decision to pretend this is 'All The Presidents Men 2' is a bad one. It's not that story. The movie is inert for much too long.<br/><br/>What's more important to know is that Joe McCarthy was dead within 3 years of being knocked out of power, from alcoholism. A fitting end for such a contemptible human being. Would that such alcoholism might strike the descendants of McCarthy and Father Coughlin; Limbaugh, Coulter, Beck, O'Reilly, etc. Most Americans can't even figure out that the freedom they pay lip service to, arrives in their community as 'individuality' which absolutely horrifies them, and which they immediately attempt to crush."

","Surprisingly compact behind-the-scenes struggle at the CBS Network's news division in late 1953-early 1954, when Senator Joseph McCarthy was running rampant with his communist theories and threats, and television newsman Edward R. Murrow steadily hoped to expose him for the hypocrite and headline-grabber that he was. Director/co-screenwriter/co-star George Clooney displays a great feeling for this era in time, and for tawdry show business tactics; he knows with certainty the feeling of workplace camaraderie, but also the politics of the game--and how most of it comes wrapped up in a glossy package. McCarthy is represented solely by real news footage, which puts most of the focus (some may say one-sided) on David Strathairn's Murrow; Strathairn was certainly not encouraged to give his Murrow many shades, and the man comes off as singularly stolid. However, the supporting performances are mostly all wonderful, including Clooney's turn as an associate producer, Frank Langella as the news manager for CBS, and Ray Wise as the fragile news-anchor who follows Murrow every night (and is lambasted as a ""pinko"" for taking Murrow's side). The film, while not ""electrifying"" (as Rolling Stone called it), is sleek and to the point, though the quasi-flashback framing device is puzzling and some of the details aren't quite clear for those who weren't around in the '50's (is Murrow reporting for ""See It Now"" or is this his follow-up news-show ""Person To Person""?). A fine achievement overall, with great music and gorgeous black-and-white cinematography. **1/2 from ****"

","I HIGHLY recommend this one. If you have any interest in either McCarthyism or TV journalism's history, this is up your alley. George Clooney made the right call here to only go as far's the record allowed, not to try and make a three hour Stone-like epic, and not get into histrionics. The footage of McCarthy speaks volumes alone.<br/><br/>David Straithairn is the best part of this, as Murrow you couldn't ask for anymore. Clooney wisely steps back and acts as the capable supporting co-star and doesn't get in the way. You get some nicely menacing shots of The Powers that Be-in the form of two Air Force Colonels, William S Paley(knowing he has to look over his shoulder at his sponsers etc all the time), and McCarthy's minions in the press and gov't.<br/><br/>I am not so sure that the suicide of Hollenback was well-thought out, you get a few nasty columns about you(as an experienced reporter why would he care?) and then you check yourself out? I didn't quite buy that. There hadda be more to his story.<br/><br/>The same can be said for Robert Downey Jr's side-story w/ his wife; it's not developed the way you need to make the audience really care about their plight. This is after all Murrow's story, and we get nothing about the guy's personal life.<br/><br/>All that aside-this is Oscar material.

","There is so much to like about this movie--the cinematography, the editing the actors, and, most of all, this dramatic era in American history. So it was particularly disappointing when the film itself seemed to run out of drama about a third of the way in.<br/><br/>After CBS makes a decision on whether or not to air a sympathetic piece on Lt. Radulovich's dismissal from the air-force in the wake of McCarthy-led national hysteria, the movie walks at an even pace to the end with a strange lack of tension or much connection between these rather flat characters and the larger world of events and people outside the newsroom.<br/><br/>That said, there's a lot worth seeing. Patricia Clarkson, as usual, is terrific. She steals every scene, even those with an unusually subdued Robert Downey, Jr. The film looks beautiful, richly lit and making good use of ubiquitous cigarette smoke to capture the atmosphere of the era. Clooney makes great use of old footage, such as a fun nod to America's denial of homosexuality with an actual Morrow interview with Liberace. ."
"Steamboy","5","2","4","14 July 2008"," Documentaries can do it, too
","The directorial debuts of famous actors is a stunt that little interests me. There's a lot of young aspiring directors who are probably struggling right now to get that immense privilege and might never get it, regardless of their creativity and ideas. I can't help thinking those Hollywood stars are depriving them of some opportunities. Thus, I always wind up watching an actor's film with high skepticism and little hope, rarely finding my prejudices shaken.<br/><br/>George Clooney is a nice guy. Or at least that's how it feels on the other side of the screen. He doesn't always have great parts and I keep having nightmares of him in a Batman suit, but there's something about him that feels friendly. Naturally, that had no effect whatsoever on my prejudices: it was just going to be an actor's film. To his credit though, he didn't choose the easy way.<br/><br/>He picked a true, political-based story from a not-so-glorious era of the United States history and shot it in black and white. If this wasn't a risk-taking enterprise, I don't know what is; maybe his next film, Leatherheads, about a football team in the 1920s ? For these choices alone, kudos to Mr. Clooney. Rare are the filmmakers willing to explore some little-known periods or events of the past, especially when not backed by a best-selling book.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the mid-fifties, right when senator Joseph McCarthy was holding public hearings against anyone suspected of having sympathies for the communist party. This is taught at school, generally in one or few sentences. What I didn't know is how McCarthy's downfall came. And this is precisely what the film is looking at. One of the persons who raised the alarm against McCarthy's unruly methods and attacks on civil liberties was a CBS journalist called Edward R. Murrow.<br/><br/>Through his TV show ""See it Now"" he started to conduct a series of report questioning the legitimacy of these actions. Murrow was a brilliant speaker as you can judge by the few enlightened speeches scattered along the film, which are certainly all his. I found this and the archive footage, spread throughout as well, to be the most interesting. And that's the problem I have with Good Night, and Good Luck; the same result could have been achieved with a one-hour documentary, just putting together footages of McCarthy and Murrow's speeches.<br/><br/>Nothing else really matters, the subplots are so thin they're almost nonexistent. The relationship between Robert Downey Jr and Patricia Clarkson's characters is here just to fill the remaining space and the only thing you will really remember of it is that it was not allowed for a married couple to work at CBS. Same goes with the dealings between Murrow and his boss, played by Frank Langella. It's slightly better because there's a bit of tension, but eventually nothing comes out of it and it just looks like a filler. What about what happens to Don Hollenbeck ? Well, being from an event that actually took place, it would have fitted in our documentary alternative.<br/><br/>The direction was quiet, not very inspired, an actor's film in short, with the addition of the natural elegancy provided by black and white tones. You can barely say more of the actors. There wasn't a bad performance, there wasn't one outstanding either. David Strathairn was convincing and well cast, yet again his main task was to deliver Murrow's speech in a subdued, convincing way. This done, most of his job was done. I find it hard to imagine this film was an Oscar contender. It was a modest, unambitious production, using a feeble narrative to present documentary-like facts. It was instructive, both in the domains of history and TV production, and may well have been its sole real value."

Dictatorships don't happen when 'big bad' people plot against the citizens at 3 AM in dark bars, but when ordinary citizens worry about their own little freedoms and rights, but not about those of others. This movie has been extraordinarily well-timed, at a moment when the Bush-league politicians are more worried about their re-election than about doing what's right for America (and for the rest of the free world, I might add), and when 'journalists' are more preoccupied with their ratings than with the Truth."

While the cinematography was beautiful--I loved the black & white and the jazz--and there were some good scenes, I felt like the movie was stripped down to a bare-bones documentary with very little character development. It was decently clear who everyone was, but, beyond that, very little was done to explore why characters chose to do what they were doing. Sometimes words are enough, but I felt that this movie didn't seek to explain or put what was going on in any sort of context. The use of actual footage was great, but I thought the story of the movie was lacking. I know I should probably care about what's happening in the movie (and I do care in real life), but nothing is developed enough to really cause that.

The historical battle was over the right to be confronted by one's accuser on the issue of being a Communist or former member of a Communist, or Communist front, organization.<br/><br/>It's October 1953 and the big news is about a US Air Force officer Let. Milo Radulovich being drummed out of the USAF because of Let. Radulovich's association with his own father John, a suspected Communist sympathizer. This story was something that was a little bit over the top in the opinion of CBS News commentator Edward R. Morrow, David Strathairn, who decided to run with the story on his weekly new program ""See it Now"".<br/><br/>It eventually turned out that John Radulovich's only sympathy with the Communist regime in his native Yougaslavia was his scribing to a newspaper, who yearly colorful calender he liked. The fact that he didn't speak or read English only Serbian, which the newspaper was printed in, was the only reason that Mr. Radulovich had anything to to with it in the first place!<br/><br/>Realizing that people like Wisconsin's junior Senator Joe McCarthy, convincingly and brilliantly played by himself,are a bigger danger to America's freedom and democracy then any outside Communist threat Morrow took on the case of Let. Radulovich who was being pressured by not only the USAF but Sen. McCarthy as well. The case was later dropped by the US military since it was so ridicules and un-American that it would have in fact helped the cause of Communism more then hurt it.<br/><br/>Edward R. Morrow now turns his guns on Sen. McCarthy himself but this could very well backfire on him since McCarthy at the time was a very popular Communist fighter in the Senate. An attack on him would end up not only having Morrow smeared as a Communist, or Communist stooge, but cause his news network CBS to go bankrupt with all it's sponsors deserting it and having himself and his fellow newsmen on CBS out of a job and a career.<br/><br/>The movie centers on two Edward R. Morrow ""See it Now"" shows, March 9, & April 6, 1954, that in the end began the study downfall of the powerful Joseph R. McCarthy. For all intents and purposes Joseph McCarty's political career ended with him being censored by the Senate, on December 2, 1954, for his unprofessional-like and rude behavior. There was also of course the disastrous, for Joe McCarthy, Army-McCarthy Hearings in the spring of 1954 that the movie ""Good Night and Good Luck"" almost completely ignored or overlooked? Properly because Edward R. Morrow and the staff of CBS' ""See it Now"" had nothing to do with them.<br/><br/>The battle with Joe McCarthy did in the end take a lot out of Edward R.Morrow and his colleagues. His best friend and fellow news commentator Don Hollenbeck, Ray Wise, ended up killing himself because of his wife leaving him and the brutal criticism from the press that he got for supporting Edward R. Morrow. <br/><br/>The movie starts and end at a banquet for Morrow on October 25, 1958, a year after Senator Joe McCarthy's death, which he tells his audience that we can only lose our freedoms from the inside by not standing up to those in political power who want to take them away from us, under the guise of patriotism and national security. Hopefully what we learned in the early 1950's, at the hight of the Cold War, will not be forgotten by future generations of politically educated, in the words of US Constitution and Bill of Rights, and freedom loving Americans; we can only hope and pray that Edward R. Morrow was right."

","When they announced the Academy Award nominations this year, I has seen all but one of the best picture nominees--Good Night and Good Luck. Of the other four, the only one that seemed deserving of its nod was Munich. Crash was far to simple-minded for my taste (please, go see Do the Right Thing if you want to see a movie that deals intelligently with race in America), and, as a huge supporter of Annie Proulx's Brokeback Mountain, I was let down by Ang Lee's translation; Capote was a lot better than I anticipated, but it was not one of the five best pictures released in 2005. Having seen the trailers for, read the reviews about, and listened to my Hollywood friend expound on the virtues of Good Night and Good Luck, I assumed that I would be immediately drawn to the movie. I like George Clooney and adore David Strathairn; the topic was interesting; the cinematography looked fantastic. <br/><br/>Well, I was enormously let down. The direction was solid and the cinematography was brilliant. The acting was very good as well. However, I'd argue the movie fails on the level of its writing. Given what the screenwriters offered him to work with, Strathairn does an amazing job. There are no speeches given by Murrow in this film that would indicate what type of person he was--nothing to indicate that, while taking on McCarthy, he had second thoughts. Strathairn creates that lack of sureness. Yet that's not enough to create what I would consider a complete character. Murrow feels flat throughout, through no fault of Mr. Strathairn, I think. He just wasn't given nearly enough to work with. Perhaps that was the point to keep Murrow an enigma, but I don't know if I feel it was a good choice. In any event, I simply felt that there was something missing.<br/><br/>I also felt that the film presents a VERY biased view of history. Not that the film is wrong to elevate Murrow above McCarthy. Sen. McCarthy was a no-good, opportunistic, lout; whenever I see the Dead Zone, I am pretty sure Martin Sheen modeled his character on Minnesota's former-junior senator. What I take a critical view of is the fact that they present McCarthy's downfall as more or less the result of Murrow's taking easy potshots at him. It seems too facile to argue that Murrow brought down McCarthy and even in the movie it feels a little false. History is never that simple. It's complicated and convoluted and the straw that breaks the camel's back is seldom the only straw on the camel's back. <br/><br/>This is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, and I might have had a different opinion of it had I not expected unrivaled brilliance. I was awaiting and expecting greatness, but I did not get it."

","Good Night, and Good Luck is an honest and upright look at broadcast politics during the 40's and 50's, when Senator Joseph McCarthy was on a witch hunt to uncover Communist sympathizers living in the U.S. The film, which was directed, co-written and starring George Clooney, is a nice look back at old school film-making, from decades long since past, and is shot in gorgeous black and white looks great. I think more films these days should be made in black and white, because they force you to concentrate on the story and characters, and allow you to not get distracted from anything else.<br/><br/>What I meant by ""old school film-making"" was that Good Night, and Good Luck isn't buried beneath a lot of modern day film-making techniques; including overindulgent and quick paced editing, or fast, sudden camera movements, or a heavy handed booming musical score. Every thing in Good Night, and Good Luck is underplayed, and aimed at accomplishing a sense of realism, without having to ""amp"" anything up, or going dramatically over-the-top. That's what I what I meant by old school film-making, and this is a nice change of pace from the norm, because it's rare to find a film with a relaxed pace, and requires you to think for yourself, and at the same time the film isn't overly long, finishing up in about 90 minutes.<br/><br/>At the heart of the picture is Edward R. Murrow, a CBS news journalist, played to perfection by David Strathairn. Murrow standed up to Sen. McCarthy (which is shown using entirely old film stock footage) and his tactics when no body else would, for fear that they too would be seen as a Communist. Murrow is represented as a noble hero, seeking out the truth, and not gossip or rumors; a reporter who believes in integrity and honesty; a real American.<br/><br/>This is George Clooney's second film to direct, but he easily convinced me that he'd been directing movies for far longer. He's a man that can not only act, but write, produce and direct as well, now that takes talent. Good Night, and Good Luck was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Cinematography and Art Direction. Which is pretty much saying that Good Night, and Good Luck is well made, well directed, acted, written and also looks mighty fine as well, and that pretty much sums it up for me.<br/><br/>However, the film certainly isn't perfect, and in fact does suffer from a few things. First, the subplot of the married couple, played by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson felt pointless and tagged on, just some extra ""padding"" to increase the already too short running time. The film also lacks strong character development, or arch; the characters never go through any change from the very beginning to the very end. And the film may have also been too fact driven, as if Clooney didn't want to ""Hollywoodize"" any part of the film, even if it means creating a more interesting, or riveting plot, or characters. I found these few things to weak the overall feel of the film, but not enough to really discourage me from recommending it, but I must say that out of all the films I saw last year I could name at least five other films I saw that could have and probably should have been nominated for Best Picture over this one. Good Night and Good Luck succeeds in the really important areas; it has a really good message that's backed up by some solid performances and is presented with strict attention to the facts."

","GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a brilliant piece of film making, a film that recreates a period in our history when gossip mongers and fear exploiters took the lead for a terrifying few years that threatened to extinguish civil rights forever. Not unlike now! And that is one reason this film carries so much resonance: the story of the bravery of popular news reporter Edward R. Morrow (David Strathairn) and his associates Fred Friendly (George Clooney), Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson), William Paley (Frank Langella) and the crew at CBS is one that begs for re-creation in the way the news is reported, analyzed, and serves the rights of the public to be truly informed.<br/><br/>The story is the 1950s McCarthyism Communist Hunting that terrified the country unchecked until Morrow et al challenged the Senator's accusations and methodology by simply quoting the statements McCarthy made in the television series See It Now. Morrow and his associates did not elect to smear McCarthy: they instead elected to bring to the public's quivering attention just what the sick mind of McCarthy was doing to innocent people. It was an act of bravery on Morrow's part and on the part of everyone connected with See It Now.<br/><br/>George Clooney continues to impress as a quiet, subtle voice who doesn't seek the limelight for his brilliant mind, but rather uses it to enter the arena of emerging patriots - the good kind. He wrote the script with Grant Heslov after much research and investigation and then gathered a gifted crew of actors (including himself) and directed the film using the atmosphere of black and white photography (credit cinematographer Robert Elswit) in the almost exclusively interior claustrophobic set of the television station to give the ring of honesty that pulsates this story to its powerful end. Strathairn is brilliant as Morrow, but then so are all the cast members in this ensemble effort.<br/><br/>GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is an immensely entertaining film on every level, but the fact that it is released in such a realistic fashion at this particular time in the nation's precarious history makes it a film that should be seen by everyone. The DVD added commentary by not only the writers and actors but also the people still living and the children of those who aren't is informative and sensitively poignant. Lightning can strike in the same place twice. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
"shanejamesbordas","7","2","4","14 March 2006"," Gripping B&W Drama
","The main motivation to see 'Good Night And Good Luck' should overwhelmingly be for David Strathairn's superbly calibrated performance as 1950's journalist and broadcaster Edward R. Murrow in this somewhat talky but intriguing film. However, its director George Clooney proves to be a surprisingly deft hand behind the camera and should certainly give more thought to a career move further in this direction, away from his usual lacklustre acting performances. Here he wisely opts to stay in the background. Elsewhere, Robert Downey Jr. gives a dependable but unexciting performance in a rather unnecessary parallel plot line while Jeff Daniels and Frank Langella show admirable gravity.<br/><br/>One could argue that the film offers little psychological insight into what gave Murrow his motivation to take on McCarthy ""The Junior Senator"" other than journalistic integrity and more often than not comes across as a political tract with a rather too obvious contemporary relevance. 'Good Night And Good Luck' (Murrow's catch phrase) also arguably errs towards becoming a stylised filmed stage play in its reliance on confining most of the action to the TV studio but as other directors have proved in the past (such as Sidney Lumet with '12 Angry Men') this can in turns be an equally gripping technique and the word perfect transcribing of Murrow's eloquent broadcasts are thought provoking and moving. Numerous newsreel clips are used (and perhaps over-used) but their historical fascination is undeniable and to see a recent film with such glorious B&W Kane-like photography is quite simply a thrill."

Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?"") and that does make a short appearance here. The movie is educational for me in that it tells a story I never knew about those times.<br/><br/>Good Night does a great job of building up the tension as Murrow decides to expose McCarthy. As it rolls on, there is a feeling of excitement as most of CBS and the rest of the press back Murrow and his crew. It reminded me of _All The President's Men_ in that way.<br/><br/>There is plenty of jumping off points in this movie for serious discussion about the media today, but those points are better left for a college seminar than a movie review. The ending is a bit didactic, but then it seems Murrow was, too."

","Although set in the past - at the height of the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950's - ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" has a great deal of relevance to the world of today. For in an era in which civil liberties are again under attack due to a perceived threat to national security, and political opponents are labeled as ""unpatriotic"" and ""soft on terror"" merely for disagreeing with the powers-that-be in the government, this film reminds us of just how precious and vital disagreement and dissent are to the health of a democracy. The modern-day parallels are never far from the mind of director and co-writer George Clooney as he tells the true-life story of famed CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow's courageous attacks on Senator Joseph McCarthy during the politically charged era known as the Red Scare.<br/><br/>This film is reminiscent of ""All the President's Men"" in its austerity and lack of narrative adornment. Filmed in period-appropriate black-and-white, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" spends virtually no time on exploring the personal lives of the characters, choosing instead to stay entirely focused on the drama at hand. This has both a positive and a negative effect on the film. On the plus side, the film doesn't become distracted by secondary issues or wander off into irrelevant narrative by-paths. Yet, the film has an almost hermetically sealed quality to it in that we rarely leave the highly insulated world of the CBS studios. As a result, the movie sometimes feels as it it's choking on its own lack of oxygen, not providing sufficient room for the characters themselves to breathe and grow. Morrow, the host of ""See it Now"" whose signature sign-off becomes the basis for the film's title, delivers his pointed speeches and the men and women around him debate the issues of the day, but we really don't get to know any of them as people in the way we would like (compare it to a film such as ""Quiz Show"" which did manage to bring a three-dimensional quality to its characters).<br/><br/>What the film does do very well is to point out the hypocrisy at work in McCarthy's witch hunt tactics, for apparently he couldn't see - or perhaps chose not to see - that, in his squelching of dissent and his terrorizing of those with political views opposite to his own, he was aping the very Communists he claimed to be reviling, becoming an even greater threat to true American values than those he despised.<br/><br/>The performances - particularly by David Straitharn as Morrow - are good, but the overall lack of characterization makes ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" more interesting as a history lesson and an allegory for today than as a full-fledged drama."
"lee_eisenberg","10","2","4","5 February 2006"," They all need to do this.
","If the Oscars lean too much towards favoring actors who direct, then ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" justifies that. David Strathairn plays CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow, who in 1954 challenged Joe McCarthy on live TV. And believe you me, he does a perfect job.<br/><br/>George Clooney directs and also stars as executive Fred Friendly. To give the movie an extra-realistic sense, he filmed it in black-and-white, thereby eliciting the feeling of 1950s TV. At the end of the movie, Murrow reminds everyone of the danger of letting TV turn into an escapist medium...something that it has truly become today.<br/><br/>They could not have done a better job making this movie. Everything about it is perfect. Also starring are Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella, Patricia Clarkson, and Ray Wise. ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" is a masterpiece in the real sense of the word. I would say that David Strathairn deserves Best Actor for it. George Clooney has certainly been making a name for himself this year, with this one and ""Syriana"". And to think that less than ten years ago he starred in ""Batman and Robin""."
"colonel_green","9","2","4","30 January 2006"," A sedate, interesting look at an important juncture in recent history.
","2005 has been a blockbuster year for George Clooney, who won heady praise for his actor/writer/director/producer role on ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" and for his performance as CIA Agent Bob Barnes in ""Syriana."" Clooney, son of a local journalist, seems to have great affection for this period, when television news was in its infancy. He's meticulous in depicting the way a 50s TV station was run, and it's engaging just to see the old equipment (film instead of tapes, for example). The entire place seems quite claustrophobic (the limited array of sets surely plays a part in this), and with untold toxic tobacco particles floating in the air (little wonder that Murrow died of lung cancer in early middle age).<br/><br/>The film is quite sedate, as I said earlier, with little score (beyond some jazz riffs that can get a bit repetitive), and tight camera-work that focuses solely on the actors, walking down grey halls and talking in offices and meeting rooms. The film's trailer really misrepresents the kind of film this is; it's a docu-drama, that does not ""sex up"" the day-to-day workings of a newsroom. Anyone not really interested in the subject matter is likely to be bored by the movie.<br/><br/>There is a bevy of quality actors in the film, ranging from Clooney himself (underplaying nicely), David Straitharn as the legendary Murrow, Frank Langella, Tate Donovan, Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson, and Robert Downey Jr. There's very little character in the film; Clooney is interested in the genesis of the plot, and the facts. It makes for refreshingly unsensationalized viewing, although it can seem a bit sterile.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note the differences between this and Clooney's other political film; GNaGD argued that good men, like Edward R. Murrow, could topple villains like McCarthy if they stuck to their principles; ""Syriana""'s ultimate message is that we're probably screwed, regardless of what we try to do, because the problems of the world are beyond anyone's ability to solve. This film's message is, obviously, the one most people would prefer."

","Goodnight, and Good Luck: ****<br/><br/>'Goodnight, and Good Luck,' written and directed by George Clooney with Grant Heslov, is a wonderful portrayal of the battle between Edward R Murrow and Sen. Joeseph McCarthy in the 1950's. This battle has become legendary, and while not every may know Murrow, they certainly have heard of McCarthy. I do not feel unfair to state here that McCarthy was a bully, an intimidator, and quite possibly an unstable man. He terrorized many innocent citizens unjustly, and it is shocking to still see that there are people who support his actions. Yes, it's true. Clooney, who's father was a newscaster, clearly has a handle for the procedures and processes of the early newsrooms. The sets are excellent in showing the tight spaces. The image that comes to mine here is of Clooney, playing Fred Friendly, tapping Murrow's (Strathairn) knee to signal the on-air cue. The performances here are outstanding. Everyone does a fantastic job, especially Strathairn. No one feels out of place, everyone nails their characters and the result is that you actually feel as if you have been put back in time and are watching it unfold all over again. The choice to go black and white for cinematography was perfect. And it works so well, because it enhances the best performance of all in this movie. That performance is of Sen. Joe McCarthy, played by, dum da da da, Sen. Joe McCarthy. The inter-cutting of archive footage works wonderfully here. Why hire an actor, when you capture the mood by using the real man. It was reported that some people walked out of the screenings claiming that the guy playing McCarthy was overacting. Well, he was. McCarthy overacted and overplayed the communist threat and took it out on many people who were never part of that threat, a threat, which was never really a threat to begin with. 'Goodnight, and Goodluck' is one of the better films of the year, and is certainly one of the most important. Not only is this a film about McCarthy, this is a film about values, exploitation, and the misused power of television. Murrow discusses the role of television, and the preference for entertainment over education. What if we did, as he suggests, move some of these prime time entertainment slots and replace them with shows promoting education, political issues and the like? Would we do any more harm to ourselves than to become a little more enlightened on issues that are important to the state of the world? This is one of the films of the year that should not be missed. It is not an isolated piece connected only with Murrow and McCarthy. There are important connections to be made with our society today, and the American war on ""terrorists"" and their sympathizers. 10/10, big thumbs up."
"pyrocitor","9","2","4","13 January 2006"," Superbly crafted and surprisingly relevant
","Good Night and Good Luck<br/><br/>In Good Night and Good Luck, actor George Clooney takes the directorial reigns to share a story which would normally sound slightly obscure, and not too appealing to today's audiences - the story of 1950's television broadcaster Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his mission to take down Senator Joseph McCarthy and his absurd anti-communist campaign. <br/><br/>This kind of story would normally seem a bit out of place in today's theaters, but Clooney (who also co-wrote) shows a great deal of intelligence throughout his film, forcing the viewer to notice astonishing parallels between the U.S. governments of the 1950s and today, and when we look at it, how ultimately similar they are. This is the real beauty of Good Night and Good Luck - the realization as one parts the theater of how, despite all sociatorial advances, how frighteningly similar a problem still exists today.<br/><br/>Clooney has also created an excellently made film, apart from the thought provoking political messages it raises - the cinematography is wonderful, as a camera sweeps through the lonely halls of the CBS broadcasting building, and the stark lighting on the black and white picture strongly help bring across the feel of the period, as do the excellent sets, music and 50's style costumes. The audience feels fully immersed in the middle of a 1950's television broadcasting building, so complete is the feel of the picture. <br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck also excels in the performance strand, bringing out wonderful work around the table, especially from leading man Strathairn, who perfectly captures the essence of heroic yet humble journalist Murrow. But although he is clearly the star of the show, he is backed up by similarly terrific performances from Clooney as CBS producer Fred Friendly, Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson as secretly married crew members (it was illegal at the time), Jeff Daniels as a not entirely supportive executive, and Frank Langella as the weary yet understanding superior of Murrow. The actual footage of Senator McCarthy works wonderfully, as it drives home exactly how very real the issue was at the time, and ground the story in real life. <br/><br/>All in all, Good Night and Good Luck is one of the most expertly crafted films of the year by far. Although Clooney has brought his film in at a tight hour and a half, he easily succeeds in putting his point across, as well as raising several profound and thought provoking questions about the government system. Good Night and Good Luck is wonderfully made and still very relevant - definitely worth seeing for so many reasons.<br/><br/>-9/10"

","This movie was surprisingly historically accurate for a Hollywood movie. Edward Murrow was portrayed surprisingly well and I enjoyed the fact that McCarthy's scenes were all actually of him in television broadcasts! Kudos to Warner Bros. for making such a great flick! It was enjoyable all the same, as the characters portrayed the broadcasting industry of the 1950s very well. And I hope ""Good Night and Good Luck"" receives praise for its great cinematography, in that it was black and white, adding to the realism of the time period it was portraying. By choosing to do the movie in black and white it makes the transitions from actual 1950s footage to Hollywood footage that much smoother. The movie in all was enjoyable, and a must see for anyone interested in the Cold War Era or in a good movie!"

Also, seeing those first days of TV was fascinating, with Friendly crouched underneath Murrow and the hand written queue cards. Tight, taught, suspenseful--even though we know the outcome. This is what movie making is about. George Clooney is far more talented than I had realized, with his involvement in the writing, his directing and his acting. But David Straithern steals the show. Compelling performance."
"Philby-3","8","2","4","18 December 2005"," Good luck to George Clooney
","It's no wonder Hollywood is regarded by the American Lunar Right as a propagator of evil. Here's Gorgeous George Clooney, veteran of many a popular lightweight entertainment, using his money and position to attack that misunderstood patriot, Senator Joe McCarthy, long after he has faded from the scene. The trouble is, of course, that Georges' timing for his retelling of the efforts of the country's most famous broadcaster, Ed Murrow, to expose McCarthy for what he was, could not have been better. The same question that Murrow canvasses in a 1958 speech which bookends this production faces us today  is the enormous power of the electronic media going to be used for proper public education and discussion, or just to sell soap and peddle propaganda. It has to be said, though, that the US networks, probably now more competitive than the comfortable tri-opoly of the 1950s, have been more critical of conduct of the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism than they were of McCarthy when he was around.<br/><br/>This movie, appropriately in black and white, feels like television. Apparently the original intention was to do the piece live, as George did a few years ago with his re-make of ""Fail Safe"", but sensibly that was not attempted on this occasion. The sets are small and crowded and full of movement. It seems early TV studios at least at CBS in New York, were tiny and Murrow (David Strathairn) practically sits at the end of the camera lens. His producer, Fred Friendly (played by George Clooney), sits close enough to tap him in on the leg as a cue.<br/><br/>Their program, ""See it Now"", on CBS Sunday night 6:30 to 7 pm gave the viewers some pretty challenging stuff, but the ratings suggested viewers could cope. Clooney has for dramatic effect rather exaggerated the problems Murrow and Friendly had: Alcoa, a major sponsor did not pull out until at least a year after the McCarthy program, and not as a result of it, as suggested in the movie. It should also be borne in mind that Murrow, reasonably expecting that he and CBS might be next, made a pre-emptive strike against McCarthy, and the junior Senator for Wisconsin's weak, inarticulate and ineffective response lost him much support.<br/><br/>I was very interested in the scenes between William S Paley, the former cigar salesman who was chairman and chief stockholder of CBS, and Murrow. Paley is no Hearst or Beaverbrook, nor even a Katherine Graham, and, as played by Frank Langella, despite being an intimidating and large man comes across as rather timid, deferring, most of the time to Murrow's evident moral authority. Perhaps it is because Paley is in a licensed industry, dependent on the Government and Congress to operate, or perhaps Paley realises he can always get rid of Murrow if he has to, and in the meantime it is better to leave him alone. In the end Murrow did leave CBS and when he died of lung cancer in 1965 he was the Director of the US Government Voice of America radio service. His ideals as a broadcaster live on in National Public Radio and the PBS television network (of which Fred Friendly was a founder).<br/><br/>As a piece of drama, the film works very well. The atmosphere is very like that of ""All the President's Men""  although we never feel for Murrow and Friendly in the way we do for those cub reporters Woodward and Bernstein. In 1953 Murrow was a national icon; the Washington Post guys were unknown. David Strathairn underplays the part beautifully, though he does not quite get Murrow's cadence. The triumph over McCarthy comes at a cost, as we see toward the end.<br/><br/>Anyway, more power to George. If he wants to spend his fortune on ""message"" pictures of this sort, he's welcome. Even better, if he can make money doing it. He might be a limousine liberal, but at least he's at the wheel with a firm idea of where he's going. Murrow might not have approved of some of the editorialising but I'm sure would have agreed with the sentiment."
"ab-2","10","2","4","20 December 2005"," George Clooney and David Strathairn give career-defining performances in this Edward R. Murrow biopic
","The truth is a complex concept. What is the truth? When do people deserve to hear the truth? But most important, whose job is it to tell the truth? The film Good Night, And Good Luck, directed by George Clooney, not only expertly deals with truth in journalism, but also the ethics all journalists should follow and owe to the public. It is also the best movie of the year thus far.<br/><br/>The 1950s brought many changes. Television was beginning to come into everyone's homes, motion pictures were starting to be filmed in the widescreen cinemascope process and the American people's fears of communism had reached its peak. The most respected newsman at the time, Edward R. Murrow, and his producer Fred Friendly, want to go after Senator Joseph McCarthy for his unsubstantiated charges against supposed Communists in the U.S. While Murrow wants to do hard-hitting news, CBS' sponsors want nothing to do with it. Murrow must also be prepared to face McCarthy himself and risk having his career ruined by being labeled as a Communist sympathizer.<br/><br/>The acting by this ensemble cast is truly magnificent. Each actor performs their part with every right note and never falters. David Strathairn should get an Oscar nomination for his career-defining performance as Murrow. He plays the role with the integrity and honesty that made Murrow loved and trusted by so many Americans. George Clooney also gives the best performance of his career with his role as producer Fred Friendly. Unlike most of his past roles, which have been one-dimensional, here he gets to show us his real dramatic side, throwing away his pretty-boy charm in favor of a tough and serious part.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, who is the most overlooked actor in Hollywood, plays CBS president Sig Mickelson and shows us, once again, why he can perform in just about any genre and any role with ease. He presents a human character who knows that he has responsibilities to sponsors and the business side of entertainment and he would probably be the evil corporate bad guy in a more typical Hollywood film.<br/><br/>The film also sports excellent performances from Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. as a married couple who work behind the scenes on Murrow's program.<br/><br/>This is George Clooney's second stint as a director. His first was the mediocre but visually enthralling Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind. Along with cinematographer Robert Elswit, the decision to shoot this piece in black-and-white helps the dark atmosphere of the film, but also gives it a period feel and authenticity. Clooney's decision to have most of the characters smoking also helped give the film more of a '50s feel. Seeing the cigarette smoke float into the lights puts the audience right in the middle of this time period. Clooney, above all things, should be praised for not opting to use an actor as Senator Joseph McCarthy and instead uses archival footage.<br/><br/>The Senator himself was a great ""actor"" who managed to convince the public that Communists could take over the United States. With this film, Clooney doesn't water down any details or make it an audience friendly film. There are no clear good guys or bad guys. Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov create real people, great dialogue and a fantastic film of historical importance.<br/><br/>The music, with jazz vocals sung by Dianne Reeves are beautifully edited into the film at the right times. There is no background score, but instead music is heard on the radio and through the airwaves. The editing itself is very well done. There are no quick cutaways. Editor Stephen Mirrione doesn't go off on tangents and the action isn't coming out at lightning fast speed.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best and most important film of the year. Clooney has proved that somewhere in him is true talent as an actor and director. The cast gives magnificent performances, the stark black and white cinematography is beautiful, and the importance of this film, especially with the type of news outlets that are prevalent today, is too important to be ignored. Come Oscar time, this better win some acting awards, as well as Best Picture.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A+"

","George Clooney and his wonderful band of actors and actresses bring back the look and feel of the middle to late 1950s in this splendid black and white film. The film concerns Edward R. Murrow and the CBS News and Murrow's expose of the heavy handed rampage of Senator Joe McCarthy during his Senate committee's campaign against 200 communists who supposedly were infiltrating government agencies at that time. It is fascinating to see the old behind-the-scenes methods of CBS News during this period and the influence that advertisers had on news content, which continues to this day. Another interesting aspect is the pervading use of cigarettes in this era, with Murrow being shown to be a chain-smoker. I was born in 1949 and, despite my youth, recall the hot anger that McCarthy inspired in my parents with his campaigns. Surely, the fear that McCarthy stirred up against Communism reverberates even today in regard to our lack of friendship with the relatively harmless Cuban government, for example. And, the lack of scruples in persecuting relatively low-level employees suspected of belonging to the Communist Party or having relatives who at one time subscribed to the Daily Worker shows the paranoia that was gripping much of America in that period. It was good that Dwight Eisenhower and his allies were able to defuse this mood, somewhat, and save the republic from something approaching a fanatical inquisition. Nevertheless, John Birch inspired crusades against communism continued to plague America long afterward until the early 1990s. All in all, this film stirs up memories that reverberate, a tour de force of film-making."

","I am amazed that this film does not get the same attention at Brokeback MOuntain. It is simply an incredible achievement for director George Clooney. My biggest complaint is that it is too short. There is so much going on during that time. I am reminded of how the news changed since the days of Edwin R. Murrow. I am reminded of how much I dislike my local and national news. There is too much softness regarding on reporting abroad. Major international news stories go unnoticed anyway. Maybe our society has become content to worry about our own problems. Murrow was an unsung hero of his time. He went against McCarthy who orchestrated a mass witch hunt unprecedented in American history since the Salem witch trials. I don't care for our news system today. It has become a sad commentary. This is a first rate cast with David Straitharn sure to earn a Best Actor NOmination at the Oscars. I would like George Clooney to get one for director. This film is a triumph over controversial yet an important time in American history. We must not forget the communism witch hunt of the 1950s. Today, there is another kind of witch hunt going on. I don't care about other films. Nothing has made a strong impression on me this year but this film. I left wanting more of it. The black and white cinematography added a film noir to it. It could have been done in color but not as effective. Bravo, George Clooney. Your Aunt Rosemary would be so proud of your achievement."

","I sat through this film with tears flowing from my eyes. I am old enough to remember this period, but - of course - I never knew the behind-the-scenes issues because they were just that: behind the scenes.<br/><br/>George Clooney has proved to us again that we need to remember that Conservatism is not always good in government. This is especially true when the specific Conservative is ignorant, or - worse yet - only venal. Liberals can run amok too, but they tend to be gentle in their liberalism whereas Conservatives tend to be intent on harming someone or something they don't like."

","Good Night, and Good Luck - Broadcast journalist Edward Murrow (David Strathairn) looks to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy (himself) in this finely crafted movie by George Clooney. Much thanks George. All is forgiven for Batman and Robin and The Perfect Storm. This is a perfect period piece that is applicable to virtually any time in America (including now). A person of political stature trying to rule by terror and preying on the innocent? Bingo! David Strathairn has probably made his career with his portrayal of Edward Murrow. Calculating and intelligent, he is able to evoke emotion from the audience with the slightest look or raise of an eyebrow. George plays the loyal Fred Friendly and the two actors have good chemistry. The rest of the cast is fine. Frank Langella makes for an intimidating boss. The screenplay is well written, thought provoking and witty. A wonderful and believable underdog story. Short and entertaining enough to hold the attention span of even those that don't like historical films, and powerful and simple enough in its message to be one of the most important films ever made. Deserves to be nominated, if not win the best actor, director, and screenplay Oscars.<br/><br/>""Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, that he is grown so great?""

","As one who was a teenager during the period covered by this film I remember all too vividly the harm done by the deeds of Sen' McCarthy and his henchman, Roy Cohn. Had it not been for the courage of Murrow and Friendly, and the support of CBS boss Paley, they might have done much more. While I watched this film I could not help thinking of the parallels to the Cheney cabal and their deeds how in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century. This film should, IMHO, be required viewing for today's high schoolers who may not be cognizant of the scoundrels taking refuge in patriotism, as typified by Joe McCarthy; and they need to be."

"Chris Knipp","9","2","4","17 November 2005"," Elegant and intelligent
","Shown at the New York Film Festival, Lincoln Center, September 23, 2005.<br/><br/>In his amusing first film ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" which was scripted by master of illusion Charlie Kaufman, George Clooney -- whose own dad is a long-time TV anchorman -- dramatized the fanciful autobiography of kooky Seventies game show host Chuck Barris. This time he films real events, focusing on the conflict between much respected ultra-solemn CBS TV commentator and veteran newsman Edward R. Murrow and the dark prince of early Fifties communist-scare witch-hunting, Senator Joseph McCarthy. <br/><br/>In the film, Murrow defends navy pilot Lt. Milo Radulovich, who's been kicked out as a security threat without being told the charges, and the pilot is reinstated. McCarthy, seen here only on actual vintage TV footage, accuses Murrow of being a communist sympathiser and Murrow rebuts. McCarthy is subsequently sued by the army and censored by the Senate so again Murrow has won the battle; but he loses the war, because CBS, then headed by the regal William S. Paley, soon phases Murrow out. <br/><br/>The film looks very elegant with its rich black and white (blending with archival footage for McCarthy) heavily weighted to close-ups interspersed with jazz song interludes sung on screen by Dianne Reeves. The cast is led by an appropriately buttoned-down and chain-smoking David Strathairn as Murrow, with the director himself as Murrow's producer and right-hand man, Fred W. Friendly. The period atmosphere is spot-on. The overall effect is dry and a little self-important, and the result is a rather limited picture of the red-baiting period for viewers unacquainted with the overall history. But this is nonetheless one of the most intelligent and politically serious American pictures of recent years. Clooney's an amazing fellow: handsome, urbane, and witty, he's got brains and taste and commitment. There's hope in such a man's being as well placed as he is, and promise in his future collaboration with Steven Soderbergh in the new joint production company, Section Eight."
"meeza","8","2","4","18 November 2005"," Goody Film!
","Edward R. Murrow was a legendary CBS television anchorman during the golden age of 1950's television. That was the time when ""TV Video killed the Radio Star"". Murrow was pointed, prepared, cerebral, and audacious. No more audacious when he challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy controversial claims on numerous Americans alleged ties with communist parties. For several years, McCarthy's bully tactics were uncontested by the media. However, Mr. Ed got on his high horse and the gallup ratings poll skyrocketed for CBS when he whitewashed the Big Mac Senator in several televised news programs. Why should I continue to inform you on this historical broadcasting event when you can see for yourself in George Clooney's film ""Good Luck, and Good Night""? The film's title was Murrow's signature line. Director Clooney must be commended for not being ""tubeloose"" by crafting the M & M debate with exact precision. He also intensifies the film by inserting actual McCarthy footage and presenting it in monochrome. Georgie Boy also validates ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" by screening the fast paced style of the television medium. Thespian Clooney also executes a labor-type vociferous performance as longtime CBS News Producer Fred Friendly. Clooney's ""friendly"" relationship with the Academy should ""reel"" George two Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Supporting Actor. Frank Langella also executes a subtle but frankly striking performance as CBS President William Paley. However, what was not newsworthy about ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" was the superfluous subplot of two CBS married reporters portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. What anchors this reputable film was the superb performance of David Strathairn as Murrow. I wish him good luck at Oscar night because undoubtedly he will garner a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Strathairn nails down Murrow's mannerisms and verbose to an exact television science. Broadcasting rights (and not wrongs) should also go to the creative art direction, thematic costume design, and garrulous screenplay of ""Good Night, and Good Luck"". So for goodness sake, do yourself a favor and have a good night by tuning in to ""Good Night, and Good Luck"".<br/><br/>**** Good (what else)"
"lms-2","8","2","4","14 November 2005"," Quite possibly a perfect movie
","On leaving the theatre, I realized I had just seen what is quite possibly a perfect movie. Not merely was every actor somehow just right for their role, but the cadence of dialogue, the scene timing, the intimate view of the period, all just simply worked. And worked well.<br/><br/>The drama, for all its understated restraint, is very powerful, and actually leaves one feeling breathless. The masterful choice of letting the major players speak for themselves through archival footage was clearly the right choice.<br/><br/>A carefully placed clip of Eisenhower near the film's end summarizes not merely the preceding story, but offers a warning for the future, as well as reflecting current events. I have never seen a movie speak so perfectly about past events while delivering a timely message that may contain a word about what could lie ahead.<br/><br/>This really may be the perfect movie."
"GlenMarshall","9","2","4","13 November 2005"," What a great flick!
","Even without getting into the story line, the cinematography and editing are great. The screenplay is strong, supported by well-chosen historical footage from the 1950s. One does not need to have lived in the 1950s, or be much of a student of US political history, to understand and appreciate the story. It is well-told, well-acted, and afterward you will have gotten a good picture of demagoguery and the bravery and integrity needed to overcome it. The question remains as to whether McCarthy was an evil person or simply afflicted with mental illness. However, in these times of political polarization and half-truths, this movie is a cautionary tale. In my opinion it as a ""must see"" and clearly in-line for a few Oscars."
"moviemanMA","8","2","4","13 November 2005"," David and Goliath
","Senator Joseph McCarthy sought out to bring down communism in the United States in the 1940's and 50's. To rid our nation of people whose ideas could hurt our way of life and well being. The only problem was that anyone could be a communist, you just had to fit the criteria.<br/><br/>In Good Night, and Good Luck, a team of journalists working for CBS News went on a mission to bring down Senator McCarthy. The driving force was broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathrain, L.A. Confidential), who believed that what McCarthy was doing was completely unfair. Luckily he had a staff of journalists to back him up. The network reluctantly did so, too.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an award ceremony in Murrow's honor. Because of his dedication to finding out the truth and his journalistic integrity, he was one of the first to stand up for what he thought was right and what was right for the American people. Then the movie goes back to when Murrow got involved with the McCarthy trials.<br/><br/>Murrow gets involved when a man is accused of having communist ties. The evidence is concealed in an envelope that no one is allowed to see. A great scene is when Fred Friendly (George Clooney, Ocean's Eleven) is talking to the military about the contents of the envelope and who has seen what is inside. This conversation just adds fuel to the fire for Murrow the CBS News staff.<br/><br/>In March of 1954, Murrow goes after the primary target, Senator McCarthy himself. He goes right for the throat. Using file footage and documents associated with McCarthy, Murrow comes out saying that McCarthy is a fake and shouldn't be doing what he is doing. It is a disgrace and telling McCarthy, ""We will not walk in fear, of one another"". Soon after McCarthy sends a message to Murrow saying that someone who is against what he is doing is probably a communist himself. The battle wages on between these two and the rest of the media world.<br/><br/>This is Clooney's second attempt at directing. His debut was Confessions of a Dangerous Mind starring Sam Rockwell as the television game show producer Chuck Barris. Both films have very interesting and unique qualities. Good Night, and Good Luck was filmed entirely in black and white. This gave it a nostalgic look. <br/><br/>The camera shots used were particularly exquisite, especially during the news broadcasts. You would see Strathrain speaking to the camera at an angle and off set you would see what the television camera was recording. It was a brilliant shot. Cinematographer Robert Elswit is no foreigner when it comes to shooting a picture. His prior works include all of P.T. Anderson's films and some other notables like Runaway Jury and Heist.<br/><br/>The Acting was exceptionally good by everyone. Strathrain gives a lustrous performance as Murrow. Clooney as Friendly is at his best. Robert Downey Jr. (Wonder Boys), Patricia Clarkson (Pieces of April), Frank Langella (Dave), and Jeff Daniels (Pleasantville) all give great performances to compliment the others.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is a great picture that delves into a dark period of our history, the ""Red Scare"". The title of the movie is Murrow's sign off line, one of the best in television history. It is especially necessary for the time period he lived in. When the world was covered by darkness, he was the voice of security."

","People who didn't live through the McCarthy era don't have any idea of how terrifying it was for honest Americans who firmly believed in the Constitution. It took the combined onslaught of Edward Murrow and Joseph Welch to bring that madman and his vile little henchmen to an end.<br/><br/>I was prepared to love this movie, simply because George Clooney was in it and because a lot of people were brave enough to make it. I didn't plan on being swept away.<br/><br/>I could write about how inaccurate much of it was historically, but that's of no matter here, because this is art - art reflecting life, which is what the best art does. It held up to us in a most palatable way the absolute corruption that is forever nibbling at the edges of our freedom. Joe McCarthy was not nearly as prominent as George W. Bush or Dick Cheney, but the harm he inflicted - and tried to inflict - was enormous, much like those murderous cretins in the White House today.<br/><br/>That's why this film matters so much. The writing, the acting, the glorious cinematography, all of it is terrific. But, more than all of that, it's a movie that teaches those who aren't familiar with what it was like back then to sit up and pay attention to the basic American truths that will never fail: <br/><br/>that your government lies to you, that you must always be prepared to defend yourself against your government, that you have the power to hold your government to account.<br/><br/>This is more than a brilliant movie - it is an essential movie."

","I have seen GNAGL one time, and may be acting hastily in reviewing it without seeing it again. The story -- Edward Murrow, a successful and affluent, if not wealthy, newsman risking his livelihood to take on Joe McCarthy -- is both compelling in its historical context and in the lessons it offers for today's leaders (who probably won't see the movie and who wouldn't heed its message if they did). But I found the narrative of the movie dry and uncompelling. I appreciated the choice of filming the movie in black and white (and scoring it with a sparse but effective ""black and white"" soundtrack of jazzy standards; the opening rendition of ""When I Fall in Love"" was the perfect mood setter). I wanted to see more background of the main characters -- both the newsmen, and the careers they had before this moment that brought them together, and McCarthy. The movie did not explore how, and why, McCarthy became so powerful, so quickly, in the first place; that was a filmworthy element that should have been emphasized, IMHO.<br/><br/>The performances were uniformly enjoyable, and the creation of the '50s environment was masterful, from the nerd-glasses to the cigarette commercials to the all-night gin joints. But at 98 minutes, the film didn't sate my thirst for the subject matter. I would have enjoyed another quarter hour, and there was story enough to provide it."

","George Clooney captures history in a starkly realistic way. Using black and white film and newsreel clips of actual footage from the fifties made this viewer feel as if time had eclipsed and I was actually seeing Edward R. Murrow again. I admit that I did find some of the blurred filmclips annoying, but this was a technique that only added to the realism of the times. Television was new and digital technology was 5o years into the future. David Strathairn is Oscar caliber and totally captured the persona of Mr. Murrow. This film reminds us of how history has a way of repeating itself if we are not diligent about guarding our rights and freedom. The timing couldn't be more appropriate. All Americans should see this film, especially our children. My only negative comment was that the film wasn't longer. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and wished there were more.

","As a docu-drama (i.e. trying to be like you were in the news studio of CBS at the time) its well done. But I wanted more than that. Its interesting that Murrow's on screen presence as the ultra serious reporter is depicted as just the way he is all the time (which may have been true, but seems a little doubtful). I found this to sort of dilute the weight of his words (that I have heard before). You also get nothing about who Murrow and Friendly were, why did they do this, what were the risks etc. What did they think and feel about it, what did their families think and feel about it, what price was paid etc. Clearly Friendly and Murrow (and others) put a lot of their lives into this, and must have been passionate about it, but that passion does not come across. Its like the cast is on anti-depressants and having their emotions compressed, no real highs, no real lows. It has this constant air of ultra seriousness, yet also a sort of superficialness. Its about what they did, but not who they were or why they did it. You get a little of this in the one scene with in Bill Pailey's office, but its not enough."

Beautiful black and white filming really captures the contrast in every frame and gives everything a sense of drama. The decision to use music as transitions between movements of the movie was good choice, and the lyrics to the songs often are directly related to what is, or what is about to happen in the film.<br/><br/>The best part is that this movie's message is two-fold.

David Straithern really encompasses the no holds barred attitude that Edward R. Murrow approached journalism with, truly an American hero. This move helps to exposes McCarthy as the kind of relentless sleaze that he really was by using all of the original footage, an actor here would never had been as good.

This is also true of a TV speech given by President Eisenhower near the end of the movie. The warnings of 50 years ago also apply today, but with greater urgency. Some reasons are: (1) The mass media rarely informs and educates. We are shielded from the real dangers our society faces (not the terrorists!), and therefore, as a nation, are so ignorant of them. (2) Dissent that criticizes our government can be mistaken for and labeled as disloyalty, (3) There are people in jails without due process."

","This is why I love movies! Good Night, and Good Luck will undoubtedly transport you to a 1950s TV newsroom, where everything looks, sounds, and even smells the 1950s. Well, I imagine that if a movie could give off a scent, this one would smell like smoke, whiskey, and fear. In the early 1950s, nearly all Americans were afraid of Communists, or worse yet, being labeled a Communist. Senator McCarthy made it his personal mission to seek out expel all Communists on American soil, and he didn't care about trampling the Consitution or civil liberties to do this.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is the story of the first news team to speak up against Sen. McCarthy and his unconstitutional and immoral witch-hunt for Communists. Real-life broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow (played with precision and perfection by David Strathairn) used his weekly half-hour news show to investigate and reveal the futility, illegality, and immorality of the McCarthy hearings. Soon, members of the CBS news team found themselves under attack from McCarthy and were accused of sympathizing with Communists.<br/><br/>The parallels to 2005 are obvious, but still interesting. Substitute the word ""communist"" for ""terrorist"" and you've got a picture of the post-Patriot-Act U.S. where the mainstream media is terrified of openly opposing our inept President and his misguided attempts to make us ""safer from the enemy."" George Clooney wrote, directed, and stars in a perfect film that should inspire every citizen to speak up against injustice."

Yes, his courageous attacks on McCartthy began the Senator's demise. Yet, we see ourselves in similar times without the benefit of journalists willing to stand up to corporate power. This movie is great historical theater. But, it's better as a commentary on contemporary society. The world that Murrow feared, of entertainment trumping news and news dominated by corporate wealth is alive and well."

The choice of Black and White for the entire film as well stark lighting and details of costumes, hair and sets, makes us focus on what is being said.<br/><br/>The excellent use of music serves well the feeling of the time although I am not quite sure just why the singer is in the setting she is. At that time local TV did have live music and that may be why Mr. Clooney picked this.

"eichelbergersports","9","2","4","15 October 2005"," 'Good Night' a thoughtful, intelligent, well-made film
","One has to view this stacked-deck film, about how valiant Edward R. Murrow and some of his CBS cohorts were during the days of blacklisting  led by junior Wisconsin Republican Senator Joseph P. MacCarthy  with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>That does not mean I dismiss the movie, however. I think it was one of the year's best, well-crafted and completely engrossing, but I do have to qualify that opinion, a bit. Art is art, and when art and politics meet, sometimes I have to put aside my conservative principals and give credit where credit is certainly due.<br/><br/>While conventional wisdom and historical revisions have made MacCarthy the American equivalent to Adolf Hitler, recent revelations from declassified Soviet documents have suggested he may have been right in some cases  there were Communist sympathizers in some top US government positions.<br/><br/>So, perhaps in retrospect, McCarthy may have been somewhat correct in his overzealous pursuit of what he termed as ""enemies of the state."" He just did not know how to go about it, sweeping up the good with the bad.<br/><br/>For those uninitiated in the latter issue, rumors began circulating that highly-placed members of the Truman Administration were soft on Communism. McCarthy, elected in 1948 (over Progressive icon Robert LaFollette), soon made public a list of over 3,000 possible subversives working within the Democratic Party (57 of those in important positions).<br/><br/>With the war going badly in Korea and Communist advances in Eastern Europe and in China, the American public was genuinely frightened about the possibilities of internal subversion. <br/><br/>McCarthy, as chairman of the Government Committee on Operations of the Senate, was in an ideal position to exploit this situation. The McCarthy hearings soon began and the ripples of these investigations washed over hundreds of individuals, some Communists, some not. During that time, individuals such as Alger Hiss and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted  the former of perjury, the latter's of espionage  although not because of McCarthy's subcommittee. The Verona Transcripts, along with other released Moscow documents prove these people, and others, were collecting secret information for the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The problem was that there were innocent people caught up with the guilty, and when the junior senator claimed there were Commies in the US Armed Forces, the walls caved in on him.<br/><br/>Ironically, it wasn't so much CBS which shot down tailgunner Joe, but third-place ABC, which broadcast the McCarthy-Army hearings. CBS refused to air these events because it interfered with the networks popular daytime soap operas.<br/><br/>McCarthy was soon investigated by his own body, and, on Dec. 2, 1954, he was officially censored by the United States Senate, 67-22. Another problem he had was he was terribly unattractive. Short, pudgy, balding, sweating and often rude, he could not rely on any charm factor when it began to turn.<br/><br/>That, and the mainstream press  which was on him like ravenous wolves  kept hammering home all of his faults. This was never brought to bear more clearly than Murrow's ""See It Now"" program from March 9, 1954  the crux of this film, although he was already in a downward spiral before that broadcast.<br/><br/>In this picture, Cooney chooses to use archival news footage of McCarthy rather than have a Danny Devito-type actor playing him. This is both good and bad. Utilizing these old kinescopes, the senator is done in by his own words and attitudes. It's a very real and scary (to some) enemy, and gives the film a genuine presence of evil.<br/><br/>In real life, Murrow was not all good; nor was McCarthy all bad. For this movie's purposes, however, we are given as black and white of a picture as this film's print.<br/><br/>The movie is populated with hard-drinking, tough-talking, chain-smoking reporters, producers and news reporters, all with a common goal, bringing down the terror they perceived the senator brought with him. But, as Murrows says<br/><br/>in the movie, ""McCarthy did not invent the fear; he exploited it.""<br/><br/>it is a fantastic trip back to a time of unparalleled paranoia, no matter what side of the political fence one resides on. As Murrow, David Strathairn (Eght Men Out, The Firm), does for his character what Jamie Foxx did for Ray Charles, brings out his mannerisms  strengths, vulnerability and often nervous false bravado. <br/><br/>For someone who has played mostly quiet, dignified supporting characters, this is a breakthrough performance, and one which will surely earn Strathairn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He plays the role almost like Gary Cooper in High Noon, battling not only his enemies, but worst of all, his so-called friends and colleagues (Cooper, as Will Kane, however, did not have anywhere near the support Strathairn's Murrow does here).<br/><br/>As his producer, Fred friendly, Cooney may cop a supporting nod, but I would give it either to Frank Langella (the pragmatic CBS president William Paley), or veteran actor Ray Wise (as the frightened left-leaning newscaster, Don Hollenbbeck, driven to suicide by the scandal). The film is probably too political to win Best Picture, although it will surely be nominated, as will Clooney for Best Director (who'd a thunk it?!)<br/><br/>Overall, despite being a victory dance for progressives, at times (as well as omitting Murrow's morbid fear of conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr.), I highly recommend this thoughtful, intelligent, well-made and extremely well-acted motion picture.-"

","A good biopic about Murrow could have been made. Actually, it was made already. By HBO in 1986. This movie is too narrowly focused and lacks depth. We learn nothing about the Murrow-Paley relationship which would help us to understand the actions of either in this film. Clooney spends far too much time on old film clips of Joe McCarthy and on extraneous and irrelevant clips of a jazz singer. (If he had to use music to set the tone of the 50s, he'd have done better with clips of his aunt.) The film is full or errors (see goofs). This is a Hollywood pretty boy trying to be a serious film maker and instead offer self-indulgent BS, that would barely get a passing grade in film school. See ""Murrow"" with Daniel J. Travanti instead. And Edward Herrmann makes a much better Fred Friendly than does Clooney."

","I put off giving this title a view since I was fearing that it would be another Michael Moore-esque left wing screed about the evils of McCarthyism. While it doesn't spare McCarthy at all (nor should it, McCarthy was a sloppy drunk who dug his own grave) it does ""illuminate"", as Murrow says, the eternal friction between the televised press, the pols, and the need for advertising profit. Indeed, unlike ""All The President's Men"" or ""Guilty By Suspicion"", one feels that the real loser in the end is the new medium of television and the men and women that make the news.<br/><br/>A breadcrumb, courtesy of Mr. Paley, is left for anyone curious about the period of the so-called ""Red Scare"": it can be confirmed now that the Federal Government was indeed infiltrated by many paid Soviet agents during the 1940s and 50s. Lookup Project Venona if you wish to know more. This, again, doesn't excuse any of Joe McCarthy's bad actions, it only answers the question of whether or not he was on to anything except the next bottle of scotch.<br/><br/>A far as a cinematic achievement, ""Good Night And Good Luck"" is a bit dull, but the cast is great, as is the cinematography. Whichever side you're on politically, you should be able to appreciate good art when you find it. And, for the record, Ray Wise is an eternally underrated and terrific actor.<br/><br/>PS It should be noted that the real reason Murrow left CBS was because of what Paley was going to offer the targets of his scrutiny: equal time."

","This movie is rather dull for the casual viewer. Starting with the camera angles and movement; using black and white, Clooney gives it a real air of the 1950s, however the camera is very stagnant with almost no movement or dynamics at all. The movie has one of two scenes. 1. A few abstract camera angles while endless amounts of dialogue plays, and 2. a slow moving shot with people bustling around with an audio overlay of slow Jazz. While there is a few other types of shots, the movie mostly alternates between these two.
For about 30 minutes I was completely lost as to what this movie was trying to portray, so I googled all of the names and events I could hear. After hours of study time, I finally grasped what these people were even talking about. The issue is the dialogue and actual sound clips are so old or they are drown so heavily by background noise or static that you need the captions on to even understand them.
This movie was really solid once I researched it and the feelings felt very real. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends, but for someone who is interested in the red scare of the 50s, this is a must"

You got the black and white covered along with how people didn't know the dangers of smoking so everyone had a cigarette in hand. If you look at the entire film there is a lot of information i think you covered really well. One of the things i think you betrayed really well was what false accusations did to some people. The part where a reporter committed suicide was a great representation of how far some people pushed with accusing. You also did a good job at representing the checks and balances. When McCarthy accused pretty much anybody of communism, checks and balances stepped in and silenced him because he never had evidence to back himself up.

The movie is a like a crack of a whip that is buffered with sound-absorbing shields that by the end of the movie, one understands the immensity of what happened but more in terms of the strong, powerful, cerebral, intellectual whiplashing of the character's verbal assault, but not emotional beating.

The McCarthy era, fear of being labelled a liberal, a lefty, was synonymous with communism where the slightest suggestion caused fear of reprisals and silenced the majority.

","It is odd how, a historical biopic still has a box to check for spoiler alerts, as if to say that Americans don't know enough about their own history to actually know how this story is going to end.<br/><br/>The fact is, they are right, we don't and we are seeing it all play out again.<br/><br/>It is decent enough. The Black and White gives is a nice vintage feel to match the old television sets at the time and the use of authentic period advertisements is a beautiful touch. It not only sets the era, but it also works as a nice subtle hint towards what we are about to see, mainly the removal of news as a public service and the addition of news as a source of revenue.<br/><br/>It all came to end in the unclimatic demise of the Fairness and Accuracy Act, the one that had been destroyed long--almost two decades--before ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" was even filmed.<br/><br/>2005 was the release date, well into the Bush Administration, well into the crackdown of anyone that disagreed with the president or the wars, or anything else touted as right-wing values.<br/><br/>So on one hand it stands as a warning, this is what happened before and it is happening again today. Not unlike Miller's ""The Crucible"" served as that same warning during the Red Scare and HUAAC.<br/><br/>And on the other hand it attacks the press. After all, at the time Fox viewers believed that Iraq perpetrated 9-11 and many still do. It shines the light on how the news became a tool of disinformation for the masses. How it went from standing for the truth to telling lies.<br/><br/>And it also brings the journalists to account. Many traded access for accuracy and still are. Even today not a single news source, save Maddow ran anything that didn't utterly vilify Hillary in the last election. Before that they all seemed to agree that ignoring the truth about WMDs in Iraq, smearing Kerry, doing whatever it took to stay close to power was better that trying to take it on. They all seemed to think that towing the disinformation line made for better ratings and they largely still do.<br/><br/>The fact is this movie came out over a decade ago and it is still important. The press, the fourth estate, with few exceptions, has yet to develop the fearless nerves to take on what they see as wrong, or lies. And the nation is suffering for it."

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" is, in short, a superb piece of historical film, both at once giving an excellent insight into the world of television making and a clever piece on the Red Scare, and the infamous Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Its close knit approach feels personal, while the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is stellar.<br/><br/>Perhaps the films greatest strength is its pacing; the film is roughly cut into three sections, each concluding with a broadcast from Edward R Murrow, while in between, events play out without a hitch and a surprising amount of tension is built up throughout the story. <br/><br/>The connections between the characters are also superb; Murrow and Friendly serve as the focus point of the film, and their chemistry is strong and interesting. The CBS crew are a perfect addition to this, being far more than just background characters; they greatly expand the story and build on the personal feel of the film. You feel as though you aren't just viewing these characters, but are actually part of their team, something that is expanded upon by the cinematography. <br/><br/>The antagonists of the film are also well designed. While the story's structure doesn't quite permit a truly defined antagonist, the twists at the end with Hollenbeck's suicide and Payley's ultimatum for Murrow and Friendly reveal that the true enemy in this film are symbolic - they are the influence of corporate sponsors and the impact of the fear that McCarthyism helped to create. That really defines the films hard hitting message, and helps to portray the semi-victorious main characters as vulnerable. In short, it's a clever touch that really strengthens the film.<br/><br/>Then, there is the cinematography. Some might say that the deliberate use of black and white filming is pretentious, but its all about creating atmosphere and authenticity. Particularly in HD, it is a superb looking film. The camera movements and positioning all help to generate the personal feel, especially with how the vast majority of shots are from eye-level. The use of rooms and windows too with the visuals of the film are a neat idea, and help to separate the film from mainstream movies. <br/><br/>Flaws in this film are very few and far between, with the only I can think of being related to your opinion of the film as oppose to any genuine problems. It is such a well crafted piece of cinema.<br/><br/>To conclude, Good Night and Good Luck is essential viewing for anyone interested in this part of history, but also for anyone who wants a drama film that's a little more special than the average one. Excellent casting, very well written and gorgeously filmed, this is truly a gem of a film."

","It's 1953. CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) leads an on-air fight against Senator Joseph McCarthy and his crusade to uncover communists and other unamerican activities. The film follows the CBS news team which includes producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.), wife fellow reporter Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson), and others.<br/><br/>George Clooney is also the writer and director. He decided to strip this of its Hollywood flash by making it black and white, and keeping the sound design to a minimum. It's a smoke-filled representation of the behind the scenes work in the newsroom. It doesn't have the tension for me. It's inside-baseball for the journalist crowd. Clooney can't escape being Clooney and it's hard to see these characters as flesh and blood. The story could have better tension if McCarthy has an actor playing the group's foil. The news footage serves an useful historical reference but it needs a big performance to deliver the intense drama."

","Good Night, and Good Luck starts with a framed narrative in the form of an acceptance speech from Murrow years on, for an award for his services in media. Why place this speech here and at the close of the film, bookending his most infamous moments in the spotlight? We have seen so many of these docu-dramas jump straight into the narrative and throw you into the time capsule world. But here we have a few effects. The first is the immediate moral judgement of the actions of Murrow - we expect, after the rousing call to arms to the people of the media world, so influential and affecting, a hero's story, something that has become mythologised and therefore worthy of being commended. Oddly, within his layer of the film there is the de-mythologising of Murrow too; contrasting the gushing introduction from Mickelson is Murrow's silhouette, swallowing nervously, and the paper he holds in his hand, shaking slightly. The outward shield is of course the copious puffs of cigarette smoke. So we have alternating personas that becomes a recurring theme that is played with even within the bookends of the film - the Murrow everyone saw in his condemnations, and the Murrow off-mic (but not off-camera). The hero becomes humanised. Another effect that becomes more obvious at the film's close is the never-ending cycling of popular media opinion that shifts and morphs to suit its audience and hit those rating. Murrow as a controversial figure during his time on the air, demonised by certain attacks, now being rewarded with an esteemed honour, perfectly demonstrating the hypocrisy and unending ability to switch stances at the drop of a hat of the mass media. <br/><br/>Clooney has utilised the usual technique in inserting real footage of the events within his narrative. This makes by far the most sense of all the examples of this usage I have seen yet. It fits the theme like a glove; most were not there to witness in person the attacks of Joseph McCarthy himself, or the interrogation of the timid Annie Lee Moss, but we endlessly pored over television screens and radio broadcasts that covered the events. The act of scrutiny, of thousands of screens and ears tuning in, each with their own perspective, becomes thoroughly integrated into the film. We can almost hear the collective rise as Welch utters his iconic condemnation, or the hushed, held breaths whenever Murrow takes the stage. Strathairn himself is electric. He has completely submersed himself into Murrow, taking on the cold, steely gaze, mind constantly churning and cigarette endlessly dragging. In his addresses to the public he radiates pure and unadulterated fury that justice might not be served in the courts of America - it is as strong a belief as we can see on our screens. If there is a flaw (though it is not a glaring one) it is that the direction of the attack is perhaps a little on- the-nose. Clooney's political stances have never been hidden away. At one point Strathairn looks right down the camera as if he was addressing not just the fictional audience but the viewer themselves - the furious gaze almost daring us to not see McCarthy for what he really is. But then again, isn't a topic like this meant to elicit such a reaction? Perhaps Clooney is not just pointing at the McCarthyism of the 50s, but events a little more recent."

","This is an important subject from a historical perspective. The ""red scare"" era, where everyone and anyone could be suspected of being a communist simply on the basis of rumours or hearsay, and where lives and careers were ruined because of the sometimes questionable connections that were established, and which gave rise to the otherwise obscure and undistinguished Senator Joseph McCarthy, is a fascinating one. This is even a relevant movie - because to some extent the smear tactics used against communists are being used once again against Muslims today, as politicians try to make names for themselves and win elections by whipping up fear. This is an interesting subject - because it focuses on the work of Edward R. Murrow, one of the greatest reporters of all time, in standing up against McCarthy, and committing himself to bringing the man down. And yet, important, relevant and interesting though it is, this is also a pretty dry presentation.<br/><br/>Some people liked the decision of director (and co-star, as producer Fred Friendly) George Clooney to film this in black and white. I suppose there were reasons for it. First because it gave the movie a nostalgic feel (although increasingly there are fewer people who would feel the nostalgia because black and white television isn't even in the memory banks of very many people under the age of 50.) It might be that a political point was being made - the dangers of everything being seen in black and white terms. There are good guys and bad guys and never the two shall mix. To me, and I do have some memories of black and white TV, the black and white was a distraction. It added little to the movie. Overall, beyond the black and white, I thought the story seemed to lack something in the power department. It was very low key - TOO low key for my liking. Obviously I wasn't expecting an action movie, but I was expecting something a bit more dramatic.<br/><br/>Not that there weren't many good things about this. First, I liked David Strathairn's performance as Murrow. He portrayed Murrow as I would imagine him - a no nonsense, tell it like it is kind of reporter who's willing to butt heads with the powers that be at CBS if he has to in order to tell it like it is. That certainly led to a critique of television that truly relevant today. To what extent does TV news seek to inform, and to what extent does it exist to entertain? How powerful are sponsors in deciding what can and can't be covered? Worthwhile questions, to be sure. I also appreciated the video clips of McCarthy himself. The movie also portrayed the tragedy of CBS newsman Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) who became himself tainted with communism after choosing to associate himself with Murrow's attacks an McCarthy, and ended up committing suicide - although, in reality, several weeks passed between that incident and Hollenback's death.<br/><br/>Too much was made of the relationship between Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson.) Co-workers at CBS, they were also secretly married, because at the time CBS didn't allow fellow employees of the network to be married. Quaint, perhaps, but I didn't think it warranted the amount of screen time it got."

","It would be difficult for serious viewers not to get excitedly caught up in this work. The American news and social commentator Edward R. Murrow was absolutely spot on with his predictions for the future of Television. He was right, not just regards news broadcasting but across the full programming spectrum! And sadly, seems the perpetuation of its ethical downfall lies in the gullibility of viewing audiences who have become equal partners in crime - allowing themselves to be dragged down into the sludge alongside the programmers, writers, producers and sponsors.<br/><br/>Many younger viewers won't even realize they are being compromised daily by the 'less is more' mentality of modern entertainments. I wonder if this important work might help some to question the ethics of a society where so-called grown-ups 'play' 'M and R' rated 'games' ad nauseum and TV News is dished out by matinée style pretty boys and girls - sandwiched between specially programmed promos, product placements, and a barrage of handpicked commercials. Murrow was seeing the giant CBS Corporation dump important social and ethical programs for easy revenue shovelled in with endless re-runs of mindless TV series. Other attempts at serious social comment like David Suskind's ""East Side West Side"" series was dropped by CBS for upsetting some overly powerful sponsors (but hey, surely I understand that sponsors are more important than the truth...well, aren't they?)<br/><br/>Only a couple of minor technical bits interrupted my enjoyment of this serious endeavor...the prolific use of super blow up zoom type lenses to give that 'fly-on-the-wall' feel, at times detracted from the 'look of the fifties' (as these lenses weren't even available in this era - tending to give the film a more 'resent' look). Not that I object at all to the use of modern technology in movies set in the past - it's just that in certain situations, when overused, it can have the effect of giving the subject a somewhat pretentious look. Joyously, most images were steady - some may have even been shot on tripods! This same style of photography was used to give ""The Downhill Racer"" its 'documentary' feel back in the late 60's. A couple of shots appeared to have been compromised by some editing decisions (possibly telling us they had nothing else to replace them with) <br/><br/>And OK... we know more people smoked in the health ignorant 40's and 50's but these shows look very much like they are playing the same game as did the major studios of the times, by taking money from cigarette companies to bankroll their projects. This has a tendency to look somewhat more than simple 'realism', to being a tad suspect. Another modern, over-written and endless TV series ""Mad Men"", bears this same 'suss'look.<br/><br/>Clooney shows no fear in some of his more intelligent projects and this is certainly one to be commended. Perhaps he is a little too in awe of his title character - to the extent of maybe manipulating his audience's emotions but, the equally manipulative bullying tactics of Communist witch hunter, Senator Joseph McCarthy also had to be highlighted - with this being done to strong effect by the use of archival footage. Anyone with a serious interest in the overzealous political pursuits of the day should see this one."

Shortly after this Murrow comes up and tells these people about the importance of television in educating and informing the public of major economic of political events. The film then goes back to 1954 when Murrow and his friend and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and the rest of his news team sough to bring down Joseph McCarthy and his communist witch hunt. I love this film for a number of reasons. I love Murrow and I think that Strathairn does an excellent job in the role. He looks and sounds very much like Murrow. The film is shot in black and white and it just looks beautiful. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is fantastic. I give it an A+ there. I also commend this film for it's great and dramatic showcase of Murrow's famous political attacks on McCarthy. Strathairn recounts several lines used by Murrow on his program and he just does a stellar job with it. Whenever Strathairn speaks in a scene where he recites Murrow you're just drawn in to his words. And this once again is due to the may the film is shot. Clooney did a great job here with his second directorial effort. At the end scene when Friendly walks up to Murrow and tells him that McCarthy is to be censured by the US Senate it's not a moment when you get up and cheer. It's a moment where you are just left with a satisfying feeling as is Murrow. I highly recommend it. Good Night, and Good Luck."

The theme is incredibly contemporary, given our current government's obnoxious appeal to ""State Secrets Privilege"" as an excuse for withholding evidence about what is being done in the taxpayers' name. These days, it seems more like a ploy used by bureaucrats to protect themselves against charges of having wrongly killed and inappropriately spied on citizens, etc. <br/><br/>I'll stick with my original '7' because I do believe that this film is worth watching, regardless of one's political slant.

","I was alive in the early 1950s. And, as far as I remember, life was still in color. So why is this movie in black and white? Well, the artsy fartsies would probably say it brings reality to the story. Really? Because in reality, televisions -- like motion pictures -- at the time were at 1.33:1, not 1.85:1. The CBS studios were in completely separate locations, not in the same building. So from the perspective of making things ""real"", this film doesn't really do that.<br/><br/>Now, not criticizing the film, but reality. In the discussion between William S. Paley and Edward R. Murrow in the film, the issue is the truth about Eugene McCarthy. But it occurred to me that Murrow didn't care so much about revealing the truth about...Liberace when he apparently knew he was being dishonest in an interview.<br/><br/>In some ways, it must have been an easy film to write. Many scenes are verbatim from Edward R. Murrow's television broadcasts. Of course, putting them all together in an interesting sequence was important. I question the opening scenes of the film...boring.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is excellent...I think. I'm not sure any actor could have truly captured the essence of Murrow, but David Strathairn, a superb actor, did about as well as anyone could have. Everyone else is secondary, and it's difficult for us to judge their performances since we don't know much about the real people they represented. However, it seems good.<br/><br/>Of course, the film got rave reviews, which is pretty typical of films that deal with the McCarthy topic. It's certainly not a new topic, but it's a story that must be told over and over because there are always demagogs like Murrow, and they always seem to be conservatives who wish to restrict personal freedoms.<br/><br/>But, as I watched the film, I sensed a lot of self-congratulations on the part of the media.

","Set during the reign of Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunt, Good Night, and Good Luck. is the story of CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow's public battle against the senator. Shot in a beautiful black and white, the film details the pressure put on the public to declare loyalty to the United States and denounce Communism, as well as the struggle to resist that pressure. Murrow was able to leverage his position in the media to expose the evil of McCarthy's crusade, and the film shows the lengths he and his team had to go to do that, as well as some of the contradictions and compromises involved. David Strathairn is brilliant as Murrow, and all in all the film captures the mood and explores the terms at stake in that era with clear purpose. It's also an interesting film on the question of objectivity in journalism. Murrow has a definite perspective, and yet his reporting is fair and accurate. This kind of ""activist"" journalism is more honest and truthful and ultimately informative than the kind of false ""objective"" reporting we've been conditioned to accept as the standard."

"rcolgan","9","0","0","18 June 2014"," The Story of When Logic and Reason Was Used To Combat Fear Mongering and Madness
","During the 1950's there was a wave of communist paranoia where a mixture of government policy and propaganda made everyone afraid that anyone could be a communist. From the kid round the street to your own Gran, the communist could be anyone. Or at least anyone you said it was as the whole thing became a witch hunt, with word alone being enough to give a lifetime in jail as a means of protecting national secrets. But there were no better witch hunters than McCarthy, who would incarcerate people without trial for merely being suspected of Communism. <br/><br/>In Good Night and Good Luck we focus on Edward R Murrow and his loyal team of news investigators who chose to take a stance against these policies. Murrow stood to expose McCarthy for the madman he was. Whilst McCarthy made blank accusations that Murrow was a Communist, Murrow destroyed his arguments through logic and reason. The focus of the film remains on behind the scenes of Murrow's campaign including the struggles that he faced to get out his truth and how he refused to step down from what he knew was right. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, it incorporates archive footage to show all the government actions with figures like McCarthy only ever appearing through old footage. It does not use any actors to recreate any of the government actions within the film. Thus the overall focus of the film remains on Murrow and his team, whilst creating a greater sense of realism through seeing the events really unfold before us. <br/><br/>But more importantly, just like Murrow when he was fighting McCarthy, the archive footage better enforces the idea that it is important to use the facts to back up its arguments. It's keeping clear of the McCarthyism belief of telling us what to think and instead tells us why we should think this way. Just like Murrow did with his audiences, the film treats us as thinking individuals who are allowed to have our own opinions, rather than a maniac such as McCarthy forcing their own beliefs down the public's throats. <br/><br/>It is this journalistic style that leads the film throughout to ensure honesty. It tries to be as factual as it can be on every element, from the financing difficulties that the show faced to the need for honesty amongst the entire film crew from the very start. Whilst the film does side with Murrow, it does not go so far as to glorify him. Instead a balanced view is shown on this issue as it is stated that even Murrow censors the facts to work towards his own point of view. Through details like this, a far more realistic representation of the media is shown and that every person when representing a story will have their own agenda. <br/><br/>On top of the brilliant scripting that remains as factual as possible to the real life events, it is also incredibly shot with a rich black and white style throughout. Partly it just makes it fit in with the archive footage and the standard black and white television sets of the 50's. But more importantly it gives the film a distinct look, with the focus remaining on the people rather than the backgrounds with their facial expressions coming across clearer in the black and white style. Also all the characters are smoking in near to every scene. Whilst a dreadful habit, the great visual of seeing the smoke fill the air better emphasises the office environment that they are working in. <br/><br/>It's this cool style mixed with the films factual nature which puts this amongst my favourite films of 2005 and why I view it as a serious overlook for the 2006 Oscars. Good Night and Good Luck shows us the potential that technologies of television reporting can be capable of. Murrow proves how the technology allows for opinions to be heard and for people to be protected against government policies. This message that the film tells remains eternal, as great reporters like Murray remain as important now as they ever were to keep government powers in check and working for the people."

David Strathairn, well I don't know how he is meant to give a better performance on film than he does in this film.

We know McCarthy was a liar, a bully and a bit of a nut, we know Cohn was vile. Strathairn's Murrow is not quite the perfect hero you thought he would be: in rejecting his friend Don Hollenbeck's obvious appeals for help we are presented with a Murrow who is a little bit selfish, a little self-obsessed, and a little bit uncaring.<br/><br/>The scene where Murrow is advised of Hollenbeck's death is a powerful one, and Strathairn's acting is majestic: as Murrow watches the wonderful singer performing in the studio next door, the tears in his eyes are fifty percent grief and fifty percent guilt.<br/><br/>I would love Clooney and Strathairn to get together again for another film featuring the Murrow character.

The movie is no nonsense drama of how one aggressive reporter takes on a senator who believes shadow of Communism will kill America so every person who has the history or present connecting to communism beliefs should be called as threat to the security of nation.

Clooney's direction is astute, the pace careful and steady, and the editing exceptional. It's also worth noting that it's not so much a biographical film of a man, and instead a biographical film of an important key time. The entire cast delivers, but the real star here is David Strathairn, whose portrayal is that of a brooding, serious, yet charismatic man just trying to get the truth across. If I have seen Strathairn anywhere before, I certainly don't remember, and that's because it doesn't feel so much of a performance rather than the actual person from the time period. It's not a showy one, but at no time does he come across as anything other than Edward Murrow. Overall, a great film."

","I've just barely gotten into it but already the very clever script, sensational soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals have won me over. The contemporary use of black and white in films is often a cue that something sincere and artful is being attempted, and within moments of it's opening frame I was reassured that my critical attention would be rewarded. As Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) is introducing Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) to a banquet room of elegantly attired news media elite, the camera settles on the off stage shadowed profile of the acclaimed newsman, his head bowed slightly, the intensity of his mood made evident by the back lit dragon breath cigarette smoke streaming from his nostrils and mouth. This transcendent moment establishes a quality that bodes well for the remainder of the film, and sets a lofty standard to which all films should aspire. Magically, I was made to predict - to understand - exactly what it was that Murrow was about to proclaim to, and stun, the attentive audience; my own powers of reason and intuition had been expertly recruited as sympathetic combatants in this symbolic war of ideals. I have just experienced cinematic poetry of the highest order that could very possibly be mistaken for extremely subtle propaganda. Or vise versa! Bravo, Grant Heslov and George Clooney for brandishing the double edged sword of paradox. I have just been graciously reassured that this stylish tale will in no way be an unremarkable obvious cliché.<br/><br/>Esthetically, George Clooney as Fred Friendly is certainly a bit of a stretch, but so far he's convincing as Murrow's similarly principled co-conspirator. I've just been introduced to Robert Downey Jr.'s and Patricia Clarkson's characters and they're sensational, and I look forward to seeing more of their nuanced performances. Frank Langella as William Paley, the burdened head of network, is the epitome of restrained arrogance. And Ray Wise as the ill fated Don Hollenbeck has just made his first appearance with his usual inspired excellence. Can this get any better?<br/><br/>I'm now going to resume watching, confident that the ensuing historical recreation/fictional contrivance is the product of enlightened, inspired, sensitive, generous, and talented minds. That's a great way to feel at the beginning of a movie, and it's the only way to be when confronting what might be art. If the remainder of the film somehow fails to fulfill the high promise of these initial scenes, I will be thoroughly shocked. In fact, I'm more than confident that I won't be returning here to this comment later to correct the following statement. This is one of the finest films I have experienced in many, many years, and is equaled by a scant few in this twenty first century. No doubt, I'll be watching and enjoying this very fine film more than once."

","This is only the second time George has sat in the director's chair, on a motion picture. He's definitely picked up quite a few of the tricks of the trade, and this does not feel like the work of someone new at their job. This grips the viewers' attention right from the start, and maintains it throughout. I was emotionally invested in the well-developed, credible and human(unlike the visuals, not black and white) characters, and I was not let down. The cinematography is excellent, not drawing attention to itself, it's about the clever, realistic and smart dialog and the events that unfold. This also convincingly captures the busy, focused environment of a news station, and without being overwhelming or noisy, either. The acting is all compelling; Wise and Strathairn deliver what I would argue are by far their most unforgettable performances of their respective careers. This has a marvelous cast, as well. The set is fantastic. All of this would of course mean less if the subject matter wasn't as important as it was; the witch-hunt(it got downright Kafkaesque at times) of McCarthy's search for Communists. This does not mock the concerns about the ideology during the Cold War, and it does show negatives about supporters of both political parties. The film can't be claimed to demonize the late senator himself, with his part played by real footage of him. There is occasional use of moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with sneak previews, a trailer, a commentary track with Clooney and fellow script-author Heslov, and it is interesting and, if you like aforementioned Hollywood star's sense of humor, funny, and last but not least, a 15 and a half minute informative behind-the-scenes featurette with magnificent quotes by Murrow that help paint him as an honest journalist with integrity. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the story. 8/10"
"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","6 January 2010"," Buried in historical sensibility, with a careful and respectful study of an organisation's reaction to accusations.
","Good Night, and Good Luck is a superb capturing of a tense and suspicious time in which the very identity of certain men is called into question by those who believe they have the power to command and control if it is, in their view, for the good of the nation. The film covers these individuals and their reaction to the accusation the're guilty of certain 'bad' deeds, all playing out at a very important time, both politically and in regards to media progression and overall modernity. Beneath all this is the very gradual, very natural realisation that television and television journalism can be used to the powerful degrees that are possible.<br/><br/>Clooney's 2005 film, shot in glorious black and white adding to the 1950s period feel, begins with a montage of various people at an expensive function talking to one another. But what they're talking of is impossible to make out due to the limited time we are given to focus on one group of people twinned with the fact the entire sequence is drowned out by diegetic jazz music compliments of the in house band. What follows is a speaker at the function, talking in front of this array of different people about television of the time and what might become of it in the future. He warns of what it might become, for the bad, and how it'll have the ability to contribute to the dumbing-down of society if misused. We realise, briefly, that during the preceding montage we were merely observing stuff on screen and people interacting without the ability to take in what they were saying. We were transfixed, zombified even, as an hypnotic score and clear things being exchanged were playing out but without sound – maybe sound was not needed. We were passive, absorbing stuff on screen without truly being able to engage with it, much in the way the speaker warned television would become if misused.<br/><br/>The sequence highlights the ease in which it is to just observe and absorb, two characteristics or actions one might associate with the masses of items on television in the contemporary age of now. Andre Bazin once wrote about his dislike for the montage as it was a passage of play in a moving image piece which essentially told the viewer what to see and what to focus on, and that it rendered the experience false, pushing it away from a realistic sense in the process as things are progressed in an unnatural manner. What springs to mind when we think of television nowadays anyway? We think highly kinetic, colourful, blurry nonsense for most of the time; punctuated by advertisements of a similar nature. Good Night, and Good Luck sees one man talk into a camera, for extended periods, without much in the way of cutting away delivering important speeches on specific subjects. Quite a contrast, but it's the substance of what he's talking about that counts. The film is about an era in which television saw one man, a certain Edward R. Murrow (Strathairn) whom was addressing the crowd in the opening scene, attempt to lay everything out for what it truly is set amidst the backdrop of paranoia and politics as the American Media and American Government, respectively, fell out over the item of individuals suspected of being enemies of the state.<br/><br/>The early signs of this falling out occurs when Clooney's character, acting within his own piece proving he can juggle both roles at once in an effortless manner, named Fred Friendly; a producer of Murrow's talk show named See It Now , is challenged for attempting to broadcast a supposedly Communist story to the watching nation. This jousting that the military, a sub-division of the government, do with the professionalism driven; usually typically egotistically driven journalists at a national TV broadcast centre over the ability to get across information and broadcast 'the truth' to a nation makes for fascinating viewing. In what is a battle of words between a group of people at the peak of their respective careers, and all the power that comes with these respective positions, it is brilliantly played out tale of two sides desperately attempting to get across what they perceive as 'the truth', simultaneously to one another and the watching public. The film is a glorious blending of ideas and historical reconstruction that explores the real-life questioning of the extent of McCarthyism; combining an overall reflective aura with moments that sees the film dip into a more sombre mood; skip upwards into a more positive refrain when the characters momentarily succeed in something and it knows when to deliver the facts and use the necessary found footage to show the man McCarthy himself. There are few tricks and few gimmicks, just an unadulterated focus on the subject matter, seeing Good Night, and Good Luck act as a wondrously guided, well executed piece which informs and entertains in equal measure."
"silverscreen888","9","0","0","22 October 2009"," Powerful Fictionalized B/W Biography of Edward R.Murrow vs. McCarthyism
","""Good Night and Good Luck"" (2005) is what movie makers should call a fictionalized biography; but its form is that of a documentary biography. Within this film of ideas, written by George Clooney and Grant Heslov, the opponent of honest news professional Edward R. Murrow and his team, Senator Joseph McCarthy, is seen within and quoted only from video news sources and documented speeches and utterances. The choice of black-and-white photography was made here, owing no doubt to a desire to incorporate period 1950s footage, but I argue this also works dramatically as do the period makeup, hairstyles, clothing, sets and properties to help establish an historical era, its communications, power sources, lighting and restrictions. But this is a film is about responsibility in non-fiction, the honor and regulations that men establish and earn or transgress. The storyline of the film can, I assert, be briefly stated; but it is a more complex achievement than at first it appears to be. The junior senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, a neocon of the 1950s,era, is conducting a campaign under the aegis of anti-Communism. His witch hunt, founded on the false premise of a massive infiltration of the U.S. government by pro-Communist pr-Russian sympathizers, makes it dangerous for anyone to assail the man and his anti- concept; anyone opposing him is also then smeared by the Senator as being pro-communist , not anti-McCarthy nor anti McCarthyist tactics. Against the desires of public television monopoly 'tsar' William Paley, but with his reluctant consent, leading reporter Edward R. Murrow begins to reveal McCarthy through honest reporting of his falsehoods, lies, fraud, smears, invented data and fear-mongering. In the end, a major clash of the two is seen to be inevitable. The film I found to be impressive in its seriousness, its picture of the fear sown among men in the news business mirroring that in the minds of nation's populace at large. Listening to fine jazz singer Diana Reeves, smoking cigarettes, drinking after work., the newsmen of CBS TV at work are made a microcosm of the nation as a whole; they, the supposed guardians of independent-minded information reporting, are as endangered by McCarthyist tactics, disinformation and abuses as are the citizens of U.S. then--or in any other era. It is the universality of the threat in this film posed by non-objective nonfiction purveying that gives the film its unusual condensed force; false advertising of cigarettes, limited interviews such as one with then closet-gay pianist Liberace, deleterious effects on hiring and promotion decisions, works of fictions and news, voting and business conduct and lives are used by the authors to zero in on cost of unrealism to a nation of the endangered. Waldo Sanchez's departments of hair and makeup, costume head Louise Frogley, set decorator Jan Pascale Art Director Christa Munro and Production Designer Jim Bissell and cinematographer Robert Elswit all contribute to a surprisingly powerful and unified look and feel of an eariier era, one many other directors and production teams have not captured I believe half so well. Director and co-star George Clooney had tried black-and-white productions before; his success here seems to be based on those strong experiments. He acquits himself well as Fred Friendly; David Strathaim lacks some emotional impact, but is beautifully-trained and suitably serious as the great Murrow. As William Paley, 'tsar' of CBS, Frank Langella is able to be by turns courageous and himself frightened; no one else in the cast is given a lengthy part but the roles are adequately played or better in every case by my standards. A telling story point is that two members of the CBS team are secretly married, against corporate policy; and this is used against them in time, presumably in the name of objectivity in news, even as the network's head sells out not only Murrrow but American journalism to the forces that since the 1950s have filtered what U.S.ers are permitted to see and hear through ""postmodernist"" anti-realist ideas, attitudes and practices. No critic worth listening to can report on this film I assert without recognizing that Murrow's final speech in the film, a strong warning against allowing pragmatic pretensions to replace individual ethics, applies even more to minds in our deregulated and anti-rights era than it did to those in Murrow's earlier period. This is a film, for the reasons cited, perhaps to be watched over and over. The movie deserved best picture and best adapted screenplay awards. Mr. Clooney deserves our deep thanks I assert for having the courage and vision to have made such a film, especially during the neocon regime of George W. Bush."

","George Clooney takes only a minor role in 'Good Night and Good Luck', his second film as a director, which from my perspective is a blessing; I definitely prefer him behind the camera, for the movie is an atmospheric invocation of another time, when journalists of integrity promoted cigarettes and the terrible Senator Joeseph McCarthy sought to ruin the lives of anyone who had even the faintest connection with communism. David Strathairn is excellent as Ed Murrow, one journalist who eventually took McCarthy on (although I have heard it said that he waited till the peak of his opponent's power had passed before striking), but who couldn't defeat the rise of television's relentless commercial ethic. As a film, it's not quite the equal of 'All the President's Men': telling only the story of McCarthy's downfall, we never quite get the sense of how mighty he was, or the true level of bravery involved in confronting him; and McCarthy is a man with whom it is quite impossible to sympathise from a modern perspective. But the effectiveness of Clooney's recreation of the 1950s means that it's a gripping tale, in spite of the relative weakness of plot."

","A brilliant American film for the 21st century. One more film on McCarthy, you might say. Yes indeed. But this one is different. Different because it is in black and white and it is a real smoking factory : politically correctness is forbidden. Different because it is not about the cinema but essentially about television, CBS. The real fourth power of the media : the power of journalism reinforced by the power of images. This television produces news programs that become the 21st century gospels. This power is absolutely enormous. And yet it is not CBS that brings McCarthy down, nor Murrow. It is McCarthy himself who brings himself down when he decides to react to Murrow on television and rebut him. In other words he falls in the trap laid in front of him and is unable to cope with this medium : he appears like what he is, a bigot, and he attacks someone who is beyond doubt in the wide public, a gospel writer as I have already said. Then McCarthy is doomed. This film hence shows something most people ignore on the old continent as well as on the new continent. The USA, like any human society, contains both good and evil because good cannot exist without evil and vice versa. But the USA, like any human society founded on the belief that individuals have rights and are fundamentally free as individuals and as citizens, will contain evil by its own efforts because good is necessarily stronger, even if at times it takes a few years to get around an obstacle and get into a dominant position. It is true some damage may have been caused during the period when evil had the upper hand, but good will push that evil down and aside sooner or later. Unluckily in such a society evil will find its way back up one day and will have to be pushed down again. But that is democracy and to believe that good, provided we all agree on what good is, can triumph once and for all is just as narrow-minded as the belief that communism had triumphed in 1917 once and for all. History has proved how wrong such a view was. The only criticism I may do is that the film believes television can be an education tool, and thus it does not understand that the medium itself goes against this idea. He says that television is entertaining and isolating people and it is in a way extremely wrong. Television is entertaining for sure but it is not isolating people, it is by mediatic essence homogenizing people, building vast all and everyone including consensuses, the famous global village of McLuhan. Yet the film is conscious of this shortcoming when it says that television can be an education tool if the watchers, the audience wants it to be such a tool. The place and role of television in society and the very medium it is goes against that eventual desire. Television can be used to educate people but it is not its ""natural"" mediatic essence. It is true it played a great role in the McCarthy case but it is the press that played that role in the Watergate case, and it is the press that has played that role ever since and it had even before the Watergate. Television is then essentially the relay of such mediatic investigation, when it is already out and has come out most of the time in the press. We may regret television not to be what we would like it to be, but a medium is a medium and its essence cannot be negated. It is like history. If you negate the essence of history, the natural course of history, history will sooner or later come back with a vengeance and make you pay for that vanity of yours. Think of the Soviets who tried to force history into their vision of the future. In 1989 history came back and leveled all these cogitations and pretensions. Think of the Chinese and how Mao's egalitarian communism was dismantled and how that decision liberated the energies of millions of people, and think how this liberation of human power is still not complete, and yet their experience shows that strict regulations are necessary to protect both the market economy and the people of the country against the unavoidable greed and cheating instinct of some individuals in that society.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" proved to be a very accurate and engaging film telling about 50s TV host Edward R. Murrow. Brilliant actor (though lesser known) David Strathairn, from films like ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""Sneakers"" is perfectly cast here and has his role as Murrow down perfectly, right down to his gestures and ways of speaking. It has a feel similar to ""All the President's Men,"" as a documentary meant simply to tell the true story. This film does not really attempt to go into grave details about much of Murrow's personal life or the lives of any working with him. The film is not necessarily meant to entertain, though it does at times. I was surprised that a film like this managed to squeeze all of the facts of the true story into a 90-minute movie. It is not boring; it is not long enough to become boring. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey, Jr., Jeff Daniels, and George Clooney (also director) is excellent and very realistic. Strathairn was robbed not to win the Oscar for this superb depiction of Murrow. Not absolutely perfect, but rarely do I see a film like this that doesn't have many dull spots. Worth seeing, one of the best documentary-like films I've seen.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"tavm","9","0","0","13 September 2008"," George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. makes a fine dramatized documentary
","In making Good Night, and Good Luck., director George Clooney has made a nearly perfect dramatization of the issues legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (perfectly played by David Straithain) had with the ""junior senator from Wisconsin"", Joseph R. McCarthy and the way he tried to ""infiltrate"" Communists in the United States. There's also some suspense when one of Murrow's assistants receives some info from an associate of McCarthy that accuses Murrow of having some ""Red"" connections himself. That assistant, played by Robert Downey, Jr., tells the associate that no one would believe him since publicly, Murrow has proved to the public what a patriot he was since his radio reports from Britain since World War II! Clooney acquits himself nicely taking the supporting part of Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. One Friendly scene that really impressed me was an argument with a Colonel (played by ""24""s Glen Morshower) whose military base had basically fired a soldier named Milo Radulovich because of his father's Communist sympathies branding the son as a ""risk"". The Colonel did not want that story to air. While many of Straithain's lines as Murrow came verbatim from many of ""See It Now""s transcripts, there are some liberties taken with when some events took place (like when the Army-McCarthy hearings were on live, Ed was not doing his other show, ""Person to Person"" since that show aired on primetime and the hearings were on the afternoons). Also, seeing Diane Reeves performing her jazz stylings in rehearsal at an adjacent CBS soundstage throughout the movie was obviously meant to ironically comment on many events depicted here such as ""How High the Moon"" coming before Murrow eulogizes on a fellow newsman's death (that of Don Hollenbeck who's played by Ray Wise). The screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov (who plays a young Don Hewit here), contained enough info to explain why Murrow felt the way he did about the senator and why his boss, CBS chairman Bill Paley (Frank Langella) who Ed is on a first-name basis with, would initially support him before complaining of an ""upset stomach"" concerning the newsman's point-of-view. Other good performances come from Jeff Daniels as a liaison between Murrow and ""See It Now""s sponsor, Alcoa (by the way, check out the irony between the ""glamorous"" smoking of many of the characters and the way ""Person to Person""s sponsor, Kent Cigarattes, tells you how good smoking is in addressing viewers skepticism of many TV messages!) and, as a Louisiana resident who loves to point out performers from the Pelican state, New Orleans native Patricia Clarkson as another Murrow employee who's secretly married to Downey. If there's some quibble with this movie, it's with the long footage devoted to accused ""Communist spy"" Annie Lee Moss which almost stops the movie though Murrow's explanation at the end does make some points. So to anyone interested in this fascinating piece of television news history, I highly recommend Good Night, and Good Luck."

","This is an astute, assured piece of film-making from George Clooney who shows that he is also a talent behind the camera. He combines delicately composed black and white photography with real archive footage to create the mood of paranoia and manipulation in the American media of the 1950's. This coupled with an evocative but simple mise-en-scene, evoking the feel of the classic Hollywood era, accomplished art direction and lighting and some effective linear editing give it the feel of an actual news documentary. This is an important, engrossing and informative work on the ideology and control of the media with great performances by a top notch cast.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Chris Brown","8","0","0","3 April 2008"," fantastic performances
","Let me warn you that the beginning of this film throws so many names at you that you might feel a bit lost. (We all know who Senator McCarthy is, but I bet you don't know the names and jobs of every person who worked at CBS in the 1950's.) Rest assured, if you watch this movie without distractions, you will figure out who is who.<br/><br/>Excellent casting and wonderful acting. David Strathairn has always been great. (Check out his work in Sneakers and The Bourne Ultimatum.) Here, this star gets the chance to shine as the lead character, newsman Edward R. Murrow. George Clooney is a bit too good-looking to play Murrow's producer, but he has the right chemistry on screen with Strathairn. Frank Langella (as CBS chief executive William Paley) has such a powerful presence that viewers immediately sense the intimidation that any CBS employee must have felt whenever they were in the same room as Paley. The tension between Paley and Murrow feels incredibly real.<br/><br/>Although modern actors play the parts of CBS employees, the movie's creators choose to show almost everyone else in authentic archival footage. Real footage of Congressional hearings and of television interviews is blended seamlessly into the film. No actor portrays Senator Joseph McCarthy; he is only seen in archival footage. I was impressed that the movie's creators were able to pull off what must have been a difficult task.<br/><br/>The film also succeeds at transporting viewers into the 1950's. The costumes, the hair, the sets, and the soundtrack are absolutely perfect. The use of music is right on the money.<br/><br/>Too many filmmakers feel that an ""important"" film has to be at least 2 hours long. Their inflated egos tell them that 90-minute runtimes are only appropriate for teen sex comedies. Too often, they try to fit too much history into a single movie. George Clooney and Grant Heslov do not make this mistake. This movie selects a very specific moment in U.S. history, tells the story very well, and then ends. Ninety minutes was all this movie needed.<br/><br/>I have no complaints about this movie and cannot find any flaws. However, I am not ranking it a ""10"" simply because I have to be profoundly moved by a drama to give it such a high score. I am glad the writers told the story as accurately as possible, but there are other true stories in history that are more entertaining."
"lee_a_scott","7","0","0","2 February 2008"," Fair and balanced film - unlike the characters.
","The allegory in this serious piece from George Clooney would only be hard to spot if you were locked in an isolation chamber and were not watching the movie  otherwise it kind of hits you in the face with its politics. Is that a bad thing? Well, that depends on your politics, I guess. Personally, I kinda liked it. Whilst blunt, I thought it managed to avoid being preachy, and the actors all get chance to act. There are a couple of nice side-steps, and the characters all feel like real people. Oddly, it's mostly Clooney who looks somehow out of place, but that's a small gripe. This is the sort of film that is nobody's favourite film, and will probably be forgotten by history, but it's a nice little history lesson and, worryingly, will probably resonate with the times more often than it doesn't."

","This movie is lovely and it contains very much details for the viewer, but what I miss is a intrinsic controversial storyline which raises the subject to a higher level of human thoughts. The fact that George Clooney played in this movie gives the story a little bit of more popularity, but I doubt if this was needed. In my opinion the story became more fiction, than reality. Which had a negative effect on the quality of the movie. For the George Clooney fans it was enough to see a film directed and partly written by George Clooney, to see Clooney also on the screen was too much. Not because of the quality of the acting, just because of the fact that if you want to be a director, just be a director and don't be an actor also. Because this doesn't give the comfort to believe that George Clooney is a good director: which he is. Beside of that I think he could do it better if he didn't act as well. This fact shows actually that Clooney does 'love' acting more than directing! What indeed is logically, but he really should make another controversial movie in future... I look forward to watch a new Clooney-directed movie!"

","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a good film. The thing that is bothersome is that it could have been a great film, given a bit of tweaking.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a deceptive film. From the commercials and advertising campaign, you would think that it was a film about the fight to bring down the dreadful McCarthy. You'd be wrong. This is not a film about McCarthyism and its collapse, but rather about television at the time of the before-mentioned collapse. George Clooney's messages in this film are mostly about censorship and the corruption involved in major TV stations. This is actually the film's biggest flaw.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are the times when we are able to see the slightly doctored broadcasts that brought McCarthy down. David Strathairn's impeccable performance spruces these interesting segments up. The rest of the film is what keeps it from greatness.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we are forced to view the unimportant and dull conflicts that the other characters in the story are going through. These take us away from the interesting McCarthy sub-plot and bring us towards the boring moral tales about the television industry. George Clooney's acting makes these side-stories even more dull and less authentic. Unlike the other major actors and actresses in the film, Clooney acts very casually, as if the film were supposed to take place in the 2000s rather than the 1950s. Still, Strathairn's performance and the documentary segments make this film good."

The actors in this carefully, yet delightfully underplayed movie realistically inhabit both the characters they inhabit and illuminate the paranoid 1950's brilliantly. I found myself completely immersed in the story and cannot ask more of any book or movie.<br/><br/>Unlike most Hollywood nonsense where the stars seem to constantly, barely escape ever more implausibly massive explosions, this movie relies on an ensemble of highly skilled actors gently crafting an extremely believable micro-universe.<br/><br/>The statements contained in the movies including an excerpt from a broadcast by President Eisenhower are relevant to the new millennium."

Much like All the President's Men in my opinion, this film teaches a lesson about a dark era in our own history.

It really does show just how free the so called ""land of the free"" really was (and maybe still is?).<br/><br/>The movie feels almost like a fly on the wall documentary, it's realism is superb as is the performances from the actors.

","I'm surprised that I'm in such disagreement with so many of the reviewers, not to mention the Oscar nominating committee regarding this movie. Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed it very much and wanted to see how it turned out. But the reason I enjoyed it was mainly because it portrayed a significant and damaging period in U.S. history which I found fascinating. And yes, some of the acting performances were really excellent, David Strathairn in particular. But, as a whole, the movie was awful! The 1958 introduction essentially is a spoiler for the rest of the (1953) setting. That meant that there was really no suspense whatsoever. Even those who might not know anything about the McCarthy era would be unlikely to feel any great sense of involvement in the story. The cinematography, clearly something that caught the attention of many, gets in the way of the movie itself. Do we really need the film to be in black and white just because it happened on the TV of the 1950s? The continuity is hopeless. Most of the time, the actors (not Strathairn, fortunately) give their lines as quietly as possible as presumably they are some kind of secret that we shouldn't be in on. But the worst thing is that there is no characterization at all. We come away feeling that we really don't much care what happened to these people. Wouldn't it have been nice to make McCarthy a real person in the movie? Rather than just a bunch of period film footage? It's hard to get worked up about the ""bad guy"" when he's just a cut-out character. My recommendation is to see it if you love history. But if you want drama, or action, there are probably much better movies out there."
"raaesquire","8","0","0","4 June 2006"," The Best Picture of 2005
","While I rate Good Night, and Good Luck with an 8/10, that is because it is not perfect, nor were the excellent films (except for Crash) that were also nominated for best picture. Good Night and Good Luck is definitely an excellent educational piece for aspiring journalists and politicians. It is good to note that Murrow defied the advertisers and the executives by offering his opinion in an intelligent matter, unlike using 'comedy' or exploiting the woes of others (Michael Moore, the hacks at Fox News). Murrow had a sense of dignity about him, and was able to take down the ruthless McCarthy. If Murrow can use his wits to take down that jackass, any journalist can abandon dependence on technology's excesses to bring down the criminals that run this country today. But, we are fat and comfortable, as Mr. Murrow said.<br/><br/>As for the film itself...<br/><br/>It's not perfect. While I offer my Kudos to George Clooney for integrating actual footage of McCarthy and so forth, sometimes you can't help but feel such a method causes an uneven balance between the actors in the film and archival footage. But, this is only minor, as it is more effective than having actors play McCarthy and his cronies.<br/><br/>The good parts obviously outweigh the minor problems: Straitharn should've been the best actor of 2005. The writing is top notch, as the length of the film is perfect to get an adequate message across. George Clooney did not deserve Best Director at the Academy Awards (as Ang Lee, a more experienced director, won this award), but watch out for him in the future. After seeing Good Night and Good Luck, it certainly seems bright.<br/><br/>How Crash, with its horrible portrayal of race relations, won Best Picture over this, well I don't know."

","When one considers the schlock (albeit very entertaining) that Clooney has been seen in over the years it has been a pleasure of his directed work that it seems to play on many levels. The personal and the political are never far away and these are skillfully blended with dramatic and comedic tensions.<br/><br/>'Good night and good luck' is perhaps his most edgy work to date - for a major Hollywood name this is strongly political work casting glances askance at the current US administration as well as gazing piercingly at the events of the McCarthy era and revealing the terror ('the terror is right here in this room') that seeped into every niche of American life during that period. The depiction of Ed Morrow as the quintessential principled TV journalist brooding over the relentless nature of the confrontation with McCarthy is sensitive and fullblooded. No glamour there. The nods and winks to film noir are clear and the spare dialogue and sets contribute to an overall feeling of authenticity.<br/><br/>Personal triumph and tragedy are dissected in all their terrifying starkness, and all the time the director is tugging at out conscience, saying look at today, look at the 'War on terror', the lies and the paranoia. We've been here before."

","In 1953, Edward R. Murrow stood up for a lieutenant named Milo Radulovich, whom the Air Force tried to discharge from the Air Force Reserve as a security risk due to his father's subscription to a newspaper published by the American Slav Congress, a periodical which had been labeled as a Communist organization. Radulovich's indictment came in the form of documents in a sealed envelope, and his severance came without him or his attorney being allowed to see it. Murrow denounced the Air Force's actions as un-American because, regardless of his father's political leanings, they violated Radulovich's right of due process. Murrow insisted that the son shouldn't bear the sins of the father. Murrow and producer Fred Friendly (whom Murrow called his partner), had been wanting to take on arch-conservative senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin and his campaign of terror for months, and the Radulovich episode gave them the ammunition. A month after the episode aired, Radulovich was reinstated. What follows is a battle between the rights of free speech and the right for the people to know and national security.<br/><br/>The film is almost perfectly cast. David Strathairn is stunning in his portrayal of Ed Murrow and George Clooney (who also directed) is effective as Fred Friendly. Frank Langella (as CBS boss William Paley) has very little screen time, but makes the most of it. Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson (the secretly married Joe and Shirley Wershba) and Ray Wise (Don Hollenbeck) ably put forth the pressures the real people who worked for Murrow faced when they took on McCarthy. In Hollenbeck's case, sadly, the pressure lead to suicide.<br/><br/>Murrow's message was simple: ""dissent should never be confused with disloyalty."" It's a belief that's relevant today as ever.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" proves that you don't need a $100 million budget and flashy visuals to make a good film."

","Ed Murrow, I believe, was an intellectual! Accused by many of taking sides. This may be true but as the film stated, the other side is well represented. The political environment of America is one that fascinates and confuses me. Like all things in this world it appears to repeat itself.<br/><br/>""We must remember always, that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another, we will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason."" In recent times, this statement is once again completely untrue in America. Accusation is proof. Look at Iraq and the accusation of WMDs with no solid proof. The majority of ordinary decent citizens in the McCarthy era, the ones that lived in fear, most likely had no idea what communism was. When you think about it, communism would be something to embrace except that it is too theoretical to put into practice. The thing to fear is a suppressive political regime. And if the paranoia created by the fear creates another suppressive political regime then who is the enemy? As far as I can see, America still lives in fear, still paranoid. The new word for communist is unpatriotic. The very thing that Ed Murrow prided himself on, reporting the truth, challenging the status quo and ""bouncing ideas"" has been abandoned in American journalism. An industry given over to sensationalism and ""insulating society from reality"".<br/><br/>I know there is very little about the actual film written here. The fact of the matter is that this is not a very visual film, it is a dialog based intellectual film. What is said is as important as what is not said and the most important thing is the thought and words of the viewer afterwards. George Clooney is no ground breaking director. This film won't blow your mind. It will fascinate you and make you think. It is amazing how in your face propaganda can be, and then a film like this comes along that deliver a subtle message. No even necessarily the truth, but to question yourself as to what is the truth!<br/><br/>Some minor criticisms: the quality of the sound was a bit lacking and I felt the story could have gone on for much longer. It was difficult to figure out if this was a film about Ed Murrow or just about his battle with the junior senator from Wisconsin."

Well, at this stage, the first thing that's evident to me is that the two films that received the most (and most coveted) awards are, in fact, the ones that I found least satisfactory, i.e. CRASH and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN! While CAPOTE and MUNICH are both fine pieces of work, the film that I feel really should have won  and, having been left empty-handed on awards night, means that it was well and truly snubbed!  is, in fact, George Clooney's second stab at directing (I've missed out on his debut CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND [2002] and, I guess, I should make it a point now to check that one out)! <br/><br/>Barely over 90 minutes in length and shot on a low budget in black-and-white (the gleaming cinematography is first-rate), it really harks back to the hard-hitting American cinema of the 50s and 60s  and, for me, that's quite an achievement in itself! Even if Clooney himself ended up the winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for SYRIANA (which I haven't watched yet), I feel that his direction was a lot more focused  and, well, interesting  than that of Ang Lee for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN; likewise, while Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote deserved all the praise that was showered on it (a fact which I commented on in my recent review of that film), I also feel that David Strathairn's performance as another real-life celebrity  Edward R. Murrow  was even more impressive (if anything, because it was understated as opposed to showy) and, for lack of a better word, iconic.<br/><br/>Dealing with one of the most fascinating  and painful  events in American political history, the film utilizes ample stock footage to throw us back into (rather than merely recreate) the paranoia that swept the country in the Cold War era, though attention must be paid for the narrative to be followed in detail. While Strathairn (in the role of a lifetime) is the nominal lead, the film actually features an ensemble cast that includes Clooney himself, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels and, most welcome of all, wonderful bits  in pivotal roles  by Frank Langella (as the long-suffering head of CBS, producer of Murrow's McCarthy-bashing programme) and Ray Wise (as Murrow's fellow journalist who cracks under the strain of the Anti-Communist persecution)."

","The events this movie portrays happened over 50 years ago... and yet they happen today again. As such the work is poignant. As a history lesson, for those who don't know history, it is extremely well done. As a movie, it is somewhat unfulfilling. There is no conclusion to the action. In order for this movie to have worked completely, it would have had to have focused upon McCarthy himself and show his downfall, partly caused by Murrow's heroic commentaries. As it is, we see Murrow's work and his valiant determination to stand up to the right wing demagoguery of the self serving McCarthy. McCarthyism is all around us today, making the movie apropos. Instead of communism, now it's terrorism...the republicans have to incite the masses to fight something. Of course, terrorism is real (and has been for decades.) But now they use it to incarcerate people without trial, send some to foreign countries for torture, declare war on countries to fatten the pockets of their favorite corporations and... as usual, accuse anyone who has a different point of view of being ""soft of terrorism.""

","Watching ""Goodnight, and good luck"" feels at times like watching a multi-scene one act play, with the interlude between the scenes enriched by beautiful vocal performance of favorite jazz numbers by Dianne Reeves.<br/><br/>In mesmerizing black and white photography, the movie opens with languid camera lens roaming across faces at an evening event, to the nostalgic lyrics of ""When I fall in love"" in the background. Then, after a brief introduction, the gentleman to be honoured appears. Edward R. Murrow (played wonderfully by David Strathairn), despite the hitherto light, jovial atmosphere, starts to deliver his speech with characteristic seriousness. The movie then flashes back to the main story, and comes back at the end to conclude with the remainder of Murrow's speech.<br/><br/>This movie is a re-enactment of a well known part of recent US history, the downfall of communist-witch hunter Joe MaCarthy, a downfall brought by his own self-destruction, many say. This movie however see it from the perspective of Murrow, who most agree has a part to play in bringing down MaCarthy, although they may not agree on how large that part is. The story is told with exceptional detachment, sparing the audience of cheap thrills of poetic justice triumph. Furthermore, it starts at the point when the downfall is about to begin and therefore does not show MaCarthy at his most powerful viciousness.<br/><br/>This is an important movie for young people of this generation to see, not just in the US, but all over the world. Without any preaching, this movie reminds us all of this simple sense of honesty and truth that should never be forgotten. There is a secondary, but almost as important theme, as addressed in Murrow's speech - are we contented to let TV be just ""wires, lights and a box""? There is such potential for it to inform that it's just a shame that it's only there to amuse.<br/><br/>This movie is also vastly entertaining, unless your idea of entertainment is limited to a car chase. Just to hear Strathairn's monologues is superb entertainment. But there's even occasional flashes of sense of humour. When asked about his meeting with a general, Friendly replies to Murrow, ""It's not a general; it's two colonels."" ""Well, that makes it a general"", quips Murrow.<br/><br/>Strathairn, as mentioned, immortalizes Murrow on the screen. George Clooney plays an uncharacteristically low-keyed (for Clooney) Fred Friendly, producer of Murrow's TV program that contributes to bringing down MaCarthy. There's also a fantastic supporting cast of Murrow's loyal colleagues and friends at the CBS. Clooney's direction is deft and no nonsense. MaCarthy plays himself, i.e. via newsreel footage ""borrowed"" for this movie. <br/><br/>""Goodnight, and good luck"" is the best of the Oscar lot this year, winning or not."

","As a semi-documentary, this film does a great job. Back in the 1950s American journalists tackled serious issues with integrity and courage. Edward R. Murrow exemplified that level of journalistic quality, as he clashed with powerful U.S. Senator Joe McCarthy, a fanatical right-wing conservative who alleged that certain prominent Americans were allied with Communism. McCarthy's accusations not only were unfounded, but also led to a general atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Probably more than anyone else, Murrow exposed McCarthy and his tactics, and in so doing showed that television journalists could serve a useful public function by questioning Washington politicians.<br/><br/>As much as anything Clooney's film reminds us, by inference, that today's television ""news"" is shallow, flippant, dishonest, and very, very self-serving. In effect, there is no Edward R. Murrow among today's myriad ""news"" people.<br/><br/>The cinematic package of ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is high quality, but scholastic. The film's pace is very slow. There are several long speeches. The setting is entirely indoors giving a claustrophobic feel to the film, accentuated by close-up shots. David Strathairn does a terrific job in the role of Murrow.<br/><br/>The film's B&W cinematography is great but, along with all the cigarette smoke, the serious dialogue, and the jazzy score, contributes to a downbeat, depressing tone. Murrow, himself, comes across as a somber, studious, articulate man who smokes heavily and rarely smiles.<br/><br/>As educational as this film is, it is not particularly entertaining. A lot of viewers are going to be bored. The film is low-key, dreary and lacks the special effects, the humor, and the various cinematic gimmicks that contemporary viewers have come to expect from modern films.<br/><br/>Your opinion of this film will depend heavily on whether your purpose in watching is to learn something or to be entertained. Some films can do both. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" excels mostly as education."

","Good Night and Good Luck enters into the territory of films like Appolo 13 and to a certain extent even Revenge of the Sith which tell an intensely compelling story to which everyone knows the ending. It is an unenviable task, to be certain. We know the start and end, what we are interested in is the details. GN&GL is an engaging, skillfully made period piece which make no bad decisions.<br/><br/>Telling the story of the fabled and public battle of Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joe McCarthy, director and co-start George Clooney does a near perfect job of transporting the audience back to the 50s. An age when America's most respected news anchor would still smoke on TV. When communism was what terrorism is today.<br/><br/>The key to this film is casting McCarthy as himself, using only newsreel footage and actual McCarthy speeches and quotes, rather than having him played by an actor. This gives a documentary-like authenticity to this film that it would otherwise never have and it is the key to its success.<br/><br/>The film portrays Murrow as an intelligent man, defender of freedom of the press, eloquent and of the highest integrity, which he was. It portrays McCarthy as an likely-insane demagogue, power hungry and exploiting fear, which he was. In other words, it completely succeeds in re-telling the tale. David Straithairn, long an underrated character actor adds great depth to what could have been a one note performance as Murrow.<br/><br/>GN&GL is, however, style over substance and craft over content. It does not stray even the slightest from its mission, and thereby may prove to be a little dull for some viewers. If you are the type who can watch a movie and appreciate it for its skill, then this is worth watching. ***1/2 out of ****."

","I've long been a fan of the Cloon-ster's directorial work, because although he's only made one film prior to this, it was really, really excellent. ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", if you don't know; a superb additional to anyone's collection, with a great re-watchability value. In keeping with Edward R. Murrow's respect for honesty in a reporter, I should say that it was with that in mind that I sat down to watch ""Good Night and Good Luck"".<br/><br/>I must admit that, although I had a vague idea of what went on in the communist witch-hunt which the film is about, the first thing that pops into my mind when I hear the name McCarthy is the line in ""Dazed and Confused"" about ""Neo-McCarthy-ism"". But it turns out, that was a good thing, because not only did I enjoy Clooney's second film as an engaging dramatic work, it also became suspense-driven as I was drawn in, gripped to know what would/did happen to Murrow, Friendly and the CBS News team.<br/><br/>The film is a combination of dramatisation and archive footage, and Clooney manages to mix the two interchangeably, so much so that if you don't think about it, there's really no way to tell what's acting and what's reality. ""The Junior Senator from Wisconsin"", as Murrow frequently describes Senator McCarthy, is just as much a living, breathing character in the film, despite only appearing (as himself) in real archive footage.<br/><br/>Plus, y'know, as well as great performances by David Strathairn and Clooney, it has Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Daniels in ""character roles"", all of whom are outstanding.<br/><br/>The film also looks incredible; no surprise there, since Clooney's first film was gorgeous too, but even so, the stark black and white never looked better than it does here. The 50's environment photographs so well, and when you see the TV studio lighting playing with Murrow's cigarette smoke as it curls upwards towards the rafters, you'll swear cinema's never looked better.<br/><br/>Despite everything I've said, it's not a pants-wetting seat-gripping roller-coaster ride of entertainment, but it also doesn't aim to be. In his final address to his colleagues, Murrow notes that if television is used strictly for entertainment rather than education, being nothing more than wires and lights in a box, then it would be better it didn't exist at all, yet Clooney illustrates here how well the two functions of the media can combine, for in setting out to make an historically accurate dramatisation of the war waged on fear by Murrow and his team, he's created a story which not only educates and enlightens, but also manages to engage and entertain.<br/><br/>See it."

"TOMASBBloodhound","7","0","0","5 April 2006"," Lacking intensity.
","Good Night, and Good Luck is George Clooney's first serious attempt at directing a high-profile film, and the results are mixed. The film is a treasure to look at for those of us who like to watch b&w films. Everyone is smoking all the time and that along with the jazz music, gives the picture an old-school classy feeling. But overall, the film just was not as intense as its main character's story should have been.<br/><br/>The film deals with CBS anchor Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his attempts to tell America about Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and his anti-communist campaigns. George Clooney plays Fred Friendly, the producer of his weekly news show. The fact that Clooney won an Oscar for this performance is mind-boggling. His character is little more than window dressing as Strathairn easy walks away with the entire movie. Oh well, what does the Academy know? Just ask the Brokeback crowd about that one.<br/><br/>We see Murrow and his newsroom pals at CBS become increasingly outspoken about McCarthy and his tactics. This was a time when the government could push back, however, and we see them lean on the network to some degree. ALCOA, who sponsors the show, also decides to back out. Murrow & CO. don't back down until a network honcho (Langella) basically takes Murrow off the air save for 5 shows per year that will be shown on Sunday afternoons. The film begins and ends with Murrow giving a speech to his colleagues and warning that television must keep from becoming too entertainment oriented. He hopes that television will always ask the tough questions and so forth... that's pretty much about it.<br/><br/>Without Strathairn's performance, this film would not be worth watching. Every shot of his face captures and intensity and the need to tell his side of things that the rest of the film strangely seems to lack. It's just too laid back and leisurely for its subject matter. The film is rated PG, but that almost seems too harsh. Maybe a swear word or two might have helped hammer home the urgency of Clooney's message. Do you really suppose nobody swore in that newsroom? The film deals with Joe McCarthy by only showing news footage of him. You pretty much get the picture that this man was a grand-standing and intimidating type. Even though communism was a threat to America, McCarthy's tactics of character assassination may have been extreme, indeed. Also, the man had about the worst hair I've ever seen. Heck, even Joe Biden's garden of hair plugs looks better than that! This was a decent but unspectacular effort for Clooney. He will no doubt improve as a filmmaker, but this was a good place for him to start. If nothing else, the film shows a good example of the workings of an old TV newsroom. So quaint, and with all that smoke I'll bet most of them died of lung cancer! 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>Good night, and good luck from the Hound."

","Great film, great acting. David Strathairn is exceptional, it is about time he had a leading role after the many excellent non-lead performances I've been impressed with. The essence of 1950s broadcasting is captured in this film and choosing B&W over colour was a stroke of genius, as are the facial close-ups which zoom the focus on to the personalities and individual integrity (or otherwise) rather than a more general survey of the parallels between the McCarthy-led prejudices then and the fundamental attitudes today. The 3 piece suits, incessant smoking, claustrophobic broadcasting rooms, 50s mores (such as the policy against marriage within the workplace) add compelling verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Cross cutting CBS footage from the period (complete with the grainy film quality) strengthened the political punch and one wonders how on earth McCarthy gained such powerful influence - he is boorish, mind-bogglingly narrow-minded, ignorant, slow-witted (of course, a reminder of a certain President). The irony, by comparison with the intelligence of the CBS reporters and broadcasters, is searing. I hope this pithy, scathing insight into an important aspect of media and political influence will inspire contemporary viewers to look further into the full history of this difficult era of American indoctrination (remember, it was also the period of the Korean War and the real entrenchment of the Cold War). It amazes me now how Murrow in fact got away with his views, and all credit for Paley for supporting his team. The implication that Murrow directly influenced the investigation of McCarthy is a new and fascinating slant on the whole issue of McCarthyism. Murrow makes it quite clear he has no Communist or Socialist sympathies and Strathairn brilliantly evokes his absolute integrity combined with 'American dream' idealism. Again, the contrast with the rampant prejudice and increasingly narrow focus of American thinking (the military as well as government) is concisely illustrated with effective economy of scene and screenplay. The film's frame - Murrow's speech criticising the way American TV is developing at the end of the 50s into moronic brain-numbing mush instead of challenging, through-provoking programming along with high-quality entertainment - neatly contains the whole film's theme of how closely media and politics have combined to sugar-coat the American people into complacency and ignorance.<br/><br/>One fantastic additional bonus to an already superb production was the inspired casting of Dianne Reeves. The soul singer provides a late-night relaxed broadcast immediately following the powerful Murrow broadcasts, her mellifluous voice and emotive lyrics singularly contrasting - and balancing - with the stringent gravity of Murrow's deceptively restrained tone. Her plangent delivery indirectly emphasises the emotion and idealism behind Murrow's unemotional delivery and is one of the most effective devices in the film, as well as providing a very pleasing rendition of some favourite 50s songs.<br/><br/>I could add several more compliments to this brilliant film, which in my opinion deserved Best Film Oscar or Golden Globe. But this year it competed with so many other marvellous films - it's been quite a year for serious issue films. I've seen all the others, Brokeback Mountain, Crash, Walk The Line etc. but this one has my vote for the best film of the year."

","Here is a director who just seems to get better and better. It's hard to imagine a more pertinent theme today than that of the dangers of letting fear overrule the fundamentals of democracy and 'Good Night and Good Luck' addresses it masterfully. This is truly the antidote to over-the- top anti-establishment propaganda produced by Michael Moore, this is how to fight back without lowering ourselves to the same cynical sensationalism or mud-slinging in which the far Right indulge. I have to disagree with the contention that the subplot detailing Joe and Shirley's marriage is a weak point of the film, rather it adds depth to their characters and is a subtle yet satisfying comment on the role of women in the media at the time. The idea of Joe giving up his job rather than Shirley is so ridiculous that the characters actually make a joke about it. This subplot is far from extraneous to the plot, on the contrary it fleshes out the story and adds layers of humanity to the characters.<br/><br/>After this last success I wait with bated breath to see what Clooney has to offer next, Hollywood needs more edifying directors like this."

","George Clooney has taken a pivotal first step in his foray of directing: he solidified his knack for finding good stories to tell. As with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" Clooney looked into the entertaining nuances of real life to draw inspiration for his film. However, ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" as far as story goes, isn't as colorful a film (literally) as the controversial source material Clooney interpreted in his first venture.<br/><br/>This by no means is to say that ""Good Night and Good Luck"" isn't up to par with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" In a lot of ways, the film is better.<br/><br/>I was a little apprehensive to sit through 97 minutes of a docu-drama in which I already knew the plot, but good ol' Clooney made sure the retelling was as entertaining as it would have been if I hadn't even known the names of Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy.<br/><br/>In the early to mid 1950's, a junior senator from Wisconsin, McCarthy (shown through real footage), used America's fear of communism as a means to secure his power and popularity in office. While McCarthy tagged any reporters who questioned his ethics a communist, Murrow, wonderfully played by David Strathairn, challenged McCarthy on live television and used his own popularity to exploit the senator. Buried cleverly within every scene, the audience can feel Clooney's love for the story and for Murrow's courage to take on a giant.<br/><br/>The directing was sharp; an active camera constantly circled the battle room that was CBS and its employees (made up from a strong cast: Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey jr., George Clooney) seemed to pop out of their black and white world and right into my living room. Clooney's hyperactive cameras and quick cuts heightened the sense of urgency that surrounded the battle of the titans Murrow and McCarthy staged in front of TV viewers everywhere and reminded the audience that while they were watching a film taking place in the 50's, it sure wasn't made in that time.<br/><br/>Whether you know the story of Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy or not, the film is an entertaining document of how fear is used to gain popularity in politics.<br/><br/>At a time when Spielberg, Burton, and Lucas seem to be showing their age, it's comforting to have someone rise through the woodwork and prove his worth in the world of film-making.

","Yet another in a long line of ""Loony Toon Clooney"" liberal propaganda films badly disguised as ""thrillers"".<br/><br/>First of all, McCarthy didn't hunt for ""witches"", but Communists. The analogy is one of the most idiotic ever made by the Left (and God knows they've made a few!). Witches don't exist, Communists do. And if nepotistic Clooney had actually studied the historical documents related to ""the 50s Witch Hunt"", he would have found that those Soviet agents McCarthy was looking for did in fact exist.<br/><br/>Secondly, McCarthy's impact was almost minimal. After all, had he cleaned Hollywood at all? Take a good, hard look at Hollywood today: does it look as though someone had eradicated the Marxist elements from it? Do you see any Right-wing propaganda films being made there? Do you even see any NEUTRAL, fairly unbiased movies being distributed? I rest my case...<br/><br/>In fact, quite to the contrary: nowadays Hollywood is a place where a reverse phenomenon exists, namely so-called ""red-listing"". Actors/directors who vote for Republicans can easily find themselves isolated and desperate for roles the moment their cover is blown. Keeping their politics a secret is a way of life for most of them. Where's the movie about that?

","Clooney is interesting. Very interesting. He has become one of the major figures in modern cinema and rightly so. An actor who can produce challenging performances in films such as ""Syriana"" as well as entertain in films such as ""Ocean's 11"" deserves such an accolade because they can satiate every audience with artistry and finesse. Now he has moved into the territory of direction and screen writing. He was widely acclaimed with promise when he produced 2002's ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and three years later ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" brought on more and greater acclaim.<br/><br/>And rightly so for this film is a spectacular effort from Clooney. As a writer, he, in conjunction with Grant Heslov, has produced an intricate script. It is well designed with interesting characters, clear themes and genuine drama. As an actor he delivers a fine performance, possibly superior to the one he delivered in ""Syriana"". He manages to create a believable character - a producer whose thoughts can be seen by the audience in such a way as to give them a glimpse of the cacophony of emotions that are bubbling up inside of him but maintain a certain mystery - as a well as a man who has genuine camaraderie with the major players with his colleagues. And as a director, Clooney has made a bold statement, a fine film and a stylish piece of art.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film is good to look at. The black and white photography maybe regarded as clichéd but it really works. It's natural contrast allows for a greater focus on characters, who are really the drive of the film. It adds to the sense of period, also evoked with the spectacular inter-cutting of archive footage, the art direction and the use of Dianne Reeves' jazz singing which is beautifully done and beautifully sung.<br/><br/>Clooney's work, although startling, required the support of its ensemble. Clooney, as I have said, makes no small contribution and is indeed the stand out of the supporting players which also include excellent performances from Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels and Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. However, they are all of them overshadowed by a towering performance from David Strathairn. He uses the power of his voice, the strength of his eyes and every muscle in his face to create what is a truly mesmerising performance. He is the only person to look at when he is on screen.<br/><br/>The Oscars were cruel to this film. ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Crash"" were good films, but the former, in my opinion, was driven largely by hype and the latter by a strong ensemble and script and went onto to claim the major awards despite their failings. ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" may not be the perfect film but it is superior to those two. The film that should have won was ""Capote"" but that claimed victory in the Best Actor category at the expense of Strathairn. Whilst Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in that film is staggering, it seems to be inferior to Strathairn. Whilst Hoffman had to master the mannerisms of a well known public figure, Strathairn did not and he was not able to give as much of an emotion driven performance as Hoffman and these seem to be the reasons for the Academy's decision. However, Strathairn's performance is more powerful and packs a greater punch and his moments of emotion are striking.<br/><br/>In years to come, when anniversary editions of this film appear on home entertainment, the film may not be able to say ""Academy Award Winner"" but is able to remain a very fine film. Its single failing is that, whilst it grips its audience for a great length, it does drag a bit at times but this only a minor complaint when you consider the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The film's major achievement is that it has the courage to question the integrity of a nation through a historical parable during a time when it is needed most and it does this with great style, accomplishment and effect. Not only that, but its message is one that will echo down the ages. We shall not walk in fear of one another."

","Some movies you love because they're great (or they push your own worldview). Some you hate because they stink (or they oppose your own worldview). Most leave you cold because they're mediocre and don't say much of anything about the world. It's an odd feeling to take a strong personal dislike to a movie about which you're ideologically conflicted on ethical grounds that transcend all of these considerations. <br/><br/>I refer to the use made of the character played by the actor who played the nutty father of the slain girl in TWIN PEAKS who kills himself by sticking his head in a gas oven. He had been a staunch liberal TV newsman, apparently. A staunch conservative newspaper columnist said that he was probably some kind of pinko because of his left-leaning positions and that CBS should get rid of him. A nice lady starts reading a column full of such accusations and unkind suggestions out loud to the putative pinko and Murrow and a whole bunch of Murrow's boys and then stops. ""No, read it all,"" the guy insists with tears in his eyes and his nostrils flaring as though they are motorized. So she does. And yep. The columnist more or less said that he really had to be some kind of pinko. The guy comes crying to Murrow. ""Save me from that columnist who says that I'm some kind of pinko."" But Murrow tells him that when he reads the paper in which that column appears it might be a good idea to skip that column, seeing as how it is so upsetting to him to be called some kind of pinko. Sounds like good advice to me. But the guy doesn't take it. R.I.P.<br/><br/>Has Clooney no shame? No decency at long last? The poor man has no place in this movie. Maybe there was more to it in real life. I suspect that there was even less. In any case, as portrayed here, his personal unhappiness and tragedy are not a bad reflection on McCarthy. They are not even THAT bad a reflection on the conservative columnist, who doesn't even sound particularly nasty or threatening. All he did was hurt the guy's feelings and POSSIBLY misrepresent his political position at a time when that MIGHT lead to serious trouble. He didn't cost him his job or out-and-out slander him or degrade him or reveal any dirty secrets or get him in any trouble. The poor man is just a lost soul with personal demons. Just like the dead girl's father on TWIN PEAKS. From motorized nostrils start to stove dial finish this part of the film is stupid, manipulative, and in horribly bad taste.<br/><br/>Hmmm. I think I DO hate this movie... Across the board. The main problem with it is that there's really no story here. That is anathema in a movie about news people. It is no more than a mildly interesting sidebar to one of American history's most distressing embarrassments. No wonder Clooney felt that he had to spice things up with an implication of murder-by-impoliteness. And a jarringly pointless subplot about a married couple working at CBS who have to pretend that they are not married because CBS has a policy against married couples working for CBS. <br/><br/>I've yet to read a criticism of the stilted dialog. ""The waters in which you are attempting to navigate are dangerous."" Then there is the sanctimonious sententiousness of that spiel by Murrow (who is depicted here as a melancholy prig and not as the choleric gadfly he seems to be in the old clips)about the supposed assault by Senator McCarthy on everyone who ever ""read a dangerous book or has a different kind of friend."" Think I saw that engraved in marble somewhere in DC between the Lincoln and the Jefferson Memorial. <br/><br/>Clooney is really indulging his late Boomer inner child here as well as his liberal politics. This is the second coming of a popular hero in the less and less visited pantheon of 50s/60s-style Liberal Enlightenment. Murrow is not in the CBS building. He is not on the boob tube. He is not in a drab suit with a skinny black tie. He is in a golden cloud, in a toga, with a swarm of putti attending. I expected Ben Kingsley to pop in wearing a saffron loincloth to join the entire cast in a rousing chorus of ""It's A Small World After All."" (Or should I say, ""There Will Be Pie in the Sky When You Die""?) Lenin's mummy looked truer-to-life.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Celeste Holm got an Oscar nod for the way she says four words in COME TO THE STABLE.In the role of CBS president William Paley Frank Langella deserves an Oscar for the way he brings balance, depth, shades of gray, and reality itself to the proceedings in his four minutes of screen time. Straithern's impersonation of Murrow is pretty good when he is on air: when he is supposed to be a real coffee-slurping newsman in smoke-filled rooms, he makes you sigh for the relative life-likeliness of Clark Gable as Parnell.<br/><br/>The camerwork is pretty but pretentious."

","SPOILERS In the English dictionary, the term 'Witchhunt' is described as ""an investigation carried out ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but actually used to harass and undermine those with differing views."" Dating back from the Dark Ages when witches were blamed for practically every negative event, a witch-hunt is always going to violate human rights issues.<br/><br/>With the second world war over, America descended into the paranoia of the cold war. Believing Russian communist spies to be everywhere, Americans watched as friends, neighbours and former colleagues were rounded up and systematically accused of communist sympathies. Led from the front by Junior Senator Joseph McCarthy, these witch-hunts undermined everything that was free and honest about the American people. Filmed by George Clooney as a piece of hero worship towards news reporter Edward R Murrow, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" tells the story of Murrow's involvement in the fight back against the paranoid senator.<br/><br/>Right from the outset, there is a notable pretension about this film. Shot in black and white, probably as an attempt to make it feel more like a documentary, and also to allow archive footage to blend more easily, the film is never short of a firm belief in the message it delivers.<br/><br/>Whether ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" deserves the pretension it possesses is difficult to really know. Beautifully shot, and a labour of love by George Clooney (who directed, co-wrote and starred in a supporting role), it encourages us to really believe in the freedom of the press. Fighting for a noble cause and determined to make themselves heard, the film portrays Murrow and the whole of the CBS News team as being martyrs to the cause. Refusing to be silenced by threats from both the senate and their superiors, they knock on the door of truth and then force their way in.<br/><br/>Yet, for all the beauty and the well meaning message that Clooney gives us, there is an element of irony about the whole issue. Here we have a film which preaches the freedom of the press and the notion that people should be offered a balanced argument. It goes out of it's way to suggest that McCarthy was offered a balanced platform with which to defend himself. Yet when it really comes down to it, we are looking at the events from one side only. Whilst the use of actual archive footage of McCarthy is definitely impressive, it does limit the film to what the man can say. We are never properly presented with an argument in his favour. Whether we agree with his witch-hunts or not, it is weird that a film about journalism should be so one sided.<br/><br/>A labour of love by Clooney, this really is a beautiful film to watch. Magically filmed and magnificent in structure, it truly does inspire the journalist in all of us. It is just disappointing therefore that in his desire to create a shrine to his idol, Clooney forgot to offer the opposition some form of defence."
"happy_hangman","Null","2","5","20 February 2006"," No Luck Needed...A Class Act
","How much you admire George Clooney's 'Good Night and Good Luck' probably depends on your politics. Those on the far right, particularly those who have emerged in recent years as apologists for the 'honourable intent' of Senator McCarthy, will no doubt dismiss it as liberal propaganda. Perhaps so. If it is propaganda, though, I think it's more in reaction against the 'my Country, right or wrong' mentality of so many mainstream newsmen and commentators, unwilling (or afraid) to be branded as 'unpatriotic' by criticising the current US administration. David Puttnam hailed this, at the recent BAFTA awards, as one of the most important movies of recent years, and I think he might just have a point.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast are simply superb, from the sombre, authoritative David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow, and Clooney as his bullish editor, to smaller, more nuanced turns by the likes of Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey, Frank Langella and Ray Wise  affecting as the tragic news anchor Don Hollanbeck. Strathairn and Clooney dominate, but it is important to note that theirs are simply the most prominent amongst a host of well observed, impeccably delivered performances. Hard to believe that this is not the work of a more experienced director.<br/><br/>The frenetic pace of live broadcast journalism is well captured, as, indeed, is the genuine sense of terror and paranoia during this undistinguished political era. Good use is made, too, of stock footage from the CBS archives, which  inter-cut with dramatised or scripted segments, add greatly to the authenticity of the film, and the arguments of it's protagonists. An important and politically prescient film."
"samzpan","9","2","5","17 December 2005"," 2005 one of the best
","This movie is one of the best of the year. It has an organic wholeness about it that is very unusual for a flick. The dialog is extremely important and it's best to pay close attention to what everyone is saying. Shooting the thing in black and white was a brilliant move and certainly gives one a feeling for the times ( the 1950s). Another astounding thing is the smoking of cigarettes, one can almost smell tobacco in the theater, and I would not be surprised if everyone in that era died from lung cancer. There is one unusual scene involving Liberace. (for those of you unfamiliar with him a popular closeted piano player in the 50 and 60s). I guess the footage involving him was taken directly from the TV show that Edward R. Murrow hosted where he visited celebrity homes. The clip they chose to use is Liberace answering a question about if he was going to get married. With the benefit of hindsight, the answer is almost high camp. But why the producer/director wanted that in the film, i do not understand. I barely remember Murrow and that TV show, but it seems to me he did a segment with Jack and Jacquline Kennedy, which I think would have been more appropriate. Anyway, if you have the maturation level for this one, it is not meant for teenagers, this is a movie that will be talked about 50 years from now. The use of jazz to tie together the different scenes was also very effective. This is a true classic."

"helenlew","5","2","5","9 November 2005"," What Happened?
","I was truly looking forward to this movie. I admired Edward Murrow and his succinct, prescient remarks re the news of the day. Of course, the main objective was his comments about Senator Joe McCarthy, who was the man responsible for ruining many lives after tainting them as a Communist. During the '50's I was literally glued to the television set and spent that time in despair at McCarthy's innuendos, distortions surrounded by his lackeys. I think some of the more prominent names who were attacked should be mentioned even if the characters weren't shown. Very prestigious people; including George Marshall and Adlai Stevenson. The only one shown was General Eisenhower briefly. The movie lacks the anger I felt at the underhanded tactics used by the Senator and though it does not whitewash him, it leaves us wanting to know what happened. I know what happened but the movie doesn't show the finality of McCarthy's viciousness and his subsequent censure by the Senate."

","This is a very good movie, maybe not a great movie, but should be seen by everyone (especially kids who have probably never heard of Joe McCarthy...or Edward R. Murrow) to show what our country's civil liberties are all about. The characters were heroes but not supermen. Some of them were in the film so briefly that I'm not sure you really knew what their purpose was other than to be part of the ensemble. Strathairn is excellent, as always, but here he gets the spotlight. The black and white makes it seem more authentic, being set in the days of black and white TV, the singer/musician scenes weren't really necessary and perhaps were a distraction, but all in all, an entertaining civics and history lesson."
"P51Jay","9","2","5","23 October 2005"," It is as it was...
","If you want to see the reality of the early 50's in the dirty little scenes behind the prim and proper presentment of a U.S. Senator, this will tell the story quite accurately. Note that all the scenes of Joe McCarthy are actual film of his speaking. The truthful story is built around those actual films.<br/><br/>David Strathairn gives an accurate portrayal of Mr. Murrow, at least from the films I have seen of him. The foundation of Edward R. Murrow's truth comes into conflict with about every avenue of American society. Makes one wonder about whom the government serves if not that truth, even today."
"madbeast","6","7","31","2 October 2005"," Everything is Black and White
","It is ironic that this impressive docudrama about newsman Edward R. Murrow's television vendetta against Joseph McCarthy is shot in black and white, as that is precisely the sensibility the film has towards its deified hero and big brother antagonist. Murrow is presented as a plaster saint with no discernible flaws (or personality), while McCarthy is Evil Incarnate.<br/><br/>The film's gimmick of presenting McCarthy and his HUAAC cohorts through actual documentary footage is both its strength and its weakness: by using the actual footage there is a strong sense of authenticity to the proceedings. It also occasionally breaks out into not only an intellectually stimulating, but emotionally engaging movie with scenes like Murrow prostituting himself by conducting a cloying interview with Liberace on ""Person to Person"" or in Ray Wise's touching, angst-ridden performance as troubled newsman Don Hollenbeck. <br/><br/>But since the villains are only shown through stiff public appearances they lack a sense of attachment to dramatics of the story. And since the Murrow camp is depicted as an earnest and somber think tank whose human interactions are either high school civics class-level conversations about television news ethics or breaking into spontaneous applause over their perceived successes, they rarely engage any response that emanates from anywhere beyond the frontal lobe.<br/><br/>There is a lot to recommend the film: it provides a valuable remedial lesson about the McCarthy era and David Stathairn does a remarkably effective impression of Murrow (within the limits of the screenplay's stiff depiction of the character). But like films that attempt to tell the story of Adolph Hitler, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" fails to provide a context for McCarthy's villainy that explains how he rose to power or why he was such a powerful politician for such a brief period of time. But more than anything, the film lacks the human element that transforms the characters from exalted idols from a History of Television Journalism textbook into relatable human beings.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is an easy film to admire, but a hard one to cherish."

Even his breakdown with Paley is mostly handled in 1 scene.<br/><br/>Langella and Strathairn (always good) were excellent; Clooney was nothing; everyone else pallid.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie about where the news reporters and staff are big heroes: flawless, on our side, saving the world - never just some folks trying to sell news. They're made to be busy to show how serious and worthwhile they are. They're dedicated and intense. The worst are the ""newsroom feel"" scenes, where several folks talk and shout at the same time until finally things settle down and you can hear the important announcement. Clooney uses this technique several times. Why: we already know how busy and self-important the 4th Estate is.<br/><br/>What's with the lengthy song interludes? Wouldn't 1 have given us a feel for things? How distracting was it to sit through an entire song while we're waiting to hear how Murrow's show went. And why show the entire Alcoa commercial?

It WAS liked however, it was liked a lot by critics and movie-goers, and so I have to say this is a grossly overrated film. I cannot deny that the acting here is superb (Strathairn's nomination was well deserved), and I admire Clooney's attention to detail and historical accuracy, but he really should stick to what he's known for, because it is clear to me that he failed to foresee or maybe just chose to ignore the fact that because this movie does pay so much attention to historical accuracy and so closely attempts to recreate what people were experiencing then (the archive footage) it's entertainment value is greatly limited. Now, I'm not just some ignorant moron that would have been more pleased if they had thrown in a sex scene or some excessive, unwarranted violence into the movie, but I do believe Clooney should have taken a little more creative liberty and made the movie a little more Hollywood. The concepts of Communism VS. Capitalism, Good VS. Evil (not politically correct, I know), Freedom VS.

This is just another Clooney attempt in using his money and fame to exploit his left-wing propaganda.<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed in the lack of character development for Robert Downey, Jr's character. What a waste of talent. Why even have him in the film? His character and storyline seemed very edited and the parts that were in there looked like it was building to something, but didn't go anywhere. Even when he and his wife were brought into the office at the end, it was very anti-climatic and even Murrow's comment in the end about their relationship was anti-climatic. It was as if some interesting part fell on the editing room floor.<br/><br/>We go to the movies to be ENTERTAINED, not to be educated. When the film finished, I can't say I got anything out of it or learned anything substantial from it. What was Clooney's point in making this film? It appears it was to EDUCATE, however, what happened in 1953, the storyline to this film, has NOTHING to do with current life. If you are going to take the time and money to educate people regarding left-wing propganda, make it be worth something that we could apply to current life. Otherwise, why bother?"

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" a DVD Movie Review<br/><br/>by Bradley A. Draper<br/><br/>This a good TV movie, but it is not Oscar class and it certainly is not classic cinema. Nothing to stand up to and applaud. Clooney should stop producing. I am reminded of his aping of the classic ""Fail Safe"" film and novel via his attempt at live TV with a retelling of a story that needed no reprise. Great movies should not be remade and those that attempt so only do so at the critic's peril. Just because you are a popular actor, George, this does not make you a directoral talent.<br/><br/>In this film, much can be made of similarities of our own paranoid times, of the communist witch hunts of the early 1950's with todays suspectful techno intrusion on our privacy. That is what this movie is all about. It is couched in a period piece but tries to be a political statement of our time. The clichés are even chosen for this affect. Not that our time does not need reflection. But today's political climate is far more tolerant and liberal than the early 1950's. I get letters from the ACLU almost every week. Even though I am sympathetic to their cause, I do not join, because they just want my money, and I do not want to be on anybody's list.<br/><br/>This film is shot in stunning silver black and white. Very well done. An effective period piece, even down to the obligatory black jazz music. Still, one of the clichés that were hard to ignore was that of the cigarette. Every character it seemed smoked a million cigarettes in this movie, and they even throw in a ""Kent Cigarette"" commercial, with little subtlety. Was this an indightment of cigarette smoking some how? It seemed so. This obsession with tobacco's smoke was to me very distracting.<br/><br/>Although filmed well, and the acting, sliding into the realm of TV soap style still, was good, the writing was contrived and weak.<br/><br/>I found the portrayal of Edward Murrow, legendary CBS World War II broadcaster, by the severe and constant jaw clenching of David Strathairn clichéd and consistently boring. The weird Fred Friendly cameo of George Clooney was unexplainable? Why, other to include his ego into a Oscar territory in a weak Oscar year. Patricia Clarkson and Robert Langella's outstanding character portrayals, were totally wasted in this film. Too bad as they are iconic character actors. And what is the point of including the sad Robert Downing Jr. in a totally inconsequential part?<br/><br/>There is no social impact in this film, although it was very apparent that the film attempted this. I liked the movie, but it is what it is, a tiny little TV film made, to exploit the paranoia of our time, which had nothing to compare to those ultimate ""look over your shoulder 1950's."" This film, already dated, will be forgotten in six months.<br/><br/>I give it 5 stars."
"NJMoon","6","2","6","8 February 2006"," Over-Rated & Disappointing
","Welcome to one of the most disappointing and over-rated films of the year: GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK. A look at Edward R. Murrow and Senator McCarthy should have been riveting and inspiring. Instead this flat feature is dull and uneventful. Director Clooney employs gimmicks galore to seduce his audience, but he can't overcome a lackluster script and his own neophyte direction enough to do more than scratch the surface of a fascinating time and place. Clever cuss Cooney's monochromatic lensing is the film's first big mistake. No one under 45 associates black and white with anything but oft-repeated sitcoms like I LOVE LUCY and Hollywood films: both fiction. The gimmick only served to distance the viewer from the subject, not lend veracity. While the first rate cast is in fine form, they have all been better elsewhere (including the much-praised Straithern as Morrow). Using Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. as a metaphor for CBS's own private witch hunt (no employees may be married) relegates them to symbolic status, robbing them of any reality. As they lie in bed staring into space, I felt their boredom with their limited characters. Clooney telegraphs every plot point and uses heavy handed symbolism at every turn. From Ray Wise's first screen shot, I knew (without knowledge of the real-life Hollenbeck's fate) that a Willy Loman-esquire gas pipe was in his future. A shot of Frank Langella's Bill Paley alone in a studio tells us nothing without a single glimpse of the actor's face. It's lonely at the top? Tell us something we didn't know. A Morrow interview with Liberace oddly avoids a single raised eyebrow when Lee is questioned about his marriage plans. A second interview with a Gabor is so short we're not even sure which Hungarian sister he's interviewing. A little humor here was much needed, but Clooney misses again. Kinescopes of McCarthy's hearings go on far too long, making us long for a proper documentary on the subject instead of this pseudo-effort. The script also inexplicably avoids any mention of CBS's biggest star of the 1950's, Lucille Ball. Ball herself was accused of being a communist in 1953, putting CBS's cash cow ""I Love Lucy"" in serious jeopardy. Clooney's Paley never even mentions the redhead or her red scare experience. Instead, he mystifies most viewers with mentions of Uncle Miltie in a dress (Berle was important to the decade, but has not withstood the test of time like Ms. Ball's sitcom.) He also invokes the name of ""The $64,000 Question"" which only brings to mind a far superior film of similar topic and time period: QUIZ SHOW. For further comparison on what to do when making a bio pic of the era, see CAPOTE. Where GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK fails (even when it dazzles) CAPOTE succeeds - in living color."

","This is an absolutely beautiful film.<br/><br/>I only saw parts of it, but the glaring reflective commentary about modern issues voiced through a period piece and its conversations was never missed. <br/><br/>Clooney clearly voices his concern about issues of government power and accountability, and makes certain his passion shows through his character. <br/><br/>Then he also addresses the issue of media responsibility to both the citizens, the public, and the audience-consumer and its ability to counter-balance the growth and proliferation (of basically unchecked) government behavior. <br/><br/>I personally found it entertaining to the extent to which the dialogue in fact reflected the issues of our day rather than those of its time period. <br/><br/>The one line where the CBS boss (or one of his contacts) highlighted the matter at stake by drawing attention to the contracts certain parties had with the government seemed describe perfectly the government- contractor relations of today.<br/><br/>And of course the speech questioning the extent to which any single ""threat"" to national security really was a credible threat just seemed completely analogous to the dialogue brought forth in many works of the 00's discussing the US response to 9/11 and counter-terrorism. <br/><br/>I certainly don't find these points problematic; I am all the more impressed that they so appropriately describe modern life despite sitting in an older period. <br/><br/>The passionate line by Clooney questioning how the evidence against the officer was necessarily substantive felt like he was immediately rebuking back in the face of our modern decision makers the policies of cavalierly detaining individuals suspected of terrorism. <br/><br/>It no longer felt like he was producing just another line in that context. It felt like he was reaching out and making a bold, clear, unhesitant, and fiery protest against legal overreach in any context, in any time period by any party, making it a universal appeal.<br/><br/>It did feel like maybe the voice/perspective was too modern. The viewpoints and psychology put forth by the character seemed distinctly modern, (coming from a history buff -- I am more familiar with attitudes of certain eras), though I am not sure what the background/true perspectives of the period were, as I hadn't researched the film/setting before viewing the segments. <br/><br/>For example the discussion about the harms that TV would eventually bring- the disformation of personal integrity that would result-- seemed too much like a more modern - state of the art perspective of television.<br/><br/>I have serious doubts that the perspective and critique of television was nearly as developed back then as it was portrayed in the movie. <br/><br/>The discussion of McCarthyism seemed far less ominous than it probably would have been back during that time period.<br/><br/>Furthermore the urgency and insight revealed by the media bosses seemed representative more of the way our media structure functions today rather than back then.<br/><br/>I do not believe the executives back than held as far-reaching and thorough a scope of information that they do today. <br/><br/>The pressingness of decisions to release information and what to discuss I sure would have been far less magnified back then. I believe discussions of what would have been appropriate material would have been far simpler and not as informed as portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>But what impresses me is the ability of the writers to imagine what the people of that era would have thought and how smoothly they put our oversight/checkback perspective into the stances of the men of that era."
"jwhit9992003","9","1","2","3 May 2010"," Good Night Mr. McCarthy
","The government has always had control of news content, if reporters would abstain from being swindled and report uninfluenced news they would be able to expose true corruption. In the 1950s Senator Joseph McCarty of Wisconsin began a wave of accusations against many of America's political leaders and members of Hollywood. He claimed that communists were infiltrating the American Government. Although this was during the Cold War, many of his accusations were exceedingly false and carried no merit. As a result, two men at CBS decided to expose McCarthy for the liar he was. Nighttime news producer Fred Friendly and reporter Edward Murrow devised a plan to go against the wishes of CBS and report their findings on McCarthy's fallacies. In Good Night and Good Luck (GNGL), directory George Clooney illustrates the hold the government has on the American Media, through the true story of the fall of Senator McCarthy. The domino effect that takes place in this film is evident. First the government tries to take control of CBS. Then CBS tried to threaten Friendly and Murrow. Finally Friendly and Murrow muster up the strength to stand against CBS. When they do, Friendly and Murrow are able to report the truth and influence the American people forever. <br/><br/>The US government has, in the past and present, threatened members of various broadcasting companies to report news deemed acceptable by them. If reporters of producers refuse to do so, they risk losing their jobs or being sent to jail. In the film, William Paley, the head of CBS, is approached by a government official. In this scene, Paley is accused of slander and humility. He is threatened and told he will be blacklisted and labeled a communist. In an article on CBSNews.com transcripts on Senator McCarthy read that he ""manipulated his hearings by calling witnesses he can intimidate and avoids calling those likely to oppose him"" (Holguin, pg. 1). His so-called ""smear attacks"" on government officials and Hollywood stars alike is unjust and unethical. Gehlback and Sonin say in their article, Government Control of the Media, that the ""governments that seek to mobilize populations to take a particular action induce a higher level of media bias"" (Gehler and Sonin, pg. 23). This proves that even though some people may think they are getting real news, they are just getting the governments version of the news. <br/><br/>CBS approaches Friendly and Murrow who then face a tough decision. They can run the true story and be fired, or keep their jobs and comply with the government. Instead of listening to ""the man,"" they create a report revealing the ugly truth about Senator McCarthy. By sticking to their instincts they stand up to the Senator and his men. They also stand up for the American people who deserve to know the truth.<br/><br/>In the scene when Murrow first reports the fallacies of McCarthy, his demeanor is very defiant. He reports with dignity and valor, making each statement as important as the last. Murrow and Friendly break barriers as they stand up to CBS and the government (GNGL). Although it lands them in a bit of hot water, they stick to their story and prove they are not to be tested. Their words influenced many viewers: Even a democratic candidate for a seat in the House of Representatives had, so Roosevelt had heard, advocated a declaration of war. 'He should be thrown out of Congress promptly even if elected and no honest man can afford to vote for him and thereafter claim to be himself a good and loyal American'"" (Shannon, pg. 9).<br/><br/>Fred Friendly and Edward Murrow do not fully understand the influence they had on the American Media. By making information about McCarthy public, they showed that real reporters told the truth and real Americans let each other know when something was awry. Even after more threats from McCarthy and a rebuttal that he airs on CBS, these two men risk everything, and ultimately create history. When Murrow responds to Senator McCarthy's response, his apprehension becomes evident. This is the climax of the film where everyone realizes how important these reports are. After Murrow finishes his report, the camera jumps to his fear-stricken face. In the next scene Friendly receives the news that McCarthy is on suspension and is being investigated. It is here that the viewer understands the influence the news has on its people. <br/><br/>Although some Americans believe the government always has our best interests in mind, this film shows how they do not. The government has gained control of the media in some ways and Good Night and Good Luck is a depiction of the fear they had on media sources in the 1950s. The story of Senator McCarthy is just one example of how the United States Government controls what Americans watch on the news. However, the bravery of Edward Murrow and Fred Friendly exposed a Senator and brought truth to the American people. Although it is still a work in progress, the freedom of the press has come a long way. It is because of men like Murrow and Friendly that the American Media is able to unveil the truth about the government and bring justice to the American people."

","In times like these, when President Bush is willfully violating one of the founding principles of this country, and reporters are going to jail for not disclosing their government sources (or worse, the newspapers are turning over their notes!), it is appropriate to be thinking of how far wrong is the political right.<br/><br/>This movie was considered for an Academy Award, as perhaps it should have been. It tells a story of unbelievable courage, fueled by righteous indignation and some typical misguided liberalism. Edward R Morrow was a voice of compassion and liberalism in a country scarred by war and afraid of the future.<br/><br/>Then, as now, they faced a world growing ever smaller with the threat of formidable foes. Then, as now, the knee jerk reaction was to raise fences, throw up barriers, run for shelter and hide under rules, regulations and desks. Yet, this is not the American way. The great American progressive social experiment is one of meeting new challenges, adopting new solutions and succeeding.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie stays within the recording studio. It doesn't show what is happening in the world outside of the newsroom. It only hints at the horrors of that day and age. It doesn't depict the attitude of people on the street. Many people supported McCarthy, Nixon Hoover and Cohen. Then, as now, the country was polarized between red and blue states (although I think the colors have changed). In fact, Morrow was incensed because a friend of his was accused of being a spy and then committed suicide. This and many of the other allegations turn out later to be true. Soviet President Gorbachev revealed many Russian secrets in the spirit of Glasnost. There were sleeper moles planted in the US. The Rosenbergs were indeed guilty. Hiss was a spy. So was Morrow's friend.<br/><br/>What the movie fails to communicate sufficiently enough was how the basic American principles, upon which this country is founded, were treacherously ignored (not by Nixon!) in the interest of sensationalism and political power. Principles of equality were trampled. The rule of law was set aside. The right of a fair trail ignored. To like communism, attend a meeting or read about it was a crime. Many Jews and liberals were accused of being Reds.<br/><br/>Watch this movie after seeing the incredible Schindler's List. There was an awesome enemy out there after the end of the Second World War. Russia shared more similarities with the Axis school of thinking than with the progressive Americans and the allied powers. But as Hussein knows, Stalin was a master politician, even among world-class champions, and he choose to go his own route – an uneasy alliance with the one world power that could help him fend off his aggressive neighbors (gee, sounds like Saudi Arabia, doesn't it?). The world was divided then, much as it is now, between two very different schools of thought.<br/><br/>What the movie fails to explore, and another one certainly should, is the hysteria that gripped the nation. We need a movie about the Hollywood 10 (20 really) whose lives and careers were changed because of government prosecution and persecution due to their political beliefs. Even today, we think there is something wrong with people who like communism, instead of respecting their political opinion (and then rushing to outvote them at the polls).<br/><br/>In a year of some solid contenders (finally), Good Night and Good Luck falls behind in the pack. Though it is one of the best motion pictures of last year, it does not have the modern intrigue of Syrianna. Nor is Good Night the heart-warming tale, with wonderful portrayals, of Walk the Line. It is not the disturbing performance and tale of Capote. Nor does Good Night have the powerful, emotional-moving majesty of Brokeback Mountain. Rent it yes, but be sure to get the others too.<br/><br/>Then, just for kicks, sit down and reread one of the all-time-great classics of courage, compassion, sensitivity, awareness, truth and honesty in the face of public adversity and scorn. Read To Kill A Mocking Bird again."
"Ertzi","7","1","2","8 August 2009"," A Strathairn showcase, during which you have to be sharp to understand everything that is being said
","I tried to watch this once without subtitles, but I quickly found it a bit too hard to follow, so I aborted and let the flick simmer, while waiting for the right opportunity. Finally the movie was on television here in Finland, so I soared in the air and went for my prey like a falcon. And I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>I normally do not like movies that take place in the 1940 - 1950s range, something about the era repels me. I can't say if it's the fashion, the cars or the fact that everyone smokes all the freaking time. However, in this flick the time period didn't hurt at all. If anything, it just added to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This film is Strathairn's show, pure and simple. He makes this movie what it is, and it is pretty compelling just to watch him speak (with a cigarette in hand, of course). The fact that the film is black and white can prevent some people from enjoying it, but I didn't find that detail at all distracting. What I did found distracting were the musical montages, where the woman sings some hideous jazz songs. Hated those.<br/><br/>The movie is written and directed by George Clooney, who is by now emerging as one political son of a *female dog* to me. I always find it fascinating to follow political scheming in films, although in real life I couldn't care less. Go figure. One thing I find amusing though. Why is that dude from Twin Peaks always a tragic character? I guess he is just good at playing a somewhat damaged individual.<br/><br/>All in all, a very solid political drama, but one has to be interested in that sort of thing, as there is scarcely anything else than speech in the movie. Very fast and heavy speech, I might add."
"magicsinglez","8","1","2","1 July 2009"," A terrible reminder of the dangers of undirected feelings. Of having feelings.
","Racism wasn't defeated in World War II. Fascism was not finally defeated with McCarthy. This is when they began. The president of Oberlin college once remarked, ""I was a student during the McCarthy era, to tell you the truth there is less freedom now than there was then"". Journalist Bernard Goldberg once said on TV, ""(back then) all you had to do was not be a communist"". More people are being fired today in a week, for endless reasons, than ever lost their job during the McCarthy era. But no one lionizes or aggrandizes them, they're not communists. These folks are getting what they deserve. <br/><br/>A more sensible reviewer might try and compare those who use the phrase 'McCarthyism', modern sensitive folks, to McCarthy himself - years ago my local paper wrote, ""Hitler, McCarthy, Political Correctness: the totalitarian parade marches on"", but McCarthy is actually a hero of mine. Perhaps I'm a masochist of sorts and enjoy a bit of pain. Perhaps my love for McCarthy serves as a warning, a reminder of the terrible danger of undirected feelings. Feelings lead to thoughts. Thoughts lead to ideas. Don't be too concerned, however. We live in a simpler time where a single word provides the incentive or 'correction' needed.<br/><br/>For me, though, Joseph McCarthy was the greatest American of the 20th Century. Is there someone, anyone, willing to stand up and say the truth! Is there someone not afraid to say the truth! I just can't bring myself to believe McCarthy is just another actor. Not McCarthy! Silly idea, I know. And what IS going on? Is it a crime to know? It's just a romantic notion, I really don't know all that much about the man, and I don't take it too seriously. 'Goodnight and Good Luck' didn't reveal much about McCarthy I hadn't heard before. True or not (and probably, not), this movie agrees with my silly notion. It presents the idea that something big was happening. This was a turning point in our history. McCarthy was not simply a final speed bump to be run over on the road to the Jerry Springer Show. No. <br/><br/>Some reviewers said there wasn't any tension or emotion (at least not the kind they expected). One objected to it's, ""minimalist and neutral stance"". One reviewer said, and I suspect he was being facetious in part, ""(Murrow) stands as a symbol for the continuation of truth (someone) who is willing to bring it out to the public. The end has a very honest bleak tone to it--we want to see Murrow continue to let the public know what's actually going on in the country, but one man's fight isn't good enough. Clooney chooses a perfect and powerful ending. He makes a bold statement on how public interest in television has contributed to the decay of society, whether it is 1950 or 2005.""<br/><br/>Goodnight and Good Luck isn't truly neutral. It has a message or two. Due to the low-key nature of the film, we'll call them 'suggestions'.<br/><br/>What this movie suggests (most of it probably not true).<br/><br/>1. This was a watershed moment in history. <br/><br/>2. Edward R Murrow, Don Hollenbeck, and also another CBS employee, working closer to Murrow, did attend some kind of 'subversive' meeting. The newsmen were motivated to go after McCarthy at least in part by self interest (providing a set up for us to agree with McCarthy).<br/><br/>3. The black lady singing Jazz or whatever during the interludes didn't seem very happy with the proceedings.<br/><br/>4. The outcome of this watershed event was determined by public opinion. Once public opinion turned against McCarthy, it was his undoing. The government and media bend to public opinion, they don't create it in the first place (coming from a film that subtly manipulates our opinions, this one is a bit rich?). I suppose the underlying message being next time we should support 'McCarthy'. <br/><br/>5. Don Hollenbeck's suicide, in a movie that was surprisingly 'balanced', is the event that must force the humane viewer to ultimately side against McCarthy.<br/><br/>6. Should the media themselves be monitored/regulated?<br/><br/>The last point I'll admit is a stretch - It may have been the scene with Murrow arguing with the president of CBS news. His boss says something like (while Murrow is arguing to protect an accused American soldier), ""And who will protect McCarthy from you (your accusations)""? He ultimately comes down on the side of 'journalist freedom', allowing Murrow to do the story the way he wants. It may have been the scene (that made me think a bit outside the movie) near the end where Robert Downy JR, no relation to Morton Downy (who was taken off television for being too communistic, oops I mean too 'insensitive'), where he lies in bed looking up at the ceiling, saying, ""I wonder if we did the right thing""?<br/><br/>'Goodnight and Good Luck' brings up the idea, should the content of television be overseen? Does freedom always lead to exploitation? Should 'whatever sells best' be the final arbiter? Perhaps I'm being alarmist, and am just engaging in more 'McCarthyism', and we already have a system in place that works just fine - well educated, conscientious employees themselves. And that in the battle between censorship and freedom, the debate between protecting citizens on the one hand and allowing them freedom on the other, there can be no contest. As a society, clearly we've come down on the side of forethought. Examining all the pertinent facts, we've decided that protecting ourselves from white men is more important than freedom.<br/><br/>Murrow may be right, we may not be descended from fearful men. But we have certainly descended into fearful ones. Fear has become a given, we expect fear. In fact it's considered enlightenment to make people afraid. Then we condemn and disparage them for it."

Goodness knows we need such people.<br/><br/>One problem is, though, that we know the story before we start. It is an essentially simple one and does not take long to tell.<br/><br/>Another, bigger one, is that the film is self-congratulatory: The idea is that we right-thinking people (or our predecessors) win out over our nasty opponents, and we are very pleased with ourselves for being so right. Don't get me wrong: I support the values promoted in the film, but it's like reading a newspaper that exactly reflects your own views. There is something a bit arid about it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is well made and very well acted by all concerned."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","8","1","2","11 September 2008"," Clooney has chops
","George Clooney has to be, if not the most talented guy in Hollywood, certainly the luckiest. A former Sexiest Man Alive, according to People magazine, scion of a wealthy show business clan, a TV star, a movie star, and now a successful director. His first film, Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, on wacky TV game show host Chuck Barris's fantasies, was a sober look at a mentally disturbed man, much better than highly lauded screenwriter and director Paul Schrader's similar Auto Focus, on TV star Bob Crane's descent into pornography. But, we've all seen this before- a big star thinks he can make films, makes a first film that is lauded- think Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and on and on, and then starts pumping out sheer dreck.<br/><br/>Well, scratch that with Clooney, who also wrote the film with his producer Grant Heslov. His latest film, Good Night, And Good Luck, which tracked CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow's 1953-1954 battle with Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he belittles backhandedly as 'the Junior Senator from Wisconsin', and his own network, deserved all the accolades it got in its Academy Award nomination. Of course, its nomination was for its political stance, and the relevance to the civil and human rights abuses going on today, in the failed War On Terror, but just because it got recognized for the wrong reasons does not mean it's not a worthy film.<br/><br/>What separates Clooney, in his first two films, from the above named actors, is that he is simply not content to tell a straightforward story. In both films he uses different filmic techniques, frames scenes in different ways- in this film letting the camera be a static fly on the wall, and generally shows that he knows what to do behind a camera, as well as in front of one. Several things show why this works. First off, Clooney and his cinematographer Robert Elswit (Magnolia) shoot the film in black and white, which always lends an 'old', historic feel to a film. Secondly, he makes the audacious choice to use footage of the real Senator McCarthy and his victims, rather than using actors. In doing so, we see how truly deranged and maniacal McCarthy was. Latter day apologists try to insist he wasn't as bad as all that, and that there were real communists in the government.<br/><br/>This is all true, but they were never a threat, merely a convenient scapegoat, and McCarthy's many false accusations and smears allowed the handful of real threats to later get off by claiming McCarthyist tactics were used against them. McCarthy falsified records, lied, claimed he had proof he never revealed, harassed people, never produced their accusers, practiced cowardice in the name of patriotism, and tried to suspend the writ of habeas corpus (ala Guantanamo Bay). The Left, especially in Academia, has much to answer for in its support of Stalin and Mao, and their regimes which murdered manifold more people than the Nazis, but the average laborer/fellow traveler merely saw The Party as a refuge from the vile practices of Big Capitalism at its worst. To equate a few rabble rousers with a plot to enslave the nation is to blur all colors between black and white, and like trying to make the case that David Duke was as great a threat to world peace as Hitler. This was why a Communist sympathizer like Alger Hiss was found guilty and sent to jail on a technical perjury, barely related to the treasonous crimes Richard Nixon accused him of, and which history has exculpated him for, yet is viewed as if he passed on atomic secrets like Julius Rosenberg. And it was in this gross conflation and addle-minded simplification that we see that the true threat to freedom was in the lying, manipulating, and fulminating madness of McCarthy, amply captured on film, and nicely left undiluted by Clooney, so that 'selective editing' charges are baseless. The film just misses greatness because Clooney makes a few errors. First, he has a pointless side story about a married couple (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) at CBS that violate the company rule against married employees, then he has a subplot about a man, Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise), McCarthy drives to suicide (done in Martin Ritt's Woody Allen starring film The Front, with Zero Mostel's character), and finally the film's soundtrack is a bit weak, with a jazz score that seems inapt to the gravity of the situation. But, these are all minor demerits. The use of classic 1950s commercials and footage more than makes up for those weaknesses, and really gives a claustrophobic feel, at times, that only heightens the drama, the outcome of which, is known. Yet, this fact does not lessen the intensity because Clooney gives a great performance, and Strathairn, as Murrow, is simply brilliant. It is a testament to his brilliance (mostly unseen in small, independent films, such as those by John Sayles) that this great performance is almost routine in his canon."
"slokes","7","1","2","6 May 2008"," Iconography, Not Hagiography
","Edward R. Murrow is presented as hero and prophet in ""Good Night, And Good Luck"", but also as a scold and an emotional eunuch. It's a double-sided portrait that reflects the open-ended nature of this atypical docudrama.<br/><br/>David Strathairn's performance as Murrow is the film's standout achievement, a man who has all the right things to say even as everything around him slides down the wrong path. Two of his CBS News employees are forced to hide their marriage from management's prying eyes, while the newshound himself is oblivious to their plight. One newscaster, a longtime friend and wartime colleague, seeks his solace when a columnist attacks him, yet Murrow can't offer up anything worthwhile.<br/><br/>Sure he can upbraid his colleagues about sitting on their ""fat surpluses"" while television is turned into a damn amusement park. But called onto the carpet himself by his boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), he does a good job of rolling over and playing dead. Of course he will be dead soon enough, thanks in large part to those cancerous weeds he's been helping sell across the nation.<br/><br/>That's probably not the film George Clooney wanted me to see. Yet the movie he directs allows enough space and dimension for that interpretation. We see Morrow as the crusading journalist who took down Sen. Joseph McCarthy and anti-communist hysteria, straightforwardly with humor and contemporaneous news footage. It's not a bad story, and Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov tell it well. But there's something more interesting to me around the corners of the frame.<br/><br/>""I simply cannot accept on every story there are two equal and logical sides to an argument, call it editorializing if you will,"" says Morrow. That suggests a slippery slope from his lofty perch to ideological bag carrier, but only his unliked supervisor Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) points this out to him.<br/><br/>Because Clooney's film focuses on the positive aspects of Morrow's career, it is accused by some of being too glowing. Of course, Morrow's skill on camera is well represented, and we do get bolts of surprising humor, as when he tells Sig his producer, Fred Friendly, will have to forego Christmas this year.<br/><br/>""He's a Jew,"" Sig replies.<br/><br/>""Don't tell him that,"" Morrow responds. ""He loves Christmas.""<br/><br/>But Strathairn doesn't crack a smile, and there are signs of strain throughout. The smoke he relentlessly inhales. The morose stare as he hangs out at the bar after a show. His painfully phony smile as he asks ""Lee"" Liberace about his wedding plans.<br/><br/>I'm impressed but not blown away by the movie on the surface. Clooney gets the tone and the iconic nature of Murrow just right, but he also inserts a superfluous story (CBS's secret couple) and allows a couple of weak performances, Ray Wise as the dejected newscaster and Clooney himself as Friendly, too much time.<br/><br/>But Clooney gives you just enough of a sense of this other Morrow to make the film come alive for me, especially on re-viewings. It's not historically 100% accurate, but it's solid where it most needs to be and presents Morrow, warts and all, as a newsman worth remembering.<br/><br/>Who can you say that about today?"
"pinokiyo","4","1","2","31 March 2008"," Disappointing... A documentary on this history would've been more interesting to watch.
","First of all, I actually wanted to watch this movie because I was first introduced about Edward Murrow in my film class -- thought THAT was interesting -- and especially since this movie was nominated for many awards. Maybe because it had too much hype to begin with, or it's the fact that this movie just isn't interesting to be a movie, but I just didn't like it at all.<br/><br/>This movie isn't historically accurate, other than the major points of Murrow against the senator -- because the screenwriters had to come up with the conversations themselves.<br/><br/>I think the transition between using actual TV footage at the time and the actual movie was slightly distracting; it's like did we go from a film to watching a documentary? I'm sure this was historically an important event, at least for TV journalists, but it was just really boring as a movie. If you were alive during that time, you probably already had the back-story and found the movie engaging, but for others, the movie expects one to dive into it knowing all the horror that was going on at the time; this makes it extremely hard for modern viewers to relate and follow.<br/><br/>I just never felt that intensity (other than the look of it, by cheating aesthetics using extreme close-ups) ever for the story. I didn't see McCarthy as this threatening guy as he might have been. I didn't see Murrow as this ""most trusted guy on TV""; his character was really boring as he's the same from start to finish (just giving speeches all the time or smoking). Robert Downey Jr. and his wife in the movie, basically a ""B"" story that they forcefully threw in, wasn't anything special. I just didn't feel anything for any of the characters. The movie felt rushed and undeveloped (it's like let's see the showdown with Murrow and McCarthy already), even though it was also tedious, waiting for something to happen. It's just one of those stories that doesn't translate well on film. A documentary on this would be far superior and interesting.<br/><br/>I recommend NETWORK (1976) way over this - it's a lot more engaging and mind opening showing the corruption of television/corporation. I guess you could see Howard Beale (fictional character), the guy in NETWORK, kind of like Edward Murrow."

","During the early 1950s the United States of America valued conformity over honesty and integrity--a social lockstep driven by fears that the Soviet Union had infiltrated American government and society and sought to bring our society crashing into chaos. As the decade progressed, a number of politicians played upon those fears to their own greater glory, and few played harder than Senator Joseph McCarthy, who shocked the nation when he claimed to have factual evidence that numerous branches of the government were overrun by communists and communist sympathizers.<br/><br/>Over the past decade or so a number of historians and critics, Anne Coulter among the latter, have attempted to rehabilitate Senator McCarthy's reputation by noting that there were indeed communist infiltrators at work in the United States government. This was doubtlessly true, but there are several problems with this pro-McCarthy argument. Chief among them is McCarthy himself. His accusations were not based on fact and were strewn with misinformation, and he showed a marked tendency to level them against two types of people: those who could not fight back and those who dared to criticize him. If McCarthy ever did manage to expose a communist it was by dumb luck only, and by 1954 even the members of his own party--including President Dwight Eisenhower--were openly disgusted by his behavior.<br/><br/>GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is the story of how Edward R. Murrow, possibly the single most respected reporter of his era, exposed McCarthy for what he was via a meticulously prepared news program. In the wake of this broadcast an outraged public turned against McCarthy and thus gave the Senate the public support required to end his reign of terror. At the same time, it is also the story of television's role as entertainer ultimately undercut its role as news medium--and laid the destructive seeds of the ""news as entertainment"" format that today typically overpowers serious journalism.<br/><br/>It is in many respects a fascinating film, its script drawn from the actual words of the actual people involved in the Murrow telecast. It is memorably directed by George Clooney and remarkably performed by an ensemble cast that includes David Staitham, Robert Downey Jr., Frank Langella, and Clooney himself. The black and white art direction and cinematography is brilliant, truly capturing the look and feel of the era; the pace is rapid fire; and it offers a series of pointed warnings about political bankruptcy and public expectations of television that ring true in no uncertain terms.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it also manages to ever so slightly miss the mark. This is partly due to the film's divided intent: by refusing to focus specifically on either McCarthy or the issue of broadcast news it manages shortchange both. It also errs in its use of considerable archival footage, which leaves us to wonder if we might be better off watching a documentary on McCarthy and Murrow instead of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK. But the ultimate problem with the film is that gives zero context. We are told nothing of the tenor of times, given no clear idea of what made McCarthy's claims seem initially viable, and indeed given no clear idea of what those claims actually were. We are simply given to understand that he is a danger to democracy and shown actual film footage of McCarthy to prove what we are assumed to already know.<br/><br/>In the end, I have to say that it is always a good thing to be reminded of McCarthy. He stands as a warning to us against those who would play upon our fears for the sake of their own power. It is also always a good thing to be reminded that ""finest hour"" events in television news tend to be few and far between largely because of the commercial, entertainment-oriented nature of the medium. But GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LOOK isn't entirely successful in making its points in either direction. The DVD includes a making-of documentary that is reasonably interesting and an audio commentary that is largely spurious. Recommended, but primarily for those who already have enough historical knowledge to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","This is a class movie by a class director full of great subtle performances by the whole cast. Clooney directs and fills a supporting role in this movie based around the media's response to the McCarthy enquiry. David Strathairn is fantastic in the lead role of television journalist Ed Murrow who leads a one man campaign to show the public the injustice's of Senator Joe McCarthy. He stands when many would fall withstanding pressures from the network and it's associated corporations. This is a message that Clooney knows is still completely relevant today (if not more so, if you consider the American television coverage of Iraq). The film is shot in black and white given it a lovely noir type atmosphere, you can almost smell the smoked filled rooms that broadcasters habit. The films is well shot with some real nice stylistic shots that must have Lent a sly smile to Sodenberg. These is a slow movie at it certainly helps if you are a fan of Clooney or have an interest in politics and like Clooney lean to the left (which are all pluses for me), but there is also a superb supporting cast who all give fine performances including Robert Downey Jnr (being remarkably restrained) , Clooney himself, Jeff Bridges and Patricia Clarkson matching the boys with the only substantial female role. I will certainly be watching this movie again and I recommend you give it a chance."

","We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home."" -A thought that resonates true throughout, director and star, George Clooney's latest gem, Good Night, & Good Luck. Starring David Strathairn with a near perfect performance of the legendary Ed Murrow, Good Night, & Good Luck takes a behind-the-scenes look at Broadcast Journalism's most memorable battle: Edward Murrow vs. Senator Joseph McCarthy. Viewers may find polishing up their American History knowledge of the 1950's Red Scare beneficial, but note this-- Good Night, & Good Luck's screen play, written by Grant Heslov, follows the events in remarkable accuracy stimulating those old memories of 11th grade history class (7th period while desperately trying to stay awake) allowing any viewer to follow along. But Good Night, & Good Luck is anything but a history lesson. The film portrays the fast paced exciting moments of live television, and with the advantage of hindsight Clooney could make a protagonist out of Murrow and his team (featuring the notable Clooney as Fred Freidnly, Robert Donwey Jr as Joe Wershba, and Jeff Daniels as Sig Mickelson). The film samples real footage from the Communist hearings and the rebuttal Sen McCarthy gives on Murrow's show. It leaves a genuine feeling, even a sense of patriotism, when Murrow heroically stands up for his country and the people being bullied by McCarthy. Another mentionable performance was by Ray Wise in his portrayal of the sad, and the slow deterioration of Don Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck committed suicide during the weeks of the CBS quarrel with Sen McCarthy. With Good Night, & Good Luck's undeniable charm, timeliness with current political deception, and quick intelligent wit, Ed Murrow and the gang of CBS moguls may help restore a little faith back in the liberal media."
"rmax304823","8","1","2","21 May 2007"," Surprisingly low key docudrama.
","I approached this film warily. Here you've got George Clooney as writer and director and actor, and who IS George Clooney? A self-proclaimed liberal with a background in afternoon television dramas. He's made a movie about a shameful episode in America's past in which lives were ruined and there were few heroes. And the movie focuses on Edward R. Murrow, who is widely acknowledged as among the first and most deserving of those heroes.<br/><br/>Well -- look out, now! I figured we were due for a colorful, bombastic civics lesson with every point underscored and overwritten.<br/><br/>But, nope. Instead, Clooney has come up with a low-key black-and-white drama about Murrow that shows him as mirthless and doesn't dig into his personal life to give him a more human, hale-fellow-well-met identity. We don't even know where he's from. David Strathairn doesn't smile once. Here's Murrow, warts and all. He doesn't come across as much of an idealist either. He's strictly a newsman. Neither he, nor his able supporting cast, give a single speech about freedom of the press or due process. Only once, in one or two sentences, does he dig in his heels when negotiating with his boss, Bill Paley, about the show. He asks Paley what he wants. Paley replies that he doesn't want to get a bellyache from not knowing what's going to happen next on Murrow's show. And Murrow replies evenly, ""Well, Bill, that's the price you have to pay."" The threat of firings and resignations linger unspoken in the air.<br/><br/>So -- totally against my expectations -- the story isn't hyped at all. There are no speeches fulminating against McCarthyism. (I don't think the word ""McCarthyism"" is even used. Maybe it should have been. Recent polls show that most high school students believe Watergate took place before 1900.) No dramatic music, no music at all except occasional inserts presumably taken from Columbia Records which CBS operated. Even the suicide of one of the news staff's colleagues is short and silent. And nobody says anything afterward about what a great guy Dan Hollenbeck was, although we see Murrow mention him briefly at the end of a broadcast. Murrow paid for his freedom of speech with a commitment to ""Person To Person"" interviews with celebrities. They were supposed to be like Robert Oppenheimer but instead they became Liberace. Note when the lights go out after the Liberace visit and Strathairn looks up and rolls his eyes slightly.<br/><br/>Murrow smoked all the time and died of lung cancer. Yet the film ends at a party given in Murrow's honor, a tribute. A cheaper approach would have followed Murrow through his medical exams, his death bed speeches, his funeral, the rousing perorations of his colleagues -- but the film has none of that.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie seems to have been deliberately stripped of every quality that might give it commercial appeal. No one shouts at anyone else. No one gets angry. No one swears. People don't fight or have hot sex. Nobody wrenches anybody else's head off and spits down the neck cavity. This damps the drama. I'm not sure how much appeal this film actually had, except for older people, or for people comfortable enough in their skins to absorb a message that isn't pounded into them -- a dwindling few, I'm afraid. How many young people know who McCarthy was or what he did? It's the kind of movie that demands the viewer's attention. It doesn't compromise. ""LA Confidential,"" a fine movie in its own right, is set in the same period as this movie. But in ""LA Confidential,"" nobody smokes. Why not? Presumably it would turn off some more-than-usually moral people in the audience who would interpret it as a promotion for tobacco smoking. In ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" just about everybody smokes cigarettes. Why? Because just about everybody smoked cigarettes in 1952, that's why. That's what I mean by ""uncompromising."" If you watch this, don't expect to be led by the hand through the evils of overzealous patriotism. Condemnation and imprisonment for reasons kept secret are taken for granted as wrong. President Eisenhower is seen on TV speaking briefly about habeus corpus. Many of us seem to have forgotten the meaning of the term or the dangers of ignoring due process.<br/><br/>That last sentence I wrote is more preachy than anything you'll find in this film. Clooney is no Oliver Stone. He trusts the viewer to be able to distinguish good from evil, and it's very flattering to find a writer/director willing to do that."

I think that the subject matter of the film is outstanding, but the film deserves to be reviewed aside from your political views on the issue.<br/><br/>Good Night does not fall victim to any kind of pretentious film making and doesn't need to employ and overly dramatic techniques to make the movie work. Good Night uses tight, black and white photography to very accurately capture the smoky feel of journalism in the 50's. The dialog is great and is all that is need to fuel the film. The tension of the situation is tangible without any corny suspense moments. The flow of real conversation is clearly evident and is refreshing to hear. The soundtrack is perfect for the piece and has a voice of it's own that perfectly compliment s the piece.<br/><br/>The cast is a knockout down the line. Having said that I think that David Strathairn deserves extra kudos for his rendition of Murrow; a great performance that most certainly deserved it's Oscar nod.

Superb performances all round (David Strathairn in particular) and a fascinating look at one of the darkest periods in America's modern history. The dangers of television pointed out in the final speech by Edward R. Murrow were a prophetic warning as to what and how television should be used. The question as to where the responsibility lies and what should be done to place restrictions on the material broadcast remains to be asked? I can see how such a film remains ever so timely in todays world of television and how anything outrageous is broadcast for the sake of boosting ratings. For me, Good Night, and Good Luck is a comparison piece to Sidney Lumet's Network, two films that look at the television industry and address what is right and proper to broadcast to a nation. While Network is a satire, they both address the same issues and they remain as both important, fascinating and topical films."

","'If you are not with us, your against us.' The phrase of the ignorant. I am so glad that movies like this exist. Along with 'the Grapes of Wrath.' They do not dissuade the powerful from trying to control our thoughts and behaviour, but they sure are a thorn in the side. Cloony takes a supportive role to David Strathairn as Ed Murrow, (A man I should be thankful to as a kid born in Woolwich, London 1945. That I was not, is because I did not know about his broadcasts) That we have such men as Murrow is a cause to be thankful. It is unfortunate that I have to say that David has not the gravity, although certainly the voice, but not special presence that this role demanded. This is not to take away from the man - he is good, but not good enough for this particular role. Who is? Orson Wells, perhaps even James Mason? I say worse about Georgy boy, I've never believed him in a role. Good man though he is. Certainly gets my support is he ever ran for the Big Pres. The guy in this movie for me is Frank Langella as William Paley. I believed him, his responsibility, his doubt and his act of loyalty.

"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","21 November 2006"," The journalist vs. the senator.
","It's already a sort of forgotten subject, the McCarthy-hearings from the early '50's, though it perhaps is one of the blackest pages out of the modern American history in which Senator Joseph McCarthy was exploiting the fears of Americans regarding the communist threat, by (falsly) accusing hundreds of Americans of all social levels (without ever presenting proper evidence) of various Communist activities, on live TV. Nobody dared to oppose him until CBS television journalist Edward R. Murrow and his crew of journalist decided to stand up to him and stop his hearings/investigations by airing opposing documentaries and telling the real 'truth' to the public about McCarthy and the accusations he made.<br/><br/>The fact that this movies dares to touch such a controversial and not much talked about subject is already a reason why the movie is such a fascinating and relevant one to watch. It's a movie about people who dare to stand up to the government and use the powerful tool that media is to do so and deliver its message to the public, fully knowing what the consequences of it for them personally might be. It's inspiring and still applies to certain situations this present day.<br/><br/>Clooney definitely is not the most brilliant director but at least he is a daring one. He is not afraid to touch some (for Americans) controversial subjects. Not only as a director but also as an actor and producer. He and the movie were rewarded with six Oscar nominations for this.<br/><br/>The movie is shot atmospherically entirely in black & white and uses only real archive footage of McCarthy and the hearings, rather than make him a movie character. It suits the atmosphere and the time period the movie is set in. I don't know for some reason black & white movies always are more beautiful to look at and the images better help to tell the story. Thank goodness that there are also still film-makers around that realize this and have the guts to still shoot a movie entirely in black & white.<br/><br/>The movie handles some interesting matters, involving several characters. The movie easily could and perhaps also should had lasted 3 hours long, instead of merely 93 minutes. The subject screams for more and a deeper insightful treatment. Some of the elements and characters in the movie are rather raffled unfortunately.<br/><br/>The movie is very well cast and has some great actors. David Strathairn is absolutely brilliant in his role and it is without doubt the best role out of his career till date. Clooney also allowed himself to play a small and toned down role in the movie, which absolutely adorns him as a person. Some smaller roles also are there for actors such as Frank Langella, Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>In my opinion not a classic must-see but still an essential viewing, due to its subject.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ClaytonDavis","9","1","2","11 November 2006"," ""Good Night"" is really Good
","PRE Oscars REVIEW: This is the most important film I have seen this year by far. Never have I seen a story so masterfully told and focuses solely on the issue and not around the irrelevant events that surround the issues. The true light to the film is George Clooney's beautiful direction of the story of Edward R. Murrow. Clooney truly has as an eye for film-making and he certainly stretches out his legs here and shows some true talent. Clooney has the ability to go the way of Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, and Clint Eastwood and make his way to the shortlist for his very intelligent writing, his beloved acting and masterful directing. He may find his way more likely in directing and writing than his acting. Clooney played Fred Friendly great but it definitely wasn't one of the best of the year. Better luck with ""Syriana"" if he wants to get in for acting.<br/><br/>The screenplay for GN & GL was so intelligent that it kept you intrigued the entire time. Not only is the movie very good but it speaks directly to us and by us I mean Americans today about many issues that we choose to forget about. Along with Grant Heslov, the co-writer with Clooney they have a real shot at some gold here. It is pretty much already known that ""Crash"" is the early frontrunner and favorite for the original screenplay win but this will give it a run for the money David Strathairn gives a mind to pen to life performance. He plays Edward R. Murrow to the T and his hard work hopefully will not go unrecognized. The only problem with the performance is the performance that goes with the story itself which isn't the fault of the writer or the actor but just the way events occurred. They never show Murrow in his house or outside the NBC studio in fact so we never get to see the ""human"" side of Murrow. Strathairn plays the part professionally and keeps it there. Maybe if Strathairn showed a bit of a tear drop or make a fist with anger could he seal his nomination. I see him grabbing a critics award or two but Oscar will have to wait for another time and movie to award this actor. Strathairn is the standout of the film but doesn't stand alone.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is magnificent. Clooney as stated before gives a one-two punch performance along with Frank Langella whom Sasha Stone has on her site as a possible contender for supporting actor. And it makes sense; veteran actor, never nominated, a legend to some, and underrated. The time might be right. Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey, Jr., and Jeff Daniels also give great supporting performances but they lack that ""one scene"" that could get them to the short list. Daniels still has ""The Squid and the Whale"", Downey, Jr. has ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and Clarkson had ""All the Kings Men"" but now will have to wait on the reaction to ""The Dying Gaul"" which I think isn't the film that will do it.<br/><br/>Oscar predictions include a good bet for Best Picture with a leading actor nomination for David Strathairn. A supporting nod for Langella is in order if academy voters love it and want to acknowledge the veteran actor. I say Clooney has a 75/25 chance on a double nomination in screenplay and directing. He might just have the director's lone spot of the year. (lone spot means director nomination but not best picture nod) And one or two technical category nods including cinematography, film editing, and maybe even a costume design.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the cast and crew for a terrific job on one of the best films of the year. You can bet this will be in my top 10 list at the end of the year. Good Night, and Good Luck folks.<br/><br/>Grade: ***1/2/****"

","This is not the first film of George Clooney, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' preceded it, but this is certainly the first important film. I am no big fan of Clooney the actor, even in this film his own part seems to me one of the weakest links in a very good movie, and I prefer that he focuses on directing. 'Good Night, and Good Luck' shows that he has the talent.<br/><br/>The story of the fight between the CBS news team and the political persecution and witch hunt led by right-wing senator McCarthy in the 50s has strong connotation in the actual political scene in America. This is one more reason to applaud the good work done by Clooney, who is shooting the whole movie in black and white and mixes almost perfectly real news footage with the atmosphere in the TV studios of the time recreated with a great care for detail. Jazz music links pleasantly between the scenes and builds the overall tome of the film. Splendidly acted by David Strathairn in the principal role, Downey Jr., and a few other excellent actors, the principal downsize is the lack of more consistent material. It is seldom that I consider a film to be shorter that it should be, but here is one of those cases. Yet concision may be looked as a sign of quality and hopefully, this movie coming directly from the tradition of 'Citizen Kane' will be one of the first steps in a magnificent director career."

","I deeply enjoyed the movie because the characters are true and human : I always felt how depressing it was for those suspected to be communists and actually not belonging to this political party. How could they prove they were not what they were accused to be ? The black and white pictures and the movements of the camera add a lot to the drama especially when the camera comes very close to the journalist with a veil of smoke coming up from his cigarette reinforcing the impression that they all feel glued in a deep fog. So does the position of the journalist rarely facing the camera but looking at the lens with a light turn of his head and shoulders."
"RJBurke1942","9","1","2","10 September 2006"," Back to the future, with a metaphor for American politics that is still running...
","This is movie that many in the USA would find hard to take, or even to pay money to see.<br/><br/>In the first place, it's the sort of story that most Americans would probably find unpalatable: not only is it about an episode in American history that is still a blot on the essence of democracy anywhere, it's a stark parallel with some of the more dubious practices of the current Bush administration about which most are familiar. Of course, history from around the world is full of corrupt politics and politicians; so many Americans are no doubt aware that they are not alone, in that regard.<br/><br/>In addition, it iswella purely political story and, these days, not too many cinema-goers and DVD buyers are interested in politics, especially politics from the 1950s.<br/><br/>And that's a real shame because, politics aside, it's an extremely detailed and well-produced film. The period sets are exquisite; the jazz music is great; the dialog is spot on; the acting is superb and the seamless use of actual footage of the senate hearings, with the late Joseph McCarthy, is eerily real. Over the years, I'd seen a number of documentaries that featured the senator, but this is out of this world (no pun intended). And, the use of black and white photography simply made it all the better.<br/><br/>It's not a movie for action fans, for romantics, those who want thrillers, or the comedian in you. This is drama of the highest order, although there are some great wisecracks between Clooney (as Fred Friendly) and Strathairn (as Ed Murrow); but, you have to listen carefully, or you'll miss 'em.<br/><br/>Although it did poorly at the Oscars (not unexpected, I would imagine) it's a credit to the producers, the director and the actors that this movie was completed and shown around the world. I just hope that Hollywood is able to continue to present such quality cinema during these trying times for the USA and the rest of the world."

","Good Night, and Good Luck, based on real-life events, is a docu-drama exploring the 5-6 year period of the CBS show See it Now. The hard-hitting semi-news show is headed by the passionate and driven host Edward Murrow. During the 50's, when the cold war paranoia was still gripping USA, Senator Joseph McCarthy fueled the public fear, uncertainty, doubt by going after many supposed communist sympathizers. In a time when opposition was equated with conspiracy, Joseph McCarthy easily handed out conspirator titles to anyone opposing him. Good Night and Good Luck shows the fight of Edward Murrow as he, through See it Now, went after Senator McCarthy and his hysterical witch-burning trials.<br/><br/>George Clooney, the man behind Good Night, and Good Luck, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the 50's. The movie has a distinct charm, due not entirely to the settings. The mood, the music, the dialogs, the reactions, all seem very 50s. The precision with which everything in this film is crafted cannot be highlighted enough. The insults and accusations are trenchant, yet dignified. The carefully weighed words and the impact of each sentence shows how different those times were. I dread to imagine what would happen if CBS had aired The Daily Show even for a single day!<br/><br/>A special mention must go to the aptness of the film in this day and age. This film isn't just a dedication to the astounding challenges overcome by Edward Murrow and friends. It is very relevant to what is happening today in the USA. With terms such as War on Terror, Homeland Security, Threat Levels, and so on doing rounds, politicians seem to be feeding and milking the public frenzy. The film producers see the breakdown of the media and news networks much like Edward Murrow did in 1958. They are reminding us all that those days of paranoia and mass confusion are not behind us, that the media isn't always as ""fair and balanced"" as they proclaim. This is a call-out to all of us, to recognize the motivations behind the words, to know that there needn't always a compromise between national security and individual freedom, to remember that the constitution gives us the right of freedom even if it isn't the most popular thing at the moment. The movie shows the difficult waters trodden by the makers of See it Now and are reminding the current crop of political commentators to not forget that reporting the truth is their first duty.<br/><br/>A brilliant film by a brilliant mind, this gripping drama is a must-watch, not only for its timeless message, but for its sheer film-making greatness."

I already knew this. In fact, this movie didn't tell me much I didn't already know, because he was already a TV icon. Go into any library, and you can find books written specifically about his brand of journalism. A quick Google search while writing this review came back with over 1.8 million hits on his full name. That isn't including derivatives, misspellings and use of just his last name. In the TV age, he is a famous man, though he didn't really try to be.<br/><br/>But this movie told his story in a very real, very personal light. It didn't give you every detail, or try and give you an overview of his entire life. Again, because much of the story that is told is public record, it could have been warped, distorted, or told differently...but it wasn't. I got what I think was a real sense of who Edward R. Murrow was, a real person who was not entirely sure that what he was saying was the 'right' thing. But he felt it was his responsibility to tell it.<br/><br/>In short, this movie doesn't try to do everything.

The production and performances are flawless in their evocation of the early days of television, a brave new world where the commitment to public service and editorial integrity superseded all other considerations; a state of affairs that seems to have been lost forever in the blizzard of empty presentation that characterises current TV news.

","Superb performances, particularly from star David Strathairn, highlight this tale of communist fears and a broadcast industry turned upside down. Strathairn is Edward R.

Appropriately shot in black and white, this sharp-looking film captures the essence of the era and what many consider an overreaction to the threat of ""commies."" It's also an intriguing inside look at journalism and its power.<br/><br/>Some have labeled ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" as liberal Hollywood propaganda (particularly since Democrat George Clooney directed), but it's far from it. The film is objective enough that it doesn't necessarily portray Murrow as the hero, and, though the characters oppose him, McCarthy is given enough time to make his case and respond to various Murrow accusations (actual footage of the senator is used). Overall, this is a well-made, entertaining depiction of a fascinating story."

Similar things are happening today so this film is all the more prophetic. George Clooney co-authors and directs a film of limited length but at 93 minutes, it runs just long enough to hold your attention and challenge modern day authority.

Thus just sort of a few small climaxes, there was no single big huge event, which is what I was expecting. But its still a great movie with a good message. When people start to get scared to say their opinion about the government we enter a dangerous time.

","I enjoyed seeing the movie and it definitely had moments of near greatness.<br/><br/>Unlike trying to stretch the point today, this was truly a time in our history that challenged the very core of constitutional rights of individuals. While Senator McCarthy didn't invent the fear they lived in , he truly used it for his own obsessive agenda.<br/><br/>Where the movie lacked being a top film was how it strayed all too often from what we all wanted to see and know. That silly hidden love-affair and relationship going on in the office took precious time away from trying to comprehend this historical time. Why the writers and director chose this approach is very puzzling.<br/><br/>I still recommend the film but not with enthusiasm. Reading a good historical book on Murrow vs McCarthy , and how it all came about, would give you better insight than the film did."

","First, the plot:<br/><br/>In the early 1950's, the threat of Communism created an air of paranoia in the United States and exploiting those fears was Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. However, CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow and his producer Fred W. Friendly decided to take a stand and challenge McCarthy and expose him for the fear monger he was. However, their actions took a great personal toll on both men, but they stood by their convictions and helped to bring down one of the most controversial senators in American history.<br/><br/>This was one of the best movies I have seen in the last decade.

"Syrchek","8","1","2","24 April 2006"," Not for a careless viewer. In terms of politics and history of course.
","George Clooney's second fully-length feature takes on a past but remarkably present theme of protecting the civil liberties in an otherwise democratic state. We see him perform the role of a CBS producer Frank Friendly who worked on the early 1950's show, hosted by Edward R. Murrow. Murrow was a broadcast journalist on CBS and an open critic of the internal politics of that time's senator, Joseph McCarthy. He made history with his approximately half an hour long show in which he aired his thoughts on the senator's stands on communism. He also reported about the otherwise obscure stories of civil liberty violations that were a result of the senator's activities.<br/><br/>I was stunned by Murrow's prefatory speech that happened a few years after his bold activity on CBS. Talking about the obvious but strangely concealed always sounds stunning when it comes from people of his type. David Strathairn gave an incredible performance and made me wish to see more of these kind of shows where a cigarette smoking commentator provokes your thoughts on the up-to-date topics. <br/><br/>Seeing it in black&white makes the film feel more unbiased. Overall, people who see movies for sheer entertainment and who are more or less unaware of past and present events in politics don't need my warning. Like some movies, this one doesn't market itself like it's something else than what it is, meaning that it's pretty much what you might expect but well executed. It's a small possibility that the 'wrong' kind of viewer will see it. It can seem boring at times but it was worth the attention because of Murrow's lucid and consistent criticism. Good night, and good luck.<br/><br/>........ 4/5 ........"
"rps-2","8","1","2","22 April 2006"," Worthwhile movie
","As a former news broadcaster who lived through the era, I was fascinated. If I were 40 years younger and had never worked in media, I might not be so enthusiastic. In fact, I might be very confused. So this film may not be to everybody's taste. But it's a good thing that it was made. David Strathairn has done such a fantastic job of emulating Murrow""s whole persona --- voice, appearance, body language --- it's spooky. The decision to shoot only black and white was a gutsy one. It captures the spirit of the era and helps with the integration of historic news footage. As good as it is, I wonder if it might have been even better if it had done Murrow's whole life story, rather than concentrating only on the McCarthy broadcasts. For example, his radio broadcasts from London during the blitz, a high tech marvel and a journalistic innovation in 1940 and their impact in both Britain and the US and on the future of radio news, were historic. The one disappointment was the lack of much substance in the extra features on the DVD. There should have been some archival footage of the real Murrow and maybe even something about the 1958 RTNDA convention where Murrow gave his famous speech. There are a lot of people who were there that night. For the benefit of younger viewers, there should be an epilogue concerning Murrow's subsequent life. He had a falling out with Bill Paley, left CBS to take over the Voice Of America under Lyndon Johnson, an unhappy time for him, and eventually paid the price for his years of smoking in a long and difficult death from lung cancer."

","While the era and the events that occurred may be of profound importance to the history of America, this movie does not share the distinction in the history of film. I can only really imagine that this would make a wonderful reenactment to punctuate a documentary on the time. In order to be profoundly affected one would have to be more profoundly empathic than the average person. Murrow may have undergone a terrific personal terror, but it is one that isn't communicated by spectating the newscasts. In fact, there is very little beyond the newscasts that hints at any terror. In the genre of historical drama, this movie pales in comparison to movies such as ""Thirteen Days."" As far as learning about the events of the time, you are probably better off simply viewing archived footage, of if you were to watch this movie, do so in conjunction with a history class. This movie can only be considered great when one also has some in-depth, previous knowledge and appreciation of the times. By itself it is dry and slow with far too much time taken up by musical transitions."

"styleequeen","7","1","2","16 April 2006"," Stylish but thin on plot
","An above average cinematic experience, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is nevertheless more documentary than movie.<br/><br/>While the acting is flawless, the subject poignant and the camera-work clever (at times distractingly so), by far the best parts of the whole are the archived footage and reenacted Munroe broadcasts. In fact so much screen time is given over to these latter two that the rest of the film feels somewhat tacked together to allow history to speak for itself. In many ways this is fine - McCarthy was a fascinating character, whatever else may be said of him, and Munroe's eloquence was nonpareil. However, it makes for some very trite and two-dimensional supporting characters and almost zero tension and plot.<br/><br/>It's well known that this was an frightening time for anyone who wanted to speak out for the erosion of human rights and American freedoms, but this is barely explored within the insulated world of the movie. CBS is an institution entirely populated by brave, super-supportive people with buckets of integrity and honour. Which is all very nice, but within a film, doesn't provide much scope for dramatic tension. Most of the characters are underwritten, and only two exist to illustrate the dangers and consequences of speaking out - one in so mild a form as to be forgettable, while one harassed colleague tops himself after three scenes, an event so predictable I had bets going as to his method by his second appearance. And certainly Robert Downey Jr. is wasted on his insignificant role.<br/><br/>While much can be said for Clooney's debut as a director, his screen writing abilities are limited. As for his Oscar winning appearance? Let us just compare to Judi Dench's win for her 8 minute job in ""Shakespeare in Love"". All in all though, a worthy and thought provoking way to spend a couple of hours."

","This is a quiet film about a particularly vicious and scary time in US history, the McCarthy era. David Strathairn is Edward R.

No one on contemporary network TV comes even close to the sophistication and intelligence of Murrow, not even 60 Minutes which is probably the most thoughtful news show today. Which I guess is the main point of the film; it's an indictment of the current state of TV news reporting which is biased, dumbed-down and entirely without depth.<br/><br/>Strathairn and the supporting cast are all excellent, especially Robert Downey Jr. George Clooney directs and plays Fred Friendly, the co-producer of Murrow's TV show.<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot. It is very low key and quiet but makes its point. You will also get to see a black and white film and be exposed to the machinations of network TV in the 1950s. If you already detest the stupidity of network TV news, this movie will put the final nail in the coffin."
"ginger_the_Wolf","9","1","2","6 April 2006"," One of the best films of 2005
","The days of the newscaster are dead; made virtually obsolete with the invention of the Internet. Yet in Good Night, and Good Luck, George Clooney's sophomore film as a director, we are brought back to the 1950s, the era of McCarthy and the newscasters like Edward R. Murrow. In perhaps one of the top films of the year, an era of the past is recreated with accuracy and added interest because of great performances and a tightly knit script.<br/><br/>The real strength of this film lies in its wonderful atmosphere and its attempts to recreate a time in our not so recent history. Black and white photography adds familiarity because it is how we best remember the era. It adds contrast and accentuates the thick smoke that breaths through every scene. The complex sets that the designers fitted every detail imaginable could only be matched by actual documentary footage. The cinematography evokes a time of the past, and brings us in the room with the characters. It is subtle and involved, bringing us through the television screen into the world of journalism.<br/><br/>The inherit difficulty of portraying historical people almost does not apply because of the strength of the performers in Good Night and Good Luck. Strong supporting performances by Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, George Clooney and Ray Wise add depth to the film, but it is David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow who owns the show. The audience gets lost in Strathairn's performance and we forget he's acting. He portrays Murrow with such strength, and his unflinching wit keeps us glued to the screen. This is a sincere and real performance, and perhaps the opportunity of a lifetime for Straithairn, who until now was a perpetual secondary character actor. An interesting decision in the casting of the film was to use actual archival footage of McCarthy, instead of an actor. His out of place antics show the power and fear this man instigated, and why Murrow worked so hard to bring him down.<br/><br/>The final piece of the puzzle lies in the script. Much in the vein of a Frank Capra film, this is the story of one man who can make a difference. Yet, unlike Capra, this story of a real man lacks the often over sentimental and idealistic interpretations that are found in most of Capra's movies. This film breezes by and leaves you thinking long after you are finished watching. However, this is the one area of fault that this film encounters. Although the script is excellent, I felt as though there were several unresolved stories and one or two story lines were left hanging. This is a minor quibble however, because it is barely noticeable.<br/><br/>Although this film is about times past, it is still hard-hitting and relevant to today's audiences due to combination of many factors. Good Night and Good Luck is a film that is an important film for society today because it shows a possibility for change and prevalence of will power and intelligence. It should be interesting to see what George Clooney tackles next."

Perhaps it loses some of it's entertainment factor by staying so close to the source material, however that doesn't detract too much. For one such as myself with very little prior knowledge of the subject matter, the film is rather confusing at first. After the first half hour or so though, the plot sucks you in and you wont want to blink. Strathairn skillfully heads up a wholly incredible cast, backed up by such strong supporting actors as Ray Wise, Frank Langella, and even director George Clooney himself. Though Clooney is great on both sides of the camera, in this film he really shines behind it. The beautiful cinematography blew me away, though I am a sucker for back and white. Overall, this film does drag in parts but is completely worth it. Should have one at least one or two Oscars.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"virek213","10","1","2","31 March 2006"," TV's First Battle Royale: Murrow Vs. McCarthy
","Of all the embarrassments in American history, few can compare in magnitude to the witch hunt conducted in the early 1950s against real and alleged Communists by Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. But there was at least one man who was willing to use the powers he had to call McCarthy's bluff on the issue, and do so on an embryonic medium called the television. That man was legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, and that televised battle royale between him and McCarthy is the subject of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK, directed and co-written by George Clooney (who portrays CBS news director Fred Friendly) and so titled after Murrow's celebrated closing line at the end of his newscasts.<br/><br/>David Straithairn does a superlative job of portraying Murrow, who, while realizing that his actions might very well jeopardize him, his colleagues and the entire CBS television network, nevertheless could not just stand idly by and see a demagogue like McCarthy persecute those he merely suspected of ""being Red"" without a shred of evidence to back up those claims. Television was still a relative novelty when these events took place in 1953 and 1954, and because of this, the battle between the uncompromising newsman and the equally uncompromising junior senator from Wisconsin was one that helped make television news into an institution, and the first example of television's ability to influence the minds and opinions of people on matters of vital importance. GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK also shows how, even early on, the line between corporate profits and social values was one that needed to be trod with care, especially in the sometimes heated discussions Straithairn has with CBS chairman William Paley, played to brilliance by Frank Langella. In a very wise move on Clooney's part, he filmed this movie in glorious black-and-white and recreated the look of CBS News during the 1950s in such a way that one gets a true sense of the period. Straithairn accurately captures Murrow's clipped speech tones while reporting the news and commenting on McCarthy's heated Commie fishing expeditions. The ensemble casting is rounded out by folks like Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, and Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>Though set in the early years of television, the story of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK still seems hugely relevant today; and it is for that reason, plus the fact that his father Nick was a highly respected TV newsman in Cincinnati, that Clooney took this project on. Murrow was not afraid to hit hard at what he saw were wrongs being committed by such a tyrant as McCarthy--a kind of bravery that newsmen of today could learn from when dealing with those who say that to question the veracity and the truthfulness of the U.S. government with respect to the war in Iraq is somehow ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"", and somehow ""gives aid and comfort to the enemy."" Unsurprisingly, this is the mark of liberal Hollywood film-making (and Clooney himself is an unabashed liberal), but then so be it. As a look behind a defining moment in American history, especially with respect to television news, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a great singular achievement. It is also an example of the kind great, hard-hitting, issue-oriented film-making that Hollywood was so great at during the 1960s and 1970s--a trait that has only been reawakened the last few years with the Iraq war and post-9/11 paranoia. In short, this is by any stretch of the imagination a must-see movie."
"DeStyles","9","1","2","31 March 2006"," A well-crafted film with the guts and suave of Edward R. Murrow himself.
","To hell with Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and the rest of those fear-mongering, revisionist loud mouths. This is political film-making at its near best. It is a shame more people in the United States didn't see it.<br/><br/>George Clooney has bumped his directorial skills up a few notches here, since his debut with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" It's evident that he pushes the limits of comfort for his cast, crew and himself. The casualty of this risk-taking reveals itself with a few weak scenes and a slightly confused pacing, but overall, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a far better and cohesive film than most of the tripe that makes its way to the theaters today. Give David Strathairn strong praise, as usual, but hey, he doesn't come close to capturing the signature sturdy voice of Murrow (who could, really?). And his performance lacks the kinetics of Philip Seymor Hoffman's portrait of Capote--but maybe that's not the point here. This isn't a film about Murrow, but one more about an idealism that is long lost in our current cadre of so-called ""journalists."" <br/><br/>Additionally, the qualities of Cloney's direction go beyond just the mechanics of film-making. There is a crucial story here, one that is chillingly familiar in these dark days of George W. Bush. One that takes strength and vision to tell properly. It is fitting that the film is shot in black and white, because that is how the uber-right wing sees the world. Maybe it will help the point of this film sink in better with them. Good Luck with that, I suppose."

Murrow did not shy away from controversy and was not afraid of McCarthy and his televised witch-hunt searching out those who were accused of being sympathetic to Communist causes. Clooney plays Murrow's friend and colleague Fred Friendly. CBS exec William Paley is played by Frank Langella. Other cast members of note: Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels and Ray Wise. Strathairn's appearance and mannerisms are excellent copies of Murrow's.

"abum190","8","1","2","26 March 2006"," A very good movie
","This movie engaged me from beginning to end for several different reasons. One was the overall style- like everything was real. Clooney films everything as if it were real footage; but not necessarily footage that people want to see- footage people need to see. There is a certain urgency in everything- the way the camera moves, the way it focuses on one person at a time, the manner in which it changes focus. From what I have read about the making of this movie, Clooney intended to draw parallels to our time now, but I felt more of a documentary sense in this film. It does not feel like an allegory to this age, but a chronicle of that one.<br/><br/>Another thing was the acting. Well, actually, there is no real acting in this movie, only being. David Strathairn is Edward Murrow. Frank Langella is Bill Paley. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson are the Wershbas. John McCarthy is...oh, wait. Even George Clooney isn't George Clooney in this movie. He does not steal the spotlight at all and cedes everything over to Strathairn and the storyline.<br/><br/>The dialog is wonderful too. This is a very quotable movie, but even beyond that, the words coming out of these people's mouths are made real. Clooney has his actors speak over each other and draws attention to the important lines by having the dialog trickle away until there is only one person speaking and then repeats the process all over again- which is pretty much how real conversations take place. However, this also makes it hard to follow the plot at times and it takes a good deal of concentration in some parts to keep up.<br/><br/>This movie's great accomplishment is creating a real setting and atmosphere and making something that was a reality then in real life into a reality now on film."

Now I have never seen a clip of Ed Murrow so am unable to say how like him David Strathairn was, that said though I don't think we needed to know the original because his acting was so good, understated and commanding, well deserving of an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were equally as good, I liked the fact that George kept himself in the background throughout the film. Patrica Clarkson turned in yet another strong performance, I'm not sure this woman ever has a bad day. Coupled with Robert Downey Jr who complimented her very well and showed that he also can act.<br/><br/>The stroke of genius in my opinion was using McCarthy footage and not an actor, this made it seem all the more real, which of course originally it was. A big thumbs up for all concerned and I agree with George it is about time we had more films about things that mean something or say something."
"poc-1","7","1","2","21 March 2006"," Excellent but with narrow appeal
","This movie portrays the battle between CBS and Senator McCarthy in the 1950s. For those who don't know, this was the period where Joseph Mc Carthy became chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and used it to perform an anti-communist ""witch-hunt"" calling dozens of prominent people and basically accusing them of treason on little or no evidence. It is very stylish, filmed in black and white with occasional jazz music. The character portrayal of Murrow (David Straithairn) is flawless. McCarthy appears in archive footage. The atmosphere of a 1950s newsroom is faithfully reproduced. Strangely I found George Clooney seemed to detract from this because he is such a familiar face on TV. <br/><br/>In what it is, the film is pretty well perfect. It shows a genuine moment of human heroism where one man had the courage to stand up and say enough was enough. On the other hand, those who know nothing of the history may not find it engaging enough to draw them in. It does not go beyond its brief to inform and provide background to the climate of terror that McCarthy fostered. In fairness, most people would probably find this movie boring. But that's OK, a movie of this kind can't have mass-appeal."

Murrow was not afraid to report the truth. He is what many reporters today have tried to live up to.The fear of McCarthy was very real by the people of the country and Murrow exposes the fear by talking about it on his newscast.

If I am not mistaken, this was the first movie David Strathairn was ever nominated for Best Actor, and probably the greatest movie role he has had up until now.<br/><br/>The dialog is simply incredible. Edward Murrow was well known for his ability to pull his listeners and viewers into his reporting and broadcasting -- with the assistance of that smooth, melancholic voice of his, of course.<br/><br/>There could never have been a better choice for Murrow than Strathairn, all because of his apparently timid outward demeanor, but with that sense of fortitude and perseverance on the inside that made this movie what it is.<br/><br/>If there's any 2005 movie you want to rent, or buy, forget A History of Violence, forget 40 Year-Old Virgin.

","It has been awhile since I watched a film and became fully sympathetic and supportive of the views and message that it conveys. The movie is actually well-written, concise and to-the-point (all of which conveys good journalism) which assists in generating the aura of the film. During these times, we have lost touch of the positive and productive role of television or media in general, that is enlightenment, education and culturing and not just pleasure and entertainment. This film is not just about journalism, the freedom to speak and convey ideas or documenting the medial foundation for the constitutional rights of the American citizen, its much deeper than that. I believe that it tells us subliminally, that the current ignorance, fear and unreadiness towards terrorism is due to the inability of journalism to enlighten and broaden the horizons of the viewers to current issues, policies -whether they be homeland or external, and actions the American government carries out which may or may not be in the interest of its people. The closing speech at the end of the film suggests this. It is the responsibility of the media to pass on this information in a consistent and productive manner so as to ready the viewers for the possibilities and outcomes. Good Night, and Good Luck. :)"

","I loved this movie, but I have a huge issue with the fact that Clooney just jumps into the Murrow-attacking-McCarthy thread without illustrating very well what See It Now is all about. Clooney needs to take two or three minutes to establish what See It Now's normal news coverage is like to illustrate that Murrow's sudden editorial stance against McCarthy's commie witch-hunt is so unorthodox and profound. Personally, I think Murrow is a journalistic hero just as the movie portrays, however, without any context in which to place See It Now's McCarthy coverage, Murrow's stance comes off a bit like propaganda. That said, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a work of art unlike anything we've seen in the theaters in recent years. Excellent. Show this to your kids and anyone who doesn't quite get the parallels between McCarthy's witch-hunting and rhetoric coming from the White House today."

","Good Night and Good Luck is one of those rare pieces of cinema that is both immensely important and immensely entertaining. It is one of the years best films and would be easily the best in almost any other year. 2005 was a brilliant year for movies with four masterpieces(And there are still more really good looking movies I have too see!) Good Night and Good Luck, Brokeback Mountain, Crash, and A History of Violence. Although Good Night and Good Luck is not the best of these films it is still simply breath taking. I considered George Clooney a very good actor before seeing Good Night and Good Luck, now I think he is a brilliant actor, director, and screenwriter. The performances are very strong with Clooney's supporting turn as Fred Friendly being the best. David Straithairn is also perfect as Edward R. Murrow while Jeff Daniels and Patricia Clarkson are also amazing in fairly small rolls. Clooney is a brilliant director and really needs to make more movies. Good Night and Good Luck is easily his best work to date as an actor or director and may end up being his crowning film."
"bob-rutzel","10","1","2","17 March 2006"," Excellent History Lesson
","This is a slice of life for an hour and a half of the controversies in the early 1950s with CBS's TV journalist Edward R. Murrow (Strathairn) going up against the USAF and Senator Joseph McCarthy who seemed to accuse everyone of being a communist if they didn't agree with him.<br/><br/>You are only going to see a small part of the life of Murrow who is played perfectly by David Strathairn, but this is more than something about someone's life. This is a part of our history and should be mandatory viewing in all High Schools across the nation and it's better than a Classic Comic Book (are they still around?). This was a very serious time in our history. And, you are going to see how effective Edward R. Murrow was.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in Black and White, but it didn't need to be. There was enough actual B/W TV coverage of Sen McCarthy and that would have been sufficient for effects, but no matter. The actual TV coverage of Sen McCarthy was genius at work, hence no one needed to ""play"" him. You actually get to see history being made. You see the real thing. And, Strathairn's portrayal of Murrow was as close to the real thing as anything I have ever seen. I was a kid back in the early 1950s and I had heard of Edward R. Murrow, of course, but I was a kid and didn't pay too much attention at the time. What I do remember about the time was that the whole country seemed to be watching the Army vs McCarthy hearings and they kind of overshadowed the Murrow broadcasts except for the politicals and the news people. And, now we are here again. Can you see any similarities between then and now? <br/><br/>We learn that Murrow really didn't like doing the Person to Person TV shows, but he did those to keep CBS brass happy with advertisers. The head of CBS played by Frank Langella never censored Murrow, but cringed every time Murrow went on a crusade. Very good interplay here.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn that CBS, at the time, had a policy whereby two CBS employees could not be married to each other. How that played out in the film was never really explained unless I missed it.<br/><br/>Acting all around was excellent. The movie was nominated for 5-Oscars: Best Actor (Strathairn), Art Direction, Best Director (Clooney), Original Screenplay and Best Picture. George Clooney did an excellent job as Director.<br/><br/>Now for Murrow's sign off. Terrible, terrible, terrible. You would think someone would have taken Murrow aside and said, ""Hey, come up with something more people friendly. This sounds like you are in Las Vegas with friends for a night of gambling and you tell them you are tired and are going to bed and leave them with: Good Night and Good Luck (at the tables)."" But no one did and here we are.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent slice of life regarding our history. Again, this should be mandatory viewing in all High Schools across the nation. Good night and good luck with that."

","Seriously, that's about it. All movies this year nominated for awards were merit worthy, but I thought this was better than crash. C'est la Vie. I Have To Have Ten Lines of text, however, so I guess I will continue. I believe that this film was very important to the idea of television today. I mean, seriously, reality television is ridiculous. The concept and the invention of television should be used to help better our society. Crash, on the other hand, was kind of like reality Television, but not really--it was more complex. I'm just talking out of my ass to make ten lines worth of commentary. I thought crash was good and all that, but it was too many plots, and the whole feel of the film was kind of hokey, although poignant. It felt overacted and melodramatic. But hey, what do I know, I'm just and IMDb-er. On the other hand, Good Night was too the point, well acted, humorous, important, and pretty great. C'est la Vie, again."
"Xploitedyouth","9","1","2","16 March 2006"," Read All About It
","I'm not too proud to admit that much of the subject matter of George Clooney's GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK was over my head. I just never learned much about newsman Edward R. Murrow or his fight against witch-hunting junior senator Joseph McCarthy. The best thing I can say about the film, though, is that it made me want to learn more. It's a rare film indeed that has the gumption to speak over the heads of it's audience, but still bait them into discussion and further research. Clooney manages to pull this feat off through sheer artistic invention. This film is glorious to behold, presented in a rich black-and-white palate that suits the story perfectly. The fact that every character is constantly smoking only heightens the stylishness of the film, as Clooney knows precisely how to shoot smoke as an almost mystical and foreboding presence. Another great asset the film has is that marvelous character actor, David Strathairn. His Murrow is a wonder: intelligent, plain-speaking and bold on the air, introspective, compassionate and witty off the air, and amazingly charismatic at all times. His battle of wits with Senator McCarthy is captivating. McCarthy is not portrayed by an actor, but rather by himself, via real archive footage of the famous Communist hunter that shows him as a bully and a coward. Murrow's eventual triumph over him is especially rewarding, as we see the real man flailing when the lights are turned on him during the Army-McCarthy hearings. If the film has a failing, it's in it's insistence on a meaningless subplot, involving a married couple (Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey, Jr.) who must hide their status from their co-workers at CBS, where marriage between employees is forbidden. While the rest of the film is a staunchly political piece, the addition of a small personal story with no real dramatic heft simply eats up time. This is only a small failing, however, as the rest of the film is an incisive and still-relevant piece of work. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my local library..."

","I throughly enjoyed this movie. Everyone did an great job but I was intrigued by the acting of the actor who played Mr. Murrow. He played the courage of his convictions with the fear of his actions very well. George Clooney did a great job of playing second fiddle. I also thought the black and white was an excellent choice and reflecting what the world was like in the 50's with the smoking and dress. My only regret is that I wish there was some indication at the end of the movie of what happened to who so I wouldn't have to run to the internet to catch up on my history. Overall, I should have watched this movie before the Oscars so I could have been shocked about the lack of awards for the film."

The evocotive black and white cinematography intercut with real news reel of the day gives the film a unique feel and perfectly captures the mood.<br/><br/>With obvious parallels between the McCarthy witch-hunts and todays post 9-11 world aside this is how political films should be and begs the question whether or not we really learn from our mistakes. It leaves you in no doubt where Mr Clooney's sympathies lie but it is done without the feel of lecturing and haranguing that these type of films so often fall foul.

"edwagreen","Null","1","2","15 March 2006"," Mood of the 1950s Well Caught in Film ***
","Excellent film editing highlights ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" I haven't seen such good splicing of film since Woody Allen's ""Zelig.""<br/><br/>In reality, Joe McCarthy could have been up for best supporting actor. That really isn't saying much because the acting here is just fair. At times, there appears to be too many guys in the newsroom puffing away on cigarettes. The American Cancer Society should have put out a warning before the film began. That would have been appropriate.<br/><br/>This film is really a documentary. However, it does adequately capture the period of the 1950s when Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisc.) led a cause of terrorism in this country and civil liberties just about ceased to exist. Edward R. Murrow, a brilliant reporter, stood up to him. We see Murrow taken to task by Frank Langella's Bill Paley.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, who looks like he gained 40 pounds for his role as Sig, identifies a couple (Robert Downey and Patricia Clarkson) as being married. That's against CBS policy. How ironic that they go after McCarthy but yet have this archaic rule against employees being married. The usual excellent Clarkson seems out of touch in the role. She just seems to mouth her words.<br/><br/>David Strathairn does well in the role of Edward R. Murrow. He adeptly captures Murrow in his crusade for fairness in treatment of individuals as well as civil liberties. It is also hoped that Strathairn went for chest x-rays at the end of filming of this picture. He will probably need follow up x-rays yearly following all that Murrow-like smoking.<br/><br/>McCarthy was evil in every sense of the word. Just dare to criticize him and you'd incur his wrath. He even equates Murrow with being a member of the I.W.W.<br/><br/>The movie never explains why McCarthy had to leave a meeting involving the Moss woman accused of being a Communist. What happened to this lady?<br/><br/>George Clooney, who directed this film, deserves credit for tackling the McCarthy issue head on."
"dylan-cross","9","1","2","14 March 2006"," A very careful look at paranoia and American censorship.
","After so many years of watching David Strathairn perform in many supporting roles, it was very satisfying to see him play the lead part of Edward Murrows, a 1950's news commentator who eventually went to take on Senator Joe McCarthy and early American censorship. Personally, I thought the film was very brilliant and a nice portrayal of an America caught on the skids of post-war paranoia. What makes this movie so pivotal is the fact that it presents two key arguments to the viewer: the responsibility of journalists to report on major, meaningful issues and the relationship between the bureaucracy and the media when those issues are brought forth. The movie also serves as a haunting allegory of today's America and the state of paranoia its citizens still find themselves contending with.<br/><br/>The story initially takes off in 1958 when Murrow delivers a speech before an audience of prominent journalists as to the responsibility of the media with regard to investigating and presenting credible stories to the American people. After the opening of the speech, the film jumps back to 1953 and into the days Murrow had while working as a commentator for CBS. Already a prominent figure on American TV sets, Murrow and his producers agree to air one of their first controversial pieces: the story of an Airforce lieutenant forced to resign because of his father's alleged ties to Serbia. While not a direct attack on McCarthy, the piece does place scrutiny upon the US government and its methods. It also poses the question of how well a citizen's rights are protected when certain expressions are deemed unpopular or sensitive. Can a person become a security threat solely because of what they read? Does the government protect our civil liberties only when it serves as a convenience? From this point the film explores the inner workings of the Red Scare and goes to show how vulnerable the media was during that period. Strathairn excels in portraying Murrow as the stern, articulate, and no-nonsense journalist that he was at the time. It also delves into the internal structure of America's bureaucracy and shows how easily the media can be manipulated.<br/><br/>Aside from the arguments put forth in the film, its structure was put together very well. Also of note was the great supporting cast and Clooney's directing talents. One of the best philosophical movies that I've seen in a while. 9/10"
"David_Frames","8","1","2","9 March 2006"," Black and White and Red all over
","A brief but engrossing bit of Political-Clooney and his most biting work since Batman and Robin (It was a satire of Hollywood Blockbusterswasn't it?). Needless to say, so here I am doing just that, that it's a period piece about the here and now with Whistler from Sneakers recovering his sight to star as Edward R.Murrow, CBS News Anchor and champion of liberal, anti-neocon sentimentvis a vis 'freedom of speech' as its known nowadays. Sentator McCarthy doubles as the Bush Administration to give us a timely reminder of what fear can do to would-be democracies and the movie is spot-on in laying out its stall with efficient, direct exactitude. This is Steak Pie and Potatoes film-making  lean, no-frills, no bulls*it stuff  satisfying and substantial. It makes it point very convincingly, not least because it doesn't editorialise too much itself so to speak  a neat little mirror to to the choice of Murrow and co. The use of archive material is well considered and plentiful meaning that often whole sequences are shown in full as if to say 'no dramatisation required', while the CBS scenes are restrained and well-judged ultimately the facts, Clooney suggests, speak for themselves and indeed they do  lucidly. The, dare we say, artistic decision to shoot in Black and White is a solid one as it marries the drama with the archive in a fairly seamless fashion and heightens the sense of period. The final lines about Television's role as a means for education rather than crude entertainment is as relevant as ever and although Tocqueville contended that we have absolutely nothing to learn from History whatsoever, I think Clooney safely kicks that one to ground...but would the Frenchman have done Schumacer's movie? Very good then and the best movie about communism since Hesterkefilis' ""Chairmam Mao Mao and the Teen Kitten Chorus"" (1985)  a must see by the way."
"brenden-saldanha","9","1","2","6 March 2006"," Simple and straightforward
","I started watching Good Night and Good Luck with no background to the episode between Ed Murrow and Senator McArthy which is why i think i was absolutely blown by the simplicity and straightforward manner in which which the story has been told yet keeping it gripping from the word go. Even a moment of silence in the movie speaks out loud. Attention must be paid to every dialog that Ed Murrow (brilliantly portrayed by David Straithairn) delivers with extreme intensity. The idea to use tapes of Senator McArthy's live tapes rather than use a actor to play him is a stoke of masterpiece and George Clooney must be given a salute for telling the story without adding any unwarranted scenes. Further, shooting the entire movie in black and white adds to the 'feel' of the movie which puts you right into the news room itself.<br/><br/>The supporting cast comprising of George Clooney himself in a restrained role, Robert Downey Jr, Frank Langella and others play their parts to perfection. But its David all the way who grips you while he speaks with the lack of emotion in his voice as he carried on the battle through the medium of his show.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck, is master of a movie because it tells a simple story in a simple manner, yet it leaves a powerful impact on the viewer so that he thinks more and more about each dialog long after he walks out of the theatre.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next of George Clooney...

"David Mills","9","1","2","2 March 2006"," Todays news from the fifties
","At last the Dutch had the opportunity to see this film. I waited 3 months after its opening premiere in the USA. My expectations were high and they were met to the full. The atmosphere in the old Amsterdam Tuschinsky theater was one of complete silence both during the film and after it closed. Everybody watched this film if it was their last. The last time I experienced that was with Fincher's Seven. A lot has been said already here about this marble so I will focus on David Strathairn's (in my opinion a highly underrated actor) performance, the impact the film should have on todays life and the Oscars. David Strathairn's performance is outstanding. He is impressive without his lines, let alone with his lines. His eyes tell you how his character Murrow was. Meticulous in finding the truth and striving for the execution of democratic ideals whilst applying the journalist rules of fair play. Murrow's formal speech, which begins and ends the film's story, is itself a prophetic and sobering commentary and indictment of the possibilities of television and foreshadows the future with amazing foresight. David Strathairn's performance should be awarded with an Oscar. He suffers heavy competition but he deserves it. <br/><br/>Now if he is at the top-list of the Academy than I think another issue comes into play. A political issue. To me and lot's of others (read the US newspapers at the time of the premiere) there is not only the actual issue of todays TV constantly blurring your mind, but also the strong resemblance between the tactics of the administration then and the current Bush administration now. I truly hope that the ""liberals"" in Hollywood can stand the pressure (we've seen some opposite in the past). <br/><br/>For the journalists on TV, radio and the written press (anywhere) honor Murrow and shake things up. For the listeners and readers, it's not in the stars, its in ourselves. Cassius was right after all."
"robert-1010","10","1","2","26 February 2006"," The battle for the soul of America is still on.
","If the awesome message in Harold Pinter's acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize for Literature needed a worthy friend it couldn't have done much better than Good Night,and Good Luck. Senator Mc Carthy's logic and rhetoric perfectly mirrors the injustices ever more evident in todays America. Make no mistake the corporate advertising pressure and current mantle of media interests ""dumbing-down"" a seemingly indifferent voting society is even more evident today than it was back then. If you don't believe this think about the principles of not detaining humans without trial, spoken during the film by a contemporary 1950's true American and contrast this with the detention and psychological torture of humans in camps ultimately controlled in name of the American people right now, today. The message can't be any clearer, if as a society we allow this to happen to one of us it will one day happen to us all. We can't allow these principles to slip. Think about issues involving media control and the important bearing this has on democracy working as best it can, this film is a statement by its makers that they believe those that watch it will understand this message and demand higher standards from those they have elected to govern them. The real elegance of the message lies in Clooney and Heslov as makers of this film echoing the deeds and integrity of Murrow and Friendly. Simply substitute the likes of Fox News and Cheney, powerful enemies, for Hearst and Mc Carthy in the film itself. The Communist Witchunt like the War on Terror serves to excuse the injustices perpetrated in the name of ""security"". If none of this bothers you in the slightest just go and see the film for the sheer brilliance of the acting, screenplay ,direction and critically for it all to work visually -the art direction. Particularly impressive are Strathairn, Wise and Langella. Downey, Clooney, Clarkson and Daniels are great but their characters demanded less. Eisenhower was just great too!. Orwell and Pinter will sleep easier in their beds tonight lulled by the great use of music in the film and the historical reminder that ultimately McCarthy was beaten even if similar forces that backed him are still running loose in America today."
"michael-dixon2","8","1","2","26 February 2006"," Very good film but not that brilliant.
","I enjoyed this film, greatly appreciated that it was shot in black and white, thought the acting throughout the cast was excellent and would give full marks to the close-up photography. It was atmospheric and as a past student of politics, the film based itself on a subject, which like many others, I was familiar. That certainly helped and I would suggest some background knowledge, at the very least, is essential for this film to be understood, let alone appreciated. But in truth, away from the hype, it was not an exceptional piece of work; it was just extremely good.<br/><br/>A surprise was the low key way in which it was all played. This was, of course deliberate, but I felt at the end of the film I knew not one thing more about the character of Ed. Murrow than I did at the beginning. In addition, while I appreciate that news journalists must have been a cynical breed in that atmosphere, the reaction in the newsroom to the announcement that Senator McCarthy was himself to be the subject of investigation by a Senate Committee, was very muted; disappointingly so.<br/><br/>The Director may have been wishing to avoid the pitfalls of All The Presidents Men, with two Washington Post journalists patently played by two film stars (Redford and Hoffman). Goodnight,and Good Luck succeeded in avoiding that but managed to leave me somewhat frustrated. The film length, too, was very short and I think that a little more information as to what lay ahead in the lives of Murrow and McCarthy would have been useful. My partner in the cinema, when the film ended said, ""is that it?"" This is one of the few films where I never felt I got inside the mind of one single character, though in fairness the basis of the story, McCarthy, was played for real on the newsreels from the 1950's, so that would have been tricky. What I did enjoy very much was the studio scenes when the programme was on the air. These were most realistic, both politically gripping and very intense. Full marks to all concerned.<br/><br/>Whatever criticisms I may make, it was in the search of perfection, for a film that is centred around free speech, political tolerance of a contrary point of view and, of course, media reporting, deserves much credit for even trying. For that alone and of course much more besides, George Clooney and his team deserve our thanks and appreciation."

The film engaged my mind better than any film this year, and well, just also plainly made me feel so cool. David Strathairn's performance is exceptional, an awesome hybrid of intelligence, power, and style. The performance finds firm ground in the backdrop of an awesome jazz score, black and white cinematography, and a pervasive presence of cigarette smoke that brings you in the room.<br/><br/>The screenplay is beautiful, intelligent and even poetic. <br/><br/>If I were a member of the Academy, the film would easily get my vote. I'm sure the reason it wont win is because most will perceive it as of having a lack of emotion, surely the leading ingredient in an Oscar winning picture. But I argue the film is filled with emotion, not the traditional kind that laments the pain of unrequited love, but a raw emotion that finds shape in a rally cry for a better America in the words of Edward Murrow."

Good Night and Good Luck is quite the opposite...a movie that I wish had been LONGER. I could easily have sat through 20 more minutes of this movie, i) because I was loving it so much and ii) as I am 45, and not wishing to be patronising, I think that younger members of the audience could have done with a little more time to understand the underlying story more. My wife, for instance (41) didn't realise it was Eisenhower was he when shown. This is a first class movie of the genre that BBC can make at its best, and shows the link, very clearly, how concerns about freedom and the role of a free press (and a press that has the guts to have a position - which the BBC does not seem to, these days) is as true now as it was in the 1950's - clearly an issue Mr Clooney, whose stock has risen considerably with me after this movie, was intending to focus upon, even if obliquely.

","The last Best Picture nominee for me to view for the year, and while it does not disappoint, it is not on par with some of the other films nominated.<br/><br/>George Clooney has officially become more than a pretty face. The entire construct of the movie is excellent, and I'm glad that Clooney has reaped some of the benefits that have come from it. The cinematography is utterly fantastic, and the entire storyline is fascinating (from a future journalist's point-of-view). David Strathairn is perfect as Murrow, and the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on, even if they get very little screen-time to chew (as is the case with poor Robert Downey Jr.).<br/><br/>The entire dramatized fight between Murrow and McCarthy, and everything leading up to it, is done very well, and the excellent use of black and white photography just makes it all the more better. I had never liked black and white films before, but as I keep seeing movies like this, I wish it was used more often. It looks just gorgeous for the time period, and adds to the authenticity. The use of the actual footage from the trials is also, a really good touch.<br/><br/>Although there is a bit too much smoking going out throughout the entire film (maybe one or two people don't light up at one point or another), it only adds to the beautiful imagery and photography of the picture. Plus, Clooney makes up for it with the humorous advertisements seen within the film.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with the movie, its that the entire thing seems a bit dry. Everything is authentic, but the fact that a modern audience would not be as captivated as a 1950s audience would leaves a lot to be said for the film. The first hour moves along fairly briskly, but then the last 30 minutes just drags on. It's nowhere near as boring as the likes of Capote, but there is still a lot to be said for the fact that it tumbles a bit just as its peaking.<br/><br/>A great movie, but an acquired taste is needed in order to find any enjoyment from it. George Clooney may get passed this year for everything he did with this film (maybe not for Syriana), but if he keeps up making films like this, Oscar will surely come knocking soon enough.<br/><br/>8/10."
"teh_mode","8","1","2","20 February 2006"," Great night and good luck
","How apt that after his wonderful debut ""Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind"" proved an unjustly non-performer at the box office, that George Clooney comes up trumps with this fantastic monochrome, political thriller. It's a terrific piece of work, and makes me yearn for even more of Gorgeous George's direction.<br/><br/>Edward R. Murrow is credited with triggering the downfall of the vehemently anti-communist former US senator Joseph McCarthy. This being a period piece it has awoken many historians to debate this fact. Regardless of the solid truth, he certainly got under McCarthy's skin, forcing him to go on television and justify his actions. It's debatable whether Murrow was the archetype behind opposing senator McCarthy's communist witch-hunts, but to be perfectly honest this movie was working so well it really wasn't on my mind. McCarthyism is obviously a big part of ""Good Night, And Good Luck"", in the same way that race is a big part of Paul Haggis' ""Crash"". More importantly though, the central theme for me is to do with journalism, something Clooney learnt from his newsreader father. It has obviously rubbed off on him - the sets and atmosphere in ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" really do encapsulate the grubby claustrophobia and retro 50s nostalgia of old newsrooms and bulletins. Murrow's producer Fred Friendly had terrible difficulty with both the government and his own boss William Paley.<br/><br/>Back in a time when news was thought to be thoroughly unbiased and factual, the film is bookended by Murrow delivering a rather opprobrious speech at a banquet about how television broadcasting is going to hell on account of censorship and bias. Murrow, Friendly et al certainly opposed McCarthy's methods, but defended their stance by delivering what they believed were facts, rather than ""rumour, hearsay and innuendo"". It's a pertinent thought, and one that seems lost in today's increasingly biased media. Or as Murrow so integrally put it ""power's cheerleader"". He said this in 1958. Ironic perhaps, that it is so relevant to the current administration.<br/><br/>The cast are all great. Robert Downey Jr. reins it in for his performance as Joe Wersheba, a man secretly married to another CBS employee, disallowed at the time. His relationship with Shirley (Patricia Clarkson) provides the film with a illustrative sub-plot of how McCarthyism works. George Clooney as Fred Friendly is the yin to Ed Murrow's yang. He kicks where Murrow stares and bites when Murrow chews. The undeniable star however is David Strathairn. He is marvellously subtle, saying more with glances and cigarettes than he does with words. He 'll probably get ousted in the Oscars race by the flashier performances, but I'd love to see him coveted for his work. I haven't seen him in much. He said he'd been waiting 25 years for this call. I look forward to seeing him in the future.<br/><br/>The decision to use newsreel footage of McCarthy instead of an actor was, on paper, a potential recipe for disaster. Not only does it work, it provides the film with some of it's most powerful scenes. People can see this man for what he was, rather than how someone would have him.It also gives the movie an almost documentary feel. One scene in particular is comprised only of showing the trial of Annie Lee Moss. Scenes involving the news team debating were reminiscent of Robert Altman films, where actors would improvise and overlap one another. Technically the film is magnificent. The monochrome colouring gives the film an aura of acute dignity. A smart decision by Clooney, he's taken some obvious risks with ""Good Night, And Good Luck"" and in my opinion have paid off wonderfully. It does, on occasion, look like everyone's smoking too much. But they did anyway. As far as the Oscars go, I'm now tied with this and Brokeback Mountain, which is obviously the weightier of the two films. But this is a real gem. Even if you know nothing about politics or journalism. George? Job's a good'n."

","In this exceptional presentation of historical drama, George Clooney proves to us all that he is not only a phenomenal actor, but a skillful director as well. This artistry of film, with distinguished acting and powerful characters, does an excellent job of telling the story of Edward R. Murrow, his courage for addressing controversial topics in the evening news, and his vision of Television that is not only entertaining, but educational. For a person with a deep appreciation of history, and a deep admiration for the strong-willed, courageous, and innovative, this movie speaks straight to the soul. It reminds one why Americans have the freedom to think and say what they wish without living under the fear of oppression for their controversial views."
"Robert_duder","9","1","2","15 February 2006"," Brilliant, Clooney finally proves his stardom
","For the first time since Roseanne, George Clooney impressed me. I have thought since day one that his Hollywood stardom was rather unexplained and undeserving since I have never seen him do anything of any great value. Finally he blows me away by taking the helm as writer, director and actor in Good Night and Good Luck. Of all the Academy Award nominees I have seen this year (I have seen about ten) this is the first one that is truly deserving of Best Picture. Although I wouldn't go so far to say that it's the best movie of the year, it's definitely worthy of being hailed.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck literally transports you back to the time (1950's) of Edward R. Murrow, a CBS investigative reporter who takes on Senator Joe McCarthy on his stance of communism amongst the American People. It's the most time accurate film I have ever seen. You feel like you are right there in the newsroom with them all...watching the story unfold for the first time. The true brilliance in directing for Good Night and Good Luck is that it's almost literally a documentary but a riveting one with a storyline that draws you in. David Strathairn plays Ed Murrow. His quiet demeanor and his low brow commentary, his sheer seriousness brings the power and voice of Murrow to life. It's a very low key performance and at first you might think not worthy of any notable acclaim but upon reflection it's exactly what Murrow was. George Clooney plays producer and Murrow's close confidante Fred Friendly in his first (my opinion) acceptable role. He is low key as well, doesn't try to take the spotlight, does his lines quite well and lets the story unfold. He does a good job supporting Strathairn. Another notable appearance is Ray Wise as CBS Anchorman Don Hollenbeck who tries to support Murrow only to be targeted by McCarthy himself eventually leading to Hollenbeck's suicide. His quiet intensity is one of the best performances in the film as we watch the true repercussions of McCarthy's attacks on a real person. Frank Langella is also very good in his brief role as CBS Head man William Paley. Robert Downey Jr., and Patricia Clarkson round out the cast and they do a good job supporting the main story which is what they are there for. The brilliant part of the casting is the fact that infamous situations and news reports are NOT recreated or dramatized but the real footage is used and McCarthy is never dramatized, it's all very real footage which absolutely adds to the intensity and realism of the film.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck takes you and places you right into the newsroom while they take on McCarthy. It just feels so real and even though the story never really leaves the setting of the newsroom, it's still powerful and interesting and provocative. Clooney really goes above and beyond with this film and the nominations prove it and I must say that it's deserving. History fans, fans of film will truly appreciate Good Night and Good Luck. 9/10"
"GMJames","9","1","2","15 February 2006"," A taut, well-crafted look at television in the 1950's.
","It is fair to say that I might be at a bit of an advantage to some viewers who've watched ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" because I worked in the broadcast medium for nearly two decades. I've read a lot about Edward R. Murrow, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, and the history of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). I wonder if the reactions for George Clooney's near-masterpiece ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" depends on the viewer's interest and knowledge about television and politics in the 1950's. <br/><br/>The numerous choices made by Clooney and co-screenwriter Grant Heslov, to focus primarily on Murrow (brilliantly played by veteran character actor David Strathairn) and his significance in the early days of television and broadcast journalism, made for a very compelling tale. It was very interesting to actually listen to Murrow's words on the big screen. The speech that bookmarks the movie is an actual transcript. The concerns by Murrow is similar to former FCC commissioner Newton Minnow's about television being a ""vast wasteland."" <br/><br/>The decision to film the movie in black and white captured an almost film noir quality. It also made a lot of sense considering that many TV shows were shown in homes with black and white television. <br/><br/>What could have easily been a fatal mistake and used as a crutch to tell the story, it was a great idea to use real footage of Sen. McCarthy, which I believe speaks for itself. Using an actor would have been a mistake.<br/><br/>Within this great acting ensemble, I was impressed with Frank Langella's role as CBS chairman William S. Paley. Again, it easily could have been played as the stereotypically cold and heartless executive. But Langella interprets Paley as an ambitious but fair individual who wants to do the right thing and allows Murrow and his co-workers to report the news without interference. In this day and age of all news channels and talking heads shows, can anyone do that now? <br/><br/>While watching the movie in the theater, a moviegoer behind me said, ""My God! They smoked a lot in the 50's."" It certainly was the socially correct thing to do especially since many tobacco companies used to advertise on television. Using a tobacco ad as a transition, in addition to Dianne Reeves' musical interludes, was sheer genius.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with the film was the underwritten plot device with the married employees. Luckily for Clooney and Heslov, the performances by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson made their story more interesting that it ever was.<br/><br/>I believe ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" should be included with ""Network"" and ""Broadcast News"" as one of the best films about television."

","Black and White. Bleak. The fifties.<br/><br/>Most people who lived through the 50's thought it was a simpler time. I did not. It was complex, characterized by people seeking conformity and security who would pay almost anything to get both.<br/><br/>The hero was not a person like Gary Cooper in High Noon. The hero was more like the complicated conformist in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit.<br/><br/>The reaction to that conformity was the 60's and anyone who lived through those times would certainly say they were about anything other than fitting into a mold.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we should not be confining ourselves to McCarthy. He was a drunken egotist who knew a good thing when he found it. What we should be looking at are those people who thought McCarthy was not only right, but the political guardian and watch dog of civilization as we knew it then.<br/><br/>Who were these people? Why were they so willing to give up their civil rights? And who was Edward R. Murrow and what did he do to remind them that they were giving something up? Those are the questions this film asks and tries to answer. People who go to thinking or spiritual movies quite frequently forget that a movie is only 2 hours long. There is not the time to develop ideas in the same way that an action film can move along. There is only time to suggest probe and provoke into doing more research.<br/><br/>This film is not boring. It tries to tell us what Morrow faced and each character is a little flawed and a great deal more decent.<br/><br/>I cannot end without talking about something personal. I grew up in Canada at the height of McCarthy's power. My city at the time was 13000, still small enough that everyone knew everyone, especially since my father was a doctor who was killed in the second world war. My mother was newly widowed and my brother had just finished his Phd and was applying for work at Bell Tel. He required clearance. I do not remember exactly who came to our door, but I do remember my mother's response.<br/><br/>She was terrified. She did not believe for a moment the reassurance that it was a routine questioning for his clearance. She was too new to the country not to believe that if she gave the wrong answer my brother would be doomed or that we would. And we lived in Canada.<br/><br/>There was that in the air. And it was palpable and I can remember the emotion. That's what happens when people give up their civil rights.<br/><br/>It is why we need another Edward R. Morrow.<br/><br/>And it is why this film is so good: it begs us to listen once he surfaces."
"dfranzen70","8","1","2","7 February 2006"," Flawless
","Good Night, and Good Luck is a singularly gripping, powerful movie about the epic battle between a blustery, Red-obsessed senator and a resolved veteran newsman. Photographed in stark black and white and infused with a real 1950s feel, George Clooney's sharp homage to one of the greatest journalists America's ever known is utterly captivating and discomfiting.<br/><br/>Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was one of the biggest stars in CBS News as the host of ""Person to Person"" and ""See It Now."" When he gets wind of a soldier who's been fired from the Air Force for a tenuous Communist connection, Murrow springs into action, choosing to use Senator Joseph P. McCarthy's own words and actions against him, rather than attacking the man.<br/><br/>What Murrow did was nothing short of astonishing. This was the mid-1950s. The press genuflected to royalty (i.e., politicos) much more than exercised genuine critical analysis of it. What's more, McCarthy's fellow senators did little to prevent the man from running roughshod over the rights of those suspecting of being ""card-carrying Communists."" With no press to question him and no colleagues to rein him in, McCarthy had carte blanche to root out the evil-doin' Reds from all facets of American life.<br/><br/>The stand that Murrow took - putting the reputations of himself, producer Fred Friendly (Clooney), and the CBS network on the line - took an incalculable amount of courage. One misstep by Murrow and his team, and his career would be over. (As it turned out, his undoing of McCarthy was also his own undoing, but that was less his fault than the fault of CBS chief William Paley.) More than fifty years have passed since Murrow won by decision over McCarthy (the senator was censured by his colleagues, which allowed him to remain in the Senate but severely diminished his influence), but the events that take place in this film resonate deeply today. Indeed, it is not unimaginable to see a politician like MCCarthy run amok in a avaricious grab for power and prestige. The passage of time, however, allows us to reflect perhaps a bit more objectively, to examine the fight for the civil rights of every man, woman, and child in the United States. How far have we come in the ensuing half-century? Who are the Murrows of today? Strathairn is nothing short of remarkable. He's not an especially large man, but he has such gravitas in this film that he seems to fill the screen even when he's merely sitting in the background. He is a man of many faces and expressions, and every one of them seems to ring perfectly true. Strathairn has knocked around Hollywood for more than a quarter century, earning scores of accolades from his peers and the media, but he's never been a leading man in a such a widely praised film. Indeed, he's the kind of actor who disappears into roles, who is a superb character actor, adding color and depth to every role he touches. He's been nominated for an Academy award at this writing, and he stands a good chance at bringing home the statuette. It's long overdue.<br/><br/>Strathairn is ably supported by a well-picked cast, including Robert Downey Jr. in his fortieth comeback, Frank Langella as Paley, and Clooney as producer Friendly. Even more beneficial, though, is the look and feel of the movie, and the near-flawless direction by Clooney. Clooney wisely stuck to the main tet-a-tet between Murrow and McCarthy, rather than building up Murrow as a character first; indeed, there's little else in the movie besides the row with McCarthy. For one thing, we learn virtually nothing about the personal lives of Friendly and Murrow. And that omission works very well within the structure of this film.<br/><br/>Good Night, and Good Luck is a mesmerizing glimpse at how the power of the press can be used to uphold the rights of man, and a chilling snapshot at what can happen if ego and authority go unchecked."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","2","4 February 2006"," Reminder of the Times
","In ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", Edward R. Murrow says: <br/><br/>""We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes which were for the moment unpopular. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of the Republic to abdicate his responsibility."" <br/><br/>In Director George Clooney's film set in 1958 following the end of the Joseph McCarthy hearings, Murrow's words still hold power for us as a reminder of our responsibility and due diligence as champions of freedom. The virtue of freedom is sacred in the world conflict balancing global terrorism and innate patriotism. Sometimes lines are crossed. Clooney's ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" with the powerful David Strathairn as Murrow is the amazing story of the fight for freedom and conscience when this line is crossed. The screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov follows CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's confrontation with Senator Joseph McCarthy which eventually led to McCarthy's censure. McCarthy 1950's reign of terror leveraging guilt by association (to Communists) is part of American history, and a cautionary tale to future generations.<br/><br/>During a news story meeting in 1953, Murrow (Strathairn) tells news director Fred Friendly (George Clooney) that in Detroit, Lt. Radulovich was dismissed from the Army because of a relations' tie to a Communist group, done without any apparent due process. Friendly reminds Murrow that if they run with the story they would bring upon themselves huge political consequences, and financial burden upon CBS. This does not escape Network President William Paley (Frank Langella). Murrow and Friendly are aware that their search to uncover the truth makes them McCarthy targets. Murrow broadcasts the story. Langella embodies a quiet strength and gravity as Paley, who defends freedom of speech and reminds Murrow and Friendly that their broadcasts will cost CBS valuable sponsor dollars. He also points out to Murrow that even he consciously tempers his own righteousness. Strathairn's Murrow must choose whether he is going to be a martyr for the cause or be the cause itself. Strathairn is powerful and compelling as Murrow becomes the later. Strathairn brings such an integrity and compassion in a delicately restrained performance. Here less is powerful. When one of his team bows out of the story because his ex attended ""communists"" meetings, Murrow says: ""If none of us ever read a book that was 'dangerous,' nor had a friend who was 'different,' or never joined an organization that advocated 'change,' we would all be just the kind of people Joe McCarthy wants."" Clooney is awesome as Friendly. He brings a conviction and strength of character to Friendly that never overshadows Strathairn's Murrow. His is a perfectly nuanced partnership.<br/><br/>As director, George Clooney is an amazing and gifted storyteller. His style is clean, clear, and passionate. If there is one thing that is perhaps missing that would be any insight into Murrow the man, his personal life, aside from news anchor. Clooney lends a personal touch with the story of Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson). Both do an amazing job, though following Murrow home from the newsroom would have been compelling. Clooney along with his co-writer Heslov brilliantly employ a retrospective story structure, so our eye is not so much on the outcome rather on the journey. Clooney elicits great performances from his talented cast that includes Langella, Jeff Daniels, Downey, Clarkson, along with Strathairn. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is one of the year's best that reminds us of our responsibility to defend freedom in the most trying of timeswhich may be today."

","Some people have said that this films unfairly portrays McCarthy, just as they said so of the reporter this film is about. However, you really can't say that. Not only is it unbiased (in as much as the reporter was unbiased) it also shows the response of McCarthy. This film is about what went wrong with the government then, and what McCarthy did to gain power. But, as I have said, it does not make up crucial facts, and it does not leave out things that did not fit the message. In fact, if you dislike how McCarthy is portrayed then maybe there's something wrong with HIM.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a message here. George Clooney, I believe, is trying to let us in on the fact that he believes George Bush is using the same strategy to stay ahead of the others in the government. I do not wish to speak upon my views, so I will merely say that you should keep that in mind and think about it.<br/><br/>Finally, even if you ignore the politics, it is an interesting look into what has changed in media.

Murrow is played by David Staithairn (""L.A. Confidential"") in what has become his most recognized performance. Filmed entirely in black and white to give the film a feel of authenticity, the movie exhibits how scare tactics and the like were used on American society in such frivolous ways that even reporters ran in fear of McCarthy and his committee hearings. But not Murrowthe man set a standard in integrity that has become bedrock in the journalism industry today to report the truth, which was and is always in the public's best interests. His famous lines, ""We will not walk in fear, one of another,"" and ""We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home,"" show that he was a reporter out simply to do what was right. It was not about ratings. It was not about vanity. It was not black and white; it was about right and wrong.

I also liked it that he allowed the listener to exercise their ability to understand and comprehend, instead of spelling everything out in the current ""see spot run"" fashion. Great writing in this movie. I also thought that the characterizations were excellent. I remember listening to and watching Mr. Murrow, and this was almost like a flashback.

"Pavel-8","8","1","2","3 February 2006"," Good Luck to this movie at the Oscars.
","In the 1950s, CBS newscaster Edward R. Murrow did what virtually no one else dared. At the height of the Cold War, he objected to Senator Joseph McCarthy's raging campaign against Communism. That's about all many people (such as myself) know about the events, and this movie is here to fill in the holes. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" tells the true story of the Murrow-McCarthy confrontation, and the equally interesting behind-the-scenes dilemmas faced by Murrow and fellow news staff.<br/><br/>The passing of time has dulled the accomplishments of Murrow, in large part due to the proliferation of news channels, investigative reporting, and rampant opinions. What Murrow did then could not happen in that way today. Therefore in order to craft a decent film, director George Clooney was faced with the essential task of re-creating the 1950s. In that regard, the film borders on flawless.<br/><br/>With zero exterior shots, the clean black-and-white photography captures the claustrophobic mood of the era better than color pictures would have, similar to the 2000's Clooney-produced, made-for-television Fail Safe. Reactionary glances surrounded by ubiquitous swirling cigarette smoke establish a bygone mindset and time, when cramped newsrooms were the norm, and newscasters who challenged politicians were not. Through these tight quarters the camera chases the actors like their reporters chased stories, infusing energy into what could have easily been a static film.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" won't floor you with its dramatic power, as something like ""Million Dollar Baby"" did. To use a baseball analogy, this isn't the Mickey Mantle of films, leaving a wake of awe behind. This is the Paul Molitor of movies, always solid but rarely spectacular. When the credits roll, one looks back to realize how well done the previous ninety minutes were. There are simply very few missteps.<br/><br/>Clooney also succeeds where ""Syriana"" failed, in making an accessible social point that anybody can recognize. While telling its story, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" naturally points out how the media landscape has changed in half a century, making one at least reconsider the media's role in the politics of the government and life. Not a life-altering aim, but a practical one achieved nonetheless.<br/><br/>Like its protagonist, firmly and sharply played in Oscar-worthy fashion by relative unknown David Strathairn, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" wastes little time or effort, succinctly making its point and quickly getting out. It will be somewhat under-appreciated (and likely won't challenge for the top Academy Awards) due to a lack of overwhelming personal themes and fully developed characters. But in dealing with decisions and consequences of truth, justice, and the American way (sorry), this film establishes a standard of how to effectively and gently make a point while telling an interesting story.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Short, sweet, and to the point. Well done. 8 of 10."

","It was with great joy that I finally got to see GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK today. This is film-making and tension at its best. Although there's no bloodshed or external battles, the strain of what was going on during the McCarthy hearings in the 50's is palpable in George Clooney's excellent script.<br/><br/>Not having been born until years later, I only remember my parents commenting on how disgraceful the nation felt for letting a bully push around individuals and companies without due process here in the U.S. (where we pride ourselves on a system of justice!) The film is taut with dangerous choices that could have very well ended the careers of thousands of people at CBS. Edward R. Murrow (played beautifully by David Strathairn) pulls off the performance of a lifetime by using every mannerism ever noted in Murrow's early television career. The close-up facial shots were excellent and added tension to the film without any musical score (music is only used as a kind of introduction to different segments of the story but sung in low jazz tones by legendary singer Dianne Reeves). The use of black and white film adds an extra sense of the time period and allowed George Clooney and company to meld together stock footage of McCarthy and other Senators in a very seamless fashion.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy to point out that fear was the prime method that allowed McCarthy to continue his ridiculous claims of communist infiltration into the United States (people feared the communists because of the nuclear threat and because they felt that the communists would overrun our beloved country ....boy, does this sound familiar. Are we still in the 1950s? Hmm. Is George Bush and company allowed to get away with lots of things because of the fear of bombings, religious fundamentalists, and those who disagree with America?) The ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality is easily focused on in the film by allowing Senator McCarthy to play and hang himself. If you were against McCarthy, you were a communist or, at the very least, a communist sympathizer (watching him attack Murrow as a communist was ridiculous).<br/><br/>It's funny to read the mind-numbing reviews of individuals here at Amazon.com who think that there WERE communists in high places within our government. And they still believe it! Even after the fall of communism in the USSR. Grow up gang. It's the 21st century. The only thing we need fear is not questioning our leaders, and this movie is a nice reawakening to that thought."

Great performances, coupled with a taut, almost austere script, makes this film engaging and powerful. Having worked in a newsroom, the writers artfully re-created the passion and mechanics of putting together a newscast, along with the tension of how to make news viewable and correct at the same time. More to the point, the inital story of the Air Force serviceman being summarily expelled from the military for his supposed political beliefs set the tone for the entire movie probably better than any narrative the writers could have invented. I may not accept the political slant which the movie is trying to deliver necessarily, but that still doesn't disqualify it, in my view, from being regarded as an excellent endeavor."

","Expertly directed, superbly crafted and well acted, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is as much an allegory about what's going on today regarding civil liberties as it is about journalist Edward R. Murrow's fight against Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunt in the 1950s.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Grant Heslov have crafted an engrossing story that - in this day and age - dares us to recognize the importance of questioning our leaders; that doing that is not only ethical, moral and responsible, but also patriotic.<br/><br/>The film masterfully transports us to a time and place when HUAC frightened Americans and politicians and the courts were too fearful to take on McCarthyism. (Funny, isn't it, that a simple query from Joseph Welch - ""Have you no sense of decency?"" - finally exposed McCarthy for who he was.) Journalists and producers of the caliber of Murrow and Fred Friendly are rare these days, if not extinct. Today, we have an administration (aided by a bullying ""news"" channel) that questions the patriotism of anyone who criticizes its decisions or policies and vulgarly suggests its critics give succor to the enemy. After all, just see what our leaders named the anti-terrorism law after 9/11. Who would dare vote against something called the Patriot Act? We have leaders who consider the Geneva Conventions antiquated, have no qualms about torturing prisoners or shredding the Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>And, instead of Murrow-like dogged journalists, we are inundated with sycophantic, gutless reporters cowed by our leaders, simply buying into any malarkey fed to them by elected officials and bureaucrats. I'm sorry, but the New York Times' and Washington Post's apologies that they did a lousy job in the lead up to the Iraq War doesn't absolve them of their shame. Imagine what the last two years might have been like had our journalists done their job and questioned claims of WMD, being welcomed as liberators and other crucial issues.<br/><br/>Clooney's film is studded with brilliant performances, starting with David Strathairn as Murrow. Just as Chris Cooper was finally recognized by Oscar - for ""Adaptation"" (2002) - perhaps the always wonderful Strathairn also will be honored soon.<br/><br/>Also, look for a wonderful turn by Ray Wise as Don Hollenbeck. With all the accolades going to Clooney and Strathairn, it's easy to forget Wise's beautiful, understated performance.<br/><br/>Filming this in black and white was a bold move; color would have spoiled it. Also, it was a very wise decision to use real footage of McCarthy, as opposed to having someone play him. What Clooney and Heslov do effectively is make us realize through a 1950s event what exactly is happening today. It's akin to Andrzej Wajda using the 1793 drama, ""Danton"" (1983) to expose Polish politics in the Soviet era.<br/><br/>It's easy for leaders to simply justify their questionable behavior and policies by hiding behind the excuse that they can do anything because we're at war. They prey on our (rather obscene) obsession with patriotism to further their fear-mongering.<br/><br/>This film shows that occasionally a few strong, principled, brave, patriotic people stand up to say no against all odds. And they're right. If only we had similar examples in our media to point to today."
"sourav_gati","8","1","2","20 December 2005"," Very relevant for the times
","It is a very well-timed movie. Today's America has its own version of fear-mongering (terror alerts) and violation of civil liberties (official spying), and media censorship that may not be so different from the McCarthy era. Hats off to George Clooney for pointing to that without being garishly Michael Moore-ish. The choice of black and white, the stark lighting that pronounced the overall air of tension was very apt. The cigarette smokes was used to great effect. I loved the way the story was told, with every tension buildup melting into vocals. However, I found the story itself somewhat linear, and characters not deeply delved into. I would applaud the movie for its political message and the subtle way the message was conveyed, but not for its literary qualities."
"hikingviking07","8","1","2","27 November 2005"," An intimate, behind-the-scenes closeup of a man and his passion
","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" was well-directed, and well-acted. It was a good re-creation of the 1950s era when smoking was not known to cause cancer. While the movie re-created the glamour of 1950s black and white movies with the dress, the jazz soundtrack, and the closeups of the actors, the movie seemed abrupt. <br/><br/>The movie could have had a greater buildup to Edward R. Murrow's career, say a fifteen minute series of flashbacks to his career as a news reporter in the 1930s, and then taking us to the 1950s, where most, if not the entire movie, was set, between 1953 and 1958. <br/><br/>While we are first given a glimpse into the character of Edward Murrow as being lauded by his peers at a dinner for the press on a date set in 1958, the story then goes directly into the year 1953 with an intricate look behind the scenes of CBS news during 1953. I wished that there could have been a bit more background on Murrow's career like in a flashback. Instead, the viewer is taken into a time period. The re-creation may work for people who do recall living in the 1950s, and watching Edward R. Murrow on TV. However, I went into this movie ""cold"", not knowing who Edward Murrow was, other than that he was a broadcast journalist.<br/><br/>The ending was also abrupt, as it did not follow up with the end of Edward Murrow's career, and what had happened during the course of his latter days. We do get many glimpses of Murrow chain smoking cigarettes, which is a habit of many characters in the film. <br/><br/>The film is a very good portrait of Edward R. Murrow and what he strove to achieve in the media for a period of five years. It would have been an excellent movie if the beginning and the end of the movie had been expanded to include perhaps a bit of his private life. We were not even given a glimpse of what his private life was about. Maybe he was a workaholic; maybe he lived for his work. But at ninety minutes and change, I get a good perspective of the man, and his challenges to bring the truth out of Sen. Joe McCarthy and others, who labeled people as Communists by the tactic of guilt by association. <br/><br/>The mannerisms are authentic, the acting is top notch, and the camera work is very intimate. This film will definitely win at least one Academy award nomination, and one Golden globe nomination <br/><br/>for 2006. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is excellent. As an entire film, it appears to be chopped off in sections, which is too bad, because the acting by the ensemble cast is dynamite. The black and white camera-work adds a sincere authenticity to the acting. <br/><br/>Jeff Daniels is great as Sig Mickelson, a CBS manager. George Clooney and Robert Downey Jr. are terrific in their roles as reporters. David Straitharn as Murrow is a great example of acting--he should get a nod for best Actor, because his mannerisms and expressions of Murrow look authentic. Patricia Clarkson should get a nod for best supporting actress; she does a good job of playing the pretty messenger, delivering the newspaper reviews to the CBS news crew in a methodic fashion. Frank Langella does an excellent job portraying William Paley, the top executive at CBS watching over to see if Murrow will make CBS look foolish. <br/><br/>Langella should get a nomination for best supporting actor. <br/><br/>I would rate this as a very good movie; I hesitate to call this movie an excellent movie for the reasons I have given above. I think it will do well come Oscar time."

","Good Night, and Good Luck is the story of Edward R. Murrow and his team of journalists speaking up to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy. George Clooney directs and stars in the movie as Fred Friendly. The film delves into the daring topics brought to attention about the Senator's communist ""witch hunt."" Filming the movie in black and white is more than just a nice touch to set the scene in this film, as there is evidence that a lot more was done to capture the essence of that period. From the sets to the cinematography, a very convincing job was done to make it seem as if the movie was actually filmed in the days of Murrow. Another contributor to this back-in-time effect was the fact that actual footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy was used. Stratharin's portrayal of Murrow seems a bit overdone but he still maintains a commanding presence that can still clinch the viewer's attention. The jazzy, musical ""intermissions"" are a nice touch and yet another interesting method used to capture the time period. Overall, Good Night, and Good Luck is a polished, well-written, well-directed period piece that gives viewers the opportunity to remember the impact of the news back then, and think about the impact of the news now."

","This is definitely one of the better docudramas that I have ever seen. For George Clooney to pretty much do a film on a something that occurred prior to his birth and do such a good job with it makes it an even more incredible work. Of course, most of the stuff I knew about Murrow's feud with McCarthy came from brief snippets that I saw on television over the years. This film really brought the story into clearer focus and really showed what a lowlife McCarthy was for stirring up the public's paranoia and the courage it took for Murrow and Fred Friendly to finally expose him for what he was. Where it really does a good job is in the fact that it pretty much follow's the same technique that All the President's Men took and told the story of McCarthy without using an actor to portray him in much the way that President's Men did. That film pretty much told the story of how Woodward and Bernstein exposed Nixon and didn't use an actor to portray him. Clooney is showing that he is more than just a good actor and that he is now truly establishing himself as one of the great directors around."

I can think of a long list of actors who proved to be at best mediocre directors: Clint Estwood, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Jody Foster, etc. Fellini comes as a rare exception of an actor turned a genius director. Yet, I was very impressed by ""Good Night and Good Luck"", and so George Clooney appears to be an exception. Clooney showed a great deal of taste in his reserved, minimalist approach, in creating the sense of tightness in broadcasting room and broadcasting business itself, both physical and psychological. And in addition to artistic qualities, the film, in its unobtrusive way, addresses some of the most important issues we are facing today: demand for civil liberties abroad while undermining them at home, lack of Murrow-like journalists in our age of corporate (I almost wrote corrupt) journalism. I am very impressed, and will give a look to future works of Clooney. Wanna play number game? OK, I'll give a 10 to his effort. And thank you, George."

","George Clooney's 2nd picture in the director's chair is a fantastic document of film and history. His careful and subtle portrayal of a 'Cold War' of sorts between one Edward R. Murrow and Joeseph MCCarthy gives us hints of a rising directorial talent. Clooney presents the facts as-is and does not beat the audience over the head with ideological overture in the fashion of say Michael Moore. While I am what most consider a Liberal, or even Leftist I find it admirable when someone makes a case without taking sides. It is up to the audience to derive their own thoughts on the subject matter not the filmmaker to push an agenda into the minds of the audience. In this I do believe George Clooney (an outspoken liberal) has succeeded. I would also like to commend the filmmakers on stellar black and white photography and clever casting. No one, accept for maybe David Strathairn (in an Academy Award worthy performance) steals scenes. Send George Clooney a case of scotch for this film, he's earned it."
"AMcElvain","10","1","2","9 November 2005"," Brilliant, engaging, dramatic snapshot of Edward R. Murrow in late 50's
","I wasn't aware of the role Edward R. Murrow had played in the evolution of radio and television news and editorial work, and the powerful impact his courageous work had on balancing the nation's sanity in the McCarthy era. Chillingly, I also see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The political and economic forces that compete to drive the programming on the TV broadcasts are still at it, and even more powerful than they were back then. The politics of fear and repression (if you're agin me, you must be a traitor) are still being used today to silence and intimidate those who are not in power. And yet, what a hopeful light is shone: a small group of broadcasters put their careers on the line and stood up in favor of the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process of law. We CAN do this today, and because of the courageous work of Murrow, Friendly and their team in the 50's, we can speak out with little fear of recrimination. I love that we have the right to live passionately in this country. With all our troubles, we still have the freedom to debate and discuss. Thank God for Edward R. Murrow and his team. I would recommend this film as required viewing for all aspiring journalists, broadcasters, law students and political scientists. Gorgeous David Strathairn did an amazing job, as usual. I have admired him for years for his work in films as varied as Dolores Claiborne, The Firm, Memphis Belle and A League of Their Own. He adopted the body language and speaking style of Murrow most convincingly. George Clooney directed this masterpiece, as well as portraying Fred Friendly as an amiable and effective producer. One of the most brilliant aspects of the structure of this picture was the interplay of jazz standards performed by the brilliant Dianne Reeves, who brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Presented in their time period, the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely new meaning to me. Snippets of social commentary sung to the sounds of clinking whiskey glasses, through plumes of ubiquitous cigarette smoke. I do appreciate our ""No Smoking"" workplaces of today, I can tell you that! GREAT job. Everyone must see this film right now."
"planet_mamoo","9","1","2","8 November 2005"," George Clooney hit it just right -- wonderful!
","This movie is absolutely magnificent. The choice of black-and-white was smart, as it ensures the action melds perfectly with the frequently-shown footage of the hearings and interviews from the period. In fact, one scene, showing Roy Cohn tarring a witness after McCarthy has left the room, is so magnificent, with panning between witness and Cohn (and the senator who attacks Cohn). It increased the drama of the scene, while heightening the drama of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The directing is also spare, with no soundtrack -- aside from brief, and lovely musical interludes -- and the reliance on studio sets rather than location shots was also a good choice. Clooney also struck the perfect balance between showing closeups of actor's reactions, without dwelling on them. And indeed those reactions are often not explained -- you just know there's ugliness going on.<br/><br/>The acting was also first-rate. Very understated, with lots of low talking, and characters with doubts -- as any human being would be in their place -- without any of the usual Hollywood cardboard cutouts. Clooney was strong, and nicely understated; in fact there wasn't a lot of scene-stealing, though Patricia Clarkson is, as always, luminous.<br/><br/>No review would be complete without fulsome praise of David Strathairn. He captured Edward R. Murrow magnificently. The magnificent delivery of beautifully-written words, with the quiet, observing -- almost watchful -- behavior off-camera (the guy wasn't the life of the party, it seems) came together fantastically.<br/><br/>If there was a shortcoming, it was the lack of a what-happened-afterward finish. However that's a very minor quibble, and it's hard to complain about it, because the choice to not include that makes the movie very much of a self-contained unit -- like a great TV documentary (and hey, maybe people will want to go do some research).<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie. Well done, Mr. Clooney!"

It take a lot to impress a sixteen year-old in this day of computers and video games, but I have to say he and I were both impressed with the story, the acting, and the visual effects, which were extraordinary and very effective. He and I both agree that at the end of the picture's theatrical run, that it be used in school as part of their history lesson.

","This film was one I had been anxiously awaiting for some time, only to be put out of commission for two weeks by Hurricane Wilma. Well what a treat it was when reality was restored. This has to be the absolute best movie I have ever seen in theaters. As an American history buff, I found this a wonderful subject matter. I also found it a bit sad: American television and news in particular today is nothing but a shadow of what it was then. The decision to shoot in black and white made it all seem so realistic, for the times. The lighting was well done and dramatic: it is great to see that the art of lighting for black and white has not been lost to the ages. Is it leftist? if you ask me, I could prove to you it is not. It is against the position of a man whose extreme right wing positions, far worse than all but a few since, destroyed lives. Was the position of the journalists it is about leftist? maybe, but not to the point of communism. About halfway through, three people left. If they could get upset to this degree by a film about actual events, about journalists who helped stop a terrible time in American history, they should have at least found out a bit about it first...they could have saved their money. I loved how the actual footage was so seamlessly integrated into the film. This film was simply fabulous. I have seen few films that can give it any competition, and never any on the silver screen myself. The most recent movie I've seen that I feel may beat it in my book is Gandhi. I was riveted to the screen, captivated by the movie. During the broadcasts my heart beat quickly and I felt jittery, almost as if I were the one on camera. It is good to have a film so completely envelop you without action, without explosions, even without color. This has not happened to me before in a movie theater. Sometimes I will usually drift off into random thought, others i'll talk quietly to a friend, or I might get upset at events I find silly. My eyes couldn't have left the screen for more than a minute total, and that was only to see if i'd dropped any candy. The biggest surprise to me other than the sheer power and excellence was the level of subtle humor and natural-flowing jokes between the characters. Numerous times the audience erupted in laughter. 10/10- and I am going to buy this the minute it is out on DVD."

I have my own opinions about Kennedy but I won't air them here.<br/><br/>Strathairn is wonderful, as usual, and I'm sure it won't be his last great performance. He is consistently amazing.<br/><br/>May I recommend viewing Point of View, a documentary featuring tapes of the actual hearing? Definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find tears running down my face at the loss of courageous newspeople willing to speak out. Murrow was absolutely right and television has destroyed the political process with it's ten-second soundbites, talking heads and propogation of lies and smears with no one willing to take on these talking heads who spout venom. I personally think voters were more intelligent back then, when sponsors like, yes, Alcoa made possible shows like Playhouse 90, Alcoa Hour featuring performances by young actors who would become stars. One such was Paul Newman (and the shows were live, not live on tape)."

The depiction of the characters here stayed away from their personal lives and stayed on track. David Strathairn was Murrow. The mannerisms and speech patterns were perfect.

I was especially impressed with David Strathairn's acting as Murrow, supported by George Clooney ( who co-wrote and directed) as Friendly. Other actors and actresses did well in their roles, also, such as Frank Langella and Jeff Daniels. A few parts seemed a little obscure to me, but did not detract from the essential story.

The movie is wonderfully cast with male leads that seem to defy identification to any generation, including Jeff Daniels, Goerge Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., and David Strathairn. However, at only 93 minutes, the movie really only has time to touch on the issue at hand. You seem to fly through the movie, with major milestones occurring every few minutes. Key ideas such are only given a very brief time to be explored. For instance, Downey's character asks his wife whether she is sure they are helping the right side. A somewhat brief and vague answer was all the viewer got. Subtle and delicate, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" almost failed to convey the message, almost.

Not only is it a tribute to Edward Murrow's courage but it's also a warning for journalistic responsibility that should make us take a look at the current moment.

","The movie was good, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it as a film. I just find it ironic how so many people still, to this day, choose to demonize Joe McCarthy for doing nothing more than the job he was asked to do. As it turns out, for you history buffs, 55 of the 57 people McCarthy accused of Communism (publicly only after being forced to) were, indeed, discovered to be Communists or have strong Communist ties. Most of this was proved well after Joe's death and, not surprisingly, was never reported on. I guess telling the whole truth about poor Joe wouldn't make as good of a film. What's important is that we Americans realize that our government is not shielded against corruption and, even if the press disagrees with the assertion, it is their job to report the news, not try and make or influence it. Maybe, with a bit more media support, we weed out the commies (or terrorists) who wish to control or kill us sooner. Sometimes being ""politcally correct"" is a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>God Bless Joe McCarthy. The man was a patriot of the highest regard.

","George Clooney directs a film for our age in ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" David Strathairn delivers Murrow's Kent cigarette shrouded brilliance with his own. Around him are a cast of pro's, well cast. Clooney as Fred Friendly does yeoman's work here, supplying essential,understated, grounding appropriate for this tale. Filmed in blank and white, the film captures perhaps the apex of television journalism when, in the early 1950's, Murrow stood up to the anti-communist, disingenuous, and hypocritical Joseph McCarthy. We have no Murrow's now, and if we did he would broadcast on the internet; no corporate media outlet would touch him. Thinking people will savor this movie. It is worth repeat viewing. But in the age of Infotainment, more will check out within the first half hour, which is a shame: Murrow was a great American and role model for all who strive to be."
"jamalashley","9","1","3","22 November 2010"," It is a beautifully crafted film that stuck to the basics of great film-making
","The timing (2005) of the movie is near-perfect. Americans have surrendered some of their freedoms in the name of President Bush's War on Terror through the Patriot Act. Good Night and Good Luck is a beautifully crafted film that stuck to the basics of great film-making – a good, tight story, great visual composition, marvelous performances by the actors and coherent direction. No frills, no state of the art computer graphics, no multimillion dollar superstars. But the genius of the director – George Clooney –lies in his use of TV film footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy in lieu of a live actor. And because the film is in Black and White (it was actually shot in color but converted to gray scale), the old McCarthy footage fell right in place.<br/><br/>Veteran actor David Strathairn played Edward Murrow with stoic intensity reminiscent of Gary Cooper. George Clooney's nonchalant under-acting complemented Strathairn's stark portrayal of the man who helped rid America of the junior senator from Wisconsin, who fanned the anti-communist hysteria and led the witch-hunt that destroyed the lives of many intelligent, freedom-loving Americans.<br/><br/>The film is not about the life of the popular and pioneering broadcast journalist Edward Murrow but rather on broadcast journalism itself. In the speech that bookends the film, Murrow emphasized that television, used strictly for entertainment rather than education, is nothing more than wires and lights in a box. The movie showed how free and responsible journalism can fight the enemies of Freedom just as Murrow and company fought the Terror known as McCarthyism or the Red Scare that gripped America in the early 1950s.<br/><br/>Although the film did not mention it, Senator McCarthy did not do it all alone. The road had been paved for him by Truman, Nixon, etc. He also had help from the country's foremost anti-Communist, J. Edgar Hoover, who was America's lifetime FBI director. Ironically, one of McCarthy's allies was Jack Anderson, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972 and is now considered as one of the fathers of modern investigative journalism. McCarthy certainly was not alone. He was simply the eager spokesman / henchman.<br/><br/>Mass media perform four functions: to entertain, to inform, to influence and to earn money. Most films nowadays limit themselves to the first and the last. Good Night and Good Luck is almost a documentary. It is based on true events and verifiable facts. It is a great film on Journalism, especially Broadcast Journalism as well as on the Bill of Rights, its supporters and opponents.<br/><br/>The magic of cinema can influence more people than say, a novel. In this case, it will do the world a great service if this film can influence people, especially in places where the people need to be reminded of the precious concept called Freedom, particularly freedom from fear. Writer/Actor/Director George Clooney expressed the hope that the film might give some kids ""some understanding of what and how dangerous a democracy can be if fear is used as a weapon."" Since 9/11, George W. Bush and Tony Blair in their War against Terror fanned a Climate of Fear unmatched since perhaps the Reign of Terror in France in the 1790s.<br/><br/>In a representative democracy, the government is supposed to be ""of the people, by the people and for the people."" The leaders are elected by the people. If the leaders do their job well, they get re-elected and if not, they lose. The only way for the people to know if the leaders are doing their job well or not is through the mass media. Mass media's role, therefore, is very crucial in representative democracies. Thus, the US Constitution's First Amendment prohibits any laws ""abridging the freedom of the press."" Constitutions of other countries have similar provisions.<br/><br/>In the 1950s, McCarthy instilled fear among Americans by claiming he had a list that contained the names of American communists. Murrow argued that the line between investigation and persecution is a fine one and McCarthy crossed that line. Murrow and his fellow journalists decided to fight, whatever the consequences, the ""situations of fear"" that confronted America then.<br/><br/>Plato envisioned the ideal Republic to be ruled by philosopher-kings. But in today's political reality, leaders of republics may turn out to be intelligence-challenged clowns or megalomaniac queens. Political arenas are filled with demagogues, ex-military and ex-police generals, actors, basketball players and newscasters. Today's republics would be hard put to find a philosopher - king/queen.<br/><br/>However, a Scandinavian proverb says: ""In each of us there is a king. Speak to him and he will come forth."" Murrow and his colleagues sought out the kings/queens in themselves and helped bring back the ideals of the American Republic as envisioned by Thomas Jefferson and company."

","Don't watch the opening scenes with the lights off. I did and the flashes killed my eyes-they were really more annoying than the lights flickering in Titanic.<br/><br/>I'd recommend doing some research before watching the movie, I noticed that the people talked over each other a lot which made it hard to keep up, so I'd have to imagine that knowing the complete background (or at least more than I knew) of the times would give you a better idea of what they're talking about. It was also kind of difficult to keep the characters straight since they were in black and white, since they didn't really introduce them. I'm not saying the movie shouldn't be in black and white. In fact, I should think the people who lived through those times would argue that there's no other way. The fact that the directors did the movie in black and white is part of the reason the movie got a higher rating from me, considering I was bored throughout the whole movie, it seemed more like a documentary to me.<br/><br/>I didn't really understand why people always started conversations with asking how each others wives were doing.<br/><br/>I thought Alex Borstein and Rose Abdoo were great actresses (Okay maybe I'm just being a little biased because they were both in Gilmore Girls. =P)- it's a shame they didn't get bigger parts.<br/><br/>I really liked the ending, although it was about 15 minutes too long. Overall, this movie isn't the kind of movie that I'd watch over again unless I had to do some in-depth studies of the era and learn more about it."

","""Good Night and Good Luck"" isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly an over-hyped one. There simply isn't much to it. At 93 minutes, it is surely one of the shortest Oscar-nominated films of recent times. So what, you say -- a movie can cover a lot in an hour and a half if the script is tight. That's true, but this has to be one of the least tight scripts I've seen put on film. At least thirty of the 93 minutes is blatant filler. There are several musical montages that do little to advance the plot (one is a pure music video with no plot whatsoever). And there's an uninteresting subplot about the relationship between Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson that serves no purpose other than to pad the movie's running time. What's left is the material of an hour-long History Channel show, except the History Channel wouldn't have such cartoonish portrayals of the heroes and villains of the story. Granted, the History Channel also wouldn't have the cool black-and-white cinematography, or the interesting period details like Murrow using cigarettes as props in his newscasts. But there are plenty of movies that have interesting images and also manage to include involving plots and three-dimensional characters. Rent one of those and skip this one."

","I'm amazed that so many reviewers comment on the amount of smoking in the picture. Big Deal! I can't really say I was crazy about this movie and actually started it (only to stop it) at least three times before I finally got around to finishing it. It just wasn't that captivating. The style of George Clooney is definitely artistic in his own noir way but there just wasn't much about the story to keep me glued to the screen. David Straitharn as usual is great; what Robert Downey, Jr. was doing I don't know - he didn't seem to have much to do. Neither did Jeff Daniels. Frank Langella's Bill Paley was odd to say the least since he (Paley)has ususally been eulogized as such a teddy bear. The whole thing about Downey and Clarkson being married was another weird point to make in the film. Best Picture? Not to me. I could have easily chosen Brokeback Mountain or Walk the Line. I can see this film being shown on HBO for the next century, kind of like they did Quiz Show, another generally boring film."

The final rendition is performed by Eleanor Powell, Fred Astaire, and George Murphy, who has already been mentioned on these pages as a ""friendly witness"" to HUAC and notorious conservative ass hole, becoming Republican CA state senator in the 60s, at the same time that that dumb dead f' Ronald Reagan was also governor. the musical number is fantastic, and I happily, ironically admit that out of all of Eleanor Powell's male dance partners, George Murphy is my favorite.<br/><br/>Eleanor Powell would today be targeted as a major, very outspoken ""religious progressive"" btw, in favor of human rights, as well as civil rights. she got death threats from conservatives in the mid-50s for having Black people as regulars on her local Los Angeles religious TV show, ""Faith of our Children"".

","This film is a must see for anyone who enjoyed ""The Crucible"", the 1967 parody of McCarthy which was based upon the story of the Salem Witch Trials. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is instead a parody of modern journalism using the story of the battle against McCarthy, and it has clear similarities to ""The Crucible"". The film is subtle, and unless you have seen other films to which it refers it is possible to watch ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" without appreciating the hidden message. The film highlights the way that the news broadcast by modern news organizations is influenced by their corporate sponsors, and the film controversially implies that nowadays the corporations and military are trying to directly control what is shown in the media (through the advertising dollars which pay for news broadcasts) and through lobbying to control the actions of the government in favor of large corporations and against smaller players. The film refers to ""our European allies"" being in shock at the way the freedom of expression of the US news media is being controlled. The film suggests that their is hope that some journalists should stand up to the corporations that pay the salaries of the newsmen, and should openly report on corporate influence in news reporting."

","Sometimes we see a great movie without any exceptional performances and sometimes we see a pretty good or fair movie with an exceptional performance. My sentiment regarding ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is the latter.<br/><br/>I loved Edward R.Murrow. As a preteen I remember being mesmerized by his album, ""I Can Hear It Now"" chronicling the World War Two years. I vividly remember watching his ""Person to Person"" and ""See It Now"" CBS telecasts. I was just a tot during his ""This Is London"" broadcasts so I heard none of them but I have a stockpile of tapes of those miraculous on-the-spot descriptions. If you've never heard his broadcasts aboard a B17 over Germany during a bombing raid or his eyewitness description of the liberation of Buchenwald extermination camp, you cannot appreciate the excellence, the meticulousness of the man. But he had a bad habit. Cigarettes, that took him away from us much much too soon. Why am I reminiscing? Because David Strathairn IS Edward R.Murrow. His performance is riveting,startling and amazing. That soft but stern voice. The furrowed brow. The serious demeanor. The height, build, hairline. Murrow's exact countenance captured exquisitely. Mr.Strathairn is going to give the others a race for their money regarding that Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>But alas,despite this unbelievable acting job, the film is still more of a black and white documentary than anything else. Murrow's chief nemesis, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, is played by the senator himself despite his death about 50 years ago. Director Clooney decided to use actual archived footage instead of casting someone in the role. Hence, we get a documentary. A smokey one at that. Patrons were coughing just watching it. All that smoke was downright annoying and can someone tell me the meaning of the African American female torch singer who appeared in both the CBS building as well as the nearby saloon where Murrow and company hung out for a ""spot of tea?"" I mean the vocalist was right on pitch but why? What was she doing singing in the CBS building? Beats me.<br/><br/>Edward Murrow made broadcast journalism, broadcast journalism. He introduced the idea of deep thought and insight into topics instead of the run of the mill coverage others were practicing. The man could bring to life, illuminate any subject. Watching that movie made me keep thinking of the great loss all of us have endured with his passing. Indeed, there was one whale of a brain behind that microphone. An absolute legend."

All those heroic World War Two era American soldiers who died defeating fascism and making our lives possible -- we owe it to them, ""Saving Private Ryan"" insists, to appreciate their sacrifice, and make the most of our lives.<br/><br/>I left ""Good Night and Good Luck"" feeling chastised. George Clooney took actual film footage and transcripts from another era and made them speak directly to us today. ""Habeus corpus."" ""National security."" ""Civil Liberties."" ""Terror."" All these words ring with great resonance today.<br/><br/>Clooney draws obvious parallels between the 1950s Cold War on Communism and the current War on Terror.<br/><br/>US Senator Joe McCarthy plays himself, in old film footage. He comes across as so deeply sleazy, oily, and unhinged that the viewer feels superior -- how could those simple-minded folk from the 1950s have taken this character seriously? His protégé, a sort of ""Mini Me,"" Roy Cohn, also shows up in film footage, and is as grotesque as and even more patently evil than McCarthy.<br/><br/>One pauses and considers how film clips of George Bush will look to future audiences.<br/><br/>David Strathairn plays journalist Edward R.

I surrendered all my attention and heeded Straithairn / Murrow's every word and gesture.<br/><br/>Strathairn achieves great stature here. He is in the same class as Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" and Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His performance is Oscar-worthy, even in a year of fine performances.<br/><br/>Director Clooney films in black and white, to mirror the televised images he interweaves with his dramatizations. Clooney's black and white is elegant as an Ansel Adams' photo. If you like gazing at classy vintage clothing and suave behavior photographed in beautiful images, this film can satisfy you on that level alone.<br/><br/>The film's lead characters smoke almost all the time (except George Clooney as Fred Friendly; how did Friendly, a non-smoker in real life, ever survive in that atmosphere? Viewers might nearly become ill just staring at all that smoking). The smoke is beautifully photographed; efforts to deglamorize smoking take several steps backward in this movie.<br/><br/>It's ironic; Murrow crusaded for worthy causes, but by promoting smoking through his own example (studies show that children, exposed to screen images of smoking, are more likely to adopt the habit), Murrow did terrible harm.<br/><br/>Reactions to this film often split between two extremes. One extreme insists that Communism was not a threat to America, and that McCarthy was the greatest threat imaginable.<br/><br/>Another extreme insists, just as shrilly, that Communism was a terrible threat, and McCarthy was not such a bad guy.<br/><br/>Both extremes are wrong, of course. Communists Stalin and Mao murdered many more people than the fascists, Hitler and Mussolini. The souls of the victims of Kolyma and Tuol Sleng weigh as much as the souls of the victims of Auschwitz and Dachau, though, of course, for a variety of reasons, many people who are hyper-aware of Auschwitz and Dachau have never heard of Kolyma and Tuol Sleng, or would as soon deny their horror.<br/><br/>And Communism was a threat to America, and Communist spies were, as well. As was McCarthyism.<br/><br/>Extremists on both sides did not do the search for truth any good.<br/><br/>These extreme reactions are mirrored today. Some insist that Jihad is no threat to America, and that George Bush and the War on Terror are frauds.<br/><br/>Others insist that George Bush must not be questioned, and that Jihad is a threat.<br/><br/>Of course, again, both extremes are wrong. Jihad is a threat, and George Bush must be questioned."

","Many actors eventually decide to make a move behind the camera and make a movie. Most of the time this fails miserably because most of the time these actors think they have way more talent then they actually have. George Clooney made his kind of so-so debut with 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', the story of the f-d up Chuck Barris and his theory that he was an assassin for the C.I.A., so I didn't really know what to expect with 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' Well, I can tell you he really impressed the hell out of me with this one. 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' is beautiful and well-crafted film-making that make me think Clooney is going to be working 'behind the camera' a lot more. <br/><br/>'Good Night, and Good Luck.' stems from the catch phrase newscaster Edward R. Murrow (David Straithirn - L.A. Confidential) coined in the 1950s. The story takes place in 1953 - a dark time for America because of Senator McCarthey (who is played by himself through archive footage) who is starting to down on everyone who may know someone who knows someone who is a communist. McCarthey is destroying lives with his ""your a communist!"" campaign and everyone fears the ground he walks on. All the newscasters are afraid of moving against McCarthey in their newscasts because they might be panned as a ""commie"" or ""pinko"". Murrow decides this doesn't bother him, and he wants to move against McCarthey in his broadcast, which would jeopardize the whole network. The head of CBS William Paley (Frank Langella - The Ninth Gate) and network exec Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels - Imaginary Heroes) feel this isn't a great idea, while Murrow's buddy and co-worker Fred Friendly (George Clooney) wants to go ahead with it. They broadcast a news clip kind of moving against McCarthey, and after that all hell breaks loose. The film turns into a battle of Murrow and the Network against McCarthey and his stream of bullsh*t and power. It's a powerful film, filmed completely in black & white, but you need to know your history on this before you go into the theater.<br/><br/>'Good Night, and Good Luck."" is a masterfully directed motion picture. If there is any justice George Clooney will snag a 'Best Director' nomination at the upcoming Oscars ceremony. The film drags a lot during it's first 15 minutes, but after that it picks of tremendous momentum. The writing is solid but most of it (or a great deal of it) is actual word-for-word dialogue recorded in 1953. The acting is another incredible quality of this film. David Straithirn gives an absolutely amazing and bone-chilling performance as Ed Murrow, a performance of such power and sheer brilliance it would be a crime not to give the practically-unknown Straithirn his first Academy Award Nomination. The supporting cast is superb also with high-caliber performances from Patricia Clarkson, George Clooney, Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey, Jr., Frank Langella, Thomas McCarthy, Matt Ross, Robert John Burke, Reed Diamond, MADTV's Alex Borstein, and especially, Ray Wise (the crazy murdering dad from Twin Peaks) who is perfect as Don Hollenbeck. The cinematography should grab an Oscar nod along with the film editing. Besides the occasional dragging, everything in 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' is in order.<br/><br/>It's not an ely entertaining film and it will put the wrong people right to sleep, but 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' does a damn fine job telling the history of the situation at hand and if you let it it will teach you information you didn't already know. Grade: A- (screened at AMC Desert Ridge 18, Scottsdale, Arizona, 11/11/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

However, I know the vast majority of people would need to have the message interpreted for them by character development (by an actor playing the part - what a strange concept is that eh?) The black and white format is a mistake - yes people would have seen Murrow on black and white sets but he, the CBS and McCarthy certainly were not black and white. Did music also play whilst they walked down the street? This film jerks from scene to scene - George Clooney's clunking 'creative' directions do, as other contributors have noted 'break the tension'.

I mean, the pure idiocy of hunting down everyone who is considered a communist, the sheer madness of the fear and loathing of commies at the time isn't really conveyed. Clooney seems to be more concerned about making Strathairn look really cool and self-composed, but what about his feelings? I mean, although Murrow might have looked like that on TV, I can't believe that he really was that relaxed when not on TV. I would have probably portrayed him as a person torn inside out and as a cool person on TV who turns into a scared little rabbit as soon as the Cameras are off. In conclusion.

"criticalview","3","1","4","9 July 2006"," Shallow story with too much hype; unfit for movie
","Good Night and Good Luck was a typical Hollywood heart warming, feel good kind of a movie that leaves us with nothing to wonder or debate about. It simply presented us with a story about an evil man who threatened our freedom (McCarthy); and quickly supplied us with the hero (Murrow) who confronted that man and saved our democracy, just in time. Wow, that was close! Thanks to Ed Murrow, now we can all sleep better, secure in the knowledge that we're safe and our freedom is in good hands, namely the media heroes. The media continues to invent superstars as a way of romantically relieving us from the task of thinking for ourselves and directly dealing with our problems rationally. I am disappointed to say that this movie missed a golden opportunity to make us question the practices of our trusted officials, then and now. Instead of stirring us intellectually into debating the conduct (or misconduct) of people of authority back then, and more importantly connecting with today's politicians' alarming violations of our rights, it gave us a very simple good versus evil story with a shallow plot and obvious conclusions. And, as expected, it left us feeling warm and fuzzy about our hero(es) who, as always, magically save our democracy at the end, leaving us with nothing to worry about or debate, other than the all important ""less filling; tastes great"" debate and Coke versus Pepsi dialog. The subject, our freedom, would have been much better served if the movie left us feeling angry and threatened by those individuals who rob us, and continue to do so, of our rights.<br/><br/>As a director, George Clooney showed us no artistic talent in building characters and exploiting emotions. He has followed in Hollywood typical approach of making a shallow movie that doesn't challenge our state of intellectual hypnosis. For such a highly controversial and significant subject, the film lacked any meaningful tension. It didn't really make one bond with or feel anything toward any of the characters, as it never breathed any life into them. We were never challenged intellectually or emotionally into evaluating the characters and their role during that time period because we never got to know any of them well. Everything happened so quickly: the problem, its effect, and then the happy solution. I was never emotionally involved in this movie and felt nothing for its characters. At the end of the film, all I can think is what was the point of that movie? This film could've been better presented in a 20 minute clip on 60 Minutes. Additionally, several of the characters, like Robert Downey Jr. and his wife, were a complete waste and their absence wouldn't have been missed at all. Even George Clooney's contribution to the story was very limited and his acting lacked depth. I really can't understand why the critics liked this movie, artistically or intellectually. But again, what do you expect from the big happy Hollywood family where they're good at massaging each other's egos and exchanging favors.<br/><br/>Factually, the movie was misleading. McCarthyism went on for years and destroyed many lives before it was brought down. It wasn't brought down by Ed Murrow, as the movie leads us into believing, but by its challenge of other powerful institutions, namely the Army, the Senate and other powerful individuals, including the President. There were many events that took place before Murrow's attack on McCarthy, including heated confrontations between McCarthy and the Army. One might argue that Ed Murrow's attack on McCarthy was a bit too late and came at a time when McCarthy's popularity was on the decline, making him an easy target."

","It is likely that this comment will be read by more Americans than any other nationality.<br/><br/>I rarely go to the cinema; the all-pervading television sees to that. I saw GN&GL on the big screen last night (Feb 27th, 2006) in this city; it gave me a great lift, reminding me of the America I thought I knew about from my younger days which date back to primary school during World War Two; even though I have never been to the US. I had always thought that I would go and have a look. The idea of doing that had become abhorrent over the past terms of this Presidency, and of those in the recent past of the Republican sort; but in particular due to the present one.<br/><br/>'Good Night and Good Luck' reminded me of why I had wanted to visit US. As long as there are Strathairn and Clooney like-minds and those of all of the rest of the team that made the film, living in the US perhaps there is no need to worry. As Mr Murrow put it... ""To those who say people wouldn't look; they wouldn't be interested; they're too complacent, indifferent and insulated, I can only reply: There is, in one reporter's opinion, considerable evidence against that contention."" ...In that reprise the movie generates its own approval; who needs mine."

","For those who don't believe that history repeats itself, this film is a must. Taken on its own level, it is absorbing, but George Clooney clearly sees the parallel between an America in fear in the 50's and an America in terror in 2005. When seen in that light, it is at once frightening and a cautionary tale. The acting is superb, the dialogue is crisp and well written. In addition, the audience is treated to superb music and singing as kind of a Greek chorus to the film. Visually, shooting the film in black and white was perfect. The film leaves one hoping that journalists will once again see that courage and integrity need to be encouraged in order for a democracy to flourish."

It was incredibly one sided, and I have heard of a few historical discrepancies, but it was just way to cool for me to care. Filmed in glorious black and white (and I hope too see more films in this retro style (please give me some detective film noir)) and filled with great 50's era jazz, this film tells the story of Edward R. Murrow's (played spectacularly by David Strathairn) crusade to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthey, who had his own crusade against American Communism. The acting was great, as was the pacing, editing and Clooney's direction, but my single favorite thing was Murrow himself. Smooth, filled with confidence, yet not quite smug, Murrow makes me realize whats missing in the media of today. Plus, he smokes at the news desk, how bad ass is that?!"
"moutonbear25","9","1","4","5 November 2005"," I'd say nostalgic but I wasn't alive
","GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK Written by Grant Heslov and George Clooney Directed by George Clooney<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good luck"" is one of those Hollywood films that get made at the hands of a major Hollywood player because they've played within the system for so long. When you're George Clooney, you can make the film you want and get a bunch of your high-profile actor friends (from Patricia Clarkson to Robert Downey Jr. to Jeff Daniels) to come on board and no one in the system stands in your way. A certain leeway is afforded you and you needn't worry about making a film that criticizes some of today's North American societal staples such as television, the media or even the current presidential rule. I guess it doesn't hurt to make these criticisms indirectly though.<br/><br/>Of course, no one would care what you had to say if your film was unwatchable so it's a good thing that Clooney has a skilled hand when it comes to directing. He tells the story of CBS newsman, Edward R. Murrow (played here with restraint and dignity by David Strathairn) in 1953, as he takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy, intent on exposing his means to protect the United States from the inside threat of Communism for the witch hunt it actually was. The smooth film invokes a sense of exuberant energy with its high-contrast black and white cinematography and jazz interludes (sung on screen by soulful Dianne Reeves). Clooney crafts a neo-hipster, fast-paced look back at a time when people not only didn't realize the dangers of smoking but, as in Murrow's case, they did so while they gave their composed telecasts.<br/><br/>Murrow is introduced as nervously smoking backstage before accepting an award from his media peers. There is a sense that he knows that what he is about to say will be unpopular but it must be said. He then approaches the podium and warns of the potential dangers of television on society as a device that will stump and shelter our minds, ultimately casting a shadow of complacency over all under it's control. This fearless usage of his power and position of respect will continue throughout the film and his career.<br/><br/>Next on Murrow's hitlist is the media itself. Much like Peter Weir's 1976 film, ""Network"", a film that takes place about twenty years after this period, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" presents media professionals aware of the direction their field is heading. They see the future as one where the media will not challenge authority but simply report it without question, essentially becoming a tool for the government to design the image it wants as opposed to exposing it for what it truly is. Murrow is fully supported by his producer and good friend, Fred Friendly, played by Clooney himself in an amusing supporting role that mirrors his role off camera. Neither is hellbent on taking on the system but merely determined to say what is not being said while they are in a position to have people listen.<br/><br/>""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is smart and refreshing. It dares draw links between the McCarthy era and the Bush Administration, painting them as bullies and consequently showing today's media as afraid to be the voice of the people it is meant to speak both to and for, Though the point is thinly veiled in nostalgia, it is still a necessary and welcome one."

","Too bad the people who need to see this movie and understand the paralle to today's situation, will never see it. The highly timely topic is very interesting. Too bad people don't learn from history, we would save a lot of time and money if they did.<br/><br/>Anyway the acting is excellent, the black and white photography takes you right back to the 50's and the story is something to take seriously. It is also funny and the subtle ways they show how tense the situation was , was nice.<br/><br/>I just wish we had a Edward Murrow and a Fred Friendly now who would ask the tough question and not be swayed by hard ball tactics or the advertisers."
"mburnsderry","5","1","5","3 September 2007"," A Lost Opportunity
","Despite this being a beautifully made piece of work, I must agree with the poster who felt a sense of anticlimax.<br/><br/>McCarthy was brought down by over-reaching himself and tackling the U.S.Army. This downward spiral was already underway when this film started so McCarthy was an almost spent force by the time Murrow attacked him.<br/><br/>This situation deprives the film of any suspense or sense of real danger for the protagonists.<br/><br/>The Hollenbeck character commits suicide (according to the script) merely because he was getting bad press from the rightwing O'Brian!<br/><br/>And what had the subplot of the married couple losing their jobs got to do with the rest of the plot? Curious!<br/><br/>McCarthy and his fellow travellers were indeed monsters who destroyed many lives but this film only depicts the monster in his death throes.<br/><br/>A lost opportunity."
"tilltemporaer","5","1","5","15 April 2006"," Not what I expected
","I hoped to see an exciting film and not a predictable, rather boring plot. I'm surprised to see all these good ratings... I think the plot is only good for a documentary because good and evil roles are so clearly assigned from the beginning. An exciting film would show some kind of REAL conflict, perhaps even with equal opponents (though not necessarily equally likable). Or no opponents at all... There is no question about how bad McCarthyism was and how important people like Mr. Murrow are. It's probably for its political correct message, which can be applied on the current president by bush-haters, that most reviews of the film are so uncritical. But I don't need a film for that, except perhaps a documentary film. If you want to see a good film about the subject of totalitarianism, wait for ""das leben der anderen"" to be synchronized :)"
"junkmail2000-1","5","1","5","4 March 2006"," Political commentary at the price of artistic quality
","It seems pretty clear that George Clooney set out to make Good Night and Good Luck to remind us, in this time, of where fear-mongering and zealous patriotism can lead us. The value of the allegory per Se is debatable but its cinematic quality hardly is.<br/><br/>This film starts out very formal, cold. The black and white cinematography does put us in the correct time-frame, but it does little to capture what black and white cinematography usually does best -- the intricate emotions, the facial features and movements, and other subtleties we notice when we don't have 16 million colors to look at. Why? Because there are no emotions. From the start to the finish, this movie is cold - not chilling, but numb.<br/><br/>The documentary-like style occasionally hits the jackpot. Nouvelle vague directors, whom Clooney seems to emulate occasionally in the choice and sequence of shots, did so brilliantly. Clooney does not and you as a viewer end up questioning the necessity to make this a fictional movie.<br/><br/>Really, about a third of it is stock footage of Sen. McCarthy. Another third of it is of Strathairn hosting the TV program as Murrow. Granted, some of these are ""behind-the-scenes"" and ""making-of"" shots that were not aired on CBS then, but it still seems like footage of actual Murrow could have been used instead with little difference.<br/><br/>The other shots are occasional conversations between various characters, which seem to be forced, and repetitive, always along the lines of: Murrow: We need to tell the truth. Other character: But it's dangerous (not profitable/insane/too risky, etc.) Murrow: We need to tell truth and expose McCarthy anyway.<br/><br/>There is one scene in the whole film where I thought - here, I will get to see the real Murrow, the person behind that expressionless host of a TV program, this superhuman martyr for the truth. It is when he is lying in bed with Clarkson's character. Even then - their conversation is business, the steadfast impersonal resolute determination ever-present, and you are left disappointed.<br/><br/>Some will say that the film is valuable because it allows the actual events, the facts, the words spoken by Murrow & co. to stand on its own without too much editorializing, artistic license, etc. But it seems that Clooney takes this to the extreme. He makes a movie that may as well have been a documentary. And if he truly believes that the words of Murrow and McCarthy can tell the story by themselves, then he should have just had stock footage of those two and spared us the unbearable monotony of poorly scripted, identical scenes, meant solely to tie together the various pieces of wisdom espoused by Strathairn's character."

It's painfully slow-moving and not all that interesting. Making the film black and white makes it seem like the production crew tried too hard giving it the ""artistic"" feel. On a more positive note, the acting was very good (especially David Strathairn), but was also over-hyped.

There was barely enough dramatic material to fill 90 minutes (did we need three or four musical interludes?!), and the static direction was too self-conscious. Perhaps this would have better been presented as a stage play of some kind.<br/><br/>The only memorable performance was by Frank Langella as William Paley, but David Strathairn had the thankless task of playing Edward R. Murrow as a man of marble. By the time of his final on-stage monologue at the RTNDA function I was squirming in my seat. I can certainly understand why most Americans preferred Auntie Miltie after a while.<br/><br/>Very little dramatic tension, and no messages about politics and the media that we haven't already heard."

","OK, so maybe it wasn't that bad. It's another Oscar front-runner that I would have liked to skip, however. Someone had to do a great amount of research, evidenced by all the original archived footage that is spliced into this film. And if you shell out $7 to see it as a matinée, you can listen to all the blue haired people play nostalgia games with each other (quite loudly, by the way) and thus enhance your movie-going experience. It is very very very long; all the effort to make a historically accurate piece eliminated the heart of the film as a whole. It's a snore. The script plods along very slowly with no real arc, but it would work much better on stage and might be adapted for that format very easily. On the other hand, David Straithern is outstanding and his performance alone is well worth the time and money."

I felt that the editing was not too great, the story lines were not elaborate enough and all concluding I felt that the whole impact of the McCarthy affair and his 'hunting' of communists in the USA was not depicted 'in depth'.

","George Clooney's black and white feature is about journalist Edward R.

The film is decent and well acted, David Strathairn plays a very convincing Murrow, and Clooney's directing is competent. However, the film takes an entirely too simplistic moral view of its subject, it fails to acknowledge the paranoia of the period and has the benefit of hindsight. Additionally, the film makes CBS and Murrow's efforts more heroic then they actually were, Senator McCarthy certainly didn't have as much power as the entire CBS Corporation, and the journalists who brought him down weren't really risking as much as the film implies. Furthermore, McCarthy was not attacked until he investigated individuals with real power like high ranking officials in the military; the film fails to make this clear.

","Edmund Burke's admonition, ""All it takes for evil to thrive is for good men and women to do nothing,"" is one theme underlying this depiction of an unsettling episode in US 20th century history. However, given the events shaping the early 21st century, another guiding theme would seem to be Santayana's, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" Shining light on the past to illustrate the present could easily lead to celluloid finger-wagging, but Clooney's direction and the acting by the principles excels in this wonderful film that gives food for thought while never sacrificing character and story. <br/><br/>The combination of tight close-ups, black and white photography and library footage gives the film an authentic 1950s feel, not just in art direction but in terms of the claustrophobic atmosphere produced by the Senate committee hearings. Wry parody on cigarette advertising adds humour, as do cultural references to contemporary figures such as Liberace, waxing lyrical on the search for the right girl. All of these are interesting, well-integrated tangents to the main story, the courage required to face up to political power. David Strathairn as Murrow never falters, combining rapier-like wit, intelligence and articulateness with moments of self-doubt and genuine fear. <br/><br/>This is an unflinchingly political film, the likes of which are too few and far between. The story works purely as a re-telling of events that took place a lifetime ago. However, it also asks the question, where are the Murrows who will stand up to present-day demagogues? Contemplating the answer to that question is bleaker than the events portrayed therein. Good night and good luck, indeed."

","A very good movie. A very interesting theme story about how TV was still under the submission of the government in the 50's decade, the plot is subtly engaging and the message is timeless. This first directing experience by George Clooney was simply magnificent and spectacular, the black and white atmosphere gives the film a very good appearance of that year, the rhythm maybe a little slow but it never turns boring or tiresome. The real TV images of that time used in the movie makes it to be more realistic. The cast is just perfect, David Straithaim as Edward R.

","Edward R. Murrow goes up against Senator Joseph McCarthy in ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" a 2005 using Murrow's famous sign-off on the news program ""See It Now"" as its title. The stars are David Strathairn, George Clooney, Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Frank Langella, and Robert Downey, Jr. The story is set during the time of the HUAC investigations, when Murrow was one of the few newsmen willing to go up against the powerful senator who saw a Communist under every bed, Joseph McCarthy. It's an especially timely story post-9/11 as it concerns the violation of civil rights and use of fear tactics in order to exploit the insecurity rampant in the country at that time. Director/writer George Clooney couldn't have chosen a better subject.<br/><br/>Like the film ""Thirteen Days"" about the Cuban missile crisis, the brilliance of the film is in its use of actual transcripts, here from ""See it Now."" In the case of ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" we also see real footage from the investigations and hear Joseph McCarthy himself as he goes after witnesses and Murrow. It makes for fascinating viewing.<br/><br/>Though there were some minor errors, the attention to detail to evoke the '50s atmosphere is fantastic, the black and white only adding to it. The acting is superb, if you can call what David Strahairn did acting. I felt throughout the entire film that I was watching Edward R. Murrow, not someone portraying him. Strathairn is a flawless actor who becomes the character he's playing and makes every mannerism, vocal rhythm, and cigarette puff totally organic. His Murrow is tough, with internalized anger and a dry sense of humor. ""I'm busy bringing down your network tonight,"" he tells Paley as he refuses an invitation.<br/><br/>Frank Langella's William Paley is marvelous, a man who tries to walk the fence but ends up falling over to one side. I probably already knew somewhere in the recesses of my mind about Don Hollenbeck, the character well portrayed by Ray Wise; that story arc was telegraphed from the beginning. It might have been criticized for being a cliché, except of course it really happened. Hollenbeck's story was perhaps not fleshed out enough.<br/><br/>All in all, a brilliant achievement and a sad one. Without people like Murrow, journalism has changed, and not for the better? And the world? Though the names of the threats and their exploiters have changed, the fault, dear Brutus, still doesn't lie within our stars, but in ourselves."

","It is interesting to watch this film alongside the more hysterical and consumer-driven 'Network', as both are concerned with the autonomy or otherwise of network news divisions.<br/><br/>'Good Night and Good Luck' centres on the McCarthy trials and the witchhunt against Communist sympathisers in positions of influence and/or power. Few people or occupations which had security or public facing roles were left untouched by these hearings, some of which are presented within the film in archive footage.<br/><br/>Presenter Ed Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly stuck their necks out to start a crusade against McCarthyism, while being castigated as pinko sympathisers by the right-wing media. Their intervention led McCarthy to be investigated by the Senate, and set the cornerstone for in-depth, impartial journalism.<br/><br/>Filmed in black and white, and using several songs of the period to scene-set and balance out the wordy script, 'Good Night and Good Luck' manages to portray a period in time when television was becoming the new opium to the people, capable of influencing and skewing debate and popular opinion.<br/><br/>Like 'Network', it seems that at first freedom of speech is to be sacrificed to the whim of advertisers and corporate sponsors, but Murrow and his staff took a gamble, a huge one, in giving screen time to the issues of civil liberties for the individual.<br/><br/>Clooney's film is tightly written and devoid of any modern camera trickery. It just presents a good, strong story, without gimmicks. In the current vogue for CGI and action, this can only be a good thing. And every performance is textbook perfect. Well worth watching."

Murrow, the television newsreporter for CBS that took on Senator McCarthy during the Communist scare after World War II. Again, director George Clooney takes on a biographical work and succeeds to good effect with a style that's both visible (Clooney's film all have some sort of visual flair) and yet non-distracting from the overall film.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the film is a little hollow, as it's a short story about Murrow v. McCarthy and doesn't delve very deeply into the life of our protagonist. But it's also a message film, about not allowing media to become just another outlet for entertainment and losing the power of the media as a means of providing for the mind as well as civic contributions. In a way, it's about keeping the meaning in media and that spoke immensely to me, as it's something that I'm interested in myself.<br/><br/>So, good performances by the entire cast, coupled with stylish yet not overexposed directing, along with favorable topic for me overcome the weaknesses of the film in terms of overall story and general weakness in impact. Aristotle would say that it's not that great of a drama, since the rising and falling actions are limited, in terms of story. And the story is just so focused on the singular campaign of Murrow and company at CBS that it misses its chance to delve deeper into the characters. Then again, one only has so long to watch a movie.<br/><br/>So, it's good. Not a must watch, but nonetheless, a film that I would recommend. 8/10."

","""Good Night, and Good Luck"" is a good movie about the success story of how Edward R. Murrow, a TV journalist in the mid-50s, helps to uncover the lies spread by communist hunter Junior Senator Joseph McCarthy. A thing that bothered me while watching it was that McCarthy was characterized too one-dimensional as a bad guy for my taste. I think Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov made it a little bit too easy for themselves with this good-against-bad-story. Nonetheless, George Clooney's film is an engaging work about the duties journalism has and about the courage one needs. And as such, it is still valid today, in a time where all different kinds of media get more and more under the (financial) influence of companies or political groups again. A special mention deserves leading actor David Strathairn, who shows us a Murrow with such moral integrity, you would want to congratulate him personally. Furthermore, shooting in black and white was a very good choice for this atmospheric motion picture."

Oh yeah! Adolf Hitler, 1930s; Benito Mussolini, 1930s; Josef Stalin, 1940s (ironic, isn't it?); Berlusconi, 1998-2006 (at least, he tried to).

","Nominated for 6 Oscars at the 2006 Oscars including Best Picture of the Year, ""Good Night, and Good Luck.""

There is no doubt that this movie was made because of the concerns of increased national security after 9/11 and whether that's crossing the line of censure-ship. Overall, the film relies on black and white cinematography, hearkening back to the B/W days of the 1950s (when this movie takes place). But what really makes this film a wonder is the Oscar-nominated performance by David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow - without this performance, this movie probably wouldn't hold water.

The fear of course is that with the failure of education, the proliferation of fanaticism, greed and sloth, there's no guarantee that a movie like this can communicate as well as Edward R. Murrow did when people actually had the time to listen. In this day of overexposure of information, it's hard for one single truthful idea to impact the millions it seeks to address.

However, this movie may rank on the extremely boring list pretty high up. I was begging for them to put the little display that shows the map of where the plane is and how fast and at what altitude we were at, back up on the screen. It would have moved at a faster pace then this movie, been more entertaining and to top it off, would have been in color also.<br/><br/>Now I like politics and I love history but I couldn't even stick around long enough to get to any. As I have commented before, if I have to be so much more intelligent then everyone else to ""get"" a movie, than I don't want to watch it.

Leave this movie to them.<br/><br/>OK, so my comment to you, is that if you want to know if you should watch this movie for entertainment value, DON'T. If you are an Ed Murrow kind of person, than you can probably stand it. If you like movies that deliver messages, I suggest you find another. There are plenty of message movies that can also deliver entertainment. See Crash."
"jimhills","3","0","5","7 June 2006"," The movie needed to be longer.
","www.kajatm.com<br/><br/>The movie Good Night and Good Luck looks at the battle between Joe McCarthy and Ed Murrow during the 1950's over Joe's obsession with finding Communists in the United States. Ed Murrow is played by David Strathairn who has been in such classics as League of Their Own and Sneakers. David does an excellent job of playing Ed Murrow and it is amazing how he hasn't gotten bigger parts in Hollywood cause in my opinion this guy is right up there with William H. Macy as one of the most talented actors in recent times.<br/><br/>The overall look and feel of the movie is right on with making you feel like you are watching actual footage of the 1950's even to the point that when they are showing TV clips of Ed Murrow it sounds just like 50's TV should sound. However this is where the greatest of this film ends.<br/><br/>Just a fair warning, I had issues with this film from the beginning primarily because it is one of the selected few movies that the ""Academy"" has chosen as best picture this year. And since I have serious issues with the ""Academy"" not selecting Walk the Line as a best picture nominee my expectation are that a movie like this should surpass that brilliant film. That being said, I thought this movie was fair but no where near a Best Picture candidate. First off this movie is only an 1hr and 20 minutes long, OK maybe an 1 hour and 30 minutes long but that only takes into account the stupid commercials at the beginning and previews that made me even more angry. (More on that in a bit). Yes you heard me right an 1hr and 20 minutes long and it could have easily been a 3 hour movie (also known as the ""edited"" version of any Peter Jackson film). Now it may be the fact that I am in my 20's but this movie did a very poor job of explaining the background of film or the era. I really don't know who Ed Murrow was expect for recognizing the name kind of like when you see someone that you know but you can for the life of you remember their name. I would have really enjoyed to know how Ed Murrow ended his career with CBS and how the effect of his attacks on Joe McCarthy ended. But once we get to that point they just decided to end the film leaving you with the sense that you wanted more. I just think that this movie falls way short of any movie goer's expectation.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie has Robert Downy Jr. in it where he plays a team member of the CBS team that supports Ed Murrow. After viewing this film I came to the conclusion that Robert Downy Jr.'s character has absolutely no point. The only thing that we really find out about Robert Downy is that he is married to another person at CBS and that is a no-no. So, would someone that saw this movie please explain to me what the point of his character was? I do have a theory on this. I think that because Robert Downy Jr. is still chummy with a lot of his Hollywood pals that this was a way for him to get a 7 figure check to continue to support his drug habit. Where else can a guy that has been busted for drug use several times still continue to pick up a check that size. Everyone complains about Baseball players using steroids (a drug) but when it comes to actors it is acceptable. Come on, if Joe Blow got busted for drugs as many times at Robert Downy Jr. they would be serving 8-15 in the state pen with their new friend Bubba. I guess it is just a sad statement on society when a guy like this still goes on collecting huge checks and no one says a word.<br/><br/>OK back to the commercials before the show. Pepsi has a new commercial out featuring Jimmy Fallon dancing like an idiot after drinking some Pepsi. One question for you Jimmy Fallon, how is your career going? Good choice on leaving SNL. Commercials like this make me want to stop using their products. Some of these major companies like Pepsi should do some sort of study that ask question like ""After viewing this commercial are you a) more likely to use our product b) Now hate our product and are never going to use it again. Guess which one I would choose? I would say that you shouldn't waste your time or money to see this movie. I would recommend renting this movie if the movie store was all out of movies and your choices came down to Caddyshack 2, Gone Fishing or a Thin Red Line. If you really want to see a movie that does a better job of covering the era and Joe McCarthy I would recommend picking up a copy of Guilty by Suspicion with Mr. DeNiro. But then again what do I know, I am just part of the dumb public that still pays for movies like this."

","This film is an important lesson in history, brought to us by George Clooney, who directed the movie and co-wrote the script. There was a dark period in the US history, a time when people were bullied and persecuted for alleged communist sympathies. It is known as the McCarthy era, and people are just about to forget all its lessons, because that's what people do, they routinely lose the relevance of any historical event that is more than 50 years old.<br/><br/>But the film is more than this. It is also a window into the past of television, the way it started, with journalistic integrity, lack of censorship from the ""corporate branches"" and reporters that knew and used words most US citizens think are French. The movie starts and ends with a speech that warns about the misuse and/or abandonment of the media.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in black and white, I have no particular sympathy for this method of depicting past events, I think that the world was not black and white back then as it is not 2D today. The cast is full of good actors and George Clooney plays a rather secondary role, leaving the lead to David Strathairn, who does a great role.<br/><br/>Now, if you put aside the important messages in the film you don't leave much. The acting is good, the script is informative, but the atmosphere is difficult to grasp, intellectual. People who knew about the McCarthy period and how journalism should be done are the ones who will love this movie, while the people who need to know what this movie explains will probably switch the channel or fall asleep during watching.<br/><br/>In the end, it is hard for anyone to be on the side of McCarthy now, yet the parallels to todays US political reign are obvious enough. One can see another message, rather a prediction, that Bush, like McCarthy, will eat himself up, will disappear as a dark footnote in the history books, only to be remembered as the guy who played fear and sang freedom.<br/><br/>That's why I named my comment a dinosaur movie. It's about people that you will not find in television now, it's about people that became extinct, yet towered over anything making a news report today. It is also about dinosaur politics, fast acting, smashing and disturbing in result, doomed to extinction from starvation."

","Finally someone had the balls to bring this movie in, after the Oscar hype and all. I was anticipating this movie to compare it with the rest of the Best Picture nominees, but had to refrain from watching it from *ahem* sources, or from DVD rentals. So what's my verdict? It's a little over-hyped.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The production value was superb, even though it was shot entirely in black and white, and was modestly budgeted. Much has been said about David Strathairn being Edward J Murrow, and that's true, he provided a superbly charismatic performance, that if it wasn't Hoffman in contention for Capote, I'd reckon Strathairn would have clinched the Oscar.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed political/historical movies which adds its own spin to dramatize real-life events, and this one is no exception. However, I would recommend that you read up a bit on the background on the tussle between CBS' Ed Murrow and Junior Senator Joseph McCarthy, so that you can appreciate this picture even more. It doesn't dwell on too much of the background, and jumps to the central story directly. So unless you're somewhat vaguely familiar, it would take a while to get up to speed.<br/><br/>And you'll be distracted too by the wonderful shots in this George Clooney directed picture. Smoking has never looked as sexy as this, and each drag produces smoke that just lingers on screen. Beautiful, even though I'm not an advocate of tobacco.<br/><br/>Its themes of freedom from fear, liberty, imaginary enemies, are adequately discussed, with ideas put forth single handedly by Murrow's many monologues from his talk show. You'll be captivated as Strathairn holds your attention each time he's up. However, what's lacking is the additional oomph in the return fire, as McCarthy gets relegated to playbacks from archive stock footage, so unless you're happy with monologues, you'll feel the downside in the presentation of this picture.<br/><br/>The other sub-theme I enjoyed though is the workings of internal politics within the studio, and the relationship between its backers and supporters. Prior to being given the green light to engage in a thought-provoking and direct onward fire towards a senator gaining dangerous ground, we see the hurdles and the fears that the producers and everyone involved have to cross. Really makes you wonder at times, how objective can a certain news spin be.<br/><br/>Big ideas, big cast, and lots of great jazz would have made this success a given, but its one-sided delivery might have hurt it from achieving its potential greatness."

","Good Night, and Good Luck was the closing phrase in every broadcast of famous CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow. It was also the title of the 2005 6-time academy award nominated movie that details the exploits of Murrow and his fellow crew members of the CBS News team in 1954 against Joseph McCarthy, the infamous Junior Senator from Wisconsin who literally carried a laundry list with him of ""names"" of people who at one point were supposedly associated with the Communist party. After Murrow attacked McCarthy on air, the senator attempted to rebut Murrow's statements nearly a month later and this argument captivated the nation and opened their eyes to the ridiculous exploits of Senator McCarthy. The fear of the Soviet Union and Communism was at an all-time high when Murrow and CBS News made their move against McCarthy. There was a huge response to the program shortly after it went off the air. The responses were surprisingly positive, lauding Murrow's bravery and willingness to make his true voice heard. Most people were afraid to express their true disdain for McCarthy and Murrow made it okay to voice your opinion and not be afraid of being condemned. On the other hand, there were many right-wing supporters of McCarthy who thought that Murrow's claims were ridiculous and that he was going against his country as a member of the Communist party. The thing that made this movie watchable above all things was the look. It was filmed in black and white and this was an outstanding decision because it made the audience felt like it was back in that time period in that newsroom with those people feeling the intensity of the moments of Murrow's on-air crusade against McCarthy. David Strathairn definitely earned his Best Actor Nomination as Murrow, drawing in the audience as though he were the newsman himself and making care about every single word that he said. While there are not very many nuances to the character, it is still a very strong character that is headstrong and immensely intelligent. George Clooney breaks away from his pretty-boy image as the writer, director, and star of this movie. He really shows that he is a force to be reckoned with not just in Hollywood, but in the world as well. Overall, Good Night, and Good Luck was an immensely satisfying experience, both from an entertainment standpoint and an educational standpoint as well."

I think a documentary would have been more interesting... the screenplay is a bore... none of the emotional elements are very emotional... it is very dry - which can be good, but it is not good in this case because it just becomes boring.<br/><br/>I found Clooney's role in the film to be rather pointless as well, and in fact almost irritating... his presence distracts you from the film which is hard enough to watch as it is!<br/><br/>As a political statement the film as fine, as a work of art it is a bit of a flop."

","Should Webster ever define ""small movie"" Good NIght, and Good Luck should be part of the definition. The time frame of this film does not do justice to Edward R.'s amazing life in journalism. <br/><br/>IF that was not the purpose of the film, then merely telling (retelling) the story of Joe McCarthy didn't do him justice either--his negative impact on society then and even now should be shot through the eyes of a REALvictim, not one who had a public forum.<br/><br/>More could have also been done to highlight the politicians whose careers were given birth or sustenance by McCarthy and his followers. This is where Richard Nixon was able to magnify the use of the ""red scare"" to add to his already loyal following. In a way, Nixon was more of political danger than McCarthy. Beginning with his defeat of Helen Douglas in his first race for Congress from California, Nixon was able to play the ""red scare"" card. The movie would have taken on much more meaning by showing what McCarthy left behind..."

","Just really dull. Long extended scenes of exposition, talking heads yakking from the screen. David Strathairn got the nuances of Edward R. Murrow down just right but just missed the essence. (Or it may be that my impression of Murrow, being 40 years old, is flawed.) The entire film contradicts the point being made in the speech that bookends the story: TV, by its very nature cannot be a medium of extended, thoughtful debate. The ""debates"" in the movie were all just one talking head pontificating, and then sitting down for the bloviater on the other side to spew. The debate between Murrow and Senator McCarthy is the centerpiece of the story, but there is no give and take between them; they don't even appear to be in the same room. Some other quibbles: All of the humor in the story falls flat; I wonder how many people got the interview of Liberace. What was the point of the romance between the Robert Downey Jr. character and the Patricia Clarkson character? Finally, some of the themes and even the dialog (""They were on our side."") were stolen from The Front, a much better movie. I know, I know, it's an ""homage."""
"gcatelli","9","0","3","30 April 2006"," the most shamefully dishonest movie i've ever seen
","""Goodnight and Good Luck"" is shown in gorgeous black and white. i would see the film again just to enjoy the cinematography.<br/><br/>however, beyond aesthetics, i think another reason for the use of b&w was to emphasize the filmmakers' dishonest portrayal of the controversy as a matter of 'black and white' in the figurative sense. indeed, at the beginning of the movie, Murrow is portrayed as saying something like: ~i don't believe every story has two sides; and, besides, the other side has had years to present its case.~ <br/><br/>i don't believe Murrow (or any other honest journalist, for that matter) believed the former; i don't believe he ever said that; and, even if he did, the makers of this movie (who didn't give 5 seconds to the other side, incidentally) are well aware that, based upon the revelations in the Venona papers and revelations by the successor organization to the old KGB, there certainly were lots and lots of shades of gray to the whole episode.<br/><br/>see, for example, the very anti-McCarthy cold war historian Thomas Powers's concession that much of what McCarthy *originally* claimed (ie, that the State Department was shot through with Soviet Spies, the Truman Administration knew this, and that they were dealing with the problem silently, without letting the public know what was really going on) was largely true, contrary to the film putting the words into Murrow's mouth that ""99%"" of the people McCarthy was accusing were innocent {never mind its slyly trying to make it seem as if Alger Hiss was not proved to have been a spy}.<br/><br/>(google searches of ""Venona"" on the New York Review of Books, NY Times, Nova, etc will confirm this.)<br/><br/>that McCarthy was a nasty drunk and a scoundrel is not in dispute. but, nonetheless, the substance of his original charge is largely true, contrary to this movie's 'black and white' representations.<br/><br/>on his Sunday morning talking heads program, Chris Matthews said he had reservations about a film that was so one-sided. but, after seeing it, he realized this film is not about what happened then; rather, it is about what's happening now. that is, about the ways in which dissent is being equated with disloyalty. (for just one example, the very name ""Patriot Act"" implies that its opponents are, well, unpatriotic.) <br/><br/>but, in a subsequent show, aired the day of the Oscar awards ceremony, Matthews said ""the problem with Goodnight and Good Luck"" (as a candidate for Best Picture) is that this movie makes it appear ""as if the other side was making it all up."" (quotes to the best of my recollection.) contrary to the implicit claims of this thoroughly dishonest movie, the other side had no need ""to make it all up""."
"nycritic","10","0","1","7 April 2006"," The Media Vs. Senator McCarthy
","One of the most peculiar aspects of George Clooney's film GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK is how despite its textured black and white cinematography it is also one of the most audio-friendly movies of the recent times. Situated in at the dawn of television not as an alternative to radio but a force to be reckoned with, one of the stand-out elements within its structure is how easy and multi-faceted it sounds, rather than looks. That more than likely is due to its tight script and the handling of dialog -- there is a strong influence of CITIZEN KANE in how these characters, people who work in the media, work with one another, much like in the scenes involving the reporters investigating Xanadu's deceased inhabitant at the end -- faceless, but great to listen to. If a movie can be compelling without having to be seen, it makes for a great experience.<br/><br/>Listening to David Strathairn virtually channeling even the most trivial nuances of Edward R. Murrow in his speeches -- and there are several key speeches interspersed throughout the film -- is a wonder. There is a sneaky way in how he approaches his characterization. It's not a homage or an imitation in any way and has a hint of the sly entertainer Murrow tended to be while imparting the news and his comments about the current events. Overconfident, impeccably dressed, with sleepy eyes, a cigarette perched like an advertisement in his fingers and slicked back hair, Strathairn makes Murrow look exactly how he looked -- like a smoldering Cary Grant, circa 1940, sober, letting you know what he thought about Things. He could almost be the star of his own movie, and he behaved as such in the news world. Murrow was a man who garnered respect and authority and Strathairn in his breakout, standout performance, brings is all out, even when we never see Murrow's private life.<br/><br/>His notorious battle with Senator McCarthy is the center of the plot of GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK. Had it not been for his steadfast confidence to face-off McCarthy -- a man of no importance wielding power where he had none, and a man who ultimately destroyed lives and careers, such as Don Hollenbeck, though pressure and the threat of exposure -- this country still might be under the fears of expressing itself, of having freedom of speech and of beliefs. True, not much has actually changed when you look at it -- the pressure is still there, but more subtle -- but at least there was one man who had enough material between his legs to confront this insanity head on.<br/><br/>A side story gets equal treatment: Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson play spouses who have to hide this to everyone at work due to a work policy. Apparently unrelated to the plot, this actually is quite close to the state of the union back then. Clandestine marriage is given a treatment as if it were sympathizing with the Reds, and the way both Downey Jr. and Clarkson talk to each other even in the privacy of their own home is a sly indicator of the Big Brother mentality that was prevalent in the Red Scare. When it's revealed to them at the end of the movie that all this time it had been known to the entire staff that they were married, their firing comes as an added irony -- witness the many actors who lost their jobs because they were believed to be Communists. But, at least, and as Clarkson blithely says, ""It was fun while it lasted."" Not many actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, and the like can say that.<br/><br/>Another irony is that of George Clooney. An actor who began in television, he's now definitely distanced himself from his roles in ER and it seems that it was a thousand years ago when he was on that series melting the hearts of female (and male) viewers. Now he brings a movie about the media industry and news reporters. A great reversal of roles, and a great finished product."
"artzau","9","0","1","2 April 2006"," Superb!
","OK. I love Clooney, Downey, Daniels, Langella and Strathairn and knew this would be good but I didn't know HOW good! I remember the events and remember seeing the programs in depiction as an eager kid in high school back in the 50s. I recall vividly the ""Communist threat,"" the censure, the black lists, the name calling and the impact of political accusatory innuendo on people's lives. Careers could be smashed and lives devastated by finger pointing with little or no evidence. Murrow was one of the few who had the courage and will to meet it head on. Clooney has done such a superb job of bringing the tenor of that times to the present and it takes little insight to see the relevance of the lessons of those times to the events and circumstances of today. Already, I can hear the cries of the NeoCons, screaming that this is a pure ""political"" statement of a film and for once, I would have to agree with them. But, I would also recall the description of those time by Dashiell Hammett's girl friend, Lillian Hellman, as a ""...time of scoundrels."""

","another over-hyped movie which disappointed me.although an interesting story ,in my humblest! its just a TV documentary.well acted,nicely shot in black and white and an interesting subject but ,well nothing to get excited about,wait whilst its on video or TV.sorry George. we had the choice to see v for vendetta and the matador ,so i was sorry we didn't choose these options. maybe it was because i didn't know enough about the subject ,i think this movie could possibly only interest those persons who work in the movies or have a detailed interest in the story subject. in fact i don't even know who played the lead role and to fair cant be bothered to find out (although i will)George clooney played a decent role and i like him in most things ,but Syriana was much,much better and as controvertial. so Mr clooney i believe you invested your own cash in this movie ,so i hope it works ,because its a dodgy subject and there should be more movies of this type ,unfortunately though the subject was not interesting enough for me to recommend it ,even to an enemy."

","This thing from the first has no tension, if that is what it was going after. The lighting is overdone to ....well the entire effort is...well something is drastically missing. Straighhairn is misused, Clooney just wants to go at everything the wrong way. Done right this film would never have had to have a single title underneath, no preaching about the times, just SHOW the damn stuff. Perhaps sifting through the opening stuff shows the misdirection both literal and figurative of the grand march; what in the world the court jestering of Kent Cigarettes were doing there other than to jump around with obvious pandering to the guests shows the true heart and bones of the story: by if even the deaf dumb and dumb know how the cigarette company hoked the nation into early smoky graves and hardly need to be led around the hand about it. And what was the Liberace bit doing in there. Just another fast swipe at nothing in particular. <br/><br/>In all another hasty stew from Clooney. From here on out I approach all of his managerial efforts with the greatest trepidation."
